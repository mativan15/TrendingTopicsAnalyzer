iStockIn Bangladesh, the government has launched a nationwide drive against rice hoarders amid a sharp rise in domestic prices during peak season, officials said.Export prices of rice in major Asian hubs rose this week supported by strong demand, while Bangladesh started a crackdown on illegal hoarders as domestic prices spiked. Top exporter India's 5% broken parboiled variety was quoted at $355 to $360 per tonne, up from $350 to $354 per tonne last week. "Buyers are moving towards India because prices are more competitive than supplies from Thailand and Vietnam," said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
