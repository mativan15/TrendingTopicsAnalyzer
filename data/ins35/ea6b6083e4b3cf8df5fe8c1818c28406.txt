Johnson Matthey's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was higher than its profits, and made up 93% of cash flows. The company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but this could indicate that growth opportunities are few and far between.
