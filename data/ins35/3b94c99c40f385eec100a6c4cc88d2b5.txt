However misplaced my faith, I have often believed I could beat the system, any system, which is why I buy the occasional lottery ticket. Other Minnesotans apparently view the world similarly: In 2021, the state lottery had another record year, with $803.6 million in sales.

Wouldn't it be nice if legislators didn't misappropriate profits from those ticket sales, which are supposed to enhance Minnesota's environment?

Nice.

But don't count on it.

And don't count on Gov. Tim Walz to draw the line on the Legislature's proclivity to dip its sticky fingers into lottery proceeds: On Wednesday, the governor's sidekicks spread the word he intends to sign the consummately flawed bill that distributes millions from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF), which the lottery underwrites and whose purpose is to make Minnesota a better place to live.
