The owner of Kimberley Hotel in the state's far north is seeking special permission to build an electric fence around his property in a desperate attempt to deter thieves.

The drastic measure comes as crime skyrockets in Halls Creek, with the number of stealing, burglary and property damage offences more than tripling in the past decade despite the town's population remaining largely unchanged at 3600.

The Shire of Halls Creek will on Thursday vote on whether to allow the fence to be erected at the accommodation site, which houses much of the town's fly-in, fly-out workers, including essential workers such as doctors, nurses and tradespeople.
