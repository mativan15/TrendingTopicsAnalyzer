One of the only cryptocurrencies to have recently made new yearly highs is Quant (QNT -5.10%). Despite dipping 6.2% over the past 24 hours, as of 1 p.m. ET today, this token is actually up 11.7% year to date at the time of writing. That's a rather incredible feat, considering most tokens are down considerably (50% or more) on a year-to-date basis. Quant's surge appears to be tied to interest in this project's Overledger technology, the first-ever operating system designed to allow blockchains to speak to each other.
