ETtechIllustration: Rahul AwasthiSingapore: The last few months have not been good for startups and their venture capital (VC) backers. Growth stocks like Southeast Asia's largest ride-hailing and food delivery company Grab, ecommerce giant Sea Limited, Indian companies , and Freshworks are some example of unicorns that went public recently but have performed poorly against the rest of the market. Grab and Sea Limited, both listed in the US, are down 65% year-to-date. India listed delivery firm Zomato is down 49% whereas fintech company Paytm is down 53%.
