NEW YORK (PRWEB) October 19, 2022 Mike Boots, a father of two who holds a degree in culinary arts and has spent most of his life in the hospitality industry, has completed his new book 'How the Progressive Party Saves the World... or Not': a daring political discussion that explores the flaws of both major parties in America and how, as they've evolved, become less focused on providing for their voters and more about driving their personal agendas. 'We need to understand what makes two different people think they know what is going on in this world but have two completely different views,' writes Boots.
