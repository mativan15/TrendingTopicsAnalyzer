(LEAD) Yoon says opposition-led grain bill unhelpful to farmers(ATTN: UPDATES with background info in bottom para) SEOUL, Oct. 20 (Yonhap) -- President Yoon Suk-yeol said Thursday that an opposition-led bill mandating government purchases of excess rice is unhelpful to farmers, suggesting he would veto the bill if it passes through the National Assembly. The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) railroaded a revision to the Grain Management Act through a standing parliamentary committee Wednesday, making it mandatory for the government to purchase rice when supply is at least 3 percent in excess of demand.
