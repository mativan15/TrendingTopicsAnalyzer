The Atlanta federal jury in reality stars Todd and Julie Chrisley's bank and tax fraud trial began deliberations Friday afternoon after nearly three weeks of testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses.The celebrity couple, who found fame in 2013 when USA Network picked up their reality show "Chrisley Knows Best," are accused by federal prosecutors of running a yearslong scheme defrauding banks. Prosecutors say they, with the assistance of a former business partner, manipulated financial records making it appear that they were wealthier than they were to apply for more than $30 million in loans, which they spend on a luxury lifestyle they couldn't afford.
