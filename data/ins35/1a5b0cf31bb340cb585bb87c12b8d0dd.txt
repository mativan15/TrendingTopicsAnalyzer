Since 1945 there have been 14 bear markets -- the last three averaging five months in length each -- resulting in stocks losing, on average, 36% in value during each bear market. The bad news is we entered bear market territory on May 20.
The good news is, if the last 100 years are any indication, the S&P 500 Index should rebound. Two ways to invest in that rebound are through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY 2.46%) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 2.51%), both of which track the index of large U.S. companies that make up the S&P 500.
