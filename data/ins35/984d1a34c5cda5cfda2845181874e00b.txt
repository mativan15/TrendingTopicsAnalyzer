Warning: Some readers may find the contents of this article triggering and/or disturbing. On the final day of the Paul Sadlon sexual assault trial, the defence called the complainant's allegations "straight out lies" and "not believable at all." The 89-year-old Barrie businessman is accused of forcing himself on a woman following a 2019 meeting. A publication ban protects the woman's identity. During her testimony last week, the woman said Sadlon placed his hand on her arm and made a vulgar comment, which she told the court she believed was about her.
