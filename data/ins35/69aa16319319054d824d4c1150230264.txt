A softening in demand for residential water heaters doused a string of multiple quarters of revenue and earnings growth at Milwaukee-based A.O. Smith Corp.

A.O. Smith announced ahead of its Oct. 27 third-quarter earnings report that net sales preliminarily decreased by 4% and its adjusted earnings declined by 15% for the quarter that ended Sept. 30.

'North America residential water heater demand was weaker than expected in the third quarter,' chairman and CEO Kevin Wheeler said.

The company, which says it is the largest water heater manufacturer in North America, already implemented actions 'to right-size our manufacturing,' Wheeler said.
