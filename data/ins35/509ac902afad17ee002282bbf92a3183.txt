A German central banker has called for a bank-style international standard-setter for financial-technology innovations – while dismissing decentralized finance (DeFi) as a 'casino' for speculators.

Joachim Wuermeling called for discussions 'now' on how to treat the fast growing segment of blockchain-based finance that could make banks redundant.

The move comes after international organization the Financial Stability Board (FSB) was asked to develop new rules for the crypto sector – and amid a fierce debate over the right way to regulate financial services that aren't controlled by a single entity.
