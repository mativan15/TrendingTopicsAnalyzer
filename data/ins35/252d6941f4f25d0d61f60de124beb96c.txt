India on October 15 rejected the Global Hunger Index 2022 report, saying it suffers from serious methodological issues and deliberately ignores government efforts to ensure food security for the population. The Ministry of Women and Child Development in a statement stressed that it is a consistent effort to taint India's image as a nation. In the recent report of the Global Hunger Index, India ranked 107 out of 121 countries with its child-wasting rate at 19.3 per cent, being the highest in the world.
