With Daniel LippmanBLUE STAR AMENDS FARA PAPERWORK: After a pair of Republican senators raised questions last week about 'inconsistencies' in Blue Star Strategies' recent retroactive FARA filings for the firm's work on behalf of Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a company executive, the firm filed an amendment late last week to correct the date originally provided for a meeting with a U.S. government official.— According to the amendment filed with the Justice Department on Friday, Blue Star's initial filing 'inadvertently indicated' that it had helped set up a meeting with State Department official Amos Hochstein in February 2016, when the meeting actually occurred on March 24 of that year.
