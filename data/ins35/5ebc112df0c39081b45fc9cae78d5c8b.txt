The Eagles parted ways with Alex Singleton during the offseason with the idea of upgrading an underperforming linebacker group.

Philadelphia added Haason Reddick, Kyzir White, Nakobe Dean, and Kyron Johnson at various times this spring, and the results have been staggering.

The Eagles have one of the NFL's top defenses, and the play of T.J. Edwards and White is the main reason.

All was not lost for Singleton, who signed with the Broncos during the spring, and on Sunday, in a loss to the Chargers, nearly broke the record for solo tackles in a game.
