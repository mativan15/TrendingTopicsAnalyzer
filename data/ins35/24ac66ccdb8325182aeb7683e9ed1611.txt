The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will propose to the state government to handover the Indira Canteens to the ISKCON. Confirming the development, BBMP special commissioner (finance) Tulasi Maddineni Thursday said that the proposal will be sent to the office of the additional chief secretary (urban development department) in a day or two.
BBMP will not call tenders since it believes that the proposal is for a noble cause. Maddineni said, 'There are approximately 178 Indira canteens. I know what hunger is.
