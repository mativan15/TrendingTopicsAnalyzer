It was 3 a.m., and Natasha Scott was lying awake as the rain pounded on the roof of her van, listening to the murmurs of animals outside. The barrier between the world and her bedroom was paper thin.  Times like these made her feel like 'the only person in the world,' she tells Fortune. Scott, 33 and based in Atlanta, pinpointed that night as the moment when she realized the glamorous van life advertised on social media was just 'glorified homelessness.'  You don't have to search far to see videos showing lifestyle content of families packing all their belongings into a van and hitting the road.
