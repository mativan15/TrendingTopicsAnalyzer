Finance and Health Minister T. Harish Rao accused BJP national president J.P. Nadda of failing to fulfil the promises made to the people.'What happened to the promise of ‘fluoride research and mitigation centre' at Marriguda you made during a visit in 2016 as Union Health Minister? Six years have completed and the Telangana Government allocated 8.2 acres at Choutuppal for this purpose. Not even a single rupee was released for the Centre. You have even promised to construct 300-bed hospital at Marriguda which was not fulfilled.
