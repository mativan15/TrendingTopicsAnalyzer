Genshin Impact's 2.7 update has recently hit and outside of some new content, the featured character has caused a stir.
Role-playing and gacha game Genshin Impact just got its latest update, after a few delays due to the ongoing Covid lockdowns in the Shenzhen area in China. The new update, 2.7, brings some much needed new content for people to begin working through as they build their team. 
If you've never played Genshin Impact or another gacha game they're huge, especially in Asia. Mainly coming from China, Japan, and Korea, these games derive their name from gachapon, which were those little machines you'd find that spat out rubbish little toys contained in a Perspex ball, after you'd popped in 20p.
