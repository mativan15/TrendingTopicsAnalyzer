It was a Friday night in central New Jersey, and the artist EJ Hill had me doing high-speed upside-down corkscrews as we rode the Green Lantern, a somewhat demonic roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure that seems designed to reshuffle your organs.

For me, in deep middle age, this was my first roller coaster. For Hill, 37, his umpteenth. He's a coaster aficionado. Coaster toys littered his childhood bedroom in South Central Los Angeles. He knows an inline twist from a heartline roll. He loves wooden coasters of yore and high-tech insanities like the X2, with seats out on wings that flip you over and over as you go.
