With stock shortages still being a relative problem when trying to find a PlayStation 5, this bundle from Dell is a good opportunity to pick one up if you need a whole gaming setup. With a monitor, the PS5 disc version, Gran Turismo 7, and an extra red DualSense controller, Dell offers you the bundle for just $1,295, down from $1,745, making it one of the best PlayStation deals you're going to find today. While the PS5 doesn't need any introduction, it's one of the most powerful consoles on the market right now, and it's the console you need to grab if you want to play a ton of excellent exclusives, such the upcoming God of War sequel.
