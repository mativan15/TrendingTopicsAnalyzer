There might be worse ­choices to lead President Joe Biden's fight against inflation — Vice President Kamala Harris immediately comes to mind.  
But the role of Brian Deese in Biden's new and belated 'laser focus' on inflation is more proof that Sleepy Joe either doesn't have a clue about policy, or isn't serious about one of the most serious economic problems facing average Americans.  
Deese is a lunatic in charge of the asylum. His economic policies are among the big reasons we're suffering with 8% inflation (a stealth tax on the working class) and markets are signaling a possible recession.
