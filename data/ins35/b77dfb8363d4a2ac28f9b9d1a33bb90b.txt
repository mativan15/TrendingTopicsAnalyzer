Think about some of today's best-loved brands. Trader Joe's, for example. The Hawaiian-themed grocer constantly shows up in the top ranks of those annual 'best companies to work for' lists, and it's easy to see why: TJ's employees seem to love working there, and that translates into a terrific customer experience. If you like your grocery shopping on the bulk side, consider Costco, another regular on the best places to work lists. It's renowned for paying its employees well, offering them one of the best benefits packages in retail, and having a first-rate culture.
