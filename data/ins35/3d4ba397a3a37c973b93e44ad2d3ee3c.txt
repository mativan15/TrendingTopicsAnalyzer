I was recently talking with a friend who doesn't fly often, and she was wondering how to pick the best seat on her flight. She was consulting me because I travel a lot. I've flown to and from every continent except Antarctica multiple times. My most recent long-haul, at 15 hours, was from LA to Sydney, a flight I've taken a few times before. As was I giving her a verbal download on a bunch of stuff I do for every flight, I realized, "Hey, I should write that down."
