ANIRepresentative Image (ANI Photo)Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday inspected the country's largest sewage treatment plant (STP) at Coronation Pillar here and said his government's aim is to treat all the wastewater before it is discharged into the Yamuna. The fully automatic STP can treat 70 million gallons of wastewater a day and is currently undergoing a trial run. "We have promised to the people of Delhi that we will clean the Yamuna before 2025. Working in that direction, we will treat all the wastewater before it flows into the river," he said.
