Validation of success for the white seabass hatchery was shared on April 25, 2022, with a press release from HSWRI and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). HSWRI is the entity in charge of the hatchery itself. The results show that the hatchery's contribution to wild stock are far different than previously understood. The new analysis based on archived tissue samples show that 30 percent of adults sampled were hatchery fish. This is in sharp contrast to the less than 1 percent previously estimated by the state of California.
