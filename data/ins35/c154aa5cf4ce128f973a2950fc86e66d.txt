When Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne gets in front a microphone to talk about electrifying Canada's auto industry, he has a favourite line to sum up his efforts to attract global investment: 'Not everyone in the world wakes up thinking about Canada.'
His job, as he sees it, is to change that.'I never stop,' the 52-year-old former lawyer and business development strategist said in an interview. 'You know me. I'm pretty persistent.'Champagne is a ball of energy, earning him the affectionate nickname 'Franky Bubbles' among some Ottawa types.
