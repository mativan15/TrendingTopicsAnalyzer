The FDA's new rule could make the cost of a hearing aid affordable for a lot more people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ruled that adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss can now buy hearing aids over the counter, without needing to get a prescription, medical exam or audiologist fitting.

The hearing aids will also cost thousands of dollars less, according to the White House, with the savings estimated to be $1,400 per individual hearing aid, or over $2,800 per pair.

The Ruling Has Been In The Works For A While

This ruling was finalized back in August as part of President Biden's 2021 Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, as well as ensuring the safety and effectiveness of OTC hearing aids.
