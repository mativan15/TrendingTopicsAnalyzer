Grafton lights up after dark for Jacaranda

Published on 19 October 2022

Clarence Valley Council's Illuminate and Building Bridges projects combine to create a spectacular nightscape across Grafton this Jacaranda Season.

Artworks by local Gumbaynggir, Yaegl and Bundjalung artists celebrating the endangered coastal emu will be projected onto the Sunshine Sugar building in South Grafton from 22 October to 6 November as part of the Building Bridges project.

Lights installed throughout the See Park will light up the jacarandas every night for three weeks from 20 October until 10 November as part of the Illuminate project.
