The man who is serving a suspended jail sentence for trying to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex was given the temporary home by West Norfolk Council after becoming homeless. He is living in one of four portable buildings providing temporary accommodation for the homeless in the car park of the council-owned Kingsway field in King's Lynn, Norfolk.
