Murata Manufacturing expects this year's drop in smartphone sales to keep going well into 2023, led by a sharp downturn in China.
The company's outlook has dimmed dramatically from a quarter ago, when it looked forward to a bounceback in Chinese demand after the end of COVID-19 lockdowns in major cities. Consumers in the world's biggest smartphone market haven't responded with a spending spree and Murata sees little prospect for a rally over the next year, President Norio Nakajima said in an interview.
