Internet commenters were split after one UPS employee issued a stern message to impatient motorists.In a viral video posted on October 6, delivery driver and TikTok user Mykol Gummings took to the platform with a plain request for other drivers."On behalf of every UPS, FedEx, USPS, any delivery driver," Gummings began. "If you're parked at a business...and we block you to make a delivery...please do not honk at us to get out of the way."Nothing you're doing is as important as what we're doing," he added.
