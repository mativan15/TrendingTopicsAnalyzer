(Bloomberg) -- The African Development Bank is setting up a $1.5 billion green finance facility to help meet surging demand for money to develop clean energy and defend infrastructure against floods, storms and rising seas exacerbated by global warming. The facility will be formally unveiled at the COP27 climate summit taking place in Egypt next month. The AfDB plans to partner with commercial banks and governments to fund projects, Audrey-Cynthia Yamadjako, the AfDB's principal climate officer, said in an interview this week.
