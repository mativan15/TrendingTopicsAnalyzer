A social enterprise holding an 'eat-all-you-can' event in Manila featuring mangoes shipped from the province of Guimaras is pleading with customers not to ask for refunds after some patrons mistook it for a 'take-home-all-you-can' affair.

Rural Rising, an initiative that helps local farmers around the country sell off their surplus produce, wrote a heartfelt post on Facebook asking consumers who pre-paid for tickets to the event to think twice before asking for a refund of their money, which would go towards the mango farmers of Guimaras.
