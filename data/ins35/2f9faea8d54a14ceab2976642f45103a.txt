Every investor in Niu Technologies (NASDAQ:NIU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 35% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 12% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 88% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors.
