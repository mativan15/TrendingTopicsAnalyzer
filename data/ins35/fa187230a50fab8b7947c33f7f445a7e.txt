The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s refusal to hand a poll ticket to two-time chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal for the upcoming Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls has set the rumour mills churning. The whispers within the political circles are hushed and the question on everyone's lips the same — is this the end of Dhumal's era in Himachal politics?
The BJP on Wednesday released its first list of 62 candidates for the November 12 Assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, fielding Chief Minister Jairam Thakur from Seraj constituency but ommitting Dhumal's name from the Sujanpur in Hamirpur district from where he was widely expected to contest.
