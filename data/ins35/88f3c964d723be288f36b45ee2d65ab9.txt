Joe Biden has criticised Liz Truss mini-Budget as a 'mistake' and its implosion as 'predictable'.

'I think that the idea of cutting taxes on the super-wealthy at a time when, anyway, I disagree with the policy,' The US President.

'But that's up to Great Britain to make that choice not me.'

It is highly unusual for a US President to issue such sharp criticism of the domestic policies of a close ally.

Biden said it was 'predictable' that Truss was having to abandon much of her initial plan. 'I wasn't the only one that thought it was a mistake,' he said.
