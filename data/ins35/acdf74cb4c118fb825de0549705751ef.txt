CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — Over the past 25 years, Mitch Patel has built one of the nation's fastest-growing, family-owned hotel chains with more than 40 hotels open across the country, including 18 properties in Hamilton and Bradley counties.As the travel industry rebounds from the pandemic, Patel is preparing within the next three years to open another 15 hotels, most of them larger than those in the current portfolio of Patel's Vision Hospitality Group. 'To take this company from its humble roots right here in Chattanooga to nearly $1 billion in valuation and market cap has been a tremendous pride for us,' Patel says.
