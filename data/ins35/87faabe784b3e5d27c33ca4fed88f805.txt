The U.K. government unveiled plans to revamp the country's audit and accounting sector, taking aim at the dominance of the Big Four firms. The changes will give audit oversight authority to a new regulator and expand company directors' responsibilities around internal auditing controls. Under the plans, British businesses in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 stock indexes will be required to appoint an auditor outside of the Big Four—Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers—or hand off a portion of their audit work to a smaller audit firm.
