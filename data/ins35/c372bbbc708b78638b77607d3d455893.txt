Toyota has a temporary home in the Triad as the company waits on construction of its planned lithium battery facility in northern Randolph County.

The Japanese automaker has subleased the 114,657-square-foot office building on 5.8 acres at 1701 Pinecroft Road in Greensboro, according to Cushman & Wakefield's third-quarter report on the Greensboro/Winston-Salem/Alamance office market.

Referred to as the Salem Building, the five-story facility was built in 1986 and formerly occupied by LabCorp as a billing operations center.
