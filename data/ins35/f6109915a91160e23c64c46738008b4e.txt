A system designed to help recoup property taxes from delinquent home and business owners is being used instead by hedge funds, private equity firms and other investors to turn profits, a new report from Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas' office asserts.

The weakness in Illinois laws that allow the practice is especially harming cities and villages that have majority Black and brown populations and are already struggling with declining property tax receipts, the study argues.

Pappas' research unit examined seven years of data on a little-known loophole known as 'sale-in-error' and concluded the practice has siphoned 'nearly $280 million away from schools, parks, libraries, fire departments and other government agencies .
