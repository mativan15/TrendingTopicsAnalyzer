Snap's revenue missed estimates, coming in at $1.13 billion versus $1.14 billion expected. Bernstein downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform and reduced its price target to $9 from $15. The social media company has suffered as a result of the struggling online advertising market. Shares of Snap fell about 31% in Friday afternoon trading after investors continued to digest the company's third-quarter earnings report that was released Thursday night. Shares are now trading at levels not seen since February 2019.
