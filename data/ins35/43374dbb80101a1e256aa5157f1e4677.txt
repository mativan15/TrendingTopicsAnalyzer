The Tennessee Titans went digging through the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad for the second time in a month. According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Titans are signing Josh Thompson to their 53-man roster from the Jaguars practice squad.
Three weeks ago, the Titans added defensive end Mario Edwards Jr. to their roster off the Jaguars practice squad. In his first two games with Tennessee, Edwards made two tackles and recorded one quarterback hit.
