A study has found that Russian information restrictions led a worldwide drop in internet freedom across the world during the past year.
The research was carried out by Freedom House. The nonprofit organization is largely financed by U.S. government agencies. Freedom House released the results on Tuesday.
On its website, Freedom House said it seeks to publicize the idea that 'freedom flourishes in democratic nations where governments are accountable to their people.'
Each year, the organization completes a report that rates the levels of internet freedom in 70 nations.
