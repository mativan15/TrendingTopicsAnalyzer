Jun. 5—ACWORTH — Pete Facchini believes that the protective bookcase at ProtectED Furniture could have saved the lives of the 19 children and two teachers shot to death in the Robb Elementary School Shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24.

"Those lives would have been saved if they had our bookcase," said Facchini, the co-founder and CEO of ProtectED Furniture in Acworth.

The bookcase Facchini referenced is made of steel with bulletproof, ballistic material in the middle and is used to barricade a door to keep a potential shooter from entering.
