One of the biggest storylines heading into the 77th U.S. Women's Open at Pine Needles is the historic $10 million purse. The 2022 winner will receive $1.8 million. While a full purse breakdown isn't yet available, it's safe to say that this will be a game-changing week for many financially.
Benefits of a purse that size extend throughout the whole field, however, even to those who don't play the weekend. This year, those who miss the cut will receive $8,000, double what was given last year at The Olympic Club in San Francisco.
