Slash Film As detailed in Linda H. Davis' 2021 biography "Charles Addams: A Cartoonist's Life," the longtime illustrator for the New Yorker, famous for his ghastly, grim sense of humor, suffered a heart attack in 1988 while sitting in his own parked car. Addams' widow, Marilyn "Tee" Miller, pointed out shortly thereafter that her husband had always been a car enthusiast and that the location of his death was perfectly fitting. While Addams did have a ghoulish sensibility and a passion for the macabre -- he and Miller married in a pet cemetery -- he was, by all accounts, a gentle and silly man who looked more like a journalist than a mortician.
