The Irish Property Owners Association (IPOA) is considering a legal challenge to the proposed short-term ban on evictions.Its chairwoman Mary Conway described the ban as an attempt by Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien to 'feel better' about the issue but she said it would not make much difference and would not avoid evictions this winter.The Cabinet is expected to approve a ban on new evictions lasting until next March when it meets today. Once Ministers give the go ahead, the Government will introduce legislation in the Oireachtas, which it aims to pass before the end of this month.
