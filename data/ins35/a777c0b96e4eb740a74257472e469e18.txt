Continued support to Ukraine and the bloc's strategic position against China dominated discussions among EU leaders at the second day of a summit on Friday.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is set to provide Ukraine with up to €18 billion in financial assistance throughout 2023 to cover the basic budgetary needs of the war-torn country.

"It is very important for Ukraine to have a predictable and stable flow of income," von der Leyen said at the end of two-day meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.
