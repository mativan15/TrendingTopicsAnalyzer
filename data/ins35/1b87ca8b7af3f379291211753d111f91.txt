A crackdown on illegal gambling in Turkey has led to the seizure of $40 million in cryptocurrency, according to the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office.

Authorities detained 46 suspects across Turkey on suspicion of operating an illegal gambling ring that sent ill-gotten gains to cryptocurrency wallets owned by an Ankara-based criminal organization.

"This operation came out of Turkish Cyprus and is linked to the murder of Halil Falyalı," said Turkey's Interior Minister, Süleyman Soylu, as reported in the Daily Sabah.
