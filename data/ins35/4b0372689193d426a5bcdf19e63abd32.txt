A recent analysis carried out by the RAC showed that the cost of charging an EV using pay-as-you-go public chargers in the UK has risen by over 20 percent.The RAC added that drivers will now have to pay 44.55p per kilowatt-hour.This in turn means that the average cost to complete an 80 percent rapid charge of a typical family-sized electric car with a 64kWh battery has increased by £4 since September last year.
