CLEVELAND — Yankees manager Aaron Boone said he hadn't spoken to Brett Gardner since before the lockout last offseason. 
'That's one of my regrets this year because I owe that to him,'' Boone said before Game 4 of the ALDS.
He blamed the unusual schedule, since Boone — even though Gardner was a free agent at the time — was prohibited from talking to the outfielder. 
The Yankees opted to not bring back the 39-year-old, who played 140 games for them in 2021, finishing with a career-low .689 OPS. 
Gardner had offers from other teams in spring training — including the Blue Jays — but decided to stay home.
