Mr Irons shares with five other tenants. Even if his landlord passed on the £400 cash payment to them in full, Mr Irons' share would only cover 22pc of his rent increase over six months.
He is anticipating further jumps in his bills. 'I am conscious that this was an increase that the landlord applied during the summer months, they may well decide to increase the rent again at the end of the summer,' said Mr Irons.
'I would not expect to see any of the £400 from my landlord. The best I can hope for is that this may delay another increase in the rent when the end of the summer arrives.
