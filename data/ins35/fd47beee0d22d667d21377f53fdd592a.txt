HBO Max is no longer the new kid on the block. The fast-growing streaming service, which launched in the US back in May 2020, is essentially Warner Bros' attempt to take on Netflix and Disney Plus in the on-demand entertainment space, and the platform has come on leaps and bounds during its two years out in the wild.Unlike HBO's previous on-demand services, HBO Now and HBO Go, HBO Max has a broader range of content, which includes the complete roster of classic HBO-produced series (like The Sopranos and The Wire) alongside newer HBO originals (like Succession and Euphoria) and a vast movie library.
