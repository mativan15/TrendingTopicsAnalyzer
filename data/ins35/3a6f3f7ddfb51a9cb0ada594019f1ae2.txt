Damian Lewis is reportedly set to be honoured with a CBE.
The Homeland actor will receive the honour for his charity work. He is an ambassador for various charities, including The Prince's Trust.
He and his late wife, Peaky Blinders star Helen McCrory, also raised an incredible £1.5million to feed NHS staff during the Covid-19 lockdowns last year.
‘This is richly deserved for all the work Damian has done for so many people with so much done with little or no public fanfare,' a friend told The Sun of the honour.
