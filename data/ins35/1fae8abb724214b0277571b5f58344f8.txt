U.S. stocks rose Thursday in another back-and-forth session after concerns over the economy and a weak outlook from market bellwether Microsoft (MSFT) weighed on sentiment in morning trading.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.8%, rising sharply from a lower open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 435 points, or 1.3%. The Nasdaq surged 2.7% on a rebound in technology stocks. All three indexes clawed back from two straight days of losses in a downbeat start to the holiday-shortened week.

Thursday's moves come after stocks closed lower to kick-off June, extending a streak of volatile trading into the new month as investors remain focused on inflation and the economic outlook.
