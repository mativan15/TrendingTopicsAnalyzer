Turangga Farm boss Stuart Ramsey decided at the beginning of Chain Of Lightning's campaign that the Golden Eagle was where he wanted her to be next week - the $10 million prize pool was the main attraction, but the charity aspect made him just a happy.

Chain of Lightning will start one of the favourites for the second biggest prize in Australian racing because of her six wins from seven starts and if she wins again, $525,000 will go to a charity as part of the 10 per cent component of the prizemoney.
