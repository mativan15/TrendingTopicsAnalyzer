With the start of the men's basketball season now just a couple of weeks away, Colorado State University head coach Niko Medved is eager to get it going despite losing one would-be senior to the NBA and another to a foot injury that will force him to miss significant time.

Medved and the current Rams watched David Roddy's NBA debut with the Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday night, happy for their former player and teammate to get a chance to show what he can do at that level. Medved was also clear Thursday during his session at Mountain West Conference media days that the injury to Isaiah Stevens that required surgery will keep the preseason All-Mountain West player out more than just a few weeks.
