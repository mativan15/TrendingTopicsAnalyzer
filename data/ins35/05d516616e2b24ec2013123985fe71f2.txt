Minnesota will spend $159 million to restore and enhance natural areas, from the Mississippi headwaters to fisheries on the North Shore and habitats along the various rivers that run through the Twin Cities. Legislators signed off on a bill that uses sales tax dollars designated through the Legacy Amendment to fund 42 "high-priority conservation projects" in 2023, said Sen. Carrie Ruud, R-Breezy Point. It was one of the few measures lawmakers agreed on in the final days of the regular legislative session, when a broader deal to cut taxes and fund high-priority items like schools and public safety fell apart.
