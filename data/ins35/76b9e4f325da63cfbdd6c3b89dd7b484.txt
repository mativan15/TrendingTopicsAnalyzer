Financial regulators around the world are looking to tighten their control over crypto markets, especially after a turbulent year for digital asset prices and marketplaces. Although regulators can tell crypto companies and even investors how to behave, they don't actually make the laws that could inform their regulations.

Legislators who put these laws in place, however, could lack the subject matter expertise to actually draft legislation.
