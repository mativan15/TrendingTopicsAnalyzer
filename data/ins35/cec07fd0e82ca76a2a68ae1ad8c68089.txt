A video published on Twitter showed massive flames and plumes of smoke rising from Evin Prison in Tehran on Sunday (October 16) amid nationwide protests in response to the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in police custody last month. A separate video taken from inside the prison included gunshots and screams being heard.
