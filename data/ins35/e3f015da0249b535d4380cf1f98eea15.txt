The yearlong centenary celebrations of former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao began to coincide with his birth anniversary on Saturday. Leaders across parties, mainly those who deserted Telugu Desam to join the TRS and Congress, paid floral tributes at NTR ghat here and his statues elsewhere in the State. The family of NTR led by former Union Minister D. Purandeswari was among the first to arrive at the NTR ghat. Thereafter, a stream of leaders arrived and spoke how NTR shaped their political career.
