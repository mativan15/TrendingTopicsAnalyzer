As he prepares this week to be rewarded with a third term as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, President Xi Jinping now casts an ever-longer shadow over his people, U.S.-China relations and the world than the party that gave him his start in politics, experts say.

'He has the power to change the direction of the country in any way he likes,' Adrian Geiges, co-author of 'Xi Jinping: The Most Powerful Man in the World,' told Yahoo News.

The CCP's 20th National Congress, which kicks off on Sunday, will break with recent informal precedent that had limited the general secretary of the CCP from serving more than two five-year terms.
