Ulrika Jonsson has ripped into Alexandra Burke, accusing her of being an ‘attention seeker' for not revealing her baby's gender.
Earlier this week, the former X Factor star broke down in tears on Loose Women as she opened up on why she hasn't revealed her baby's name and gender.
Alexandra, who won the singing competition in 2008, gave birth to her first child in June with West Ham footballer Darren Randolph and she explained how her fame after winning the talent show influenced her decision since becoming a mother.
