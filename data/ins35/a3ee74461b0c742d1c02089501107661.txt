AMC Networks has expanded the size of its board by one to 15 directors, adding Matt Blank, the longtime media executive who served as the company's interim chief executive for a year.

	He came aboard to fill the role vacated by former CEO Josh Sapan as AMC looked for a successor, ultimately promoting chief operating officer and CFO Christina Spade to the top job.  

	Blank was an executive at Showtime Networks since the early 1990s, including a decade as CEO.
