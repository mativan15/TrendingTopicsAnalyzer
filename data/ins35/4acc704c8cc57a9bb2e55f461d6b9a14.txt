Shanghai will build an isolation facility that can house thousands of people near the center of the city, adding to signs China is unlikely to shift away from Covid Zero any time soon despite the policy's heavy cost. The facility will be constructed on an area covering about 35 acres on Fuxing island, which lies to the east of Shanghai's business district, and will have 3,250 beds when it is completed.
