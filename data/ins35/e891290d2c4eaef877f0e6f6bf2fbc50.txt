The Wild's lineup is "up in the air" ahead of tonight's clash with the Avalanche at Xcel Energy Center.

That's how coach Dean Evason described the situation, with winger Mats Zuccarello questionable to play after leaving the team's morning skate early.

Zuccarello is tied for the team lead in scoring with four points, and he has two goals in two games.

If the veteran winger does suit up, rookie Marco Rossi looks like the odd man out.

After recalling Mason Shaw from Iowa in the American Hockey League on Sunday, Shaw skated on a line with Connor Dewar and Brandon Duhaime.
