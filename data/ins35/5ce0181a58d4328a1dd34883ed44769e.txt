By Australian Associated Press Published: 03:55 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 04:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 Australian captain Aaron Finch found form at the right time before India took four wickets with the final four balls to record a thrilling six-run win in a T20 warm-up clash at the Gabba. Finch (76 off 54 balls) had not posted a score in four previous T20 internationals but he played an assortment of trademark thumps, flicks and classic cover drives to get among the runs ahead of Australia's T20 World Cup opener against New Zealand at the SCG on Saturday.
