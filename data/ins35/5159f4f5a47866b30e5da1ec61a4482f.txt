Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday raised allegations of corruption against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. 
Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said Sarma, the then health minister, had given government contracts to firms of his wife and son's business partners to supply PPE kits above market rates in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic was raging across the country.  



The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader's statement came hours after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the former would make a huge revelation against a top BJP leader soon, while sharing a tweet on Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on money laundering charges.
