(Reuters) - UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to propose a stealth rise in income tax after the next elections to fill a fiscal hole of 40 billion pounds ($45.21 billion), the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing two government sources briefed on his plan.

Hunt will extend the current freeze on income tax thresholds and allowances into the next UK parliament, raising around five billion pounds per year by 2027-28, the FT report said, citing government sources.

The chancellor is also expected to put off capital projects and squeeze public spending after the next election, which must be held by January 2025, the FT added, citing people briefed on his plans.
