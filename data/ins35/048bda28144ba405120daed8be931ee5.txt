If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Chinook Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:KDNY) share price is 79% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 24% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend.
