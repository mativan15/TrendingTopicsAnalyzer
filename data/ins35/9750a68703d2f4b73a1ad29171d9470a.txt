Apple has been integrating augmented reality into its devices for years, and a possible mixed-reality headset has been rumored over the past several months. With WWDC 2022 fast approaching, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting in tweets this week that such a headset would not make an appearance at the annual developer event, but would potentially arrive in 2023.

(2/2)I'm sure that if Apple announces AR/MR headset and its OS at WWDC, competitors will immediately kick off copycat projects and happily copy Apple's excellent ideas, and hit the store shelves before Apple launches in 2023.
