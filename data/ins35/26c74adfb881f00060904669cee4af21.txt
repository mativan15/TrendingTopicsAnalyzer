Jun. 4—HIGH POINT — Advocates for the High Point Market expect their financial support from the state to continue as Gov. Roy Cooper and state legislators craft a new budget.

High Point Market Authority President Tom Conley said he anticipates $4 million in recurring funds to be appropriated for the fiscal year that begins July 1.

"We are not asking for more money," Conley told The High Point Enterprise. "We are pretty confident that they won't take any money away. We don't see any change in the money we are receiving.
