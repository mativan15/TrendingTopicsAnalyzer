He might have only made it a few weeks into Strictly Come Dancing, but Matt Goss has thanked fans for ‘recognizing my heart' after a challenging stint on the dancefloor.
Star of 80s band Bros, Goss was the latest to be eliminated from the dancing competition, but has said he gained ‘so much from the experience'.
Taking to Twitter early on Monday, Goss said that he was ‘taking the day to decompress' after his time on the show wrapped up when Kym Marsh and Graziano Di Prima's samba was favoured by the judges over his jive with partner Nadiya Bychkova.
