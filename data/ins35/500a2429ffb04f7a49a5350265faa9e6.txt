The shortage of baby formula in overseas commissaries has worsened a bit, with levels at about 55-60% of what they would normally be on the shelves, officials said.

That's down from the 70% figure reported two weeks ago in overseas commissaries.

The current stock rates in commissaries in the continental U.S. are holding at about 50%, roughly the same level they were in mid-May.

That said, the situation with baby formula may be a little better in some military stores than in civilian stores outside the gate, depending on the location, so it would behoove new parents to check their commissaries and exchanges.
