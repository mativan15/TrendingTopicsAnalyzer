In a joint statement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Trade Minister Don Farrell announced on Thursday the existing "punitive" 35 per cent tariff on the importation of Russian and Belarusian goods will be extended until October 2023. "The Australian government has also directed Export Finance Australia to reject any requests for loans or other finance that support trade with, or investment in, Russia or Belarus," the statement read.
