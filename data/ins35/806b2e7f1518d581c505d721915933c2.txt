May 27—After 34 years as owner of the Point Township Drive In outdoor movie theater, David Renn announced recently that he is closing after this season.

A beloved landmark in the community, the drive in theater, at 3601 Point Township Drive (Route 11), Northumberland, will be closed permanently, Renn said on Wednesday, in a Facebook posting.

"It's been a very rough and stressful few days," said Rachel Renn, David's wife on Thursday.

Although David is recovering from a medical procedure, he still wanted to address all the fans and customers who have supported the drive in over the years.
