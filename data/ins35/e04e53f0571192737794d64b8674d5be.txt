Over the past few days, there's been a dust-up between Donald Trump and one of the GOP's prize Senate candidates, Joe O'Dea. The Coloradan annoyed the ex-president by going on a Sunday show and saying he hopes Trump doesn't attempt a comeback in 2024, per HuffPost:
Asked if the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol should disqualify Trump from running in 2024, O'Dea said the former president should stay out of the race.
