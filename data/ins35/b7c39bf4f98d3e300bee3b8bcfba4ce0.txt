The Treasury Department's importance is reflected in part by its proximity to the president — just steps from the West Wing, at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue.And the secretary is often regarded as an administration's lead economic policymaker.In the Biden administration, however, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appears to be playing more of a supporting role.
