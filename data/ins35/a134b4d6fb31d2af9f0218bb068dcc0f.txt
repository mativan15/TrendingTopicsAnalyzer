The Jacksonville Jaguars made several changes this offseason, but one area that remained the same was the general manager role. Fans were hoping for sweeping changes as Urban Meyer had already been fired back in December, and firing Baalke would've completed that process.

However, that didn't happen, and owner Shad Khan retained Baalke. That led to a lot of skepticism on the fan's part early this year and some of it remains, though some fans are coming around to the decision.

As for the offseason Baalke has had, it has been far from perfect.
