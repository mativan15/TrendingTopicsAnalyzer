A court heard the thug then hit her over the head with an iron bar outside an address in Southport, Merseyside.Prosecutors said conflicting accounts of what happened next meant they couldn't be sure if McGowan set her ablaze.But after weeks in a coma, she remembered waking up covered in bandages like an Egyptian "mummy".Emergency services were called to flats in Southport at around 8.
