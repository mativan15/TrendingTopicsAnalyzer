Court documents show customers of bankrupt crypto lending platform Voyager Digital could recover 72% of their investments if a bid by FTX US to buy the lender goes through. But the sale won't close until a judge approves Voyager's payout plan, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

The Toronto-based Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York back in July. At the time, it had around 100,000 creditors and between $1 billion to $10 billion in assets.
