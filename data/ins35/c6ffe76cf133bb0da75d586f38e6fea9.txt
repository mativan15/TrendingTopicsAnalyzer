By Matt Geagan October 19, 2022 / 8:20 AM / CBS Boston BOSTON -- It did not take long for Marcus Smart and Joel Embiid to reignite their rivalry this season. The two got into a dust-up in the third quarter of Boston's opening night win at TD Garden, and they both had very different tales to tell after the game. It all started just 19 seconds into the second half, after the two bruisers got tangled under the basket following a Jaylen Brown missed jumper. Embiid corralled the rebound, which Smart also went after.
