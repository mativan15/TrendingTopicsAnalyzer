NEW DELHI: Protected monuments like Qutub Minar and Red Fort may soon have a government-run food court to cater to the needs of hundreds of tourists who visit them.While opening eateries inside the protected monuments violates the act, sources said the possibilities are being explored to have a food joint right outside the monuments, possibly close to the entry gate or the ticketing arena, to help tourists get some refreshments.According to officials, the Archaeological Survey of India may initially allow the opening of eateries at two most popular monuments of Delhi – Red Fort and Qutub Minar.
