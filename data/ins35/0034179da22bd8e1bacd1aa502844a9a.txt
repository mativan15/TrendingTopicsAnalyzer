Marci Dickerson, right, addresses a reporter at a news conference on May 26, 2022. Dickerson and others slammed the Las Cruces City Council and the mayor for not doing more regarding property crime or homelessness.

Editor's note: This story was edited after it was published online to address a concern by Nicole Black regarding statements on homelessness. Black deferred to other members of the news conference on that specific issue.

LAS CRUCES - Business leaders are organizing a forum next week to address a gap they say the city council created by ignoring the issue of homelessness and property crime citywide.
