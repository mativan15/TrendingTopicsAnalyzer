By Reuters Published: 03:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 03:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Long-dated British government bonds rallied on Monday ahead of a statement from new finance minister Jeremy Hunt who is expected to reverse swathes of Prime Minister Liz Truss's unfunded tax-cutting economic growth plan which triggered a market rout. Yields on 20- and 30-year gilts slid by around 23 basis points shortly after the markets opened, reversing sharp rises seen on Friday when a statement by Truss failed to reassure investors about the government's fiscal plans.
