HARRISBURG, Pa. — Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick conceded the Republican primary in Pennsylvania for U.S. Senate to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, ending his campaign Friday night as he acknowledged an ongoing statewide recount wouldn't give him enough votes to make up the deficit.
McCormick said he had called Oz to concede.
'It's now clear to me with the recount now largely complete that we have a nominee,' McCormick said at a campaign party at a Pittsburgh hotel.
