United Spirits, the country's biggest spirits firm, said it was keen to sell off nearly 43 mass-priced brands, but ongoing litigation on brand rights and logo made them structure the deal that combined both divestment and franchising. On Friday, USL sold 32 brands including Haywards, Old Tavern and White Mischief for ₹828 crore to Inbrew with a five-year franchise arrangement for 11 other brands, including Bagpiper and Blue Riband. Singapore-headquartered Inbrew also has a right to convert the fixed-term franchise arrangement into one with perpetual rights with a call option to acquire the brands at ₹1,331 crore, USL said during its earnings call on Monday.
