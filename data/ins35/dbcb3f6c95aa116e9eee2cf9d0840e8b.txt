Oct. 21—FINLEY, N.D. — It wasn't the kind of weather anyone would choose for a pheasant hunting excursion, but the cold northwest wind that blasted the countryside last Sunday certainly made things interesting.

There were pheasants to be had, for sure — and lots of them — but the birds held tight, only to take off like they'd been shot out of a cannon when they flushed from the tall, dry grass and caught the "big air" the prairie wind provided.

It sure was fun.

So it went last Sunday, when the

Finley Wildlife Club

hosted its annual Youth Pheasant Hunt.
