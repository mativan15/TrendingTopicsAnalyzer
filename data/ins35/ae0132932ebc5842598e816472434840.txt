Lionel Messi is "fed up" with FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta and his habit of continually talking about him in the media, according to reports. Despite the matter being a cornerstone of Laporta's election campaign in spring 2021, the club's leader failed to offer the Argentine a new contract last summer as promised due to a strict La Liga salary cap. This eventually saw the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner wind up at Paris Saint Germain as a free agent.
