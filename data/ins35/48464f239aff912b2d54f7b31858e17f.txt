Over 200 members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal were stopped from entering the Jama Masjid in Srirangapatna by Mandya police on Saturday after they gathered at the Kirangur junction in the historic Karnataka town for their proposed march to the mosque, officials said. Authorities have imposed curfew from 6pm on Friday till midnight on Sunday to prevent untoward incidents. Tension engulfed Srirangapatna, the former capital of 18th-century ruler Tipu Sultan, where right-wing groups declared their intention to chant Hanuman Chalisa outside the mosque on Saturday.
