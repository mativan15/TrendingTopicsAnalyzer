AgenciesThere are two cropping seasons in India. Kharif crops are sown during monsoon and harvested in October-November. NEW DELHI: Farm income-related stocks are back in focus as southwest monsoon looks set to hit Kerala on May 27. A good monsoon tends to increase rural demand. Analysts said if the monsoon goes well, one may see a lift in farm income and, thus, demand, especially when food prices are rising. Two-wheelers, tractors, consumer durables, FMCG and fertilisers are some of the sectors that are favourably impacted by a good monsoon.
