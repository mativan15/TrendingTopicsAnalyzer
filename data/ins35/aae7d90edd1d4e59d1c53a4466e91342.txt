Michael Vi/iStock Editorial via Getty Images PagerDuty (NYSE:PD) shares slumped nearly 6% on Friday even as the cloud computing software company posted strong first-quarter results and raised its guidance. For the period ending April 30, the company lost an adjusted 4 cents per share on $85.4M in sales, up 34% year-over-year. Analysts were expecting a loss of 8 cents per share on $82.7M in revenue. Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst Brian White noted that PagerDuty (PD) has "a large opportunity in the real-time digital operations market," but with concerns about the global economy tipping into a recession and rising geopolitical risks, the environment for tech stocks is not favorable.
