Douglas Rissing With the Federal Reserve poised for a fourth 75-basis point hike of its key interest rate in November, the central bank policymakers may start the debate about when to start slowing its rate increases at that meeting, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said, "I imagine we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening" at the Nov. 1-2 meeting. If the policymakers decide to reduce the size of its hike to 50 bps in December, they'll have to convince the markets that they're not backing off of their campaign to combat inflation and they'll want to prepare investors for that shift in the weeks after the November meeting, WSJ's Nick Timaros said in the article.
