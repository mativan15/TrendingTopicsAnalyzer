There's a chasm between the number of open jobs that require a college degree and the number of people who have one. Of positions that pay more than $35,000 listed on most job sites, more than 75% require a diploma from an institute of higher learning. But only one-third of applicants on the job market meets that criteria. That mismatch between skills and requirements is pushing many businesses to reassess their criteria, widening the access for new- and non-traditional career paths for people who didn't go to college.
