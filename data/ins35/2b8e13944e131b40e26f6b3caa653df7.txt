The Mall of America now is using metal detectors at its entrances on a trial basis, a move taken within two incidents of gunfire within the past year, and nearly eight weeks after a man with a rifle allegedly robbed two retailers and forced a lockdown of the massive shopping and entertainment complex.

Bloomington police said they were notified of the mall's security enhancement about a week ago, Deputy Police Chief Michael Utecht said Tuesday.

In response to a Star Tribune inquiry about the installation of the metal detectors along with patrons having their bags searched before entry, mall spokeswoman Laura Utecht said in a statement, "At Mall of America, the safety and security of our guests, tenants and team members is our top priority.
