SUNRISE, Fla. — Veteran forward Eric Staal and the Florida Panthers have agreed to terms on a one-year, $750,000 contract, a deal that makes him a teammate again with his younger brother Marc Staal.Eric Staal will not play in Florida's game Friday night against the Tampa Bay Lightning, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. It's the second time that Maurice and Eric Staal have been paired; Maurice coached him for five seasons with the Carolina Hurricanes.'There's so much to this man ... character, leadership, the love of the game — pure love of the game and the love of the idea of winning — I think he's great for what's still a relatively young core here,' Maurice said.
