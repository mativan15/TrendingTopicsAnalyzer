Pinterest (PINS 3.72%) has struggled to stabilize after a volatile couple of years. Revenue and user growth surged at the pandemic's onset as folks spent more time at home. Then, as economic reopening gained momentum, the tailwind turned into a headwind. 
Pinterest had shed monthly active users (MAUs) for three consecutive quarters before stopping the bleeding in its most recent quarter. Despite the win, Pinterest has other challenges to grapple with in the near term.
