There is now fear for what the future holds for Rekabi, who until now has always worn a hijab when competing – despite showing her hair in Instagram photos.
The 33-year-old has been a trailblazer for a while now. In 2016, she became the first Iranian female to compete full-time in the International Federation of Sport Climbing World Cup. She has financed her own career all the while trying to overcome gender discrimination.
Rekabi became interested in the sport in her youth after watching her brother compete, arguing that women can engage in rock climbing equally with men and compete at the same level.
