Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg announced that she will be leaving the social network in the fall to pursue philanthropic work. Her announcement has come at a tough time when Facebook is facing an uncertain future and fierce competition. It also comes at a time when her influence at the company, she helped build, is waning.Ms. Sandberg joined Facebook when it was just a start-up and its founder Mark Zuckerberg, only 23 years old. The ex-Google employee who oversaw the search giant's online sales and operations during her stint between 2001 and 2008 brought her ad selling strengths to Facebook to build the platform's advertising empire.
