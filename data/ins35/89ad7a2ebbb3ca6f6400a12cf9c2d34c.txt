I am writing to add my voice to the chorus of IU faculty and local citizens who support IU graduate student demands for economic justice and to let the community know that part-time instructors are similarly exploited by the university administration.

Since 1987, I have spent 27 years in part-time teaching positions, all of which would be called 'adjuncts' today. In my semi-retirement, I drive ride share in Bloomington for fun and money, while still teaching.

Last week, I earned $28 an hour driving ride share.
