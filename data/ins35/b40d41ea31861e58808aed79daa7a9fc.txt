(Bloomberg) -- After Liz Truss's resignation, companies from grocer Aldi to Ryanair Holdings Plc took to social media to poke fun at the UK's shortest-serving prime minister, and the chaos that defined her time in office.The low-cost carrier issued her a mock boarding pass to 'anywhere,' while the discount grocer, on Twitter, made a comic reference to the Daily Star asking whether Truss would outlast a head of lettuce.
