The Wi-Fi connectivity aboard planes could be set for a massive speed boost, with plans to bring Elon Musk's Starlink to the skies.

Starlink is a satellite-broadband service designed to boost broadband speeds for people who aren't within reach of high-speed fibre internet.

The company is now planning to bring the service to the aviation industry, potentially providing a huge hike in speed compared to the patchy Wi-Fi access on today's planes.
