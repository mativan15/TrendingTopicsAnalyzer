A Place in the Sun's Danni Menzies has shared an update on her recovery after being hit by a stolen moped three weeks ago.
The TV presenter was leaving a newsagent in Battersea earlier this month when she was struck down as the two women driving the vehicle lost control and ploughed into her while travelling at 30mph.
Flung to the pavement and left unconscious on the ground, Menzies was also left with cuts and bruises before being rushed to hospital.
Posting photos from the scene on social media soon after the accident, Menzies was put into a hospital gown and onto a stretcher, where her face was visibly bloodied.
