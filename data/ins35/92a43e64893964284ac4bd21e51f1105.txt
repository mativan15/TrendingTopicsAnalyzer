REVIEW: While Hollywood has purloined his 'cyberpunk' ideas and tropes for many a sci-fi movie over the past three decades – The Matrix, Elysium and Blade Runner 2049 three high-profile, prime examples –there have been very few attempts to adapt the godfather of the literary sub-genre's own works. It could be that their ideas are a little too complex and difficult to bring to life, or simply that the disastrous 1995 take on Johnny Mnemonic was enough of a cautionary tale. However, Gibson is now finally getting the series treatment he richly deserves in the form of an eight-part adaptation of his 2014 novel The Peripheral (which begins screening on Prime Video on October 21).
