Matt Smith has reflected on his Doctor Who tenure, stating that his exit from the hit BBC sci-fi series could have been ‘better'.
The actor starred as the 11th Time Lord and exited the show in the 2013 Christmas special which saw him face off against the Daleks and alien invaders.
Smith's Doctor then regenerated into Peter Capaldi's iteration.
Sharing his thoughts on whether he was a fan of how his storyline ended, Smith told audiences at Motor City Comic: ‘Well, look, it's always hard leaving that show because it's such a wonderful part to leave.
