At times, it seemed like a game neither team wanted to win. Duke had a chance to put it away. Did not. North Carolina had a chance to put it away. Did not. Duke had a chance to put it away. Did not. North Carolina finally did, seven lead changes later.

And by the time the Tar Heels started ringing the Victory Bell with two seconds to play, after freshman Will Hardy's game-sealing interception, they had also put a stranglehold on the division no one ever seems to want to win.

The Coastal Division is North Carolina's to lose now, having fended off Duke's final advances, having salted away a lead at Miami a week ago, and while the Tar Heels might not be the best team in the ACC, not that it matters in the Coastal, they may have its best player.
