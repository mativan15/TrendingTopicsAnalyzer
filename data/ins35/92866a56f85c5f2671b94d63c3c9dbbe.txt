She wants the royal family to put their money where the schoolkids mouths are. 
A UK mom is going viral after slamming the Queen's Platinum Jubilee for spending more than $15 million (£12 million) on gifts that could otherwise go toward the country's struggling children. 
A Twitter thread detailing the garish gesture currently boasts tens of thousands of likes on Twitter as of Thursday morning. 
'My daughter got a platinum jubilee book about the Queen, she also got a nice mug w/ the Queen's face on it,' genocide researcher Arnesa Buljušmić-Kustura wrote in the post.
