CSL's update on Monday seeks to demonstrate in the clearest terms the benefit of the acquisition announced in December. Some analysts had questioned the tie-up between CSL, which specialises in blood plasma-based treatments for rare diseases, and Vifor, which makes iron-based treatments for iron deficiency.
