SAN ANTONIO, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- October is here, just in time to get started with student loan forgiveness before the new year! My Education Solutions is here to help.
There are two different opportunities to have student loan debt forgiven this month that clients need to be aware of.
First, there is a hard deadline of October 31st on the PSLF Limited Waiver which is different from Biden's One Time Student Loan Debt Cancellation of $10,000-$20,000 forgiveness plan. Many consumers are very confused by the government putting two forgiveness plans out at the same time which can end up costing them thousands of lost forgiveness if they don't move quickly.
