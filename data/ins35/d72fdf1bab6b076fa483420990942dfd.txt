LONDON ― The Biden administration will send Ukraine $700 million in new military aid including high-tech, medium-range rocket systems that Ukrainian leaders have been pleading for as they struggle to stall Russian advances in the Donbas region.

The aid includes four of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, a light wheeled multiple rocket launcher, from U.S. military stocks. It's aimed at helping Ukrainian forces take out positions from which Russian forced launch brutal artillery barrages in what's become a tough fight for Eastern Ukraine.
