Germany plans to extend the life of its three remaining nuclear plants until mid-April 2023 as Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government seeks to ease the effects of an unprecedented energy crisis.

Scholz overruled his energy minister Robert Habeck, whose Green Party had voted against an extension of nuclear power during a party convention over the weekend.
