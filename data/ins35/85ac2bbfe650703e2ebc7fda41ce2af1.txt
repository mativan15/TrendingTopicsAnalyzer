Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) share price is up 17% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 11% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 9.9% higher than it was three years ago.
