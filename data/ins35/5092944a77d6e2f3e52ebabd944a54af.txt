Western wild lands are blazing, and those who fight the flames are hurting.Federal firefighters still haven't received a pay boost approved last year. It's not known which employees will get the money once it is implemented. In some high-risk areas, the U.S. Forest Service has only half the staff it needs.Meanwhile, the number of acres burned as of Wednesday was 112 percent higher than the 10-year average, according to the government's wild land fire outlook. Drought, heat and wind are creating additional fire hazards.
