Bernie Williams is singing his praises for Aaron Judge.
 
The former New York Yankees player, 54, recently chatted with PEOPLE about working with the One Liver to Love initiative to raise awareness about liver cancer, and also talked up Judge's historic home run feat this season.
 
On Oct. 4, Judge, 30, surpassed Roger Maris' record for home runs in an American League single season when he hit his 62nd into the left field seats at the Texas Rangers' Globe Life Field.
 
The only MLB players who have hit more homers in a season were Sammy Sosa (66), Mark McGuire (70) and Barry Bonds (73) — though baseball fans often place an asterisk on their successes as they were linked to allegedly using performance-enhancing drugs.
