US stocks soared on Monday, picking up steam in relief rally after last week's inflation report and mixed bank earnings rattled markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 550 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 2.65% and 3.43% respectively.Investors are awaiting a fresh batch of corporate earnings reports, with tech giants like Tesla, Netflix, and IBM to show how they've weathered sky-high inflation and rising interest rates in the past quarter. An earnings beat from Bank of America was cheered by investors on Monday, but experts remain weary that stocks are still fragile, with Goldman Sachs warning that the S&P 500 is still overpriced despite the index falling 25% this year.
