Based on the betting odds, the new NBA season is the most wide open the league has ever seen. Sportsbooks have numerous legitimate contenders and no clear-cut favorite.The Golden State Warriors, Boston Celtics and LA Clippers are either favorites or co-favorites across the betting market with consensus odds of +600, which is the longest recorded odds for any opening-night favorite. Additionally, the Brooklyn Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers have consensus odds of 10-1 or shorter."You used to have loaded teams but now you have a bunch of teams that are semi-loaded," DraftKings sportsbook director Johnny Avello told ESPN, reflecting on the league's evolution since he started working in Las Vegas in 1979.
