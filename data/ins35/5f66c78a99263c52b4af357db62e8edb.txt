After further investigation, Kwiatkowski was arrested. Seven devices were seized from his home, including a hard drive that contained 1,263 unreleased songs by 89 artists.
A document saved on the hard drive summarised the method he had used to obtain them. Bitcoin, then worth £64,000, was also seized.
A review of Kwiatkowski's bank account showed that he had deposited a total of £67,275 from February 2018 to September 2019, £61,855 of which was from his cryptocurrency accounts.
During his police interview, Kwiatkowski admitted he had hacked the musicians and sold their songs online.
