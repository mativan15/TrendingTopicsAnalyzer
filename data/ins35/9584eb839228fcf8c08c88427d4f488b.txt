LONDON — The British government said Tuesday that it plans to send a first group of asylum seekers to Rwanda in two weeks under a controversial deal with the east African country. But legal challenges mean it is far from certain whether the flight scheduled for June 14 will take place. The Home Office said it had begun sending formal "removal direction letters" to an unspecified number of people, including some who had arrived in Britain across the English Channel on small boats. The letters are the last administrative hurdle to the deportations, but people who receive them can challenge them in court.
