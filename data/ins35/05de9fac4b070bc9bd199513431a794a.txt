Are you crazy has been the one exclamation thrown at Jinu C. Chandy, member of Ward 12 of Pampakkuda grama panchayat in Piravom, repeatedly ever since he aired his idea to reach out to the people in his ward in a month-long door-to-door campaign.After all, for a people's representative to go to the people when no election is around the corner is no less than craziness in popular perception.But that did not discourage the first-time member from kick starting his campaign on Wednesday. The hiccups he faced recently while distributing a grant for toilet maintenance proved a trigger behind the campaign.
