Today I got a callback from this large growing tech company that I've been secretly interviewing with. The position is for a Technical Sourcer and I currently work as a Recruiting Coordinator at a Mortgage company.

I was reached out by one of their recruiters from a tech agency two weeks ago and was told this would be a contract position that would be a year long. The two people from the company I interviewed with told me that after a year, they move you to one of their teams Full-time depending on performance.
