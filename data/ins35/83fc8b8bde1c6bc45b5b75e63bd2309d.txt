My dilemma involves a small inheritance that I have recently received upon my mother's passing. It's about $130,000. I need advice about what to do with it. A little background: My husband has been very diligent about our retirement savings over the years, and although we might not be considered wealthy, we are comfortable and have a secure future. This is due to his military career and years of government service, which will result in two annuities; and this is before Social Security, which neither of us plan on taking until age 67.
