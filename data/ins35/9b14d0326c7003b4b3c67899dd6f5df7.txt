LONDON — Meta said on Tuesday that it would sell Giphy, the online repository for video clips of pets, facial expressions, and other animated GIFs, a major defeat for the social media giant in a long-running dispute with British antitrust regulators.It is the first time Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been forced by regulators to sell a part of its business.GIFs are often funny and shared as silly reactions in conversations online — like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson lifting his eyebrow — but the case is an example of the serious stance that antitrust regulators are taking toward the biggest tech companies around the world.
