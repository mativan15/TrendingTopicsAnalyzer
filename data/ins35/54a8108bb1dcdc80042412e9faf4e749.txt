The Georgia Department of Public Health on Wednesday announced the state's first suspected case of monkeypox virus.

DPH said a man who lives in metro Atlanta with a history of international travel has shown symptoms, but more testing is needed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to confirm the case. In the meantime, a DPH spokeswoman said the man is being monitored and the agency is doing contact tracing to find people he may have had contact with recently. The man was ordered into isolation and the length of time he must isolate depends on when his symptoms clear up.
