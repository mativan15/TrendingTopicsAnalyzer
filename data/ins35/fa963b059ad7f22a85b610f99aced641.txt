Chase Bank does not currently offer personal loans. However, if you're looking for a loan, you may be eligible for financing through other online lenders and banks.

Personal Loans From Other Banks

If you value working directly with a traditional bank similar to Chase, consider personal loans from Wells Fargo or U.S. Bank. Opening a loan through a traditional bank gives you access to brick-and-mortar locations, in-person customer service and potentially lower interest rates.
