Erie could soon become the location of a new mixed-use development with 630 new homes and retail space.

Englewood-based E5X Management, Inc., plans to build a mix of primarily single-family detached homes on an approximately 300-acre property located at the southwest corner of Weld County Road 3 and Mineral Road.

Chris Elliott, president of E5X Management, said he became familiar with the property a few years ago.

'It sits up pretty high and has some great views of the mountains and it has some irrigation canals on it that create a real interesting topography and it's quite a beautiful site,' Elliott said.
