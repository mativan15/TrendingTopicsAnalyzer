David's Shop has been a main stay of Emmerdale for years, but like the rest of the high street, is it about to go belly up?
The shop has been the sight of several thefts, it's seen two women go into labour, and it's had a van through the front window. It's been bought and sold more times than David's cheated on his girlfriends, and of course was the site of Maya's disgusting seduction of teenage Jacob. 
But this could be the end of the road for the infamous delicatessen.
David's (Matthew Wolfenden) beloved business is in trouble as he returns to the village post-storm.
