Liz Truss put her leadership on the line on Wednesday by making a Labour Commons move on fracking into a confidence vote in the Government.Sir Keir Starmer's party was seeking to use a rarely-deployed parliamentary procedure to seize control of the order paper to stage a vote on fracking later this month.However, Tory whips told backbench MPs: 'This is not a motion on fracking.'This is a confidence motion in the Government.'Shortly before Prime Minister's Question, they imposed a 'hard' three-line whip on MPs to vote against the Labour move on Wednesday evening.
