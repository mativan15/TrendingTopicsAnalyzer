Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the National Maritime Heritage Complex coming up at Lothal near here represents the country's resolve to celebrate its rich maritime history. The long period of slavery and indifference towards India's maritime strength made us forget about Lothal and Dholavira, and the complex will act as a centre for learning about and understanding India's diverse maritime history, he said. The prime minister was speaking after reviewing, through video conference, the construction of the complex.
