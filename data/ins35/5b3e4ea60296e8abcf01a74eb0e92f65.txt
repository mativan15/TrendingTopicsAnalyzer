New Delhi: The Indian equity market kicked off the week on a negative note as the selling pressure intensified ahead of RBI's monetary policy meet. Weakness in IT and FMCG counters dragged the benchmark indices lower, whereas consumer discretionary and financials stocks also weighed on the sentiments. BSE's barometer Sensex dropped 382.01 points or 0.68 per cent to Rs 55,387.22 at 9.40 am. Nifty50, the 50-pack index, plunged 121.25 points or 0.73 per cent to 16,463.05 at the same time. BSE's midcap and smallcap indices plunged over a per cent each, whereas among the sectoral laggards, IT, tech and telecom topped the list.
