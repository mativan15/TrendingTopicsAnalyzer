The 6 eggs in Diversified's Basket Jonathan KnowlesValues are in CAD unless noted otherwise. We had suggested an alternative the last time we wrote on Diversified Royalty Corp. (OTCPK:BEVFF) (TSX:DIV:CA). Diversified had delivered impressive returns to its investors over the last several years, but we were a bit weary of the debt load. One did not have to look too far for the alternative of our choice. Diversified holds a good collection of businesses, most of which should be firing on all cylinders as Canada achieves widespread vaccination.
