By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:45 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 23:45 EDT, 18 October 2022 Victorian farmers and small businesses inundated by floodwaters will have access to payments to assist with their recovery through a $73.5 million state government support package. Included is $19.5 million for one-off payments of $10,000 to primary producers directly affected by the floods to help clean-up and re-establish damaged properties. "This is an initial payment and we'll get these out the door as fast as we possibly can, but just the certainty of knowing that this is coming will be a comfort," Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters at the Emergency Victoria state control centre in Melbourne.
