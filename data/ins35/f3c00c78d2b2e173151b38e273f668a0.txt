Ilya Ponomarev was a member of the Russian Parliament from 2007 to 2016 and was the only figure in that Government to vote against the annexation of Crimea.Mr Ponomarev said Putin's military action in Ukraine has set the stage for a "new Russian revolution" which could see a new President put in place.He told Newsweek: "In our situation, I think it's a must that we will face a violent protest and an armed protest, I think it would not happen without armed resistance.
