Real Madrid star Karim Benzema says he ‘respects' Kylian Mbappe's decision to remain at Paris Saint-Germain and insists their relationship will not be affected.
The 23-year-old, who led Ligue 1's scoring charts with 28 goals, was heavily courted by the Spanish champions and there had been an expectation that he would sign for Real on a free transfer when his contract with PSG was due to expire next month.
But instead he made the surprise decision to renew with the Parisians, signing a new, mega-money deal until 2025 – with even French president Emmanuel Macron believed to have been enlisted to persuade Mbappe to stay with PSG.
