In late September, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and his chamber's Republicans unveiled their "Commitment to America," an agenda that they hope will propel them to victory in November and then provide a blueprint for governing.

But a myth is driving this effort: that Newt Gingrich and his fellow Republicans captured the House in 1994 for the first time in four decades due to the popularity of their "Contract With America." In reality, that historic midterm victory had little to do with the Contract - which has major implications for the 2022 midterm elections.
