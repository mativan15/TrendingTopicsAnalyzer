Lionel Messi says Argentina to not fear any team at the World Cup but he urged fans to stay calm with the tournament in Qatar less than a month away.
Copa America champion Argentina, unbeaten in 35 games since 2019, was drawn with Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Poland in Group C as they look to win their first World Cup title since 1986."Today we are doing well and people are excited and think that we will come back with the Cup, but it is not like that," Argentina captain Messi told broadcaster Directv Sports.
