Pekic/E+ via Getty Images Published on the Value Lab 2/6/22 Essent (NYSE:ESNT) has positive exposures to segments of the economy that we believe benefit from relative resilience and are due for a bit of a comeback despite economic conditions. However, the business model means that their exposure to other risk factors inherent to the economic direction is more pronounced than with other insurance businesses. The multiple is low reflecting this risk and is probably penalising the company a bit excessively, but if you're worried about economic deleveraging, which we are a little, ESNT will be the first to fall.
