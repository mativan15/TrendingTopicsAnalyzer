The Uttar Pradesh government is all set to ensure 19 basic amenities in all over 1.54 lakh government-run primary and upper primary schools of the state as part of 'Operation Kayakalp'. Under it for the first time, the government is now going to ensure disabled-friendly toilets in all these schools by March 2023, say senior state basic education department officials in the know about the move. The challenge at hand can be gauged form the fact that at present, 87,610 of these schools do not have disabled-friendly toilets.
