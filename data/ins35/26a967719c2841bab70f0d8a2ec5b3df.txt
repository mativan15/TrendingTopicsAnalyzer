FREMONT — John A. Dutra always felt compelled to help others, whether through sharing his time, knowledge, compassion or wealth, even when he was at his busiest building a company, a political career and raising a family.
The former state Assemblymember, Fremont City Council member and founder of a successful real estate and development firm, died May 29, according to his family. He was 86.
