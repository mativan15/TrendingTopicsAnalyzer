Dominic Raab has said he does not see how anybody could 'reconcile' supporting the return of Boris Johnson to Downing Street while he is still being investigated for Partygate as he threw his weight behind Rishi Sunak.The Conservative MP, who was deputy prime minister under Johnson, said although he believed a return to frontline politics was possible for the former prime minister, he did not back it happening while he is subject to an ongoing inquiry.'Whether you're an arch Boris fan or an arch Boris critic I don't see how you can reconcile returning to frontline politics with that committee looming and hanging over and oral testimony being heard,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday morning, as Sunak approached 100 public nominations from Tory MPs.
