The two companies that have been backed very publicly by David Beckham have tanked since making their stock market debuts during the pandemic — although their star investor remains in the money.Guild Esports, an esports franchise, and Cellular Goods, a cannabis group, have both more than halved in value since floating in October 2020 and February 2021, respectively.Shares in Guild were launched at 8p as part of the initial public offering, which valued the company at around £40 million — a big haircut from the mooted £100 million valuation that bosses were said to be seeking in the months leading up to the float.
