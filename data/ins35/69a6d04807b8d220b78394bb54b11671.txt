What qualifies you to hold this position? I am a husband, father, servant leader, veteran, small business owner, employer, plumber, former union member and contractor, and active volunteer. I am not a politician. I have lived in Woodbury for 17 years, and other than my time at Marquette University, have been a resident of the eastern suburbs my entire life.

What would your top priorities be if elected? Crime – Support and increase law enforcement. Pressure prosecutors and judges to hold criminals accountable.
