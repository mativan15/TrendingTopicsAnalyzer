Louis Saha says Paul Pogba's departure on a free transfer is ‘bad business' by Manchester United but believes the club have made the right decision moving him on.
On Wednesday United confirmed Pogba, 29, would be leaving Old Trafford after six years, with his contract running out at the end of June. 
After paying Juventus close to £90million for the midfielder in 2016, the Red Devils will not see a return on their investment, with Pogba in talks with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and a return to Turin over a free transfer.
