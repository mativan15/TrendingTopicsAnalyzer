Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and former chief economic adviser to President Donald Trump, warned that significant job losses are necessary to get inflation under control.

'We're going to have to see job destruction if we're really going to see inflation be curtailed,' Cohn said in an interview during Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on Monday (video above).

His comments follow September's hotter-than-expected inflation print, which showed consumer prices rose 0.4% from a month earlier, and up 8.
