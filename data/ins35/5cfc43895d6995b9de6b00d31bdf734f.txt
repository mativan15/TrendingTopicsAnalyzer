ETtechSlice founder and CEO Rajan BajajBengaluru: Card-based lending and payment solutions provider Slice has raised $50 million as part of new fundraise led by existing investor Tiger Global. Japan-based GMO Venture Partners has come in as a new investor. Slice is looking to extend the financing round to raise at least another $50 million, which would take the round size to $100 million amid a wider slowdown in large-ticket size deals. While the ongoing fundraise is still not yet closed, Slice is expected to be valued at over $1.
