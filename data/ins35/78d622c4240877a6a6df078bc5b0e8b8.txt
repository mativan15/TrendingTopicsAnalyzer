The Oklahoma City Thunder announced on Sunday that they have waived guard Scotty Hopson a day after signing him.
This move was made so that the Thunder could gain Hopson's G League rights and place him on the OKC Blue when their season begins in November.
The 33-year-old veteran made his NBA debut last season as an emergency signing due to health and safety protocol cases on the Thunder.
In 32 games last season with the Blue, Hopson averaged 13.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.4 assists.
With preseason over and the 2022-23 regular season days away, this likely marks the end of the Thunder using this tactic.
