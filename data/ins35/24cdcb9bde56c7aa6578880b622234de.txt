Oct. 15—BEMIDJI — The Bemidji High School football team was in complete control of the proceedings on Friday night at Chet Anderson Stadium — until suddenly, they weren't.

Facing St. Cloud Tech, the Lumberjacks led 14-0 at the half and were slated to start the second half with the football. But a muff of the half-opening kickoff gave the Tigers the ball in plus territory, sparking a third quarter where they outscored BHS 13-0.

The Jacks buckled down in the fourth quarter and retook the reins, though, scoring 15 unanswered points to tranquilize the Tigers with a 29-13 win.
