Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Monday, helped by plans by the U.K. government to shore up confidence in its fiscal policies after weeks of turmoil.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2%, and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%.

New British finance minister Jeremy Hunt will announce tax and spending measures later Monday, two weeks earlier than previously scheduled, after the original economic plan put forward by Prime Minister Liz Truss and former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng roiled financial markets.
