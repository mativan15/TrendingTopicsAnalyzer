Legendary American pugilist Roy Jones Jr feels boxing's exclusion from the Olympics will lead to countries like India losing hope of unearthing 'a new star' in the sport as aspiring boxers will no longer have focus and direction.In a major blow, boxing has been left out of the initial list of sports for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, a decision made due to a number of governance issues.One of the most successful boxers of his generation, Jones wrote an open letter to the International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and the IOC Executive Committee, urging them to reconsider the decision regarding boxing's exclusion earlier this month.
