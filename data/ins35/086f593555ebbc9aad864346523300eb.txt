TORONTO, Oct. 19, 2022 /CNW/ - The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today released the results of an investor survey on crypto assets that found 13% of Canadians currently own crypto assets or crypto funds.

Overall, half of Canadians surveyed could accurately define crypto assets, but most lacked a working knowledge of the practical, legal and regulatory aspects of owning them. The average crypto asset knowledge score was just 37%.

The survey also found 38% of Canadians believe crypto assets currently play a key role in the financial system.
