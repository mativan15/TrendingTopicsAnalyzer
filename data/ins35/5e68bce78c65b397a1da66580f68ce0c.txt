Several months after leaving Tricera Capital, a commercial real estate firm he co-founded, Scott Sherman has established a new company.

Miami-based Torose Equities will focus on retail and office deals in Florida, Sherman said. He is in talks to make the company's first acquisition.

Sherman made a big impact at his last job.

Formerly a VP of acquisitions at New York-based Thor Equities, Sherman co-founded Tricera with Ben Mandell in 2017. They secured over $700 million in real estate, including the Press office and commercial project in West Palm Beach, an office on Military Trail in Boca Raton, the retail space at Society Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale, commercial buildings in the Flagler Village neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, and ground-floor retail space in Wynwood multifamily buildings.
