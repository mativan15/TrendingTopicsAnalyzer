Visiting Arizona governor Doug Ducey advanced a major desalination project for his state in meetings with top Israeli officials on Tuesday that he believes will secure water for Arizona for the next 100 years.

Ducey came to Israel on a five-day trade mission, in which he met with President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu. They discussed how Arizona can learn from Israel and cooperate with the Jewish state in making the Arizona desert bloom.

He toured an extensive desalination plant and wrote on social media that such innovations are part of the solution to secure his state's water future.
