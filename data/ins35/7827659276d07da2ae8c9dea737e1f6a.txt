In a single motion, a sliding blade slices the bottoms off six speckled quail eggs, and their yolks plop into a six-well dish.Quail eggs aren't common in research, and most biomedical scientists have never seen this guillotine-like device. But at the biotechnology laboratory of the Children's Cancer Therapy Development Institute (cc-TDI), just outside Portland, Oregon, these eggs are helping researchers to quickly prioritize drug candidates for long, costly mouse studies. Last December, cc-TDI published a description of this platform1 in Scientific Reports — just one example of how the non-profit organization is breaking norms in cancer research as one of the only freestanding research labs focused on developing drugs for paediatric cancer.
