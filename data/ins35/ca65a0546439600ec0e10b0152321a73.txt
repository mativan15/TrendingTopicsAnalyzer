Pay Dirt is Slate's money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Lillian, Athena, and Elizabeth here. (It's anonymous!) Dear Pay Dirt, I am over 60, single with no children, and just retired. I am now considering my will. I have ten nieces and nephews, aged 43 to 23. I have cordial relations with all of them, and close relations with five. One of them, 'Kate,' has both physical and mental problems. She is in her late 20s and has been self-supporting since graduating college, but her parents and siblings are concerned that she may not be able to support herself until retirement.
