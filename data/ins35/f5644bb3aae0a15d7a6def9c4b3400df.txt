Just days after voicing his displeasure with the role in the Jets offense, wide receiver Elijah Moore did not practice with the team Thursday.

According to Jets coach Robert Saleh, Moore was excused from practice to deal with a family matter. This was after Moore sent a series of cryptic tweets right as practice began.

'God, I need direction,' Moore sent in a now-deleted tweet. He also tweeted, 'God makes no mistakes…I trust u through it AllllllI.'

After the Jets 27-10 victory over the Packers late Sunday night, Moore responded to a tweet that said he had zero targets in the game.
