Longer, wider and meaner than before, the 2022 Audi RS3 is small but mighty. It bursts out of its flared fenders with 401 horsepower and boasts a new electronic rear differential that enables a drift mode. I was able to put the RS3's new capabilities to the test on the road, track and skidpad, and it's every bit as impressive as I expected. Tapping unlock on the RS3's key fob sends the front and rear LED lights into a welcome dance that culminates with a fun "R-S-3-checkered flag" in the driver's-side front lights.
