Continental Resources Inc said on Monday it had agreed to a sweetened offer from founder Harold Hamm to take the US shale oil producer private at a valuation of about $27 billion.Hamm, a legendary oilman who once called the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries a "toothless tiger," said in June that he wanted to take the company private because public markets have not supported the oil and gas industry.Hamm offered $74.28 per share for the stake not owned by him and the Hamm family trust.
