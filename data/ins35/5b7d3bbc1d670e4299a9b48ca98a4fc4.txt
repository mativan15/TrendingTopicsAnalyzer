High points in the racing calendar like Derby day - which she first attended in 1945 - the five days of Royal Ascot, and Champions' Day at Ascot in October, have traditionally been ring-fenced in her diary.
Until the pandemic, she had only missed the Epsom Derby twice since becoming Queen - in 1956 when she was on a state visit to Sweden, and in 1984 when attending a D-Day memorial in France.
But what were high hopes for a win this year were dashed after her horses, Reach for the Moon and Educator, were withdrawn.
