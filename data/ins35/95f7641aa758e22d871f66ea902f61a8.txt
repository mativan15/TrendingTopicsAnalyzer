The South Carolina authorities announced Friday that they had received permission from the family of Gloria Satterfield, a former housekeeper for suspended attorney Alex Murdaugh, to exhume her body as part of an investigation into her death.

"Agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) sought and received permission from the Satterfield family, through their attorney, to exhume the remains of Gloria Satterfield," SLED said in a statement to Fox News.

Satterfield died in 2018 after she allegedly accidentally tripped and fell in the Murdaugh home.
