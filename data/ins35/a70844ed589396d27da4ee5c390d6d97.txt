Fortune International Realty, one of the largest residential brokers in Miami, is now affiliated with Christie's International Real Estate.

This is a big move for Miami-based Fortune International, led by CEO Edgardo Defortuna, as it's built up its own brand since he founded the company in 1983. It mostly focuses on condos, especially new construction.

Fortune International entered a licensing agreement and referral collaboration agreement with Christie's International, a global luxury brokerage.
