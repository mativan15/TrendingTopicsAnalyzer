The Bank of England was said to not have been concerned about wider contagion in financial markets had the fund failed.
It comes after Threadneedle Street halted a programme of bailing out pension funds on Friday. The Bank of England was forced to intervene in the wake of the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget, whose plans to launch a raft of unfunded tax cuts prompted a sharp fall in the price of gilts, which are linked to the cost of government borrowing.
Many pension schemes have large investments in gilts, meaning their falling value put pressure on LDIs and triggered so-called 'margin calls', which saw funds asked to put up more capital to backstop their investment positions.
