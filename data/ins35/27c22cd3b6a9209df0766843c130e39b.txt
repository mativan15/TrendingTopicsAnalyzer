The US will fail in its attempts to incite unrest and meddle in Iran's domestic affairs, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani has said. His statement comes after US President Joe Biden backed the anti-government protests across the Islamic Republic.Protests and clashes with police erupted last month after a 22-year-old woman named Mahsa Amini died in custody after being detained by Iran's morality police in Tehran for wearing an 'inappropriate' headscarf. Her family claimed that she had been tortured.
