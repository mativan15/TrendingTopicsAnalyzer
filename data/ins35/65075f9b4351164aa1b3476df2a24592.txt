Hayes, seeking her third term, said Logan, a former state senator, would join a conservative caucus with plans to further curtail women's reproductive rights and threaten Social Security and Medicare. She worked to portray him as someone from outside the district who was ousted from the state legislature after two terms and is now the recipient of millions of dollars in advertising from conservative leaders.

Logan focused on the economy and inflation.

"Connecticut's economy is shrinking under the Biden-Harris administration," Logan said.
