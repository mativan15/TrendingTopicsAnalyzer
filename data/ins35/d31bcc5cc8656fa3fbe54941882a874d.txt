Kanye West has revealed he learned about Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson having sex by the fireplace how many others did – via a news alert. 
The rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, has found a platform to air his frustrations out after being restricted on Instagram and Twitter, by sitting down for an interview with Drink Champs.
It comes after a highly controversial two weeks, which has seen Kanye, 45, wearing a White Lives Matter tee, brand Black Lives Matter a ‘scam', accused of anti-semitism, having his social media accounts locked and even his bank deciding to end its relationship with his Yeezy brand, meaning the rapper has just a month to move his billions to another account.
