The Baltimore Ravens had a rather eventful 2022 draft, selecting talented prospects, trading away proven players and more. The end result of the weekend was an 11-player draft class that has the potential to be one of the better rookie groups in franchise history if all goes well.
One of the players that Baltimore selected was outside linebacker David Ojabo out of the University of Michigan. The team was able to pick him in the second round at No. 45 overall, something that likely wouldn't have been possible had the rookie not suffered a torn achilles during his Pro Day in March.
