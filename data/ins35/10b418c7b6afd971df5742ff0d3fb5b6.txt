Las Vegas chapels of love have been left all shook up by moves to stop them using Elvis Presley impersonators in themed wedding ceremonies.

The licensing company that controls the name and image of "The King" is demanding operators of chapels in Sin City no longer use his likeness when marrying couples.

Authentic Brands Group sent cease-and-desist letters in early May to a number of chapels, which are expected to be compliant by now, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The city's wedding industry generates $2 billion a year, but with Elvis-themed weddings representing a significant number of the ceremonies performed it is feared the demand could devastate businesses.
