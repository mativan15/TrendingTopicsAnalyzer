The Maharashtra government on Thursday launched 'faceless Regional Transport Offices (RTOs)' to help citizens avail facilities linked to the sector better. Through this arrangement, driving licences and several other services will be available to people who need not physically make the rounds of RTOs, Minister of State for Transport Satej Patil, who inaugurated the initiative, said. These services, which will be available with immediate effect, will help save paper, he said, adding that people would need to have their Aadhaar number linked to their mobile phones to be part of the 'Faceless RTO' scheme.
