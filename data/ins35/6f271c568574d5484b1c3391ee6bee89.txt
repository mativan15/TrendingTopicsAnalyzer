Pakistan summoned the US envoy to protest US president Joe Biden's statements that the country is one of the most dangerous in the world. During a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception speech on Thursday, Biden took a dig at Pakistan while discussing the threat of nuclear war from Russia. He stated he believed Pakistan was one of the most dangerous countries in the world. 'What I think is maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world: Pakistan. Nuclear weapons without any cohesion,' the president said at a Los Angeles event.
