A vote on fracking descended into chaos last night after furious Tory MPs were left unclear about whether opposing the government would lead to a general election.About 40 Tory MPs did not vote, some of them making it clear they were protesting against the government and were willing to lose the whip. Labour's attempts to ban fracking were ultimately defeated 230-326 after the government U-turned twice in the space of minutes on whether the opposition motion counted as a confidence vote.Wendy Morton, the chief whip, and her deputy, Craig Whittaker, were said to have quit after No 10 undercut their attempts to make the vote an issue of confidence in the government.
