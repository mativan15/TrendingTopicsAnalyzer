Two Tory MPs who resigned in protest from Boris Johnson's government in July have now backed him to make a return as prime minister.Reports suggest that the former Tory leader is flying home from a Caribbean holiday and 'taking soundings' about a potential leadership bid, for which he needs the support of 100 Conservative MPs.It is claimed he has been privately urging MPs to back him, saying he is the only candidate able to save them from electoral wipeout – and the endorsement of two former government abandonees has the potential to catalyse Mr Johnson's second advance on No 10.
