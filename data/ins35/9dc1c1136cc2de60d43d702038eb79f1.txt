I'm extremely excited about scaling NFI's Intermodal offerings to be more responsive to the challenges that the market and the wider supply chain have thrust upon us. CAMDEN, N.J. (PRWEB) October 19, 2022 NFI, a leading North American supply chain solutions provider, added 200 intermodal containers to its growing Canadian fleet in September. The purchase, which includes a mix of refrigerated and dry van containers, positions NFI as the largest private intermodal reefer carrier in Canada, second only to CN and CP rail.
