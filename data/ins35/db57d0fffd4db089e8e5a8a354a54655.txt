The Tennessee Titans and Nashville Mayor John Cooper announced on Monday a plan to build a domed football stadium for a reported $2.2 billion.The new stadium will tether the organization to the city for the foreseeable future and position them to host the Super Bowl, College Football Playoff Games, and other year-round events. None of those draws currently exist at 23-year-old Nissan Stadium, the Titans home."When my father brought this team to Tennessee 25 years ago, I don't think he could have imagined a better home for our organization," said Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk.
