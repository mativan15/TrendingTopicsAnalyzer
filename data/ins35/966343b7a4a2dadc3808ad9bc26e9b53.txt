Olemedia/E+ via Getty Images Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) shares fell on Friday as investment firm Needham downgraded the cybersecurity software company, citing increased competition and concerns from the global economy. Needham analyst Alex Henderson lowered his rating to hold from buy, noting that companies like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) offer "richer, broader capabilities," while others, such as Tenable (TENB) and Qualys (QLYS) also appear to be gaining steam. Rapid7 (RPD) shares fell nearly 5% to $43.
