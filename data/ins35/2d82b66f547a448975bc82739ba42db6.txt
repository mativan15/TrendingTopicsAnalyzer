More than 5.0M Cassava (SAVA) shares have changed hands compared to the 65-day average volume of ~1.5M. Financial publication, The Fly attributed the gain to a higher-than-normal call volume trading. The upsurge is noteworthy at a time when the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is trading lower even after more than ~39% selloff YTD.
