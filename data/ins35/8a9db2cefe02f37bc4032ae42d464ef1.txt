PSV Eindhoven manager Ruud van Nistelrooy says that the string of Premier League clubs interested in Cody Gakpo are not alone, with other European giants tracking the in-form winger.
The 23-year-old has made a stunning start to the season, scoring nine goals in 10 Eredivisie games so far and another three in three games in the Europa League.
This comes after he was heavily linked with a move to Manchester United over the summer, which didn't come off, neither did a switch to Southampton or Leeds after interest from both.
