If you don't fancy your golfing accuracy, but still love a day on the green – this competition might be for you. Next month, the Southland Chamber of Commerce will be hosting its annual Southland Chamber Golf Day. Instead of a traditional raffle,Chamber membership manager Robert Dennis said it would be dropping thousands of golf balls from a helicopter onto Otatara golf-course, with the winner – the ball that lands closest to the X – takig home $1000. 'The balls will go for $20 for three, there will be a number on each ball, and the ball closest to the mark wins,' he said.
