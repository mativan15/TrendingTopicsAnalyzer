Donald Trump and Truth Social welcome Kanye West's purchase of right-wing social media platform Parler, the CEO of Truth Social told Fox Business. "We like the fact that Kanye West is buying Parler," Devin Nunes said. Nunes said it is "absolutely necessary" to have free speech to allow Americans to voice their political views so that citizens can't be silenced by "tricky algorithms" and "shadow-banning". The owner of Parler announced this week that West, who now calls himself Ye, had agreed to buy the platform, which was used by Capitol Hill rioters to gather support.
