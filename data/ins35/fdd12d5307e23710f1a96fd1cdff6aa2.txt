Pay Dirt is Slate's money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Athena and Elizabeth here. (It's anonymous!) Dear Pay Dirt, Back in May, I legally changed my name, including reporting the name change to the Social Security Administration. (For the record, my Social Security number did not change.) Once that was done, my understanding was that the change would be reported to the various credit bureaus, and my existing credit records would simply be updated with the new name, and continue to reflect all of my credit history.
