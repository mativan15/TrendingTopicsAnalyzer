Candidates in the Georgia governor's race are taking to the stage Monday night in their first televised gubernatorial debate this election year.

Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams faces a rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp after losing to the former attorney general in a bid for the governor's seat in 2018. Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel will also participate in Monday's debate.

The debate will be held at the Atlanta Press Club on the first day of Georgia's early voting period.
