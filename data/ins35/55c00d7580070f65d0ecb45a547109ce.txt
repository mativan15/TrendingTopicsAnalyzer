White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was saved by the bell Thursday when a time-keeper told her to wrap up her press briefing after she dodged repeated questions on when exactly President Biden was briefed on baby formula shortages and by whom.
Biden said Wednesday that he wasn't told about the crisis until 'early April,' but Jean-Pierre — during a second day of grilling about the timeline of the crisis — said he actually became aware in 'late April.' She then backtracked and refused to say who told Biden, who waited until mid-May to invoke federal powers as parents became increasingly desperate.
