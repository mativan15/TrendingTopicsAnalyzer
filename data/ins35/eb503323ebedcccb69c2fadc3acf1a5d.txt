Crypto exchange Kraken confirmed that it will be conforming to the European Union's new sanctions package.

'Kraken complies with the legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions that we operate in,' a Kraken spokesperson told Decrypt via email. 'Since the EU's announcement, we have been working to make the changes needed to comply with the latest package of sanctions against Russia."

The spokesperson did not comment on whether Russian users had been banned outright from the platform.

Kraken's announcement comes after the EU put into play its newest sanctions package, aimed at punishing Russia for its aggression against Ukraine, on October 6.
