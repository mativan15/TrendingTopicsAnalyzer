Published: 11:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 Merseyside Police are working with Manchester City over allegations of coins being thrown at Pep Guardiola during the 1-0 defeat at Anfield and damage being caused to the windscreen of a club coach. Police say no incidents have been reported but they are liaising with both clubs 'to understand a number of reported incidents'. Liverpool have threatened to ban for life anyone found guilty of throwing coins but have expressed their disappointment over chants from away fans relating to the Hillsborough and Heysel stadium disasters, with the Anfield Road stand concourse damaged with similarly-themed graffiti.
