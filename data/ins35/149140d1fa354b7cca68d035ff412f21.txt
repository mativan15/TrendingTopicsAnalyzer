Insiders who purchased US$198k worth of WW International, Inc. (NASDAQ:WW) shares over the past year recouped some of their losses after price gained 11% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be a costly gamble, since losses made by insiders have totalled US$115k since the time of purchase.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
