After one of the worst overall performances from the offensive line in the Matt LaFleur era, the Green Bay Packers are adding some help to the position group on waivers.

The Packers claimed rookie offensive tackle Luke Tenuta off of waivers from the Indianapolis Colts, according to agent Kenny Zuckerman.

Tenuta (6-8, 319) is a sixth-round pick of the Buffalo Bills in 2022. He was released by the Bills at final cuts on August 30 and claimed by the Colts a day later.

The Packers have an open roster spot after placing Tipa Galeai on injured reserve and may need the depth along the offensive line with Jake Hanson now nursing a biceps injury.
