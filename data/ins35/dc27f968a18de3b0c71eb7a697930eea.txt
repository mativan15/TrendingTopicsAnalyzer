October 19, 2022 10:11 AM Eastern Daylight Time FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ZPE Systems announces the Mini SR, a smartphone-size, cloud-orchestrated gateway that solves the operational challenges of running security and connectivity at the network edge.



Organizations must solve evolving business needs by deploying applications and devices at locations including branch offices, third-party manufacturing sites, powerplants, emergency response locations, and urgent care facilities. Even with cloud SaaS-based applications, organizations still require equipment, and they typically outsource to MSPs and MSSPs who can manage the SLA and operational challenges presented by this physical stack.
