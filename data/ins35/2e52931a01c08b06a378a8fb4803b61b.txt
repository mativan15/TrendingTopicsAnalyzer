A minister has admitted that the Whips could have "over-egged" Tories to force a vote on fracking on Wednesday night.
Anne Marie-Trevelyan said it was "never acceptable" for MPs to be "manhandled" into voting and added that she was "shocked" by reports from the Commons on Wednesday evening.
Cabinet ministers Therese Coffey and Jacob Rees-Mogg were among a group of senior Tories accused of pressuring colleagues to enter the "no" lobby, while Labour former minister Chris Bryant alleged that some MPs had been "physically manhandled".
