A builder with unfinished homes in Auckland and Wellington​ who has left customers tens of thousands out of pocket has a history of being linked to companies that went bust. Dean Lister was the director of Porta Homes NZ Limited​ and Lister Development Limited​, both of which collapsed in November 2008​. At the time Porto Homes had 12 builds underway, and entered liquidation owing almost $1.13 million to tradespeople and suppliers​. Lister is also linked to Build 7, a company that portrays itself as a nation-wide builder that many of Lister's current clients thought he belonged to, which also had two franchises enter liquidation in 2016 and 2018​.
