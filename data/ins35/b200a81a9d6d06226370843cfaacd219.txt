Kanye West came to blows with Piers Morgan in an explosive television interview which later saw him apologise for causing ‘hurt and confusion' with his anti-semitic remarks.
The rapper appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday night, where he said sorry when the host asked him whether he regretted threatening to go ‘Defcon 3 on Jewish people'.
At first, Kanye doubled down on his comments, declaring: ‘No, absolutely not', but when Piers asked if he knew the comments were racist, he said: ‘Yes, that's why I said it… I fought fire with fire.
