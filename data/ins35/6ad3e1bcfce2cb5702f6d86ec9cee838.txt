The Gavin Newsom recall election last year demonstrated that the incumbent California governor is as close to unbeatable as it gets when he's running against a Republican opponent or a "Republican recall."That's hardly surprising in a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republican voters 2-1, and at a time when the "R" label is a non-starter for many rank-and-file California Democrats disgusted with the national Republican Party. If the California Democratic Party's candidate for governor or senator was a paper bag, and the California Republican Party's candidate was Abraham Lincoln, it seems likely the paper bag would triumph so long as it had a "D" next to its name and Lincoln had an "R" next to his.
