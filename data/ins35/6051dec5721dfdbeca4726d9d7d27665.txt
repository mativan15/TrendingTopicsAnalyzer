WINNIPEG -- Connor Hellebuyck viewed the Winnipeg Jets' 4-1 season-opening victory Friday over the New York Rangers as a taste of what could lie ahead. Mark Scheifele scored a first-period goal at even strength and then added a power-play marker at 18:23 of the third period. His second goal was one of three the Jets scored in the final five minutes of the third. Hellebuyck stopped a barrage of 21 shots in the second period and finished with 40 saves in front of 14,553 fans at Canada Life Centre. "This team played the right way," Hellebuyck said.
