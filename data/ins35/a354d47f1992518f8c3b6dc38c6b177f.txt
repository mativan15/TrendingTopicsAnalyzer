Following in the steps of President Trump and Elon Musk, Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, may soon own his own social media platform.

Parler, which describes itself as the premier global free speech platform, agreed to a deal in principle to sell itself to the controversial rapper and fashion designer, the company said Monday.

The move comes after Instagram and Twitter suspended Ye after he shared a series of racist and antisemitic statements on both social media platforms. The rapper said the bans prompted his decision to buy the company.
