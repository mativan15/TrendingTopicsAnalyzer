TORONTO, May 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- FabriikX continues to enhance its curation focused NFT marketplace with the addition of a new private collection by comedian and photographer Steve Best.
Because of Steve's 25-year career in comedy, he is afforded private, backstage access to some of the biggest names in British comedy including Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall, Jo Brand, and Stewart Lee. This access has allowed him to combine his love of photography with his love of comedy to produce two books and his third book – Comedians, a high-end coffee table book of fine art photography – will be published in September.
