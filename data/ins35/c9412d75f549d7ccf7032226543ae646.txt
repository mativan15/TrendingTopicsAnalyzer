The Arizona Cardinals suffered two big injuries on offense on Sunday in their 19-9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. They lost starting left guard Justin Pugh for the remainder of the season with an ACL injury and wide receiver Marquise Brown injured his foot in the fourth quarter.

It was feared to be a season-ending injury.

There is good news.

While head coach Kliff Kingsbury said Brown is out indefinitely, calling it an 'intermediate' length of time, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that the injury is less severe than initially feared.
