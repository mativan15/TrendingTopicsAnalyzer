Europe's gas supply and affordability crisis is actually 'good for the long run,' Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told CNBC on Tuesday. He explained that it would ultimately force the continent to embrace renewable energy, adding that 'people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas.'Gates acknowledged that the public 'did get a little optimistic about how quickly the transition [to renewables] could be done,' admitting the need to find 'non-Russian hydrocarbon sources.'Elaborating on the matter, the founder of climate-oriented venture capital fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures published an essay titled ‘State of the Energy Transition' on his blog on the same day.
