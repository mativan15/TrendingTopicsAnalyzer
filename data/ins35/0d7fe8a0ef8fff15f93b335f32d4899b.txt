British holidaymakers jetting off to Spain this summer could find themselves faced with shuttered bars and restaurants due to staff shortages.
Some bars and restaurants in popular resorts such as Benidorm have already had to reduce their hours or shut for entire days at a time due to a lack of staff.
Industry chiefs estimate there are currently around 4,000 vacancies in the resort but a combination of factors including poor working conditions is leading to vacancies going unfilled.
There are growing fears around 50% of the current roles will not be filled before the peak summer season meaning venues in the resort may struggle to cope with demand.
