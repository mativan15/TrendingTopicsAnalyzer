Liz Truss has resigned as U.K. prime minister on Thursday after serving just six weeks on the job.

Her short time in office was marked by controversies over her fiscal policy and the energy policy known as fracking, and her resignation leaves the fate of bills on stablecoins and crypto seizures hanging in the balance.

'I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party,' Truss told reporters outside her office on Downing Street, saying a new leadership election will be completed within the next week.
