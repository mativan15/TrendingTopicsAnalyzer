Meet Canada's most expensive cities for young people: Halifax, Yellowknife, Moncton, Toronto and Winnipeg. A thinktank called Youthful Cities has teamed up with RBC Future Launch to create an affordability index that evaluates the cost of everyday life in 27 cities for youth aged 15 to 29. There wasn't a city where a young person could cover a reasonable level of monthly expenses and have a surplus. To hear more about the affordability problems of young people today, I invited Youthful Cities communications specialist Claire Patterson to do an e-mail Q&A.
