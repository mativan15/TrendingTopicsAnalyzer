A great reward for saving up money to invest in stocks is potentially earning some attractive dividend income. The more you save, the more you can stand to earn from a dividend stock. On a 4% yield, for example, a $50,000 investment would generate $2,000 a year in recurring income. If you can invest $100,000, then that same dividend rate would now generate $4,000 in cash every year.
If you want recurring income every month, what you can do is invest in dividend stocks with different payment schedules.
