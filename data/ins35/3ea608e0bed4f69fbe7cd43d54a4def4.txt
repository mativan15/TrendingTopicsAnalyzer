KNOX COUNTY, Ind. — The former Vincennes police chief accused of stealing tens of thousands of dollars from the force's evidence vault also reportedly used money meant for city salaries on vehicles for the police department, his arrest affidavit states.

Dustin Luking is accused of using department money to buy personal items as well, including a laptop for a family member. In the affidavit, police also make multiple mentions of a $6,000 gastric bypass surgery Luking reportedly underwent in Mexico around the time he was allegedly seen with money that later went missing.
