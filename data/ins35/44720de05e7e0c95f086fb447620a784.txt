Queen Camilla is stepping out to honor Queen Elizabeth at one of the late monarch's favorite activities.
 
On Saturday, the new Queen Consort attended QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot Racecourse. Camilla, 75, judged the Best Turned Out in the Parade Ring and presented the trophy to the winner of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. During the event, she could be seen wearing a navy blue and white dress and coat from Bruce Oldfield, as well as a Philip Treacy hat, per Daily Mail.
 
Camilla presented QIPCO British Champions Series Hall of Fame medals to Lady Cecil (who received the award on behalf of her late husband, Sir Henry Cecil) and retired jockey Willie Carson, who could be seen celebrating with his hands pointed to the sky.
