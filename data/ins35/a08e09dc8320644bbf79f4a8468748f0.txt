The new leader of United Torah Judaism, Yitzchak Goldknopf, sparked controversy on Saturday night when he told Channel 12's Meet the Press that he does not see how Israel gained from having math and English taught in state schools.

'Haredi schools are denied their budgets by the government because they don't teach English and math. Why? They tell me ‘because in 20 years,' but I have heard ‘every 20 years' a few times, but I have not seen how math and English have advanced the country and its economy,' Goldknopf said.
