The Mercedes-Benz CLS450 is a disappointment. While still good looking, it doesn't have the same sparkle as the original model. For 2022 the CLS is only available in CLS450 guise. It has a lovely turbocharged mild-hybrid inline-6. All-wheel drive is standard. The CLS rides worse than its E-Class and AMG GT siblings. It's pricey at $74,000 to start. The back seat is a little cramped. Save your money and get an E450 instead. Keep scrolling or swiping to see more of the CLS450.
