It's been a little over a year since I started my Substack newsletter and in that time we have grown to be a vibrant and passionate community. Thank you for that.I recently won my eighth journalism award for Best Column of the Year and I couldn't help thinking at the time that none of that would have been possible without the support of my loyal subscribers. I thought of all of you reading my thoughts, sharing them with others, commenting on them, and it gave me a very warm and satisfying feeling far greater than any award.
