By Stuart Condie SYDNEY--Appen Ltd. shares have given back the previous session's gains after Telus International (Cda) Inc. withdrew its takeover proposal. Canadian tech company Telus's A$9.50-a-share proposal had valued machine-learning specialist Appen's equity at 1.17 billion Australian dollars (US$830.6 million). The ASX-listed stock was 22% lower on Friday at A$6.42 after Appen issued a post-close announcement on Thursday that Telus had pulled its proposal without explanation. The stock had jumped 29% to A$8.
