Gangs of London director Corin Hardy has certainly not dialed down the ultra-violence in the upcoming second season.
The first season of the Sky Atlantic drama smashed records, previously set by Game of Thrones, for being the most violent show on our screens.
To put it in numbers, the Joe Cole thriller had a total of 113 deaths, 96 shootings, 30 stabbings and seven strangulations with 13 unfortunate souls being tortured.
Can season 2 of the high-octane drama about rival gangs competing for control of London's criminal underbelly topple that?
According to Corin, who spoke to Metro.
