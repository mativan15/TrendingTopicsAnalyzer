subman JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has hired Aaron Iovine as executive director for digital assets regulatory policy, according to Iovine's LinkedIn profile. Bloomberg earlier reported the news on Wednesday, saying JPMorgan recently created the role. The Wall Street bank didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The move comes less than a month after JPM Chief Jamie Dimon, long known as a crypto skeptic, called cryptocurrencies "decentralized Ponzi schemes" during Congressional testimony.
