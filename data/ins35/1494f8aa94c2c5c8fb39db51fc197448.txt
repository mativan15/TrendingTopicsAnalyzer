By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:00 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 01:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 A low-profile Liberal candidate has apologised for declaring Premier Daniel Andrews will face justice for the "murder" of Victorians stemming from hotel quarantine leaks. Michael Piastrino is running against Mr Andrews in his safe seat of Mulgrave at the Victorian state election on November 26. Over the weekend, he accused the state Labor leader of murdering 800 people, in reference to those who died after COVID-19 leaked out of hotel quarantine during the second wave.
