Hong Kong Disneyland is embarking on new initiatives to make the theme park more accessible to people with disabilities. It is the first Disney park in the world to provide sign language integrated into the body movements of performers at its shows, a practise it calls 'theatrical interpretation' – starting with Halloween. The initiative is part of the park's drive to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. 'There's a responsibility to live up to the promise that Walt Disney himself made when he invited all guests to come to our park and be welcomed,' says Alex Clifton, executive director of entertainment and costuming at Hong Kong Disneyland.
