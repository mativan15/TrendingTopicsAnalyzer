New Brunswick's temporary rent cap is due to expire at the end of the year and the province has yet to decide if it will be extended or not.
Opposition parties say that uncertainty is bad for both tenants and landlords.'This has created so much confusion, so much uncertainty, for tenants and for landlords,' said Green MLA Megan Mitton.'What are they going to do, bring in another retroactive cap some time next year? It's just nonsense. This is not the way to run a government and it's not the way to protect tenants.
