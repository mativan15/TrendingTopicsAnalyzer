The New York Giants are in the process of revamping their defense this offseason, which means putting together a unit that fits new defensive coordinator Wink Martindale's style.
One player they've brought in is massive nose tackle Justin Ellis, who played under Martindale the past three seasons in Baltimore with the Ravens.
Ellis, a 6-foot-2, 350-pounder was a fourth-round pick of the Oakland Raiders out of Louisiana Tech back in 2014 and has started 50 games in his NFL career, bringing some experience and depth to the Giants' defensive line.
