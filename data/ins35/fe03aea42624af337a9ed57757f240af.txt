The UK has undergone huge social, scientific and technological change over the last 70 years - but Queen Elizabeth II has remained a constant, stabilising presence. Take a visual journey through this incredible period of history the Queen has witnessed and been part of. The Space Age kicked off with the launch of the first space satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957.

The Apollo 13 mission had to be aborted in 1970 and the space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launch in 1986.
