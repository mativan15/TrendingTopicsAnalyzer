Liz Truss is entitled to claim up to £115,000 of taxpayers' money every year for the rest of her life – despite spending just 44 days in office.
The privilege is accorded to all ex-PMs but many have questioned her eligibility for the Public Duties Cost Allowance after her brief spell in No.10.
Sasha Swire, author and wife of ex-Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire, tweeted: ‘£115,000 a year for life, a chauffeur, bodyguards, a season ticket to all the best gigs in town, all for screwing up the country in just 44 days.
