CNN —

The UK's world of politics plunged deeper into turmoil on Wednesday night after a debate on fracking led to alleged physical altercations between Prime Minister Liz Truss' aides and lawmakers from her own Conservative Party.

Last month, Truss' government formally lifted a ban on fracking for shale gas that had been in place for England since 2019, arguing that strengthening the country's energy supply was an 'absolute priority.' The main opposition Labor Party brought forward a motion to restore the ban, but some Conservative members of parliament reported they were bullied, even manhandled, into voting in line with Truss.
