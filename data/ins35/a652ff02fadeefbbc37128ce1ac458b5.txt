MUMBAI: The Eknath Shinde government has restored the general consent to enable the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate cases in Maharashtra, two years after the previous Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government revoked the consent in 2020, people familiar with the matter said.
