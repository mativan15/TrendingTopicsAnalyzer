The Wisconsin River is known as the hardest-working river in America. Winding its way from the state's northernmost counties to its confluence with the Mississippi River near the Iowa border, it contains 26 dams providing electric power and is bordered by paper mills, farms and more than 70 municipalities.

In the 1970s, it was overworked. Waste from businesses, towns and agricultural lands polluted the water, choking off oxygen for fish and creating a sludge in some places that small animals could walk across.
