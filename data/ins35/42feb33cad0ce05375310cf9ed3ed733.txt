Confession: I haven't really contributed to my retirement accounts since 2019. And yet, I completely believe in planning ahead for retirement. I've even worked to help other people understand why investing is important. So if my lack of recent retirement account contributions sounds unthinkable, I'll explain. I started saving for retirement in my 20s via an employer's 401(k) plan. I was working as a writer and editor, and retirement was decades away, but I knew the magic of compounding could help set up my future.
