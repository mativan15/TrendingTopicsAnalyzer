Liverpool left-back Kostas Tsimikas is keen to feed 'goal machine' Darwin Nunez to increase the striker's output.The Uruguay international's goal in the 1-0 victory over West Ham was the third time in three starts he has found the net.Nunez could have added to his tally in an impressive 57-minute appearance, having also hit the post, but his header from a left-wing cross is something Tsimikas hopes to be able to replicate regularly.'It was a very good moment for me, especially because it was a cross for Darwin because I wanted to assist him,' the Greek, who was deputising for the rested Andy Robertson, told liverpoolfc.
