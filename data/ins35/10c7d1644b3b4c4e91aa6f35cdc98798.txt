Sheryl Sandberg, Meta's second-in-command for 14 years, is leaving amid perhaps the most tumultuous and uncertain period in the company's history. Meta is fundamentally pivoting its business, and that change will occur without the original architect of that business in the picture.Sandberg, the executive who built the engine of Meta's massive profitability, made the somewhat anticipated announcement of her departure in a lengthy Facebook post earlier this week. The former Chief Operating Officer said she chose to leave to focus on her foundation and philanthropic work, though previous reporting details a growing rift between her and Zuckerberg for years.
