Spain has been voted the best-value overseas destination by UK holidaymakers, despite being far from the cheapest.
It scored 92% in a poll of more than 2,000 people commissioned by Post Office Travel Money, which published separate research finding Spanish resorts were more than twice as expensive as the cheapest alternatives.
The Spanish mainland was closely followed by the Canary Islands, which scored 91%, while Greece came third with 89%.
Turkey and Portugal, which has the lowest cost-of-living in western Europe, were joint fourth with 88%.
