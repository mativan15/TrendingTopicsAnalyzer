Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) reported earnings on October 19 and delivered a beat on both its top and bottom lines. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.02 on revenue of $1.18 billion. That was above the $2.97 EPS on revenue of $1.11 billion that was forecast.

Those numbers were also stronger on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Earnings were up 17% from the prior year and revenue was up 13%.

But you wouldn't know that by looking at the WGO stock price which is down over 11% in mid-morning trading.
