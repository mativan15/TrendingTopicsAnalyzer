Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown call out Embiid for perceived dirty play originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

It's only fitting that the Boston Celtics' first matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers featured a skirmish between Marcus Smart and Joel Embiid.

Early in the first half of Boston's season opener against Philly at TD Garden, Smart got tangled up with Embiid while fighting for a rebound. Smart took exception to Embiid twisting while having Smart's arm trapped to his body and received a technical foul after he grabbed at Embiid's leg.
