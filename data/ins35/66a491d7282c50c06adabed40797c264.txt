Plug Power expects revenue will grow to $5 billion by 2026.

By 2030, the company expects annual revenue will jump to $20 billion as the fuel cell and hydrogen electrolyzer manufacturer expands its customer base, sells more products to existing customers and builds out a network of green hydrogen generation plants across the United States and Europe.

Less than a week after Plug (Nasdaq: PLUG) announced that revenue for 2022 could finish 5% to 10% lower than its previous projection of $900 million to $925 million, the company remains bullish about its long-term outlook as more countries and corporations race to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
