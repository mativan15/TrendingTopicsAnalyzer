Nurse: Nurses are working on a busy medical/surgical unit as word of President Biden's student loan forgiveness program has been released. Two nurses on the unit get into an intense argument about details of the plan. One nurse, close to retirement age, is furious she struggled years to pay off her loans, working nights and weekends for extra funds.

A third nurse attempts to tone down the anger in the room but fails as voices rise, each person anxious to be heard.
