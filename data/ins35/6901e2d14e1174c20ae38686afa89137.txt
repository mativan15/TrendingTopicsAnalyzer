NEW YORK -- Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge is the guy that most people expected would provide the bulk of New York's power in the postseason. After all, he hit a Major League-leading 62 home runs in the regular season. But teammate Giancarlo Stanton has also been providing the long ball and did so again in the first inning of Game 5 of the American League Division Series against the Guardians on Tuesday afternoon.
With Cleveland right-hander Aaron Civale on the mound and runners on first and second, Stanton clobbered a 2-0 cutter into the right-center-field stands to give the Yankees a 3-0 lead.
