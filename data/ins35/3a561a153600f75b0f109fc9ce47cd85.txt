There's an old Russian tale about two farmers. One says, 'He has a cow and I don't. I want his cow to die.'

Sometimes I feel like people say that about those of us fortunate enough to be in unions. Why do you have sick days? Why do you have holidays? Why can't you get fired for no reason?

As a unionist, I think differently from the farmer. I wonder why other Americans can't have sick days, holidays and job protections. More than that, though, I wonder why other Americans don't have health insurance, or have to dig deep into their bank accounts to pay exorbitant amounts for it every month.
