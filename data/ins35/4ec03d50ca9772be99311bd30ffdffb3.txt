Sephora, the French skincare and beauty product giant, is about to re-open in the UK after shutting operations 17 years ago. The company recently acquired FeelUnique, a beauty e-tailer, for £132 million ($128 million) and launched its website and app on Monday. As per media reports, Sephora will be opening a flagship retail outlet next year. After five years of operations, the beauty products behemoth exited the UK market in 2005. During the first stint, the company opened only six stores, the first of which was in the Bluewater Shopping Center in London.
