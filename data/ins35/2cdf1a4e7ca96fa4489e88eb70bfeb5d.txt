Shares of KLA Corporation (KLAC -2.51%) rose 14.3% in May according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor equipment company didn't actually have much in the way of new news in May; however, it did report earnings in the last days of April. Unlike other semicaps that have missed earnings due to supply constraints, KLA actually beat for revenue and earnings. Yet with the outlook for semiconductor investment remaining positive even amid macro concerns, KLA found a bid after its valuation had fallen far enough.
