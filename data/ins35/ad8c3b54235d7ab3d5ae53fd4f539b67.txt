Investors should load up on Chipotle Mexican Grill shares ahead of the restaurant chain's next quarterly report, according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Jared Garber reiterated his buy rating on the stock, noting that while the company was poised for a quarter of negative traffic, it still has strong pricing power. The analyst did lower his price target on the Chipotle to $1,840 from $1,845, but the new estimate still implies upside of about 20% going forward. "We continue to view CMG as one of the most compelling growth stocks in the industry given the strong top-line (unit growth and SSS) and leading margin profile," he said in a note to clients Monday.
