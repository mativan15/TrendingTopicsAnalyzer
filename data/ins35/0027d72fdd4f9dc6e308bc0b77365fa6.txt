When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions. Rarely in politics has this been more true than in the first few weeks of Liz Truss's premiership. Last week, she sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and, today, Suella Braverman resigned as home secretary. Last night, it was unclear whether the Chief Whip had gone too. The sense of drift that Truss had sought to dispel at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons was undone within hours.
Tory MPs who had rallied to Ms Truss, or had at least stayed their hands during the earlier parliamentary exchanges, were left despairing at the latest manifestation of a Government in meltdown.
