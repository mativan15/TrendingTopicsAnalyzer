By Reuters Fact CheckAs Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams faces Republican Governor Brian Kemp in this year's midterm election, some social media users are saying that Abrams lobbied to relocate the Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game in 2021 out of Atlanta in protest against a law that introduced sweeping voting restrictions. Georgia Republicans, including Kemp, have tied Abrams to the MLB's decision, but there is no evidence that Abrams advocated for the All-Star Game to be moved out of the state.
