A schism has erupted in environmental politics after the Scottish Greens voted to cut ties with the UK party over claims of 'trans abuse'.Members overwhelmingly backed a motion to suspend 'formal association' with the Green Party in England and Wales on the second day of their Scottish party's conference in Dundee.The Rainbow Greens, a group representing LGBTQ+ members of the Scottish Greens, submitted the motion, accusing the Greens of 'transphobic bigotry', 'homophobic bigotry' and disrespecting the devolution settlement.
