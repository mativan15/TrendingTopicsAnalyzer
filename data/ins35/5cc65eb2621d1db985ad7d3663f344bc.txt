It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Northfield to downtown Minneapolis. Then, sometimes, another 45 minutes to find a suitable parking spot near Target Center.

For proof, ask Brent Nystrom, Timberwolves season-ticket holder for the past 15 seasons, and off and on before that. A dozen or more times a season, he drives up Interstate 35 to attend games. He made it during their formative years. He made it during the Kevin Garnett era. And he's made it during a stretch in which the Wolves made the playoffs once in 17 seasons.
