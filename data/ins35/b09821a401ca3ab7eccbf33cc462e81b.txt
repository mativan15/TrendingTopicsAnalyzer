A Palm Beach art dealer whose Worth Avenue gallery was raided by federal agents in December is facing charges of mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering in connection with an alleged scheme to sell forged high-end artwork.

Daniel Elie Bouaziz made his first appearance before a federal magistrate judge in West Palm Beach on Friday, according to a release from the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida.
