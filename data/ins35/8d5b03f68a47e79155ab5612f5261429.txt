Steve McCurry's name may not trigger immediate recognition, but his most famous picture certainly will: Afghan Girl, taken in a refugee camp in Pakistan in 1984, a 12-year-old called Sharbat Gula whose startlingly bright eyes took the shot all the way to the cover of National Geographic magazine. McCurry's career is considerably more than this one picture, but such is its fame it provides significant ballast to his reputation and elevates him into photography's elite.So what does this admiring profile tell us? McCurry is a pretty truculent customer, unwilling to give much away; but uncompromisingly direct when he wants to be.
