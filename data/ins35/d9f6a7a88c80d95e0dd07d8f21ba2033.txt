The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has extended the ‘Use and File' procedure for all the health insurance products and almost all the general insurance products under health insurance business. This is a big change moving from the current regime where insurers are required to get a prior approval for launching a new product to a new regime where they can launch new products without any prior approval. 'Use and File procedure essentially means that insurers can introduce their products to the market on filing with the regulator thus avoiding a longer waiting duration in offering innovative insurance solutions to customers in order to help address the dynamic environment,' says Tapan Singhel, MD and CEO, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.
