Here we go again.

The Houston Astros and New York Yankees are set to meet in the postseason for the fourth time in eight years after the Yankees beat the Cleveland Guardians 5-1 in Game 5 of the ALDS on Tuesday. The ALCS will get underway Wednesday in Houston, with first pitch set for 6:37 p.m. at Minute Maid Park.

Of the previous three postseason meetings between the Astros and Yankees, two have occurred during the ALCS. Houston took both of these series, winning in seven games in 2017 and in six games in 2019.
