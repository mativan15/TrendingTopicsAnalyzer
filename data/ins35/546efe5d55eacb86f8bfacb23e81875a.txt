Within the energy sector, traders are the most short on drillers and companies refining and marketing oil and gas.

More traders are betting that energy stocks' big 2022 rally won't last.

Short interest in U.S. energy stocks has risen to 3.9%, the highest level since October 2020, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That means that 3.9% of energy shares available for trading are being held by short sellers. Such traders profit off a stock's decline by borrowing shares from a brokerage for a fee, selling the stock and then buying the stock and returning it to the brokerage to close out the position.
