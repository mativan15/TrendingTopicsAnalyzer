After Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh government's plan to switch from the contributory National Pension system (NPS) to the old pension scheme (OPS) has run into rough weather as the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has rejected the state's request to withdraw its contribution of over Rs 17,000 crore deposited since November 2004. PFRDA has rejected the Congress government's demand to withdraw funds accrued through government and employees' contribution saying there is no provision in PFRDA Act 2013 and PFRDA Resolution 2015 and subsequent amendments to return the amount invested.
