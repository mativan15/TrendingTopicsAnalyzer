Wikipedia editors have added a new landing page that asks readers to be more specific if they're searching for the '2022 United Kingdom government crisis.' And it speaks to just how poorly things are going for recently installed conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss. Specifically, Wikipedia would like to know if you mean the crisis in July when high-ranking politicians in former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's cabinet were quitting en masse, ultimately forcing Johnson to resign as PM? Or are you looking for information about the October crisis, an ongoing clusterfuck where current PM Liz Truss steps on rake after rake, clearly showing herself to be completely inept at running the country?Wikipedia added the disambiguation page on Wednesday after editors kept getting confused about which political crisis was being written about.
