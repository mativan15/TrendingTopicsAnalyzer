Missguided collapsed into administration on Monday after suppliers accused the business of millions of pounds worth of outstanding payments.
But on Wednesday morning, Frasers Group, which also owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, confirmed it had bought the intellectual property of the retailer and sister brand Mennace for around £20million.
