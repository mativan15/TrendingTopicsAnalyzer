'The face, soul, heart and smile of the Games: This is who they are.'These are the words used by Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet to describe the importance of the volunteers during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. In less than two years, over 45,000 volunteers from across the world will participate in the Games in the French capital, playing a key role in the organisation of the world's largest sporting competition while supporting millions of spectators, 15,000 athletes and 20,000 members of the media.
