ReutersOne must understand that while inflation will always tend to push asset prices higher, this period of high inflation is cyclical.san Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said Wednesday she sees a couple of half-point interest rate hikes ahead as the central bank battles too-high inflation, lifting rates to 2.5% by the end of the year. "I see a couple of 50 basis point hikes immediately in the next couple of meetings to get there. And then we need to look around and see what else is going on," Daly said in a CNBC interview.
