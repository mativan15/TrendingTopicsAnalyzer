MPs were ‘manhandled' and ‘bullied' into voting a certain way in Parliament, it has been claimed.
In extraordinary scenes it was claimed by MP Chris Bryant that some members were told to vote in a particular way by ‘force'.
As the scenes were unfolding in the lobby, it was also claimed that the Chief Whip, Wendy Morton resigned.
Deputy Chief Whip Craig Whittaker, is also understood to have quit.
It comes after the Prime Minister survived a crunch vote on her fracking plans but chaotic scenes unfolded in the House of Commons as her leadership continued to be hanging by the skin of her teeth.
