The pound has slid to its lowest level this week as downbeat economic data and the prospect of political uncertainty increased nervousness in the financial markets.Sterling fell by 1.16% to 1.110 against the US dollar on Friday morning. The pound was also down 0.64% at 1.14 against the euro.The cost of Government borrowing increased as yields on gilts, UK Government bonds, rose by around 2%, or 0.08 percentage points, to 4.04%.The poor performance by the pound and stocks in London has been partly caused by weaker-than-expected economic data.
