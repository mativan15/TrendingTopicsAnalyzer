The Supreme Court has asked the Gujarat government to serve it's "bulky" response to all parties in the Bilkis Bano case, wherein 11 convicted of rape and murder have been released by granting remission. The court will hear on November 29 pleas which have challenged the remission granted to 11 convicts who gangraped Bilkis Bano and murdered her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The petitioners have said that remission rules do not apply for those convicted for heinous crimes. SC remarked that the Gujarat government response filed was voluminous.
