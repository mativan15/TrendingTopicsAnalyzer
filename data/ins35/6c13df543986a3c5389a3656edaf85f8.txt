Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright have given a sneak peek into their living room as they show off their newly renovated home. The pair have posted a clip to their home account which features a huge cream sofa in their main living room. The couple are certainly going to enjoy some cosy movie nights on their massive sofa which takes up the entire wall. The chair is covered in comfy pillows, perfect for a chilled evening. Mark wrote alongside the clip: "Wanna watch a movie?" In the middle of the room there's a neutral circular coffee table topped with candles and books.
