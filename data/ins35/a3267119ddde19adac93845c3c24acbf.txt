I'm all for free speech. But free speech doesn't mean that you're entitled to destroy property. It doesn't entitle you to block roads, dig tunnels, lock on to buildings, or bring chaos and misery.Nor does it entitle you to endanger anyone. Yet many of the protests we have seen in recent years have put lives at risk. They've also cost a ferocious amount of money and taken up police time and resources.This is all too much now, which is why we need the Public Order Bill. The law-abiding majority has rights too – and I will always put them first.
