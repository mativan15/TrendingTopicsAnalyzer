Indianapolis Colts linebacker Shaquille Leonard had surgery on the broken nose he suffered when he took a hit in Week 4 that also gave him a concussion.
As Leonard recovers from surgery, he will have missed two games since breaking his nose against the Tennessee Titans after being ruled out Friday ahead of the Week 6 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Head coach Frank Reich said they haven't made a decision on whether to put Leonard on the injured reserve list yet.
'We'll continue to evaluate those things,' Reich said when asked about a potential trip to the injured reserve list.
