In brief A freaky-looking humanoid robot wearing dungarees and named Ai-Da became the first machine to speak at a House of Lords committee hearing on AI art this week.
Gallery director Aiden Meller created Ai-Da and claimed it had "a combined collaborative persona" made up of "many algorithms … very different algorithms for very different outcomes," including code for drawing, painting, speaking, and writing, The Guardian reported. Questions were prepared ahead of the hearing for the machine, and Ai-Da's answers were thus scripted.
