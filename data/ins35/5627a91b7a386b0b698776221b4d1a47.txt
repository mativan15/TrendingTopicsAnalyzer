The future value of Tiger Woods's golfing career, up to the age of 50, is approximately $175 million (€163 million), according to professional services firm Kroll. With Woods now aged 46, this implies he is likely to make – between prize money and endorsements – just under $44 million annually for the next four years.To showcase its expertise in valuations, Kroll annually calculates the Future Career Value (FCV) of the world's top golfers. Last year Rory McIlroy topped the leader board with $401 million in FCV followed by Justin Thomas ($299 million) and Bryson DeChambeau ($225 million).
