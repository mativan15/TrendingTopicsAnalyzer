A new facility in Thompson is offering Northerners a space to try out high-tech equipment they might not otherwise have access to in hopes that experimentation will lead to new interests and hobbies, perhaps even a new career.Housed in a warehouse in the south side of the city, the North Forge North's FabLab has tools to explore a wide range of crafts and trades, from carpentry to sewing to digital design and podcasting. The lessons are informal and free. Locals are encouraged to share their expertise with others even as they pick up new skills themselves.
