The Buccaneers will be without safety Logan Ryan for an extended period of time.

Ryan, who has missed the last two games, will undergo foot surgery to repair a Jones fracture on Wednesday, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media. Ryan is eyeing a potential late-season or postseason return.

Tampa Bay signed Ryan to a free-agent deal in March. He's started two games for the Bucs while playing 150 defensive snaps.
