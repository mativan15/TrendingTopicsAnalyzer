(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc., which is cutting costs and relying more on remote work, is closing its office in San Francisco, dealing a fresh blow to a city trying to revive its business district.The San Francisco office is one of several in the Bay Area, including one that opened recently in Palo Alto, the company said. Snap will continue to let San Francisco employees use a coworking space in the city. 'Our San Francisco location was lightly used by team members following our move to flexible work,' said the company, which makes the Snapchat social-media app.
