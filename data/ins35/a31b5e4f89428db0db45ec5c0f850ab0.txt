Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has apparently changed his mind about threatening to shut down his Starlink satellite network which was set up to provide vital communications services for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February unless the U.S. government steps in to pay the freight.

The Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Mr. Musk's SpaceX have been a critical resource for Ukraine's military trying to stay connected on the battlefield even as other cellular and internet networks have been destroyed in the war now in its eighth month.
