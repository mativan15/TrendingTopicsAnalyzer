While sneaker brands and designers have left much to be desired in the way of female-centric collaborations, TITAN's commitment to women is broad and longstanding. The Manila-based, basketball-focused brand sponsors women's tournaments, enlists female athletes as endorsers and is using its Air Jordan 2 as an opportunity to spotlight artist and designer Chi Loyzaga Gibbs.

Gibbs' connection to basketball is common knowledge in the Philippines as the granddaughter of one of the most celebrated hoop icons Carlos "Caloy" Loyzaga — a 6'3" forward also known as "The Big Difference" who led the Philippine Men's National Basketball team to a bronze medal in the 1954 World Cup.
