Former prime minister Paul Keating has called on the state government to return to the original height limits at Central Barangaroo and compensate developer Aqualand as the Chinese-backed company warns the viability of the venture is on the line.It follows a stunning intervention by Planning Minister Anthony Roberts nine days ago, revealed by the Herald, to effectively kill a proposed modification that would have allowed buildings taller than 35 metres, including a controversial 73-metre luxury residential tower.
