Renewed optimism in Saskatchewan's oil patch is evident as Weyburn plays host to the Saskatchewan Oil and Gas Show, which runs from June 1st to June 2nd. Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry is rebounding after a serious slump at the start of the pandemic. Hundreds of industry representatives are meeting at the show to discuss opportunities as oil prices reach record highs. However, some challenges to growth remain. Dan Cugnet, Chair of the Saskatchewan Oil and Gas Show said they are optimistic they will see more activity in the province in the fall but is based on supply chain problems as well.
