HP's (HPQ -0.20%) stock rose 4% on June 1 after the PC and printer maker posted its second-quarter earnings report. Its revenue rose 4% year-over-year to $16.5 billion, which beat analysts' estimates by $310 million.
Its adjusted net income dipped 1% to $1.2 billion, or $1.08 per share, but still topped analysts' expectations by three cents. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, its net income fell 19% to $1.0 billion.
HP's growth rates seem tepid, but investors often own its stock for stability and income instead of aggressive gains.
