By Rhiannon Hoyle Yancoal Australia Ltd. on Monday said it has established an independent board committee to assess a potential takeover by majority shareholder Yankuang Energy Group Co. Ltd. Yancoal, which is listed in Australia and Hong Kong, said it received an unsigned, nonbinding expression of interest from Yankuang on April 29. The committee is seeking more information from its majority shareholder, "including to better understand how Yankuang Energy has assessed the value of Yancoal noting that the potential transaction is at a discount to the prevailing trading prices of Yancoal Shares on ASX [Australian Securities Exchange] and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange," the company said.
