Constrained private sector growth has limited the number of quality jobs. Only 33 percent of workers in Zimbabwe receive a salary, well below peers in the region and globally, suggesting a limited share of quality jobs despite workers possessing relatively higher skills. Labor productivity in informal firms is only a fraction of the labor productivity in similar formal firms, negatively affecting overall productivity. Moreover, competition from informal firms has tended to lower the productivity of formal firms by around 24 percent on average, compared with firms that do not face such competition.
