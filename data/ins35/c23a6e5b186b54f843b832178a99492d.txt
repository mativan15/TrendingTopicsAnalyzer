New guidelines would establish travel allowances for service members who live in states where abortion is illegal but are looking to terminate their pregnancyIt would not pay for the procedures themselves - the Hyde Amendment prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortionsUnder federal law the Pentagon's health care system can only provide abortions in the case of rape or incest or threat to the life of the motherThe new directive by Sec. Lloyd Austin also bolsters privacy protections by giving troops until 20 weeks into a pregnancy to notify commanders It requires commanders to show discretion and avoid 'discrimination and retaliation' against service members who choose to have an abortionBy Morgan Phillips, Politics Reporter For Dailymail.
