At the age of 38, Tony Blair was still toiling away as a shadow minister in the Labour Party.
It took a decade-long career as Prime Minister and another fifteen years working to improve living standards in developing nations for Mr Blair to finally secure a knighthood at the age of 68 in January.
But his son Euan, 38, has been awarded his first honour just six years after setting up a business dedicated to supplying apprentices to tech companies. Mr Blair has been awarded an MBE for services to education as founder and chief executive of Multiverse.
