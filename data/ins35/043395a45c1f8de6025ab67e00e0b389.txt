opinionIn the course of three weeks I took three flights and drove over 1,300 miles to talk to women in four states. I was hosted in eight homes, where I recorded six kitchen table conversation podcasts – we literally sat at their kitchen tables – and attended six events where women were trained in the art of relational organizing. There was a lot of coffee and charcuterie involved, although usually not at the same events.I'm a born talker, and I love hearing people's stories: Put me in a room with someone for 10 minutes and I'll know where they're from, how they met their spouse and maybe even a birth story or two.
