Nikola Jokic is about to start his chase toward something that hasn't been done in nearly 40 years.

A player winning back-to-back NBA MVP awards is rare, something that's happened only 13 times in league history. And having done that last season, Jokic — the cornerstone of the Denver Nuggets — is now trying for something even more unusual: winning it three years in a row.

The only players who have pulled off that feat are Bill Russell (1961, 1962, 1963), Wilt Chamberlain (1966, 1967, 1968) and Larry Bird (1984, 1985, 1986).
