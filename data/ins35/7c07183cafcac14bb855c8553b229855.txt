Harley Moser loves his muscle cars. But he loves his children even more.The semi-retired South Dakota cattle and horse rancher is auctioning a collection of classic Plymouths and Dodges, along with a few trucks, to help pay for his adult son and daughter's medical care.Justin and Molly were both born with an adrenal disease that's required an increasing amount of treatment, and the bills have been adding up.Moser told Fox News Autos he'd purchased the cars over many years and stored them as investments because he and his wife Barb had been spending too much of the cash from their savings account.
