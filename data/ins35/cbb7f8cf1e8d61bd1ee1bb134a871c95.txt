Oct. 19—SOMERSET, Pa. — After eight hours of testimony on Tuesday, the second day of a trial for three men charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault and murder hadn't progressed as quickly as Somerset County Judge Scott Bittner had hoped.

Samson Washington, 30; Marekus Benson, 32; and Deandre Callander, 29, are accused of conspiring to kidnap and murder Damien Staniszewski, of Duncansville, and James Smith, of Portage, in 2017 over a drug theft.

After the jury was dismissed at 5 p.m. Tuesday, Bittner addressed Evan Lowry and Kara Rice, the attorneys from the state Office of Attorney General who are prosecuting the case, and the defense attorneys for the men on trial.
