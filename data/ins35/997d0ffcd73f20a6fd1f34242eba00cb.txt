stockcam Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares fell more than 28% in early Friday trading as the camera company reported its lowest sales growth-to-date, leaving analysts to wonder if there is more pain to come despite the already lowered bar. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, who has an underweight rating, noted that Snap (SNAP) is "over reliant" on branded, less proven advertising and coupled with execution risk, increased competition and a strategic change, there could be more pain to come for the Evan Spiegel-led company.
