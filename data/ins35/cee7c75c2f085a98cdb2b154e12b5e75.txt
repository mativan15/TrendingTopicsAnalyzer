The recent reports that figures at Manchester City believe Jurgen Klopp's comments could be construed as bordering on xenophobic and racist is not the first time that this bogus argument has been broached.It was first raised by club chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak at the end of the 2018-19 season. He at the very least made the comments publicly, when responding to Liga president Javier Tebas' comments on state-owned clubs, although they were no less wrong.'There's something deeply wrong in bringing ethnicity into the conversation,' Khaldoon had said.
