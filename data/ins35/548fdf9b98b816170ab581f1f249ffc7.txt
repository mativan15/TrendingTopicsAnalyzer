Zorica Nastasic/E+ via Getty Images Eyenovia (NASDAQ:EYEN) said its treatment MicroLine met the main goal of a phase 3 trial to treat presbyopia (farsightedness). The study called VISION-2 enrolled 140 people and evaluated Eyenovia's 2% pilocarpine micro-array print (MAP) formulation, MicroLine, against placebo, all administered via the company's Optejet device. Presbyopia is a gradual loss of the eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects. The analysis of evaluable patients excluded a non-study related adverse event which impacted pupil size and reactivity (new onset anisocoria), the company said in a press release on Thursday.
