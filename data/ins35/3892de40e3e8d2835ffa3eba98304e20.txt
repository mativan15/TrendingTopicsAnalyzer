The Met Office has issued a yellow alert for thunderstorms expected to cause flooding on Thursday.
Heavy downpours broke out across most of northern England, the Midlands and the South East in the morning, with hail and strong winds rattling windows in East Anglia and London.
Forecasters warned of power cuts, train cancellations and road closures later in the morning as the sheer volume of rainfall threatens to overwhelm infrastructure in some areas.
Drivers were told to watch out for ‘spray and sudden flooding', with a ‘small chance' of flash flooding taking home and business owners by surprise.
