DUBLIN, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The "Data Integrity and Document Management Training Course" conference has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
This concise course covers the background to data integrity, why it is important and how its requirements affect both paper-based and computer-based systems.
Document management and data integrity are a key focus of regulatory inspections, with both EU and FDA inspectors increasingly observing violations during GxP inspections. It has become a critical issue in document governance and regulators expect staff working in GxP roles to have been trained in this important area.
