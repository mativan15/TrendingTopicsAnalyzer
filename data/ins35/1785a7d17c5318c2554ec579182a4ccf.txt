BHUBANESWAR: Come Sunday, and Naveen Patnaik will complete three years in office in his fifth consecutive term as chief minister. In office for more than 22 years, Naveen has grown from strength to strength, evident from the BJD's recent sweep in the panchayat and urban local body elections.

Having brought transformative changes to the lives of people with its cradle to grave schemes, the Naveen government, in its current term, has turned its focus on facelift of major temples, fighting corruption and transforming high schools.
