May 28—HARRISVILLE — Neighboring towns — Diana in Lewis County and Pitcairn in St. Lawrence County — are two of the four municipalities targeted for fiber-optic broadband installation for the "middle mile" through a state broadband program, allowing Lewis County to stay within its $2 million broadband budget partnership with Charter Spectrum impacting five towns and a village.

The $10 million state project is the first in Gov. Kathleen C. Hochul's $1 billion ConnectALL high-speed internet infrastructure initiative.
