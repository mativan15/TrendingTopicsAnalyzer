The countdown is on to Sunday's CHEO Telethon, a chance to see how your generosity can change the lives and build brighter futures for children in our community. The CHEO Foundation kicked off a two-week campaign on May 23, introducing you to the six brave CHEO families who will be profiled this year. On Sunday, join CTV Ottawa for the 39th CHEO Telethon. The telethon from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. will feature live check-ins with the families, the medical professionals involved in their treatment as well as updates from staff and patients all over CHEO, the CHEO Research Institute and Roger Neilson House.
