STILLWATER, Okla. — Cayden Wallace, who hit two home runs, and Michael Turner both drove in three runs and second-seeded Arkansas defeated third-seed Grand Canyon 7-1 on Friday in the Stillwater Regional. Wallace plated a run when he was hit by a pitch and Turner followed with a two-run single in a four-run second inning that put the Razorbacks on top 5-0. That was plenty for Connor Noland (6-5), who scattered six hits in seven innings. Arkansas (39-18), which ended a four-game losing streak, faces the winner of Missouri State-Oklahoma State on Saturday after Grand Canyon (41-20) meets the loser.
