Shares of Twitter fell Friday amid concerns driven by Elon Musk's potential acquisition of the company and a federal government investigation.

Twitter shares closed 4.9 percent lower Friday even as the stock market on the whole rallied into the weekend, slipping to $49.88 per share. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all rose more than 2 percent on the day.

Musk is seeking to close a deal to purchase the company for $54.20 per share with the backing of several major financial institutions and foreign investment funds, a potential source of national security concerns.
