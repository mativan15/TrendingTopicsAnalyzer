Brightline's local expansion has drawn interest in the potential connections it could make across the region.

The intercity rail service will connect Miami to Orlando International Airport through a 170-mile expansion from West Palm Beach. From there, the service has said it wants to connect to Tampa, with the potential for a shared corridor with SunRail adding stations at locations like South International Drive near Walt Disney World Resort and Orange County Convention Center.

That route also has generated interest in what could come next.
