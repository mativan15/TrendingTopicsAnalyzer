Toronto residents can now have their marijuana delivered to them through a partnership between Uber Eats and the cannabis marketplace Leafly, as well as three other pot retailers in Canada.

Starting Monday, cannabis cravers 19 and older can place an order on the Uber Eats app, and the delivery will be made by a government-certified 'CannSell' employee who will verify the customer's age and sobriety, as is required inside cannabis stores in Ontario.

The three cannabis retailers participating are Shivaa's Rose, Minerva, and Hidden Leaf, according to The Associated Press.
