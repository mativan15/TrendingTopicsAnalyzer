Gotham Knights is the latest game from Warner Bros that adapts the legendary lore from DC comics' Batman franchise. But rather than focusing on The Dark Knight, this title puts four of his proteges in the spotlight. Gotham Knights takes place in an original story where the famed Cape Crusader and commissioner Jim Gordan have died, resulting in a huge spike in violent crime. In an attempt to protect Gotham in their stead, Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin and Red Hood leap into action, becoming the city's new protectors.
