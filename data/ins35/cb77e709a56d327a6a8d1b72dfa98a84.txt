Published: 06:01 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 06:06 EDT, 30 May 2022 An Australian man was mistakenly sent thousands of votes for The Voice Australia due to his phone number being just one digit off the one used for the competition. A 50-year-old Brisbane man called Antoni tells news.com.au that his phone was inundated with texts and calls since voting started on May 22. 'I deleted the first few hundred (messages) because I thought I was being spammed, not realising people were voting. I have not watched the show and had no idea why people were texting me the contestant names,' he said.
