The United States Congress is investigating a crisis that left 150,000 people in Mississippi's capital city without running water for several days in late August and early September, according to a letter sent to Governor Tate Reeves by two Democratic legislators.
Representatives Bennie Thompson and Carolyn Maloney on Monday requested information on how Mississippi plans to spend $10bn from the American Rescue Plan Act and from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and $429m 'specifically allotted to enhance the state's water infrastructure'.
