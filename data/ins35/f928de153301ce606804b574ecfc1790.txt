On 26 January we were sent an estimated energy bill for more than £1,000 by SSE which is roughly three times our usual usage. When I pointed out it that we had sent readings and the estimate was too high, the bill was revised up to £5,043.We supplied SSE with meter readings when we moved into the property in 2019 and have sent it regular updates, often as photographs, so it is possible to see exactly what our usage has been over the past three years.However, there has often been a huge discrepancy between the actual readings and SSE's estimated ones.
