The war of words continued to rage as days after Prashant Kishor claimed that Nitish Kumar is in touch with the BJP and that he may go for a tie-up with the party again if situation demands so, the Bihar Chief Minister Friday said that all that the poll strategist wants is publicity.
'Kindly don't ask me about him. He keeps talking. He speaks for his own publicity and can say whatever he wants, we don't care. There was a time when I respected him…I don't know what's on his mind now,' Nitish Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.
