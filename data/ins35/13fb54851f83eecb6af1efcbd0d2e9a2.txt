Tipping Point went through a big shake-up to the way in which the ITV show ran earlier this year. The new version swapped from the usual four-person line-up to only three people and changed the second round, where contestants received 45 seconds instead of 30 seconds to answer questions. However, the most recent episode whipped spectators into an online frenzy as Mandi, Nick, Rachel, and Andy made up the contestants waiting to take on the machine.ITV presenter Ben Shephard made no reference to the additional person on the panel when the show started.
