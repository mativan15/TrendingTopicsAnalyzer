From fashion to tech to home appliances, Walmart+ members can save big during this sales event. One such item that caught my eye is the Keurig K-Compact Single-Serve K-Cup Coffee Maker that's on sale for $49 (regular $89). This coffee maker might not have all the frills and features that some of the other modern-day coffee makers have, but it gets the job done.
