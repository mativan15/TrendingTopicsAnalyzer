By Elizabeth Palmer May 31, 2022 / 10:46 AM / CBS News Tokyo — China's top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was in the tiny Pacific island nation of Tonga on Tuesday, signing bilateral economic deals in a region where Beijing has sought for years to increase its influence and leverage. But the deals he signed in Tonga were not the high note on which Wang had hoped to end his tour of the Pacific Islands. He arrived from Beijing aiming to ink a much larger omnibus deal with 10 island nations that would have formalized cooperation in areas as diverse as fisheries, communications and security.
