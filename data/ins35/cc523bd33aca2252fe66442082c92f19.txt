The tusks were once part of a stockpile seized from poachers and held in sealed containers by the government of Burundi.In this study, researchers used DNA and carbon dating techniques to show that some of that stored material is now in the hands of smugglers.The government of Burundi has not responded to a BBC request for comment.The authors say seizures should be destroyed and not stored.
