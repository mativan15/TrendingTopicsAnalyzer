MUSKOGEE, Okla. — Bond was denied Tuesday for a 26-year-old man suspected in a shooting that killed one person and wounded seven more at an outdoor festival in eastern Oklahoma, a prosecutor said. Skyler Buckner surrendered to law enforcement Sunday afternoon following the shooting earlier that day at the Memorial Day weekend event in Taft, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southeast of Tulsa. He remains jailed and has not been appointed an attorney, District Attorney Larry Edwards said. Sharika Bowler, 39, was killed in the shooting, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the shooting.
