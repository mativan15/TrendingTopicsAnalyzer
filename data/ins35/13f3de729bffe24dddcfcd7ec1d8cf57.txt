Rebel Wilson sparkled at the 2nd Annual Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles on Saturday night with a special addition to the ring finger on her left hand, which had tongues wagging.
The Pitch Perfect star showed off what appeared to be a big diamond ring on the notable finger as she posed for pictures at the star-studded, glamorous event.
Dressed in a black velvet Saint Laurent wrap dress with lace edging around the cuffs and neckline, Rebel beamed as she showed off her jewellery.
The star also accessorised her stylish outfit with matching peep-toe velvet platform heels and a slick of dark red lipstick, with her long blonde hair worn over one shoulder.
