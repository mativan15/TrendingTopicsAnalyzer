Boris Johnson has said his situation is 'different' to Rishi Sunak after the Chancellor confirmed he would be donating his £400 energy bill rebate to charity.Mr Sunak unveiled a further £21 billion of support for households on Thursday after a surge in energy bills and increasing shop prices led to demands for the UK Government to step in and help people.As part of the emergency cost-of-living package, the Chancellor announced each household will get the £400 energy discount that will be partly funded by a £5 billion windfall tax on oil and gas giants.
