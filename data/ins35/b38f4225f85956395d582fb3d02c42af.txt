New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned there will be 'difficult decisions' ahead on tax and spending on Saturday.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Hunt, twice a Tory leadership contender, wasted no time in criticising the mini-budget but endorsed the "fundamentals" of the push for growth.

He added: 'Spending will not go up as much as people want and there'll be more efficiencies to find and we won't have the speed of tax cuts we're hoping for, and some taxes will have to go up. That's the reality of the very challenging situation we face.
