Women and low-income earners are among Australia's most generous in times of crisis, research shows.

An Australian Red Cross study reveals women gave more money and donated more often than men when it came to worthy causes.

Data collected from January 2019 to April 2022 shows 183,940 women donated a total of $91.37 million, while 129,539 men donated $88.96 million.

The data also shows the generosity of people in low-income areas matched wealthy Australians as a percentage of their area's median income, and they gave more than middle-income areas.
