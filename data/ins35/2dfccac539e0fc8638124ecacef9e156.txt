Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini is slashing its workforce by approximately 10% amid "turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time." "The crypto revolution is well underway and its impact will continue to be profound. But its trajectory has been anything but gradual or predictable," Gemini's billionaire founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss wrote in a blog post on Thursday. "Its path can best be described as punctuated equilibrium — periods of equilibrium or stasis that are punctuated by dramatic moments of hypergrowth, followed by sharp contractions that settle down to a new equilibrium that is higher than the one before.
