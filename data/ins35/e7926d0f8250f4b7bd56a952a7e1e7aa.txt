OAKLAND — On a blazing evening earlier this week, members of the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League filed into the back room of an old Italian restaurant that sits off 880 not far from the Coliseum for their annual fantasy football draft.

This was not the young, tablet-toting bunch so common in fantasy leagues across the country. 'One thing that's different about this league,' said Stan Heeb, the commissioner and a retired teacher, 'is we're pencil and paper guys.' Some of the silver-haired participants have been involved so long they aren't sure when they joined.
