Ms Wright claimed that she had never been in debt, and did not have any worries about paying her bills before. The 65-year-old pensioner explained that she did not want to be a burden on her family, but she was really worried. Ms Wright discussed what may happen next for her, like having to use a foodbank or losing her house due to rising bills.
