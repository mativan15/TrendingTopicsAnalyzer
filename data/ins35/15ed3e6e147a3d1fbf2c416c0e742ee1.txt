The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission said late on Thursday that Telenor's Total Access Communication Pcl and True may proceed with the merger through an all-share deal, first announced almost a year ago.

The regulator tied the merger to a number of conditions to protect consumer interests and ensure fair competition in the industry.
