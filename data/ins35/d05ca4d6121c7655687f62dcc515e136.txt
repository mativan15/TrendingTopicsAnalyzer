Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Marlin Global Limited (NZSE:MLN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Marlin Global's shares on or after the 8th of June, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 23rd of June.
