Union Minister Munjapara Mahendrabhai said the Centre has launched various schemes to develop Jammu and Kashmir as a world-class health- and wellness tourist destination. He said the Union government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last year announced a public outreach programme in Jammu and Kashmir to reach out to people at the grassroots to listen to their problems, besides reviewing the development scenario.
