My watchlist for May performed very well adding 3.31%, beating SPY, and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) that finished the month with a loss of 0.07%. After this solid month the annualized rate of return for the watchlist improves from 13.87% to 15.29%, building a cushion above my long term target of 12%.
