Liz Truss has been given just twelve hours to save her premiership, following chaotic scenes in Westminster that left the government on the brink of collapse.

Senior Tory MP Simon Hoare said Thursday and Friday were 'crunch days' for the prime minister.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, the chair of the Commons Northern Ireland committee said there was 'pessimism' across the party.
