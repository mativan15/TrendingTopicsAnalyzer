'After having shot 70 people, arrested, wounded and tortured more than 1,000 others, they are now attacking buildings and documents,' he tweeted.

Masra's party was listed first among the seven suspended by Chad's government for a 3-month period. The decree covers all political activities nationwide.

Demonstrators in the capital, N'Djamena, and several other cities took to the streets Thursday to protest against interim leader Mahamat Idriss Deby extending his time in power by two more years.

Deby became head of a transitional government when his father, former President Idriss Deby Itno, died in April 2021 after more than 30 years in power.
