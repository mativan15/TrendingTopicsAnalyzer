Teenage leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed has been called up by England Lions, joining four Test players on next month's trip to the United Arab Emirates.

The 15-man squad will travel to the UAE on November 6 for a training camp, before taking on Ben Stokes' senior England side in a three-day match that serves as a warm-up for the Test series in Pakistan.

Leicestershire prospect Ahmed, 18, has long been touted for international honours and ended the county season with a maiden five-for and a maiden century in the same match against Derbyshire.
