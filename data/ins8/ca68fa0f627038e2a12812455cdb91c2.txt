NEW YORK — Early gains for stocks faded on Wall Street Wednesday, sending indexes lower in midmorning trading. A stronger-than-expected report on manufacturing sent Treasury yields sharply higher as traders took it to mean the Federal Reserve will continue moving aggressively to slow down the economy and tame inflation. Energy stocks rose along with the price of crude oil. Salesforce.com led gains for technology companies after reporting a strong quarter and raising its outlook for the year. The S&P 500 fell 0.
