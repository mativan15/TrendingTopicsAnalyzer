Milwaukee Bucks fans return to Fiserv Forum for the start of the 2022-2023 regular season on Saturday against the Houston Rockets. While expectations remain high for another NBA world title, one thing that has changed is enhancements to the overall Bucks experience.

The team announced a new partnership with Anheuser-Busch, technological improvements have enhanced ticketing and the team is on pace for a post-Covid return of the fan experience.

Milwaukee Bucks president Peter Feigin shared with the Milwaukee Business Journal the preparations for the 2022-2023 season during an interview on Tuesday.
