Becoming a dad is a significant moment, but that doesn't mean that the transition is easy. Oftentimes, a dad's role can be seen as an afterthought, said Doyin Richards, a father of two and author of 'Daddy Doin' Work: Empowering Mothers to Evolve Fatherhood.' 'Recognizing a new dad on Father's Day is a simple way to empower him as he embarks on the most important job of his life — namely, raising tiny humans,' he said.And, as you know, raising tiny humans requires practical, sentimental and experiential gifts that better highlight a new dad's role as a parent: 'practical' for caring for the baby, 'sentimental' to treasure as the years go on or 'experiential' for the new dad who needs a little pampering.
