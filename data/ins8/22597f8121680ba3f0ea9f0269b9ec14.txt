A copy of the communique, which was seen by Business Insider Africa, said in parts: "The ratio of gross non-performing loans (NPLs) to gross loans stood at 14.1 percent in April 2022, compared to 14.0 percent in February. NPLs increases were noted in the building and construction, manufacturing, trade and transport and communication sectors. These increases were attributable to specific challenges in the respective businesses, and banks have continued to make provisions for the NPLs." In specific terms, the bad debt stock in Kenya stood at $4 billion (KSh473 billion) as of Q1 2022.
