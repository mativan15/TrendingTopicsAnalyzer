Iran is turning to Russia as an economic partner as Tehran reels under tough US sanctions. One of the largest-ever Russian business delegations visited the Iranian capital in mid-September. Representatives from 65 Russian firms and 650 Iranian companies met to discuss business opportunities in farming, manufacturing, IT and various other fields. An Iranian manufacturer of paper mill machinery has struggled to import high-quality components from Western countries due to economic sanctions. The firm, which has a plant on the outskirts of Tehran, now sources about 80 percent of its components domestically, and gets the rest mainly from China.
