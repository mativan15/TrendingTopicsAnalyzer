Brentford 0 Chelsea 0Chelsea maintained their unbeaten run under Graham Potter but had to settle for a point after a damp squib of a derby at Brentford finished goalless.The Blues made the short trip across west London on the back of five successive victories in all competitions, winning each of the last four without conceding.Once again they kept a clean sheet, but there was a distinct lack of cutting edge up front as they drew a blank against the Bees.There was also another injury scare for England boss Gareth Southgate after midfielder Conor Gallagher limped off early on.
