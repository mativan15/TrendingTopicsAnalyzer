A man was arrested for stealing multiple catalytic converters.

On Oct. 16, the manager of LKQ on Hickory Hill Road saw two men drive into the lot in a dark-colored Honda Civic, get out, and began cutting catalytic converters off company trucks.

Memphis Police arrived and saw one of the men, Treavor Coop, walking away from a company truck while holding a power saw.

The officer told Coop to stop.

The man dropped the saw, and began to run on foot, police said.

MPD was able to arrest Coop after a brief footchase.
