OPINION: Like a lot of mothers, Sen. Rick Scott's mom had a clear plan for her son: He was going to make straight A's, be an Eagle Scout, go to church, and eventually get a job and make money. This plan — created by a loving mother who was struggling through a difficult first marriage — set the path and tone for Mr. Scott's life. He was a good student, an Eagle Scout, went to church and, eventually, made a considerable amount of money. More importantly to him, he became a husband, father and grandfather.
