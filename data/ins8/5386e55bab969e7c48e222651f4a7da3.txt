A few years ago Renault pensioned off most of its models in the hotly contested C segment – cars the size of, say, a VW Golf or a Nissan Qashqai.Then a year or so ago it started trying to claw back a share of this market with the Arkana hybrid and then the Megane E-Tech EV. Now it has unveiled its latest weapon in this battle, the oddly-name Renault Austral.This is a full hybrid SUV with a brand new 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine and an electric motor, together developing 200hp. The version we will be getting in the UK, the Austral E Sport Alpine, won't be here for a good six months and so the cars we tried at its international launch in Spain were pre-production vehicles.
