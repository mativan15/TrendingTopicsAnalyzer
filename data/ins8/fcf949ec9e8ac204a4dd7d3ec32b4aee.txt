The long-awaited sequel to 1986's hit starring Tom Cruise as a cocky Navy fighter pilot broke the holiday record set by "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," which grossed $114 million during its first three days in theaters in 2007. Directed by Joseph Kosinski and also starring Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly and Val Kilmer, "Top Gun: Maverick" is the first film starring Cruise to make more than $100 million in its opening weekend.
