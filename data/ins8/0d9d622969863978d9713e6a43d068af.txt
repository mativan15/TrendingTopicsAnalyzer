It's a magic moment which his peers compete to upstage as teachers, police officers and volunteers watch on. Held across two days, the Fremantle Dockers' Kimberley 9s carnival is unsurprisingly a big hit in a region with a deep love for Australian rules football. Hundreds of primary and secondary students from Halls Creek to Looma and everywhere in between are invited to take part in the nine-a-side games, on the proviso they meet school attendance and behaviour requirements.
