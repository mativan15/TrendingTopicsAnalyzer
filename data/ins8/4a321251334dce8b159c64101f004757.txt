Andalucian soccer team Unión Deportiva Almería earned a promotion to LaLiga, Spain's top soccer league on Sunday night.

It took seven years for Almería to return to the first division, a move many in the league credit to team's new owner, Saudi Arabian sheik Turki bin Abdul Mohsen bin Abdul Latif Al Al-Sheikh, the former minister of sport and current chairman of the General Authority of Entertainment of Saudi Arabia.

Al-Sheikh bought the Spanish club two years ago for approximately $20 million.
