Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on Tuesday asked chief minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor, terming his appointment 'totally illegal'. The governor, who is the chancellor of the PAU, said the government had appointed Gosal without following the norms of the University Grants Commission, or seeking his (the chancellor's) approval. 'Since Satbir Singh Gosal has been appointed V-C of PAU by the Punjab government, you are requested to remove the said V-C, who has been illegally appointed, without further delay,' Purohit wrote to the CM, directing that the V-C's charge be handed over to the administrative secretary of the agriculture department.
