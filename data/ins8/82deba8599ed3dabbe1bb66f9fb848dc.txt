Lions defensive tackle Levi Onwuzurike opened the year on injured reserve because of a back injury and he won't be coming off of it before the season is over.

Head coach Dan Campbell told reporters on Monday that Onwuzurike had surgery during the team's bye week and he will miss the rest of the season while his back recovers.

Onwuzurike was a second-round pick last year and he appeared in 16 games as a rookie.
