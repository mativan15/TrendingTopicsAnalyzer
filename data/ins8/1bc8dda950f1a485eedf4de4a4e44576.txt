Afsaar Alam, 36 and his family have been making Diyas for 34 generations now. It is a family-run business that is active all year round. 'We make Diyas and other clay items all year round. The demand is certainly higher during Diwali,' he said. Every month they sell upwards of 5,000 Diyas, but during the Diwali period, the demand shoots up and they sell almost 1.5 lakh units.'Generally, we get orders of 5 to 10 Diyas from each individual customer, but at the time of Diwali, people are buying 20-25 pieces at a time,' he elaborates.
