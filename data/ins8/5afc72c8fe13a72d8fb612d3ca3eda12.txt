On Thursday, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, the same judge that oversaw the case between Apple and Epic Games, ruled Cydia's creator, Jay 'Saurik' Freeman, could present his claim against the company after rejecting a bid by Apple to dismiss the complaint.
Freeman first sued Apple at the end of 2020, alleging the company had an 'illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution.' Judge Gonzalez Rogers dismissed Cydia's initial complaint against Apple, ruling the suit fell outside the statute of limitations.
