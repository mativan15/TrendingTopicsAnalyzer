Fox News contributor and former education secretary Bill Bennett denounced President Biden's decision to forgive close to $6 billion in student loan debt Thursday, calling the move "regressive" and a "mistake."The White House announced that it plans to cancel federal student loans for some 560,000 borrowers who attended the now-defunct for-profit Corinthian Colleges chain. Under the new action, hundreds of thousands of students who attended the now-defunct chain will receive $5.8 billion in full loan discharges – the largest of its kind in the Department of Education's history.
