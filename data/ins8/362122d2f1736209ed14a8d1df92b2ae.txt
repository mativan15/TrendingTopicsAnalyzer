Wichita-based Textron Aviation has kept the throttle up on order activity at the National Business Aviation Association convention.

The local Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) on Tuesday afternoon announced an order for up to 20 Cessna Citation business jets from charter operator Fly Alliance.

That followed an announcement earlier in the day from NBAA in Orlando of an order for up to 14 business jets from private travel company flyExclusive.

The Fly Alliance deal is comprised of four firm orders and purchase options on 16 more jets.
