The Mall of America has begun using metal detectors and bag searches at at least some entrances, following security scares earlier this year.

KARE-11 spotted security staff at four entrances to the megamall in Bloomington, Minnesota, checking personal bags and screening visitors with metal detectors. Metal detectors haven't been widely used at the mall since it opened 30 years ago.

But the mall was a scene of a shooting in August, though no one was hurt.
