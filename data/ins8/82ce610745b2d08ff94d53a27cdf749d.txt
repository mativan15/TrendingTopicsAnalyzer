Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) not only gave 18 of its local Prime members tickets to Thursday's game, but also provided them with a hotel room at the Wild Horse Pass Resort, a bag of Cardinals swag, transportation to the game, a meet-and-greet with former Cardinals players, photo opportunities with the team cheerleaders and Big Red, the Card's mascot, and the chance to watch the teams warm up from the field before the game started.
