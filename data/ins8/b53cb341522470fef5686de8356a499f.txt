October 20, 2022 04:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A ground-breaking new legal claim ('UK Buy Box Claim') alleges that Amazon has breached competition law and caused millions of UK customers to pay higher prices for products sold on Amazon.co.uk and the Amazon mobile app by obscuring better-value deals.



The opt-out collective action, to be filed in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London, will allege that the Big Tech company abuses its status as the dominant online marketplace and harms customers by channelling them towards its 'featured offer'.
