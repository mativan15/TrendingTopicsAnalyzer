Amazon has blasted a proposed antitrust law that aims to clamp down on Big Tech's anti-competitive practices.
The American Innovation and Choice Online Act (AICOA) led by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and House Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) is a bipartisan bill, with Democrat and Republican support in the Senate and House. It is still making its way through Congress.
The bill [PDF] prohibits "online platforms" from unfairly promoting their own products and services in a way that prevents third-party businesses from competing.
