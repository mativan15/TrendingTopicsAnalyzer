FinkAvenue Fidelity Investments is ramping up its long-term bullish bets on the cryptocurrency industry as its digital assets business plans to increase its headcount by another 100 workers in the next three to six months, bringing the total to around 400. The hires will take hold across a number of functions including client services, operations, technology, business development, marketing, and compliance, a spokesperson for Fidelity Digital Assets told Seeking Alpha via email. That comes on the heels of FDA allowing its institutional clients earlier this week to buy, sell, and transfer ethereum (ETH-USD) starting October 28 in response to growing client interest, CoinDesk reported, citing a memo.
