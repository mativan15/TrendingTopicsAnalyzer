Washington CNN Business —

Facebook-parent Meta plans to sell off Giphy, an online search tool for animated images, after the UK government said it would force the tech giant to unwind its acquisition of the service.

It's the first time regulators have successfully broken up a part of the technology giant since Meta's economic dominance began drawing antitrust scrutiny from officials around the globe.

The final decision on Tuesday by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ends a drawn-out fight with Meta over the deal's likely impact on rivals' access to GIFs, as well on as the digital advertising market.
