Workers at an Amazon distribution center near Albany, New York, have voted decisively against forming a union, rejecting a bid by organizers to create the company's second unionized facility in the U.S.

Employees at the ALB1 facility in Castleton would have been represented by the Amazon Labor Union, the same upstart group that won a historic election at the company's JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island in New York City earlier this year. The 'no' votes came out ahead by a roughly 2-1 margin.

Chris Smalls, president of the ALU, said in a statement that the voting process 'wasn't free and fair.
