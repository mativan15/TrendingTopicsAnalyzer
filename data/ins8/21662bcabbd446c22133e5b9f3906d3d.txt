Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,856.86 per ounce, as of 0152 GMT. U.S. gold futures edged 0.1% higher to $1,859.40. "With the 3-day holiday in the U.S., which means lower liquidity than usual, and a lack of top-tier data until Wednesday, we may find that gold will remain nailed to its tight range around $1,850 unless a new catalyst arrives," City Index senior market analyst Matt Simpson said.
