Jack Sparrow Halloween costumes have reportedly seen a ‘huge spike' in sales this year, following Johnny Depp's defamation trial with Amber Heard earlier in the year.
According to reports from TMZ, most Halloween parties (in the US at least) will have a smattering of the Pirates of the Caribbean character after the ‘world's largest costume retailer' Halloweencostumes.com revealed they have had a 90 percent sales spike in purchases of the costume.
The retailer stocks two versions of the dishevelled pirate costume and says 85 percent of its stock has already been bought up for this year's Halloween.
