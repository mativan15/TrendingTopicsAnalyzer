Electronic Arts will shut down online services for several games next year, including Mirror's Edge, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, Gatling Gears, and Shank 2.First spotted by Trueachievements, the specific date for the server shutdowns for these games is January 19, 2023. There are two Achievements that will be affected by server closure in NBA Jam: On Fire Edition and they are Arena Noob and Arena Vet, which requires players to earn one and ten Arena medals, respectively. Mirror's Edge, Gatling Gears, and Shank 2 don't have any Achievements that require online access, so unlocking them after the shutdowns will be possible.
