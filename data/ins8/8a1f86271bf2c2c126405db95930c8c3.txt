Woolworths' mini supermarkets program is being extended to schools across the nation to help students and people with employment opportunities.The supermarket chain doubled down on its commitment to help others through its program by opening 25 of its specialty stores across states and territories by June 2023.Each mini supermarket replicates a usual Woolworths store with baskets for fresh food, supermarket shelves, a fully operational check out and the staff uniform.Students use fully operational Fujitsu registers and learn how to scan grocery items, handle money and process sales as well as customer service skills.
