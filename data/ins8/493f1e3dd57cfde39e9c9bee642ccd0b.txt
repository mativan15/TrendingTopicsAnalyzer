Democrats overdid it on their signature pandemic relief bill last year, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said this week.

'Was there too much in the American Rescue Plan on a relative basis? Absolutely,' Warner said Tuesday on Bloomberg Television when asked about economic policy regrets.

It's unusual for a lawmaker to second-guess a bill they voted for in such a way. Still, Warner said he would not have done anything differently since lawmakers at the time worried the economy wouldn't recover strongly from severe disruptions related to COVID-19.
