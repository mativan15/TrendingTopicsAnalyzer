Whispering Barren, Bless Global's first limited-edition Mystery Box series, was sold out right after going on sale, drawing great attention in the market. When things are bearish, such an achievement wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the vibrant game ecology, solid market recognition, and the numerous prospective users who are loyal and highly engaging. These factors together ensure players an opportunity to monetize their in-game assets in Bless Global.

SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 19, 2022 /CNW/ -- On Oct 18, Tigon Mobile, the subsidiary of Longtu Korea, started to sell the first batch of Whispering Barren at 19.
