And this is now set to apply to everyone. Tories and their tax cuts; Labour and their handouts and giveaways. Sir Keir Starmer's party may insist that its plans are costed, that ushering in windfall taxes will cover his party's spending plans.
Markets will know better, not least because the Tory party has announced not one, but two windfall taxes (the first one on oil and gas companies going much further than what Labour had proposed) and the total amount of revenue raised between both is likely to come in under £10bn.
