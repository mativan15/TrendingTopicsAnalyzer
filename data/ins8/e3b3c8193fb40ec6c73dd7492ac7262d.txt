DaveAlan/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) provided its first quarter earnings by the end of April. Over the past weeks, I have analyzed earnings of several airlines in North America, Central and Latin America, as well as in Europe and observed different recovery paths as well as earnings call tones. What most calls had in common was the upbeat sentiment for the second quarter of 2022, but we saw also a difference in earnings call angles, from JetBlue being downbeat due to pilot shortages to United Airlines providing a sales pitch for investment in airline stocks.
