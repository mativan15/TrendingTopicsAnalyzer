Years with statewide elections are typically quiet for local school districts, but not this year in South St. Paul.

The small Dakota County school district of 3,200 students has two tax levies before voters Nov. 8 and an unusually large field of 22 candidates are vying for four seats on the school board. The district is one of three in St. Paul's suburbs with levies before voters while a number of others have competitive school board races.

It's not unusual for school districts to avoid asking voters for funding when statewide races, such as when the governor or attorney general, are on the ballot.
