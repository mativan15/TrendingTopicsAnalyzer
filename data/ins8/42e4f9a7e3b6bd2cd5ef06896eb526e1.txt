HOUSTON — Aaron Boone is shaking up his lineup again for Game 2 of the ALCS.
Harrison Bader will hit leadoff against Astros lefty Framber Valdez, rookie Oswald Peraza will make his first playoff start at shortstop and Oswaldo Cabrera will return to left field on Thursday night at Minute Maid Park.
Peraza was added to the ALCS roster after being left off the ALDS roster and only appeared as a pinch-runner in Game 1. With him starting Game 2, Isiah Kiner-Falefa will return to the bench after starting Game 1 and collecting one of the Yankees' five hits.
