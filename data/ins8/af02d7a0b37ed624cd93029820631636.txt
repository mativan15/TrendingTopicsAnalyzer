To prepare his team for this weekend's matchup with North Dakota, Gophers men's hockey coach Bob Motzko probably could have watched any video of North Dakota from the last decade.

"You'd see the same North Dakota team," Motzko said. "Their bread-and-butter is how hard they play and their forechecking."

North Dakota (2-1-1), which fell from No. 3 to No. 7 in this week's uscho.com rankings after a tie and loss to Quinnipiac last weekend, makes its first appearance at 3M Arena at Mariucci in nearly three years.
