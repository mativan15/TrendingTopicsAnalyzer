BEIJING - Asian stocks rose Monday after Wall Street rebounded from a seven-week string of declines and China eased anti-virus curbs on business activity in Shanghai and Beijing. Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Oil stayed above $110 per barrel. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index finished Friday up 6.6% for its biggest weekly gain in 18 months after surging inflation declined in April. U.S. markets will be closed Monday for a holiday. "Markets rallied into the long weekend, providing a positive tone at the start of this week," ING economists said in a report.
