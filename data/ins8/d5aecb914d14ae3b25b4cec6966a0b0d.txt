In a tweet that has since gone viral, a netizen who claims to be a stripper declared that we are currently in a recession based on the empty status of strip clubs. The user, @botticellibimo, explained that 'the strip club is sadly a leading indicator and i can promise ya'll we r in a recession lmao.' In a series of recent posts related to their original tweet, the user made their case, arguing that 'Sex work has survived through every war, recession, decline of empires,' and pointing out that strip clubs have been 'an operative tool' for business people, and not just a source of ‘sinful' entertainment.
