OK, there's 'Dahmer,' but let's not go there.'The School for Good and Evil,' an adaptation of Soman Chainani's series of 'Harry Potter' knockoffs, is definitely all lemons on the loud/long/tedious slot machine. The problem is, because it has such a starry cast, viewers might think it worth a try when it shows up at the top of their Netflix queue. 'School' starts streaming Oct. 19.Faculty at this particular institution of supernatural learning include Charlize Theron, Kerry Washington, Michelle Yeoh, and Laurence Fishburne.
