Stuart Rose, former head of British department store M&S and chairman of supermarket chain Asda, told the Financial Times that Truss had lost the confidence of business and investors.'She is a busted flush,' he told the newspaper. 'As prime minister, you have to have the confidence of business, investors, the electorate and colleagues in the party. She has none of these.'Dame Alison Carnwath, former chairwoman of Land Securities and senior adviser at investment bank Evercore, said Truss had 'no mandate, insufficient support in parliament, incomprehensible economic policies and lacks style, charisma and authority'.
