Germany continues to rely on Russian natural gas imports.

German vice-chancellor Habeck said the country is "ashamed" that it still buys gas from Russia.

But, he said, sanctions are making it difficult for Putin to spend proceeds from oil and gas sales.

Russia may still be raking it in from its oil and gas sales, but Moscow can "hardly spend" money due to sweeping sanctions, said German vice-chancellor Robert Habeck, as reported by Deutsche Welle.
