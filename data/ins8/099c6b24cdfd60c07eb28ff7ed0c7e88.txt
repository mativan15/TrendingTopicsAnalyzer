May 28—After previously taking place at Peach Tree Golf & Country Club in Marysville, the annual fundraiser The Event became the first concert performance at the newly opened Hard Rock Live venue at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Sacramento at Fire Mountain in Wheatland.

Headlining the concert in the modern state-of-the-art facility was Yuba City's own Tyler Rich, an American country music artist who has come into his own as he continues his rise to stardom. Also performing Thursday night was Temecula Road, who opened for Rich.
