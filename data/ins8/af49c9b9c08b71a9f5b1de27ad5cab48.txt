PTIThe three military services, namely the army, air force, and navy, are about to see some revolutionary changes in the recruitment system. According to the newly proposed changes, all the recruited soldiers shall be released from service after 4 years. That's not all; the changes also make it mandatory to re-enlist 25% of soldiers for full service after a month. These progressive changes are part of the Tour of Duty/Agneepath scheme. If sources are to be believed, many high-level discussions have been taking place among the authoritative bodies regarding this radical move.
