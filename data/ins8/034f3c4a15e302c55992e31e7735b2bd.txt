Published: 02:39 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 02:39 EDT, 18 October 2022 The Australian government has reversed the previous administration's recognition of west Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The centre-left Labour Party government agreed to again recognise Tel Aviv as the capital and reaffirmed that Jerusalem's status must be resolved in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. Australia remained committed to a two-party solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, and 'we will not support an approach that undermines this prospect', Ms Wong said.
