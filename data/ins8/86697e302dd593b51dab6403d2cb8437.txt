Richard Hammond slammed Just Stop Oil protestors during his appearance on Good Morning Britain as he chatted with Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley about his new show, which sees The Grand Tour host restoring classic cars. However midway through the interview, Richard Madeley brought up the Just Stop Oil protest, which took place in London, and how protestors might have an issue with his new show."Just Stop Oil who was spraying orange paint all over Aston Martin's HQ in London yesterday would say that you are basically the devil incarnate for running these old cars," Madeley pointed out.
