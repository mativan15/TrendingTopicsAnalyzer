Before Russia's invasion, the Libertarian Party even urged 'the United States to leave NATO in light of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine' - an anti-NATO position not unlike the Kremlin's.This philosophical convergence hasn't gone unnoticed by libertarians in Eastern Europe, some of whom have taken to calling their American peers 'Kremlitarians'.In April, Liberty International, a libertarian group with members worldwide, held an online meeting on the issue.
