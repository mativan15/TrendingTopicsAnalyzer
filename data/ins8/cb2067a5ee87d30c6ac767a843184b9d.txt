As investors come up on a stacked week for earnings, CNBC Pro identified several companies that are beloved by Wall Street and will be reporting results. Roughly 15% of companies in the S & P 500 are expected to report earnings for the week ended Oct. 21, according to a note this month from Goldman Sachs. Investors will be parsing through corporate results to see how businesses have dealt with the impact of higher inflation and an aggressive rate-hiking campaign from the Federal Reserve, as well as ongoing supply chain issues and a stronger dollar.
