Silatranes arouse much research interest owing to their unique structure, unusual physical–chemical properties, and diverse biological activity. The application of some silatranes and their analogues has been discussed in several works. Meanwhile, a comprehensive review of the wide practical usage of silatranes is still absent in the literature. The ability of silatranes to mildly control hydrolysis allows them to form extremely stable and smooth siloxane monolayers almost on any surface. The high physiological activity of silatranes makes them prospective drug candidates.
