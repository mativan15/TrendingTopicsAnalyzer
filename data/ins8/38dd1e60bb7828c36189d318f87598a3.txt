Six British soldiers and a veteran were arrested on suspicion of cocaine and money laundering offenses just days before the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, the UK's Ministry of Defense confirmed to The Post.
The seven suspects were detained early Wednesday during a raid carried out by the Royal Military Police at their barracks in England, BBC News reports.
Raids also reportedly took place at a property in Windsor, as well as in Wales and Northern Ireland. The veteran involved is a former officer in the Coldstream Guards.
