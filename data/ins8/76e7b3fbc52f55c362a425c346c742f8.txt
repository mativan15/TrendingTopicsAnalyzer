One hundred days of all-out war have disproved much of what the Kremlin thought it knew about Ukraine, but Russia still believes it can wear down its neighbour's defences and the West's willingness to pay a price for backing Kyiv.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24th with too few troops spread too thinly over too many fronts, suggesting it expected Ukraine's military to fold, its political leadership to flee, and many of its 42 million people to welcome occupation.None of those things happened, and Russian units were destroyed and driven back from the suburbs of Kyiv in early April, then forced to retreat last month from near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, which is just 35km from the border between the former allies.
