LONDON, June 02, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to The Business Research Company's research report on the gynecology drugs market, menopausal hormone therapy (HT) practices have evolved over the last few decades, guided by the changing understanding of the treatment's risks and benefits. Symptoms such as hot flashes, chills, and sleep problems are common during menopause, with up to 70–80% of women experiencing vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and/or night sweats). Also, according to the research article published in the Journal of Menopausal Medicine in 2020, nearly 75% of women experience the symptoms of menopause between the ages of 45–55 years, which has led to a reduction in self-esteem among them.
