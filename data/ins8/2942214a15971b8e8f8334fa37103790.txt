SMITH HEMPSTONE OLIVER is Associate Curator, Section of Land Transportation, at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.By Smith Hempstone OliverWHEN a motorist relates that his unaltered stock sedan or convertible coupé has hit 114 miles an hour, or some other fantastic speed, there is no use in arguing to the contrary. He cannot be persuaded otherwise.
