Arsenal are reportedly considering sending Nuno Tavares on loan but also think a leading role in the Europa League could help him.

Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has focused on the full-back area as a key area of recruitment since taking charge. He first of all signed Cedric Soares on loan from Southampton, before making his move permanent.

Last summer, meanwhile, Tavares arrived from Benfica and Takehiro Tomiyasu left Bologna for north London.
