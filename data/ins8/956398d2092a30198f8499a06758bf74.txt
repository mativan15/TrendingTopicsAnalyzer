Bill Pugliano/Getty Images News The General Motors (NYSE:GM) all-electric Hummer attracted a rave review from Barron's, which said it drives likes a sports car even though it looks like a tank. The all-electric Hummer was called the favorite of the 15 EVs tested by the publication over the last year or so as it beat out the Lucid Air, Tesla Model Y and Ford Motor (F) F-150 Lightning. The Hummer tested featured 1,000 horsepower and sped to 60 miles per hour in about three seconds. Of course, one catch with the electric Hummer is that it starts at $110,000.
