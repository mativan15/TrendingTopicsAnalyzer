(Bloomberg) -- A diamond and jewelry tycoon who faces allegations of swindling 15 Indian lenders out of more than $1 billion is fighting back against a worldwide freeze on his assets in London court.Lawyers for Jatin Mehta alleged in a court filing last week that the Indian unit of Standard Chartered Plc and liquidation firm Grant Thornton indulged in a 'sleight of hand' to get the May freezing order that is completely unjustified. Mehta is 'as much the victims of what occurred as the consortium of banks,' said lead lawyer Andrew Hunter, who is seeking to regain access to $932 million of his client's assets.
