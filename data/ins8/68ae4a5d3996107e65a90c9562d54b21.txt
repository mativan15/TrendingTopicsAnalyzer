Liz Truss is facing rival rebel plots to overthrow her after just five weeks in power – as she braces herself for the markets' reaction today to her shock economic U-turn.
Jeremy Hunt – handed chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's post but already tipped to get her job – yesterday insisted the prime minister is still in charge despite chaos since her tax-cutting mini-budget.
But scheming MPs want to swap her for a ‘dream ticket' of leadership rivals Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. While Ben Wallace, the
Defence secretary, is being lined up by others who say Mr Sunak cannot unite the party after his resignation as chancellor led to ex-PM Boris Johnson's exit.
