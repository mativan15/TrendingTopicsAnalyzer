Few pop stars understand the power of merchandise like Taylor Swift. The singer's campaign around the launch of today's album Midnights provides a perfect snapshot of how a modern pop machine works.
A moonstone-blue vinyl version of the album, available to pre-order for £36.99 plus delivery charges, comes with a hand-signed photo of Swift and features one of four collectable album jackets and an eight-page lyric book with never-before-seen photos, among numerous other 'collectable' touches. The album also comes in lavender, mahogany, jade green and 'blood moon' colours.
