It's time for the Green Bay Packers to make a tough decision regarding right guard Royce Newman. Benching a player is never easy, but the 2021 fourth-round pick has struggled mightily in his second season and turned in another abysmal performance against the New York Jets on Sunday.
Pro Football Focus tallied five allowed pressures for Newman in 48 pass-blocking snaps. That brings Newman's seasonal total to 17 in just six games. During his rookie year, Newman kept a better pace allowing 32 pressures in 16 starts.
