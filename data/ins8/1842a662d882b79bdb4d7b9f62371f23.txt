P﻿eter Mackay, Ross County fanThe Staggies' performance against Dundee United came close to hauling them away from the foot of the table - but Tony Watt had other ideas when he smashed home from just outside the six-yard box. The point, which could later down the line be seen as valuable, keeps Malky Mackay's side bottom on nine points - the same tally as both United and Kilmarnock. That perfectly tees up a firey 'six pointer' at Rugby Park for the Staggies against a Kilmarnock side they have already beaten this season.
