Kyiv attacked Emmanuel Macron on Saturday after he said it was vital Russia was not humiliated for the illegal invasion of Ukraine.
The French president declared France's role was to be 'a mediating power' and that sparing Vladimir Putin a crushing defeat was the only way to find a diplomatic solution to end the war.
"Calls to avoid the humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.
He said Russia, which Kyiv says has occupied 20 per cent of its territory, should instead be "put in its place", to "bring peace and save lives".
