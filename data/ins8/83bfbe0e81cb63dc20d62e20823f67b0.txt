Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit, the Delek US Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:DK) share price is 33% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 26% (not including dividends) in the same period. That's a solid performance by our standards! On the other hand, longer term shareholders have had a tougher run, with the stock falling 26% in three years.
