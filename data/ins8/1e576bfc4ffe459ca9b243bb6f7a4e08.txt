The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says it will commit €1.23 billion to the effort to end polio worldwide.

The money will also be used to stop outbreaks of new variants of the virus which may evade existing vaccinations. The announcement was made at the World Health Summit, being held in Berlin.

Pakistan has reported 20 polio cases so far this year, all in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Afghanistan, which has registered two cases this year, previously lacked access to vaccines because of violence and the Taliban banning polio teams in areas under its control.
