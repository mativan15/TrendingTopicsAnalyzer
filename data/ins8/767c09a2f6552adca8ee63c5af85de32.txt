"This type of scam is called a kidnapping scam and is meant to trick a parent or grandparent into thinking that their child is in danger so that they will pay a ransom."

The Boston Police department issued a community alert after receiving multiple reports of a kidnapping scam from parents of students at Boston Public Schools.

Three separate parents of students have received calls that their child was in danger or kidnapped, with the caller demanding money sent through Western Union.
