Ronny Costello, Dode Fox Podcast, externalA week is a long time in football but it's amazing what three positive results can do in that time. OK, it was actually eight days, but who's counting?As we mentioned on the podcast this week, if we were offered seven points out of nine at 5pm last Saturday before we faced Aberdeen I think all United fans, me included, would have taken it.A superb 4-0 win versus Aberdeen kicked it all off under the lights at Tannadice, followed up with a hard-fought 1-0 win against Hibs.
