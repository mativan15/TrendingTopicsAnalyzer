BUDA, Texas, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Texas is on a roll. Not a good roll.



The Lone Star State leads the nation in labor-related accidents and especially workplace deaths and injuries among Hispanics. In 2020, there were 221 reported Latino fatalities in the workplace. But it's not a huge surprise Texas has led the nation in workplace deaths of Latinos for 13 of the last 20 years.

According to a recent story in The American Prospect, 'A Dangerous Place to be Latino,' 5,179 workers died on the job in Texas from 2010 to 2019 – more than in any other state.
