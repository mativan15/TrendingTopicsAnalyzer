When news of a novel coronavirus broke in January 2020, Dan Gabriel 's business had employed 20 people.

The trained journalist-turned-former CIA agent spent nearly a decade building AM LLC, first as a federal contractor that started media outlets in the Middle East and Cuba before shifting to the state and local public health infrastructure realms. That led the Leesburg firm toward contact tracing, whose need spiraled overnight during the pandemic. By the start of this year, Gabriel's full-time headcount ballooned to 1,300.
