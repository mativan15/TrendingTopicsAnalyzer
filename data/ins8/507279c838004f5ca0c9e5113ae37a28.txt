Southeast New Mexico saw some of is highest oil production in the last decade, with the most barrels of crude oil reported produced in 2021 in the history of the region, said Hanson Yates, president of Artesia-based Santo Petroleum.

Santo is drilling two new wells in the Carlsbad area, Yates said, and planned to continue targeting the region for future growth.

At the Carlsbad Mayor's Energy Summit Thursday, Yates rallied for fossil fuel production in the region encompassing parts of Eddy, Lea, Chaves and Roosevelt counties, calling for expanded domestic operations centered on the Permian and the western Delaware sub-basin.
