Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday wrote to Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis requesting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not to contest Andheri (East) bypoll against Rutuja Latke, wife of late Shiv Sena leader Ramesh Latke. Responding to his letter, Fadnavis said that he cannot take the decision alone and that the matter needs to be discussed at the senior level in the party.
Meanwhile, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar also appealed to the BJP to make the bypoll an unopposed contest by withdrawing its candidate.
