That detail was part of a report on Terra's meltdown in early May that Jump Crypto, the crypto unit of Chicago-based Jump Trading, published on Thursday.

Until now, the firm has largely remained silent about Terra's demise -- including how Terra's backer, Luna Foundation Guard, allocates its remaining funds to compensate users of UST, or steps the firm took in a failed effort restore the coin's 1-to-1 peg to the dollar.
