(JTA) — For the first time, players currently on Major League Baseball rosters are joining Team Israel in next year's World Baseball Classic — and there could be a lot of them.

As many as 12 current Major Leaguers could be playing for Israel in the event, set for Miami in March. They include Baltimore Orioles Israeli-born pitcher Dean Kremer, New York Yankees outfielder Harrison Bader and San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson, who team leaders say is working to get his fellow ballplayers to sign on.
