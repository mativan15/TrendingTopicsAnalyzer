A day after Uttarakhand Roadways employee Rajendra Bahuguna, who was given the status of minister of state in the state's first elected government in 2002, shot himself to death, the Nainital police registered a case of abetment to suicide against his daughter-in-law.
In a police complaint, Bahuguna (59) was accused by his daughter-in-law of molesting his granddaughter. Another case was registered against him on the complaint of a neighbour who accused Bahuguna of abusing, threatening and attacking her when she was walking with her mother-in-law.
