The new chancellor is bringing forward a key financial statement to today, as part of renewed effort to ease the financial turmoil engulfing Britain.
It is the second time the major tax and spending plans have been moved following a disastrous reaction to the ‘mini-budget', which has seen Liz Truss's premiership plunged into chaos.
The statement will be delivered by Jeremy Hunt later, after he replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as the under-pressure prime minister's finance chief on Friday. 
It is likely to resemble a formal budget and signal a screeching change in direction for the PM, who faces a battle to stay in office and calm financial markets.
