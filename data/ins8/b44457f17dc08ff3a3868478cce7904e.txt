Sales of Spam and fish heads have risen a third as people seek out cheaper meals amid the cost of living crisis.The famously unfashionable canned meat, made of ground-up pork shoulder and ham, is up 36%, according to Waitrose's annual food and drink report.
It's been around since 1937 but the supermarket calls it the "comeback king of 2022" and says more shoppers are searching for recipes involving the brick-shaped product.The versatile meat can be used to make delicacies including fritters, sushi, kebabs and a classic Spamburger.
