(Bloomberg) -- Activist investor Dan Loeb has taken a stake in Colgate-Palmolive Co. and is pushing for the consumer-products giant to divest its Hill's Pet Nutrition division and consider unloading other brands. Loeb's Third Point has built a position worth roughly $1 billion in the New York-based company, and is working in collaboration with Toms Capital Investment Management on the investment, according to people familiar with the matter. Colgate's pet food division would fetch a 'premium multiple' if separated from the New York-based company, Loeb said in an investor letter Tuesday.
