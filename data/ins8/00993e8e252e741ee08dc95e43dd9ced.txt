Hendon Hooker has played an integral role in Tennessee's incredible rise to No. 3 in the rankings.

Hooker was an average-at-best quarterback at Virginia Tech whose career has taken off after a transfer to Knoxville. Saturday's 52-49 upset victory over Alabama in Neyland Stadium was the high point in his journey thus far.

Hooker threw for 385 yards and five touchdowns and had two pinpoint completions in the final seconds of regulation to set up the game-winning field goal as time expired.
