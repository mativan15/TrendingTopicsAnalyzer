In Orange County this year, 26 Latinas are running for city council, school board or supervisor offices.

That's a huge increase from a decade ago, when a handful of Latinas sought local office and only two won.

In the male-dominated field of politics, women have gradually gained a foothold in O.C., as have Latino men. But Latinas have been slower to get involved.

That is changing, partly because of the women's movement that erupted after Donald Trump was elected president, inspiring a flurry of first-time candidates.
