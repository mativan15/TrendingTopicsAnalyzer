Lukas Schulze/Getty Images News Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) stock trades at 12.55 P/E and 2.8 EV/Sales. In this article, I highlight why I believe that the valuation is too cheap. I support my argument with a residual earnings valuation. Anchoring my assumptions on analyst EPS consensus estimates, a WACC of 8% and a terminal value growth rate equal to expected nominal GDP growth, I find that Nintendo's fair target price should be approximately $70/ share. Thus, I am confident to conclude with a BUY recommendation for NTDOY stock.
