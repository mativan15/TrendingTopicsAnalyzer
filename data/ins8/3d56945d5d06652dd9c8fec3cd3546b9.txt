Xinhua | Updated: 2022-05-27 09:51 A money pot might carry a sweet childhood memory for some. But as early as 2,000 years ago, in today's Yunnan province of Southwest China, it meant wealth, status and power.
But it was not a piggy bank, and what was stored inside were not coins. In the ancient "Dian kingdom" (between 278-109 BC), this bronzeware container held precious seashells from the Indian Ocean, an exclusive item for aristocrats.
According to historical records and archaeological studies, most areas in Yunnan were still a barter society at that time, and shells were not popular as a currency, but were for symbolic use in the tombs of nobles.
