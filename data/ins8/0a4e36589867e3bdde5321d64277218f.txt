Labour MP Christian Matheson resigns in the aftermath of allegations of 'misconduct'. Christian Matheson issued an apology in a statement. However, he went on to say that he was shocked to have been found responsible for a number of false accusations. As a result of the allegations, an independent commission investigated MPs' behaviour and recommended that Matheson be barred from the Commons for four weeks.

The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards upheld two misconduct claims against Matheson.
