Imagine you're out walking your dog on a nice sunny morning. As you approach the intersection, you see a car attempt to make a lefthand turn, only to be hit by an oncoming car that runs the stop sign. No one's hurt, but the cars are totaled. What is your first thought concerning the innocent driver making the turn? Is it 'poor guy, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time'? Or do you think 'even though he had the right of way, he should have made sure the other car stopped before turning left'? Believe it or not, your answer says more about you than either of the drivers.
