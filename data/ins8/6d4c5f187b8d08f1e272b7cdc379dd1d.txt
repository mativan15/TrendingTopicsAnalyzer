A Torbay drugs lord jailed for attempted murder must pay back £32,000 of money he made from his criminal lifestyle - £16,000 less than was originally ordered. Joshua Garrett was told in March of last year to hand over £47,601 as part of the Proceeds of Crime Act investigation.

The sum was calculated based on money that could realistically be retrieved from the sale of his assets. But lawyers returned to court on Wednesday [October 19] and agreed to lower the amount saying the total of his assets was only £31,628.
