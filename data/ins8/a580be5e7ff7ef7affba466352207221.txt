Fifa is facing calls to throw Iran out of the World Cup weeks before their opening match against England after 'kamikaze' drones made by the country were used in the latest wave of attacks by Russia against Ukraine.
Several people were killed, according to the Ukrainian government, during strikes that included the use of explosives-packed Shahed-136 drones which detonate upon impact with a target.
The attacks took place barely a month before England – the Government of which has been supplying arms to Ukraine to repel Vladimir Putin's invasion of the country – take on Iran at the World Cup.
