The Miguel Sanó days in Minneapolis have just about reached their end, and in the coming weeks, it will all become official.

Once one of the top prospects in Major League Baseball, Sanó's career in Minnesota will end after an injury-plagued season in which he played in just 20 games. Sanó first sustained a left knee injury during a walk-off celebration on April 26, tearing his meniscus, and after returning from surgery and rehab in late July, he wound up on the injured list with knee inflammation just days later.
