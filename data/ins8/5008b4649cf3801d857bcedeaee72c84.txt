[YONHAP] The government released a plan for Korea's shipbuilding industry emphasizing environmentally friendly vessels and a new handling of skilled worker visas. More workers with non-professional E-9 visas will be allowed to convert to E-7-4 skilled workers visas to work in shipbuilding. With that visa, they can bring their families to Korea and apply for permanent residency. This will apply to people who have worked for a minimum of five years on E-9 visas.
