Less than a week before news emerged that Goldman Sachs would embark on at least the third restructuring of David Solomon's four-year tenure as CEO, the Goldman leader was on stage with Kim Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner. Solomon interviewed both women last week at the firm's annual Builders and Innovators conference, according to people familiar with the matter. It was held at the Montage Healdsburg in Sonoma County, California. At least one member of the musical act The Chainsmokers was also in attendance, the people said.
