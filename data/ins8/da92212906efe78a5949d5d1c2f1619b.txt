Vladimir Zakharov By Rob Isbitts Summary We rate ProShares Short 7-10 Year Treasury (NYSEARCA:TBX) a buy, since we think the bond bear market is not over. This ETF is a rare type of security that allows investors and traders to try to profit directly from a decline in bond prices, due to a rise in interest rates. Strategy TBX is an "inverse ETF," which means it tries to profit from price declines in some investment, not the rise in price of that investment. In this case, the ICE U.S. Treasury 7-10 Year Bond Index is the target.
