Published: 05:27 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 05:27 EDT, 19 October 2022 Tory MPs have suggested a 'quad' of four senior ministers replace Liz Truss as the party struggles to line up a single successor who can unite the party.Backbenchers have suggested that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, his predecessor Rishi Sunak, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt could come together to run the Government. But they admitted that this might be a trouble, with talks between several of the quartet yet to get off the ground amid reports they cannot agree on what roles to take.
