Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Wednesday, building on recent gains even as rampant U.K. inflation pointed to further aggressive monetary tightening ahead.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.

The U.K. consumer price index, already at its highest level for decades, jumped to 10.1% for the month of September, likely pressuring the Bank of England to increase interest rates more aggressively.
