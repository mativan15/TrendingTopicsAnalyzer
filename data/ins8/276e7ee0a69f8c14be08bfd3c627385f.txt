serg3d/iStock Editorial via Getty Images I rate PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares as a Hold. I assessed PYPL's Q4 2021 earnings and outlined my expectations of the company's full-year 2022 outlook in my previous March 24, 2022 write-up for PayPal. PYPL's recent Q1 2022 financial results announcement and the company's meaningful share price correction in recent months have prompted me to publish an update for the stock. My mixed view of PayPal's future prospects provides support for the Hold investment rating assigned to the stock.
