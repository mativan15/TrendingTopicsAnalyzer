U.S. stock futures pointed to a third day of losses for Wall Street as investors parsed through a medley of corporate results and watched bond yields relentlessly move higher.Futures on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) declined 0.6%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased 130 points, or 0.4%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1%. Sizable moves occurred in Treasuries again, with the benchmark 10-year not surging beyond a fresh 2008-high of 4.2%.Despite the past two down days, equities are poised to end the week higher after a rally Monday and Tuesday gave all three major averages a boost and helped the S&P 500 churn out a 4% gain before the index lost its momentum.
