RICHMOND — A state court has tossed an appeal from a man convicted of trying to steal televisions from a retail store in Colonial Heights who claimed that an intent to steal was never proven.

In an opinion released Tuesday, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that sufficient evidence had been provided at trial to convict Danny Myler of petit larceny stemming from the December 2020 incident at Walmart. The appellate court ruled that the testimony of a security guard who watched the suspect try to take the TV sets justified Myler's conviction and that evidence of previous larceny attempts at other retailers was admissable even if the jury was instructed to not consider it in determining guilt on the current charge.
