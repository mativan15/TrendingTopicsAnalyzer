Former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro has been awarded A$715,000 (NZ$791,500) in his high-profile defamation case against Google, after a judge in Australia found he was subjected to a 'relentless and vicious campaign' of cyberbullying that led him to resign from politics prematurely. Barilaro sued the internet giant, which owns YouTube, and political commentator Jordan Shanks in the Federal Court last year over two videos published on the Friendlyjordies channel in 2020 accusing him of corruption.
