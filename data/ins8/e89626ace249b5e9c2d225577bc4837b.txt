SANAA, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Houthi rebels in Yemen said they attacked on Friday a ship trying to "loot oil" in a key government-controlled port in Yemen's southeastern province of Hadramout. "The (Houthi) armed forces announced the implementation of a simple warning strike in order to prevent an oil ship that was trying to loot crude oil in the port of Dhabah in Hadramout Province," Houthi Military Spokesman Yehya Sarea said in a statement broadcast by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV. "The attack was carried out after we sent a warning message to the ship to leave," Sarea said.
