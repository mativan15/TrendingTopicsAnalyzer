The Calgary Flames scored early and often on the way to a 4-3 win over the Edmonton Oilers Saturday night at Rogers Place.
'Individual and system mistakes,' Leon Draisaitl said when asked about the cause of the issues on Saturday. 'Little mistakes that are easy to clean up, but obviously you can't spot a team three goals in back-to-back games.''The response in the second and third periods was better, but when you put yourself down the way we did, it's too big of a hill to climb after being down to that team,' Oilers head coach Jay Woodcroft said.
