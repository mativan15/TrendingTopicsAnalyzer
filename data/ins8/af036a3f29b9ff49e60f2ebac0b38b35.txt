In this edition of Author Talks, McKinsey Global Publishing's Raju Narisetti chats with Rana Foroohar, a CNN analyst and associate editor at the Financial Times, about her new book, Homecoming: The Path to Prosperity in a Post-Global World (Crown Publishing, October 2022). Even before worldwide geopolitical conflicts of recent years highlighted vulnerabilities in the global supply chain, some companies were already beginning to deglobalize trade. Now, between a resurgence of homegrown manufacturing and a rise in stakeholder capitalism, Foroohar says regionalization will be the new economic order.
