Bill Gates wasn't the only investor to make big money betting against Tesla. As it turns out, short-sellers reaped nearly $7 billion in profits from their bets against the electric vehicle manufactures between the start of 2022 and Friday. Data provided by Ortex Research showed that through Friday's session, investors with the temerity to bet against the electric vehicle juggernaut – a trade that has produced painful losses for many a Tesla bear in recent years – had earned $6.8 billion in realized and unrealized gains since the start of 2022.
