Russia's defence industry is likely 'incapable of producing advanced munitions' at the rate they are being expended, according to the latest UK defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine.

'On 10 October 2022, Russia probably fired more than 80 cruise missiles into Ukraine,' the UK ministry of defence tweeted, adding that over half of these projectiles were likely shot down.

'These attacks represent a further degradation of Russia's long-range missile stocks, which is likely to constrain their ability to strike the volume of targets they desire in future,' it said.
