India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.7% in 2021-22 (or FY22) according to the 'provisional estimates' released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Tuesday. This growth comes at the back of a 6.6% contraction in GDP during 2020-21 when the pandemic led to massive disruptions and widespread lockdowns. The GDP measures the value of all 'final' goods and services— those that are bought by the final user— produced in a country in a given period (say a quarter or a year).
