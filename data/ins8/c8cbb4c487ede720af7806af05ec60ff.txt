The dust is settling after Draymond Green's scuffle with Jordan Poole and focus is shifting toward an important deadline for Poole before opening night next Tuesday.The Warriors and Poole have until Oct. 17, this Monday, to come to terms on a contract extension. If the two sides don't come to an agreement, Poole will become a restricted free agent after this season. Comments indicate the Warriors believe Poole — who looks unfazed on the court and off by the altercation — will sign that rookie extension.
