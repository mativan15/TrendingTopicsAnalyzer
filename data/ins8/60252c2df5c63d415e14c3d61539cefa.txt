After receiving an official poster accompanied by a release date, we now have the first trailer for Creed III. The third installment serves as the sequel to 2018's Creed II and the ninth film in the Rocky franchise. It is also interesting to note that Creed III will also be Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut.

Based on a screenplay by Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin, adapted from a story they co-wrote with Ryan Coogler, Creed III chronicles Adonis "Donnie" Creed's rise and places him in a testing situation brought on by his past.
