The Chargers will enter another week with the team's injury list continuing to grow.

COSTA MESA – The injuries have continued to hit the Chargers at a particularly high rate, and last week's game on Monday Night Football was no different.

Wide receiver Joshua Palmer and tight end Donald Parham Jr. each suffered a concussion against the Broncos, putting their status in doubt for the Week 7 game against the Seahawks on Sunday at SoFi Stadium.

This is the second concussion Palmer has had in two months as he was placed in concussion protocol following the Chargers' preseason game against the Cowboys.
