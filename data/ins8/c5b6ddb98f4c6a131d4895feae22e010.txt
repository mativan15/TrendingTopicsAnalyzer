Close to 150 students across multiple disciplines will showcase their scholarship at the Fall 2022 Research Symposium, hosted by Undergraduate Research & Fellowships. The symposium, where students are invited to present their research visually as posters, will take place Friday, October 21, from 10:30 a.m. to noon in Roone Arledge Auditorium.
