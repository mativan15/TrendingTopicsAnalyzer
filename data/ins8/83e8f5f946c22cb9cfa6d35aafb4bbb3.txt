Ethiopia's government said it was seeking a "peaceful resolution" to the conflict even as it announced new strategic objectives. Further peace negotiations are on hold but both sides said they are willing to talk. 

Pro-government forces and rebels from the Tigray region have been fighting for nearly two years
Ethiopia's government said Monday it wants to take control of airports and other federal facilities in the northern Tigray region, claiming it is necessary to seize key infrastructure in the north to protect airspace and distribute humanitarian aid.
