St Helens coach Kristian Woolf admitted his side were made to work hard for their 28-14 victory against Super League strugglers Toulouse.

The Saints avenged last month's shock defeat in Toulouse with a 28-14 win, stretching their lead at the top of the Super League table.

Speaking after the game, Woolf said: 'That was a really tough game, just like the first one. We had to work really hard to get anything out of it.

'We came to play and I always thought we would get on top but it's a tough trip.
