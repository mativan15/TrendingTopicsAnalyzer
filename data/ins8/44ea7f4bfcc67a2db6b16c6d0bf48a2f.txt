Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HRTG) has announced that it will pay a dividend of US$0.06 per share on the 5th of July. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 6.9%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns.

While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Heritage Insurance Holdings' stock price has reduced by 37% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield.
