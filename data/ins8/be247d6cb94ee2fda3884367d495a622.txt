jetcityimage I have been wrong about AT&T (NYSE:T) for years, as the stock continues to decline into uncharted territory. I wish I could say it's a toss-up for the most hated large cap between International Business Machines (IBM) and T, but it's not even close. T's stock makes IBM look attractive, and if I took a poll as to the most hated large cap, there is a good chance T would take the top spot. The bears and bulls have argued the points from T's massive debt load, failed acquisitions, and poor allocations of capital to their massive Free cash Flow [FCF], ability to service debt, and core portfolio strength, but in the end, the ticker tape is the ultimate judge.
