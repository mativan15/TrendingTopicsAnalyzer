Now that Portland-based Rogue Women's Fund proved its thesis with its Fund I, Managing Partner Caroline Lewis is raising a hefty Fund II.

Lewis is targeting $30 million for the fund, which had a first close in August. To ensure the fund is available to a wide swath of accredited investors, she has teamed with innovative fund managers at Chicago-based Vitalize Venture Capital and Baltimore-based RareBreed Ventures. The effort aims to help all three funds and make it easier for small investors to participate.
