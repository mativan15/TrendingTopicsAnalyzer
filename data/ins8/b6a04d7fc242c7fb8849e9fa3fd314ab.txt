The new tech could be offered on other models like the Gold Wing in the future.

Honda has filed a patent for a front-facing camera that would provide data for active riding aids on the Africa Twin CRF1100.

The patent drawings reveal a camera module mounted just below the headlamp cluster. The camera is said to have sensors similar to a smartphone camera. Instead of fixing the module in place, Honda has suspended it to reduce vibrations.

The newly developed tech has its advantages over Radar and Lidar-based systems since it offers light perception like brake lights, etc.
