Half-Life and Doom are two classic shooters that have stood the test of time, but they don't have a lot in common beyond that. Well, one modder has decided to add the peanut butter that is Half-Life to the chocolate of Doom, and the result is a unique mod that's as impressive as it is strange.Modder "LoliKololi" is the mind behind the project. Titled "Half-Life: Another Story," the finished mod will apparently tell the story of a soldier trapped within Black Mesa during the events of the first game.
