The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has urged the Taliban to urgently probe the recent disappearance of journalists and asked to bring the perpetrators to justice. This comes after Afghan journalists, Ali Akbar Khairkhwa and Jamaluddin Deldar, reportedly went missing from Kabul, with their whereabouts unknown since May 24.

Ali Akbar Khairkhwa, a reporter for local newspaper Subh-e-Kabul, and Jamaluddin Deldar, head of Gardiz Voice Radio in Afghanistan's Paktia province, allegedly disappeared in Kabul on May 24.
