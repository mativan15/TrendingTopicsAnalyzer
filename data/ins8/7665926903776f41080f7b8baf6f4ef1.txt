Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag will reportedly have £120million to spend on refreshing the squad this summer. That figure could be boosted, however, with Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Anthony Martial all thought to be eyeing up an exit, and the proceeds would go straight back into the transfer kitty.Having moved from Ajax's well-oiled machine to the bright lights and big money of the Premier League, Ten Hag is expected to have significant cash to play with in this summer's transfer market.
