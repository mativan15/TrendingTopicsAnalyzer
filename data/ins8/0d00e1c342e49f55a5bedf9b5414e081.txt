4kodiak/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a stock I mentioned years ago as a blue-chip value play and possible turnaround candidate. My last bullish article was posted in the summer of 2020. I have not written on the company since then, as growth drivers imploded. For sure, Intel still has some worth with a lower valuation vs. the semiconductor industry and a high dividend yield. But, I would suggest investors continue to look elsewhere for the deployment of new buy capital.
