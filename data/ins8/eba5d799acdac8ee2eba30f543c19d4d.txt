New York CNN Business —

American Airlines expanded on its plan to drop international first-class cabins and replace them with more business class seats.

The move was first disclosed last month and reiterated in a conference call with investors Thursday by Vasu Raja, the company's chief commercial officer, who said the change is in response to customer demand.

'The first class will not exist … at American Airlines for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it,' he said in response to a question.
