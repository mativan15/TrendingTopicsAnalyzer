'I understand that the ticketing can be frustrating. I bought tickets for two of our shows myself just to see what the experience was like,' Hoppus said. 'I had tickets yoinked from my cart and the whole thing crash out. Dynamic pricing. I'm not in charge of it. It's meant to discourage scalpers. We're trying to bring you the best possible show for the best price. This is a tour celebrating new music and the band getting back together. Thank you for your enthusiasm and I hope to see all of you at the shows.
