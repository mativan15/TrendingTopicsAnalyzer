A big challenge with Moderna (MRNA 3.92%) right now is that many investors see it as a COVID-19 stock and not much else. The company is developing more types of COVID vaccines, and its revenue for the foreseeable future will come primarily from Spikevax. Although the COVID vaccine has been a huge success story for Moderna, for forward-looking investors, the business remains full of question marks and uncertainty. 
Last week, the company released news that has the potential to alleviate some of those concerns, and as a result, a wave of bullishness helped to rally the stock.
