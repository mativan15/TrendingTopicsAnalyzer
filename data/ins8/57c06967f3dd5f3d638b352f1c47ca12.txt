The building of a planned waste-to-energy plant proposed near Waimate is predicted to add millions to the district's gross domestic product and create hundreds of jobs across Waimate, Timaru and the Waitaki districts. An economic impact report by Infometrics senior economist Nick Brunsdon, based on information provided by the company planning to build to plant, South Island Resource Recovery Limited (SIRRL), says it would help the Waimate district "diversify, thereby improving its overall economic resilience and potentially reducing commuting.
