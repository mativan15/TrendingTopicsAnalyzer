Housing for all is not just a milestone; it is also an everlasting journey.
– Housing Finance: the foundation of hope!
Housing for all does not limit to only a permanent home.  In my opinion it is much bigger than that. 
We should strive for self-sustaining economic phenomena wherein once we achieve this feat of providing a permanent roof for all the existing citizens without a home, the coming generations should have access to this fundamental and critical need of shelter. We should continue to up-skill our citizens to enable them to afford and self-sustain their expenses going further.
