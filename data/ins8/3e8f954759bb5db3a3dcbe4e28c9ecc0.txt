Gabriel Jesus ' agent, Marcelo Pettinati, has claimed talks will progress over the Manchester City forward's future after the international break in June amid rumours linking him with a move to Arsenal. The 25-year-old has been subject of transfer interest from the Gunners as Mikel Arteta looks to bolster his attacking options this summer. Jesus has been tipped to make the £25million switch to North London following Erling Haaland 's arrival to City, which is set to limit the former's minutes even further.
