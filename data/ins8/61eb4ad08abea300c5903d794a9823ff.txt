Jonathan Kitchen/DigitalVision via Getty Images Since I put out my latest in a long string of cautionary articles on Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX), the shares are down about 41% against a loss of ~10.2% for the S&P 500. I thought I'd check on the stock yet again for several reasons. First, the company has reported earnings since, so those require comment. Second, a stock trading at $17 is, by definition, less risky an investment than when that same stock's trading at $28. I may buck the crowd again, but do it in reverse this time.
