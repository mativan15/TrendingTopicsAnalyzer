Three years after selling much of 21st Century Fox to Walt Disney, Rupert Murdoch is exploring reuniting his U.S news companies, bringing titles like the Wall Street Journal and Fox News under one umbrella.

News Corp., owner of the Journal and the New York Post, and Fox Corp. — which was spun off after Murdoch's $52.4-billion deal with Disney in 2017 — said they had formed a special committee to explore a combination.
