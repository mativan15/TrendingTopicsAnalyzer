The Gratitude & Giving Gala is billed as an elegant, enchanted evening, and the Oct. 29 event benefiting the Foothills Country Hospice is already sold out. "It's one of the main fundraisers," said Debi Hartle, who is co-ordinating the event with a goal of raising $250,000. "We have to raise $1.3 million every year for operational costs, so our gala is one of the biggest fundraisers that we do." It'll take place in Okotoks at the Foothills Centennial Centre, where 450 people have bought tickets, and will feature a silent and live auction.
