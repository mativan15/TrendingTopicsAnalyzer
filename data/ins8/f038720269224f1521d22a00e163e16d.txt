I'm constantly reading space books and have occasionally reviewed them here, in my science column at Forbes. I've decided to launch a series of reviews that will build a Summer 2022 Space Reading List composed of works by friends of mine in the space community. Cover of Don't Blow Yourself Up Homer Hickam Don't Blow Yourself Up – Homer Hickam (Post Hill Press, 2021) Favorite quote from this book: Anyway, being on an airplane that was on fire seemed to be just about what I should have expected at that juncture in my life.
