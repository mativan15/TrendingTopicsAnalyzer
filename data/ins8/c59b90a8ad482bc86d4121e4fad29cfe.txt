Blockchain technology has the potential to be a massive disruptor to the traditional financial services industry, says Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment management giant Franklin Templeton.

Johnson told CoinDesk TV the firm has survived for 75 years because it has been open to adapting its business to new technologies.

'We have to be in the space,' Johnson said of the crypto sector during a special guest appearance at CoinDesk's I.D.E.A.S. 2022 Conference in New York City. 'It's a complicated space, and we probably won't see the payouts in the space for five-plus years, but you have to understand it to ensure that you're developing products that make sense.
