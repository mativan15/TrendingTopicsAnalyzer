Jun. 4—Implementing a new pay plan for county employees is expected to cost approximately $6.6 million.

Based on the financial surplus accrued over the past year, the county still needs to come up with approximately $2.5 million, and it needs to be in recurring dollars.

During a Wilson County Budget Committee meeting on Tuesday, Wilson County Finance Director Aaron Maynard plotted a few possible paths to get there. Those options included a possible tax increase or some combination of transfers between various county funds by using growth revenue.
