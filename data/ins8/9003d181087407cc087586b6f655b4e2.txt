The wave of tech layoffs has reached the supply-chain sector. Flexible-warehousing startup Stord laid off 59 employees — about 8% of its 700-strong workforce — Thursday, the company confirmed to Insider. The layoffs came from multiple business units within the company, a spokesperson said via email. Founded in 2015, Stord is a cloud-based platform that connects hundreds of independent warehouses to a network so shippers can keep inventory close to consumers without leasing space. It began offering trucking and e-commerce-fulfillment services during the pandemic.
