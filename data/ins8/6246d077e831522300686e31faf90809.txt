With Romeo Doubs and Zach Tom both signing their rookie contracts on Thursday, Christian Watson is the only member of the Green Bay Packers' 2022 draft class without a deal. While there is no reason to panic, it is possible that the absence of an agreement could be financially driven.

Under the current collective bargaining agreement, agents are unable to negotiate the length of a rookie contract. All newly drafted players receive a four-year contract, while first-rounders carry a fifth-year team option.
