Popular Wairarapa music event Summer Hummer is returning in December with Kiwi hiphop star Kings headlining. The concert will also feature a range of national and regional artists at Queen Elizabeth Park Sports Ground in Masterton on December 3. Kings will be joined by Wellington act Tin Palace and Wairarapa bands – Deluxe Edition, Sinner Man Saint, Captivated and Dragonfly and local beat boxer, Maceo Field. Trust House Foundation was the main funder of the event, which organisers hoped would once again become an annual fixture.
