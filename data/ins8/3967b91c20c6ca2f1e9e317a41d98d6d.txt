'This series certainly isn't over, and we have bigger goals,' Cole said. 'But I'm definitely having the time of my life and I love it and I can't wait to keep going.'

New York's $324 million man, Cole allowed two runs and struck out eight in beating the Guardians for the second time in six days. He didn't dominate, but Cole kept Cleveland's hitters off base and off balance.

Bader homered for the third time in the best-of-five series, connecting in the second inning off Cal Quantrill, who came in unbeaten in 44 games at Progressive Field.
