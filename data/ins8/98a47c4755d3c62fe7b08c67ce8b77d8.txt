CNN — Moody's Investor Service on Friday changed the United Kingdom government's ratings outlook to "negative" from "stable."Moody's attributed the change in the outlook to "heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid weaker growth prospects and high inflation; and risks to the UK's debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and risk of a sustained weakening in policy credibility."However, the ratings agency affirmed the country's credit rating. The affirmation of the Aa3 rating is a reflection of the UK's economic resilience, Moody's said in a statement.
