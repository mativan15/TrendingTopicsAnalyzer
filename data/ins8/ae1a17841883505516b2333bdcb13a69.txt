(RTTNews) - The manufacturing sector in Indonesia continued to expand in May, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from S&P Global revealed on Wednesday with a manufacturing PMI score of 50.8.

That's down from 51.9 in April, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

This represented a ninth straight month of improving business conditions across the Indonesian manufacturing sector. That said, the pace of improvement was the slowest seen over this period and only marginal.
