An IPS officer who had been evading arrest for around two years in connection with the death of Mahoba-based businessman surrendered before a local court in Lucknow Saturday.
'IPS officer Mani Lal Patidar surrendered before the court today in connection with the case lodged against him in Mahoba district. The court sentenced Patidar to judicial custody,' said government counsel (Lucknow) Abhay Tripathi. In June last year, the UP government announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for nabbing the Rajasthan native and the Uttar Pradesh Police attached his properties following a court directive.
