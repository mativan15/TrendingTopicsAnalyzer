The bitterness that existed between Alycia Baumgardner and Mikaela Mayer throughout the buildup to their super featherweight title fight Saturday at the O2 Arena in London led to a intense, high-contact battle.

It was a back-and-forth fight, with Baumgardner racing out to an early lead by surprisingly using lateral movement and boxing ability. Mikaela got back into the fight in the middle rounds, but Baumgardner changed the momentum down the stretch.
