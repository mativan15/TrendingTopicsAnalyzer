Fresh off his fourth NBA ring and a blockbuster opening night, Golden State Warriors power forward and 4x NBA champion, Draymond Green, will help us kick off the final day of Disrupt in style. Join us tomorrow at 9AM PT at the Disrupt stage in-person, or catch it live on TechCrunch's homepage.
Green has spent the last several years building up his resume off the court, including television production deals and, most famously, his podcast, The Draymond Green Show. Like Green himself, the show has courted some controversy, but it's also offered a rare level of insight into an active NBA player and the various athletes and other legendary sports figures he invites on.
