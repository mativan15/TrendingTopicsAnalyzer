Wichita's interim police chief said Monday he plans to seek an increase in his overtime budget to put more officers on the street after the department responded to eight shootings over the holiday weekend.

Three people died Saturday night — two in shootings and one in a hit-and-run accident.

'The amount of officers we have on the street cannot withstand that type of violence and incidents in the city without affecting response times and affecting other calls,' interim chief Lem Moore said at a news conference.
