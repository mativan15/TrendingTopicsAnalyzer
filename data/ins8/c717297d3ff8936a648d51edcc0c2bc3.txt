Former President Trump endorsed venture capitalist Blake Masters in the GOP Senate primary in Arizona on Thursday, siding with tech billionaire and Republican mega-donor Peter Thiel, who has already spent millions of dollars to boost Masters.
In a lengthy statement announcing his endorsement, Trump praised Masters as a 'great modern-day thinker' and 'one of the most successful businessmen and investors in the Country.' He also made clear another reason for his endorsement: Masters's support for Trump's false claim that widespread voter fraud robbed him of reelection in 2020.
