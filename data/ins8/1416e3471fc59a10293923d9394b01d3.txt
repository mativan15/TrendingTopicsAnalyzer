(Bloomberg) -- Spain took a further step toward becoming a clean energy hub after its regulator reassured potential investors of a level playing field in renewable power and green hydrogen, according Enagas SA.Last week, the country's antitrust regulator recommended that Enagas keep its green hydrogen interests separate from its gas transport business. While the watchdog's intervention won't immediately transform the investment environment, it shows Spain is starting to develop a regulatory framework for its nascent hydrogen industry, said Enagas Chief Executive Officer Arturo Gonzalo.
