The Wrap Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has spent 15 years developing his superhero film 'Black Adam' which finally hits theaters on Friday, and based on the reviews, critics found the superhero film 'underwhelming,' 'super messy' and 'baffling.'In his review of the film, TheWrap's Alonso Duralde wrote, 'That task is the capture of an exceedingly powerful ancient metahuman known as Teth Adam (Dwayne Johnson), and despite the movie's best efforts to jazz up the increasingly predictable superhero genre — this one doesn't care if he kills people — 'Black Adam' feels like both too much and not enough, and none of its narrative gambits are helped by a sludgy visual style that's either distractingly artificial or dispiritingly gloomy, except when it manages to be both.
