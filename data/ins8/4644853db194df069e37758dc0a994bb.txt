JPMorgan Chase & Co. will leave a downtown Portland office tower, but it won't go far.

With its Pioneer Tower lease expiring, the multinational bank (NYSE: JPM) plans to move about 40 workers to PacWest Center, executives said Tuesday, and the financial institution will keep roughly the same amount of space, though the specific square footage wasn't available during an interview.

The relocation within the city's core follows announcements in the past two years by local competitors Umpqua Bank and Unitus Community Credit Union that they will move to the Portland suburbs.
