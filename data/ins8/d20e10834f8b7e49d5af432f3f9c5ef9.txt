Expect little upside to shares of Best Buy in the near term as deflation returns to consumer electronics, Evercore ISI said. Analyst Greg Melich downgraded shares of the retailer to in line from an outperform rating, saying in a note to clients Wednesday that he expects comparable store sales — a key metric for retailers — to turn negative into the new year. "In other words, two years of counter-normative inflationary support is now rolling off, and comes at a time when traffic is falling," Melich said.
