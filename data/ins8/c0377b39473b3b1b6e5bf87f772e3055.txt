Nationwide staffing shortages continue to impact the nation's small businesses, including Polar Cave Ice Cream Parlor in Mashpee, Massachusetts. During an appearance on "Fox & Friends" on Tuesday, owner Mark Lawrence shared that he's having a particularly hard time staffing his Cape Cod business for the summer. Right now, he has only five employees. "I should have at least 10 to 12 by now," he said. "After school lets out, we normally have 20 employees. It's just very hard to find them," he said.
