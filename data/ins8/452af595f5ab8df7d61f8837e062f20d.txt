On Tuesday, a horrific but familiar story unfolded: a disturbed 18-year-old traveled to Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where he used a legally purchased assault rifle to murder 21 people: 19 children and two teachers. Before the dust had settled over the Texas border town, the conversation quickly turned to the prevention of future shootings. Schools across Texas promised increased security and new protective measures.But how do you protect against a phenomenon that often seems as pitiless and arbitrary as a bolt of lightning? For years, some have insisted that the best strategy is to adopt new security measures and invest in emergent surveillance technologies—the hope being that new products paired with hyper-vigilance will identify and stop the next shooter before he pulls the trigger.
