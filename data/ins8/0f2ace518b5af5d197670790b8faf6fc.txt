In one of the earlier scenes of the 1973 film Saudagar, Nutan's Majubi requests Amitabh Bachchan's Moti for higher wages as she is paid peanuts for her labour in his jaggery business, even though her contribution to his business is of paramount importance. But like many employee-employer relationships, she is asked to explain why she needs a raise. The woman is earnest, honest and in desperate need of some additional cash but Moti promptly questions, ‘Why does a single woman like you need more money?'
It is this scene that sets the tone for Sudhendu Roy's Saudagar where the society assumes that women are cheap labour, and if she happens to work in her husband's business, then it is a great chance to exploit her without paying any wages.
