Russian stocks may have "no value" compared to the prices listed on the Moscow Exchange, new research from MSCI has suggested.Moscow ceased trading after stocks capitulated on the back of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reopening a month later after the exchange's longest shutdown since the fall of the Soviet Union. The Moscow Exchange also had its recognized status revoked by many international powers.The MOEX Russia Index is down more than 36% year-to-date as of Friday afternoon, and international investors in Russian securities have endured restrictions in managing and valuing their positions since the war began.
