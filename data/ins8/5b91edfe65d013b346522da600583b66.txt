Firms fear an 'energy cliff-edge' after the UK government announced a reversal of mini-budget pledges and a review of the energy support package.

Newly-appointed chancellor Jeremy Hunt declared a U-turn on the mini-budget, announced in September, following market turmoil.

Hunt said he intended to reverse 'almost all' of the tax measures set out in the government's Growth Plan, including planned cuts to corporation tax and income tax, claiming this would save the UK £32bn a year. However, planned cuts to stamp duty and National Insurance will still go ahead.
