RHJ/iStock via Getty Images Vale (NYSE:VALE) is reconsidering a near-term spinoff of its base metals business and an eventual public listing, ring-fencing the copper and nickel unit from the iron ore business, CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo said Friday. Rather than selling all or part of the base metals unit, the idea now is to eventually grow the business as big as Vale (VALE) today, which has a market cap of $66B, and take it to the public market, Bartolomeo told a Financial Times mining conference, without providing details on timing.
