Consumerism and profligacy come under fire in 'Shopomania: How to talk about our Possession Obsession.' Author Paul Berton, editor-in-chief of the Hamilton Spectator, coins a series of 'shoponyms' to guide us through a consumer culture that has grown exponentially over the last decades. This excerpt is from the chapter 'Convershopping: Conversations About Shopping.'

Listen carefully: What do you hear? At dinner parties, at art shows, at the watercooler, at the ballpark? In the halls of justice and the houses of government? On factory floors and in office elevators?

Is it talk about politics or religion or philosophy? No.
