Garuda Aerospace and Lockheed Martin Canada CDL Systems have signed a pact to integrate the Indian company's locally-made drones with the latter's advanced Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) software solutions for defence and commercial purposes. Under the partnership, the companies will work closely to explore opportunities to develop drone-based service applications in sectors such as defence, agriculture, mining, large-scale mapping and industrial inspection. Uncrewed Systems are vehicles - aerial, terrestrial, or marine - and associated elements, such as sensors and communications software, that can execute data-collection missions without a human presence aboard.
