A swath of the metro's eastern portion contains 130,000 people who earn an average of 70% or less of the state's median income, which means most banks aren't beating a path to the area to open new branches.

That's exactly why the founders of WeDevelopment Federal Credit Union wanted to set up shop in the economically distressed area.

After 13 years of study, fundraising and planning, it will cut the ribbon on its first branch at 3123 Prospect Ave. at 8 a.m. Saturday. With a grand opening coming in a few weeks and full operations expected by December, the credit union will serve residents who live, work or worship in an area that generally stretches from the Missouri River south to 85th Street and from Troost Avenue east to Interstate 435.
