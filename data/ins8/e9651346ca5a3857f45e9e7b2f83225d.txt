An Oregon man's difficult sleep after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting led him to give away his guns to local authorities.

Ben Beers, a resident of Hillsboro, Oregon, called for action on gun violence and shared his experience giving his firearms away on TikTok. Beers' action comes after 19 children and two teachers died in a school shooting on Tuesday, the deadliest school shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012.

Beers said he gave his AR-15 and handgun to the Hillsboro Police Department in Oregon.
