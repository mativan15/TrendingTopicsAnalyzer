While IT budgets are set to increase for most CIOs next year, after inflation, the real-dollar value of those budgets will be less than this year.
A Gartner survey of over 2,000 CIOs found that nominal IT budgets are set to increase by 5.1% globally and 4.8% in North America.
'Funding for digital isn't really ‘falling' in a nominal sense, it's just that its rate of increase isn't keeping up with inflation,' said Gartner analyst Andy Rowsell-Jones. He cited CFO pessimism about future trading conditions and a lack of tech resources as reasons that are leading many organizations to reign in spending.
