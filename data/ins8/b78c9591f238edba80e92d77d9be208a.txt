Delhi is soon going to get 100 more electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal while inaugurating 11 high-tech low-cost stations at Indraprastha Metro station Tuesday.
The 11 charging stations were launched as part of a larger project to establish 100 more charging stations across the city. The main aim behind it is to push the public to shift to EVs and make Delhi pollution free as well as the EV capital of India.

दिल्ली बहुत तेज़ी से E-Vehicle पर शिफ़्ट हो रही है। आज से दिल्ली में 11 और इलेक्ट्रिक चार्जिंग स्टेशन शुरू हो रहे हैं। https://t.
