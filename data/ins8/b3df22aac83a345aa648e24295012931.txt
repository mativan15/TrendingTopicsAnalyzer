In Britain, another day of judgment in the financial markets draws closer.

Monday morning will bring the first opportunity for investors to give their verdict on the government's rapidly changing plans for the nation's public finances. And crucially, it will be the first trading session since the central bank ended a program that spent billions of pounds supporting the bond market through recent turbulence.

Over the weekend, Britain's new top finance official, Jeremy Hunt, sought to reassure markets, the public and fellow members of the Conservative Party that he can restore the government's fiscal credibility.
