Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief A. Revanth Reddy turned emotional during his campaign in Munugode urging people to reject the money politics of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said the Congress can no way match in the ugly distribution of money to ‘buy' votes. With tear-filled eyes, he said the only way Congress can distribute money is by looting. 'Don't expect us to distribute the money as we can't match the BJP and TRS in the money politics,' he said as he pleaded with the people to save democracy.
