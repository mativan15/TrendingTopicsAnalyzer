Joe RaedleI did an initial-interest post about Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) back in June of 2020. In that article, I discussed the compelling unit economics of their subscription division but decided that the company's share price was far too high to justify an investment. The stock is down 87% since my article, due to deterioration in the hardware division and poor investor sentiment. The subscription division, however, is stronger than ever. PTON now boasts nearly 3mm connected fitness subscribers and is generating 67% gross margins on subscription revenue.
