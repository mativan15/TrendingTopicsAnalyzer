Chandigarh: In the mid-1980s, Malkit Singh's 'tutak tutak tutiya' introduced shades of rap for the first time in Punjabi music. Lyricist Veer Rahimpuri wrote the song, which was closer to Bhangra. It did not really have rhythmic chants of rap also called hip-hop, the genre which gained popularity in the 1970s in the inner-city parties of the African-Americans in New York.
