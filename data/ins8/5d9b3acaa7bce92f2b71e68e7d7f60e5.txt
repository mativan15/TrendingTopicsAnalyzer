JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's government is preparing to issue government bonds using a blockchain technology platform, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) said on Wednesday.

Implementation of advanced technologies such as blockchain, the TASE said, would reduce costs, shorten the duration issuance and clearing of government bonds, improve transparency and mitigate risks.

The issuance is still in the planning stage and the Finance Ministry and TASE are examining an application for the sale of digital government bonds on a blockchain platform.
