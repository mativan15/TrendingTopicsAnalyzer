Oct. 15—With the holiday season quickly approaching, it is a good time to remind citizens of the potential for scams, including scams involving gift cards.

The Federal Trade Commission states, "as soon as someone tells you to pay them with a gift card, that's a scam. Gift cards are popular with scammers because they're easy for people to find and buy. They are more like cash, once they have the gift card number and the PIN, they have your money."

Scammers may tell different stories to get you to pay them with gift cards, including: — That it is urgent and pressures you into acting quickly so you don't have time to talk to someone you trust.
