Marco Island Police seek the public's help in identifying the perpetrators involved in an on-site scam about six weeks ago.

On Sept. 2, officers responded to the Bank of America in the 600 block of Bald Eagle Drive after receiving a suspicious activity call.

The Investigations Unit determined the suspects placed an "out of order" sign in the drive-thru window redirecting customers to the walk-up ATM.
