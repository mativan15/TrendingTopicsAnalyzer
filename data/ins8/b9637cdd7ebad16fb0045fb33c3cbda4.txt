The number of business insolvencies in New Brunswick and across the country is starting to creep back up again after being lower than normal during the pandemic, according to March and first quarter of 2022 data from the national Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. Two businesses in New Brunswick filed for bankruptcy in March, bringing the total to seven insolvencies for the first quarter of the year.The businesses include two corporations and five individual businesses — meaning a person who has incurred at least half of their total liabilities from running a business.
