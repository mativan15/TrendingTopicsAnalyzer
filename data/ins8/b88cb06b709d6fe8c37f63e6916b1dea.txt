The growth in the value and volume of currency in circulation slowed in the last fiscal from a year earlier as the authorities focus on promoting online cash transfer. The value of Rs 2,000 notes in circulation fell to 13% of total value in FY22 from 17% in the preceding fiscal as the Reserve Bank of India stopped indenting of the highest denomination. The value and volume of banknotes in circulation rose by 9.9% and 5% respectively in FY22 as compared with 16.8% and 7.2% respectively in the preceding fiscal, RBI data showed.
