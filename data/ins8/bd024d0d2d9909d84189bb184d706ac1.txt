Kimberley Walsh has revealed that Girls Aloud may never perform again as she thinks it would be ‘too painful' for them to reunite as a band following member Sarah Harding's death last September.
Harding died of breast cancer aged just 39 in 2021, and Kimberley spoke about how she and fellow Girls Aloud stars Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and Nadine Coyle have been able to come together since to do ‘some really positive fundraising for charity'
Speaking to hosts Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary about Harding, Kimberley revealed that the band had no plans to mark 20 years since their debut single Sound of the Underground was released in December.
