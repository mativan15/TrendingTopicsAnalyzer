Pace suburban bus service is proposing permanently cutting dozens of suspended routes and expanding joint Pace-CTA passes in the coming year.

The proposals are part of the agency's 2023 budget, which will undergo public hearings this week and next. Pace is proposing a $303.4 million suburban service budget, a $72.4 million capital program and $238.5 million for paratransit services, provided to people unable to take other types of CTA or Pace service because of a disability or health condition.

Pace is proposing additional changes to passes, after a revamped regional transit pass was introduced earlier this year that allowed some Metra commuter rail riders unlimited rides on Pace and CTA.
