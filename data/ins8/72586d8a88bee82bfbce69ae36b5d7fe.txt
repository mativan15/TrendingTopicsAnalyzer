After each episode of House of the Dragon, HBO's prequel to Game of Thrones, Slate writers gather to answer an age-old question: Who is the worst person in Westeros? This week, senior editors Sam Adams and Rebecca Onion answer the call.  Sam Adams: Welcome back, Rebecca! Or maybe I should be the one getting welcomed. For various reasons, I'd ended up taking a little break from House of the Dragon, leaving off about halfway through Episode 6, and I found I didn't miss it at all, which in pre-professional times was traditionally my cue to drop a show altogether.
