In an old video that recently resurfaced on Twitter and made shockwaves through the Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets Twitterverse, Duke forward Paolo Banchero admitted his disdain for the Thunder as he grew up in Seattle, the home of the Seattle Supersonics.
'I grew up with the Sonics a little bit. I was like six (years old) when they left. So I never liked the Thunder,' said Banchero in the 10-second clip that went viral.
