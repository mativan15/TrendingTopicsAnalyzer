Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi insisted he is pleased with his striking options as his side prepare to host Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Tuesday.Brighton had a promising start to the season, but have lost their last two matches – against Brentford and Tottenham – and failed to find the net in either game.However, the manager insisted that a new striker is not required at the south coast club.'I am happy about my strikers, I don't want to speak about how the strikers didn't score because I think there are 11 players who have to attack, who have to defend,' said De Zerbi.
