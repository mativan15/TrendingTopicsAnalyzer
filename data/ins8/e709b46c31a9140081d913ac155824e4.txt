Actor Vineet Kumar Singh made a mark in the movies when he appeared in 2017's Mukkabaaz but despite the critical acclaim, Vineet's success did not translate into many film offers. In a recent chat, Vineet said that he had expected his fortune to change after the Anurag Kashyap directorial but it did not happen because the industry is driven more by box office numbers than good performances.
In an interview on Unfiltered by Samdish, the actor said that more than one's surname, or their performance, it is their box office record that matters.
