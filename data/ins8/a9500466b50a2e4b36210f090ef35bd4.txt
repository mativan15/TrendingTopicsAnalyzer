New York Jets receiver Elijah Moore hasn't enjoyed a sophomore breakout yet despite his team's 4-2 record.

Moore has just 16 receptions for 203 yards and no touchdowns through the first six weeks of the season and is coming off a game in which he didn't see a single target from Zach Wilson. He also played a season-low 32 snaps in New York's 27-10 win over the Green Bay Packers (though that number was second among receivers for the Jets).

The lack of production from Moore hasn't affected the Jets' ability to win games, but the second-year wideout isn't too thrilled with his stat line.
