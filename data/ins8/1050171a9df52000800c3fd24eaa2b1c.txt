Without incumbent Mike Layton's name on the ballot and a bounty of high-profile progressive candidates in an arms race to take over his seat, University-Rosedale is shaping up to be a ward to watch in the municipal election. In July, Layton – who has represented the ward for 12 years – announced he would not be seeking re-election. At the time, he said he would be stepping away from politics to focus on fighting climate change and spending more time with his family. Layton is among a group of seven incumbents who have chosen not to run in this election.
