The Capital's air quality index (AQI) deteriorated slightly and continued to be in the 'poor' category on Tuesday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Meanwhile, the Delhi government started spraying bio-decomposer solution in paddy fields in the city to reduce stubble burning. The government first used the solution in 2020 and then again in the following year.
