Health and Finance Minister Harish Rao lashed out at BJP leaders for 'daydreaming to deceive the people of Nalgonda', who are known for their struggles and movements, including the historic ‘Telangana Rythanga Poratam'. But, it would be foolishness even to dream about deceiving the people, he said.At a press conference held in Hyderabad on Sunday, he reminded the party on how farmers across the country rebelled against the BJP government at the Centre following its new farm laws in a bid to hand over the sector to corporate companies.
