James Corden has reportedly issued an apology to a restaurant owner who accused the TV personality of treating his staff badly. 
The Late Late Show host is said to have dined at the famous Balthazar restaurant in New York City, owned by successful restaurateur Keith McNally. 
According to McNally, Corden, 44, was ‘abusive' towards his employees over a wrong food order and allegedly demanded two rounds of free drinks to make for it. 
As a result, the comedian was banned from the restaurant with McNally also claiming the star behaved poorly at another of his eateries.
