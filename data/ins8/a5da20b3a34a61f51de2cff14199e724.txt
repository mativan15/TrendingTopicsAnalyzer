The spinoff of Wells Fargo & Co.'s (NYSE: WFC) asset management business, Allspring Global Investments, has opened its new Charlotte headquarters.

The global asset management firm, formerly based in San Francisco, selected Charlotte for its headquarters due to the city's position as a key financial hub. The corporate office is on the third floor at 1415 Vantage Park Drive, in the West Tower of mixed-use development Vantage South End.

Until about a year ago, Allspring was the asset management arm of Wells Fargo, the company says.
