The effect inflation is having on the price of goods and services is creating tough decisions for Fredericton city staff.In the past year, the cost of some contracted projects have doubled, forcing staff to cancel them, while jobs typically outsourced are being planned to be done in-house to save on money, said Dylan Gamble, director of engineering and operations with the city.While tenders for goods and materials have gone up between 10 and 30 per cent over what was originally budgeted, tenders for services have gone up even higher, he said.
