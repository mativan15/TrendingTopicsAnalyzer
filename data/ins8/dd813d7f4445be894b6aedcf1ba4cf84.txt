Communist veteran and former Kerala chief minister V S Achuthanandan turned 99 Thursday, October 20. The veteran who straddled the state's socio-political life as VS has been keeping away from active politics for the last four years after suffering a stroke.
VS served as the chief minister of Kerala for a term from 2006 to 2011 and as Opposition leader for three terms — 1991-1996, 2001-2006 and 2011-2016. The mass leader, a rare one to attain cult status in state politics, was also the chairman of the state administrative reforms commission between 2016 and 2021 during the previous regime of the Left Democratic Front (LDF).
