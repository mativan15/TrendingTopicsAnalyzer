Hansi Flick manager Germany World Cup 2022

Germany head into World Cup 2022 with Hansi Flick as manager, who succeeded the long-reigning Joachim Low last year.

Low led the German national team from 2006 until Euro 2020, when he stepped down in the wake of a last 16 exit to England.

Flick came in to fill the shoes of the man who he was a long-time assistant to; the pair worked together until Flick departed after the triumphant 2014 World Cup campaign.

Germany won eight consecutive games after Hansi Flick was appointed manager and wrapped up qualification easily, finishing with nine wins from 10 games and nine points clear of second-placed North Macedonia in their group.
