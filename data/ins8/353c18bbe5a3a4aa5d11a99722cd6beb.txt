If you're hunting hot deals in the market these days, simply looking for stocks at 52-week lows may not be enough given how overpriced stocks were a year ago. Instead, you may want to consider stocks that are trading near multi-year lows.
Two such stocks to consider right now are Medtronic (MDT 1.62%) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA -0.56%). These businesses have solid fundamentals, and although they have been struggling of late, investors shouldn't count them out just yet.
