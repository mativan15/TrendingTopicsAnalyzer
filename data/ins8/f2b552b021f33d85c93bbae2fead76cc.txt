UPDATED: Federal prosecutors have recommended that Steve Bannon be sentenced to six months in prison for flouting a subpoena issued last year by the January 6th Committee.

	Bannon is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday after a jury in July found him guilty of contempt of Congress charges. 

	The minimum sentence is 31 days, but in a filing on Monday, prosecutors wrote that Bannon 'has pursued a bad faith strategy of defiance and contempt' to warrant a maximum penalty.
