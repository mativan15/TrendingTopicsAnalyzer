Rutgers field hockey moved up one spot in the latest rankings, this as the women's soccer took a bit of an undeserved tumble in their own national ranking.
Field hockey, despite a 4-3 loss at No. 2 Maryland on Sunday, still managed to move up one spot in this week's National Field Hockey Coaches Association poll. No. 19 Rutgers (7-7, 3-4 Big Ten) is at No. 12 Syracuse this weekend as their regular season closes out with three ranked opponents in as many games before the Big Ten Tournament takes place in Columbus, OH.
