Really curious to see who the Jazz hire to coach Quin Snyder just because that roster is such a time bomb. Do you make a last-ditch effort to save this era with someone a bit splashier? Or hire a younger coach with the idea that there are probably some lean years ahead? – 5:45 PM

I'm guessing Quin Snyder takes a year off and then replaces Gregg Popovich in San Antonio.
