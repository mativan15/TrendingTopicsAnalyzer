A UK-based travel agent is facing serious jail time after admitting to defrauding family, friends, and clients out of millions. Lyne Barlow, 39, previously of Stanley, County Durham, has been charged with 10 counts of fraud and money laundering related to loans, investments, and holiday sales.

Barlow's heist started with friends and family, whose savings she used before setting up an independent travel agency. The agency then fraudulently sold holidays, in many cases, at unbelievably low prices.
