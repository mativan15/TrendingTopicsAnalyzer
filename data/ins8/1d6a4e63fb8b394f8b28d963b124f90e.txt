A Fresno judge plans to hear arguments next month in the ongoing fight over the sale of the Tower Theatre.

As expected, Adventure Church leaders will ask the court to block the City of Fresno's $6.5 million purchase of the historic theater at Olive and Wishon Avenues in the heart of Fresno's Tower District, according to Fresno County Superior Court records.

The theater has been a flashpoint of controversy for more than a year after Adventure Church's plans to purchase the building became public.
