Social media users should be barred from live streaming unless they have a set number of subscribers to prevent 'lone wolf' terrorists glorifying their killings online, says Ofcom.
In the first study of its kind, the watchdog investigated how 18-year-old Payton Gendron's film of his shooting spree in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in May in which he killed 10 people spread from a live-streaming site watched by just 28 people to an audience of millions.
The 'live' film was removed within two minutes by the site Twitch but in that time all it took was for one of those 22 people to copy it and post it onto a little-known video site Streamable where, thanks to links posted on much larger sites, it was then viewed more than three million times within minutes.
