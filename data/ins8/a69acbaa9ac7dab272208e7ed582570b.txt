Manchester United have been given more encouragement to pursue Frenkie de Jong. Reports in Spain claim the 25-year-old is now officially on the market, with Barcelona in need of selling in order to solve their financial situation. And when it comes to reuniting the midfielder with Erik ten Hag, that bodes well.Manchester United weren't in the running to sign De Jong when he left Ajax for Barcelona back in the summer transfer window of 2019.But they're now extremely interested in landing the Netherlands international following the appointment of Ten Hag.
