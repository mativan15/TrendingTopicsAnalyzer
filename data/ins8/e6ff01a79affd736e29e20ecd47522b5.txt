Buenos Aires-based FilmSharks Int'l has snapped up worldwide rights to Portugal's first stop motion animated feature 'My Grandfather's Demons,' the debut animated pic by Nuno Beato. According to FilmSharks CEO Guido Rud, it was able to outbid other contenders for the toon, which had its world premiere at Annecy. 'One of the hardest tasks for my acquisition team, run by Santiago Migdal, is to find a true animation gem, not only aesthetically but narratively where the use of different animation techniques makes the story fly even higher,' said Rud.
