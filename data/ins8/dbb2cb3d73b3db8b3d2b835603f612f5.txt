Writer of rock songs, screenplays and travel stories Shehan Karunatilaka has won the 2022 Booker Prize for his 'daring' novel The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida. The searing title is set among the mayhem of the Sri Lankan civil war, and was described by the chair of judges, Neil MacGregor, as being a 'metaphysical thriller, an afterlife noir that dissolves the boundaries not just of different genres, but of life and death, body and spirit, east and west'. The book takes the reader on a rollercoaster journey from life to death, and explores themes of joy, tenderness, love and loyalty.
