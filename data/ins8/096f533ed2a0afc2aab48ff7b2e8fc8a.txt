Liz Truss is facing off against Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions.

Earlier a Tory MP said the prime minister was in the last 'chance chance saloon' as he warned she might have to soon quit.

Steve Double, who represents Newquay, made the comments in an interview this morning, becoming the sixth Conservative MP to publicly call for the prime minister to quit.

'I think her position is becoming increasingly untenable,' he told Times Radio.

'I think it's becoming abundantly clear when you look at the loss of confidence in her as prime minister from the general public, and increasingly I think the loss of confidence in her from the parliamentary party, that we are going to get to the point where she really does have to consider her position and for the good of the country, step aside, and I think we will probably come to that place quite soon.
