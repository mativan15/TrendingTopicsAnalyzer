Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said it has been seen in the last two decades that the gap between the internal and external security is reducing and a country's independent media, judiciary, NGOs and dynamic democracy can be misused to destroy its security. Addressing the second convocation of the Rashtriya Raksha University at Lavad village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district, Singh also stressed on the need for state agencies to work in an integrated manner. With the changing times, there has been a tremendous change in security dimensions, he said.
