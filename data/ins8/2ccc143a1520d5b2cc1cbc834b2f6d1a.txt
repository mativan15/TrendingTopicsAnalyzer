The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education's board on Thursday asked the commonwealth for more money, enabling it to freeze undergraduate tuition for a fifth straight year and to educate students preparing for careers in fields with significant labor shortages.

PASSHE requested an additional $21 million, an increase of 3.8% from the $552.5 million allocated by the state in its 2022-23 budget, to keep tuition at the same rate amid rising inflation. The system has maintained tuition for in-state undergraduate students at $7,716 for four consecutive years.
