Scott Olson The headache for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders stemming from Elon Musk's bid for Twitter (TWTR) is far from over, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Ives said that the $44B price tag for the social media player is 'simply a train wreck' and about $14B above what he sees as fair value. Indeed, Musk himself said during the automaker's earnings call on Wednesday that he, and other investors, 'are obviously overpaying for Twitter.' While Musk has already sold billions worth of Tesla (TSLA) stock to help fund the deal, the shaky outside financing of the blockbuster deal should have investors in the EV leader apprehensive, according to Ives.
