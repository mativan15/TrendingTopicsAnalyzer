Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms underscored its commitment to the Metaverse, announcing that its old familiar stock symbol FB – for Facebook, the company's old name – will change to META on June 9. Shares of the company that also owns Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp said the new Nasdaq ticker 'aligns with the company's rebranding.'
Facebook announced the corporate name change last October, unveiling plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on what Zuckerberg called 'the next chapter of social connection' but Wall Street worries may be a sinkhole.
