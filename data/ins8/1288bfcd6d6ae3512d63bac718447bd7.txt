Shares of GameStop (GME -8.59%) were tumbling almost 9.6% in morning trading Tuesday after a pre-holiday week that saw its shares gain nearly 50%. The video game retailer's stock was down to $124.01 at 10:48 a.m. ET today.
There was no news to account for the big drop in the stock, but the same was true last week, either. It's a volatile meme stock that trades more on internet and social media chatter than on the value of the business.

So what
GameStop is still a heavily shorted stock with about a quarter of its shares sold short, so it's likely that a lot of short-sellers were covering their positions last week, helping to lift the retailer's stock.
