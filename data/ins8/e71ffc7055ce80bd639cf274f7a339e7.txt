Apple could be the next bellwether to feel the boomerang effect from elevated pandemic spending as it prepares to report results for the calendar third quarter. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi said the quarter's earnings historically have not been that important, but that more attention has usually been paid to Apple's forward guidance and commentary. He's worried that it might become clear the iPhone maker benefited from lockdown spending habits and could be susceptible to weaker spending as consumers shift their focus from goods to services and grow tired of big ticket purchases.
