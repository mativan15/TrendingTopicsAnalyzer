Myanmar's military regime and its rival, the pro-democracy National Unity Government, both said Thursday that they were investigating two explosions and gunfire at Insein Prison that killed eight and injured 18, mostly civilians.

The unprecedented attack Wednesday at the notorious prison, where hundreds of political prisoners are being held, took place at a building where family members deliver packages for inmates and lawyers and witnesses are processed to enter the prison for court hearings.

Immediately after the explosions, gunfire erupted from a prison watchtower, according to witnesses, who said that it caused some of the deaths and injuries.
