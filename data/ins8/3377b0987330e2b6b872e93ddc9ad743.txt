Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor walked into Tuesday night's City Council meeting with a six-point "anti-corruption reform plan."

She walked out without most of her colleagues on the Council — the same five members who a civil grand jury suggested in a bombshell report last week were too close to the San Francisco 49ers — signing onto a key part to her blueprint, the creation of an independent ethics commission.

"I think I think it's going to be very difficult for members up here to objectively respond to the grand jury report when they're the subject of the grand jury report," Gillmor said in defense of her proposal to create such a commission, which would be made up of volunteers from the community and who would have the "power to censure and admonish wrongdoing.
