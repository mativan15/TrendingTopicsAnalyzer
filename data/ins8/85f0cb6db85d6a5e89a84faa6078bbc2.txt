The Mary Ferrell Foundation—which boasts the largest online collection of John F. Kennedy assassination records—filed a lawsuit against President Joe Biden as well as the National Archives Wednesday to push the U.S. government to give up the rest of the documents it has on the leader's 1963 Dallas murder. This lawsuit comes about a year after Biden delayed the last release of 16,000 records gathered under the 1992 President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. About 70 percent of these sensitive documents are managed by the CIA, with 23 percent being controlled by the FBI, Mary Ferrell Foundation Vice President Jefferson Morley told NBC News.
