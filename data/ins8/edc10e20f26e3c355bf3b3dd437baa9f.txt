Peter Shilton has slammed Boris Johnson for ignoring his pleas over a ban on betting firms sponsoring football shirts. The Government is believed to be considering 'watering down' proposals to clamp down on gambling advertising in football as it prepares to publish a White Paper later this month. England legend Shilton, a self-confessed gambling addict, wrote to the Prime Minister and hand-delivered his letter to Downing Street in September urging the Government to take action. Shilton says he has not even had a reply despite support from former England team mate Gary Lineker and is growing increasingly concerned the Government may be about to back track.
