Belarus could be edging closer towards more active participation in Russia's war in Ukraine.

Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko recently announced that troops from Belarus and Russia would form a new joint regional grouping near the border between Belarus and Ukraine. Lukashenko claimed this step was justified to defend Belarus from attack by Ukraine.

He claimed Kyiv was being encouraged to do this by Ukraine's supporters in the west. It follows military exercises held in September conducted by Belarusian forces near its border with Poland.
