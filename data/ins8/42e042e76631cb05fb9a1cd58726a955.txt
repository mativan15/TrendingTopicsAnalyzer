A small business owner in Provo, Utah, is hanging onto all of his employees in tough economic times — and rather than letting people go during today's inflation and labor shortage, he's retraining them as needed and investing in them in order to keep his business as strong as possible.  It's a commitment to employees that's noteworthy — and speaks to employer values beyond the raw numbers."What we're doing is actually investing more into the employees that we have," said owner Chad Pritchard of Fat Daddy's Pizzeria in Provo.
