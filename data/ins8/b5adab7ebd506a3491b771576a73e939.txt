A spokesperson for the College of Emergency medicine said the increased overcrowding at Middlemore Hospital is predictable, and 'has been coming for almost a decade'. Doctor John Bonning told RNZ's Morning Report the overcrowding and long wait times at the south Auckland hospital was experiencing was 'not some Covid blip'. 'The massive overcrowding in EDs is mirrored all over the country, certainly in every emergency department,' Dr John Bonning told RNZ's Morning Report on Tuesday. 'We're seeing full waiting rooms, full beds, patients in corridors, patients that can't even get out of the ambulance because of no physical space,' he said.
