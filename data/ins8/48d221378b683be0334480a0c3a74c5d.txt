Rosemary Penwarden has been driving the self-converted electric car for the past three years and says that building the vehicle is one of the "best things I've ever done". The project took around eight months and £12,500 to complete.A New Zealand native, Ms Penwarden bought a 1993 wreck to act as the basis for the EV and enlisted the help of a friend, Hagen Bruggemann, a refrigeration engineer who assisted Penwarden in converting her automobile to electric power.They removed the original combustion engine herself and replaced it with an electric motor and gearbox.
