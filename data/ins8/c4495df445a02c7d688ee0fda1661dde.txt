The Padres (89 wins) and the Phillies (87) each won fewer than 90 games in the 2022 regular season, and they'll meet in the National League Championship Series for a trip to the World Series. Meanwhile, the Dodgers (111 wins), Mets (101) and Braves (101) are already home for the winter, having seen their excellent regular seasons collapse in the early rounds of the playoffs.
That, depending on how you look at it, is either a great outcome (what's more exciting than David toppling Goliath! We watch for upsets!) or a disastrous one (why doesn't the playoff system reward regular season success more?!) Those are fair enough questions each, but that's not what we're going to get to today, because there's something more interesting to consider.
