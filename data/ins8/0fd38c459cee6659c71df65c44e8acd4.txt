Henry Slade has been left 'disappointed' by his surprise England omission but club boss Rob Baxter admits it is a sensible decision by Eddie Jones.

Exeter centre Slade was this week left out of England's 36-man group that will face Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa next month.

The 29-year-old was also absent for the tour to Australia in July but that was due to a shoulder injury, which appeared to be behind the versatile back after he had surgery in the summer.
