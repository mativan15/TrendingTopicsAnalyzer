92 companies in the building sector have entered liquidation this year. Two of the industry's largest organisations say the industry is likely at the start of a bust cycle. The rising cost of labour and materials, combined with falling house prices, are said to be making some builds untenable. A total of 92 companies in the building sector have gone into liquidation in the year to May 23, according to figures from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The chief executives of Master Builders and the New Zealand Building Industry Federation said the sector was probably entering the downturn phase of the boom-bust cycle, as shortages in labour and materials combine with high costs and falling house prices to make projects untenable.
