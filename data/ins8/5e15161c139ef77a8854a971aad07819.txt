By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:31 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 00:36 EDT, 20 October 2022 Car crash victims are treated differently to others affected by crime in NSW and reform is needed to ensure they are supported through what is likely the worst day of their lives, Labor says. The party says it will fund counselling for the families of victims killed by road crimes, bringing support in line with what is offered to other victims of crime. The reform will mean an additional 200 to 300 people will be able to access counselling every year, on top of the 18,000 crime victims who already use the service.
