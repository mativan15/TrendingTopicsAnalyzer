The Goa excise commissioner on Thursday dismissed an application seeking cancellation of the licence to serve alcohol at Silly Souls Cafe and Bar in Assagao, which was at the centre of a political storm earlier this year.Complainant Aires Rodrigues sought the cancellation alleging that the excise licence was renewed fraudulently in the name of Anthony D'Gama, who is deceased. According to the complaint, the alleged fraud was perpetrated by using the influence of Union minister Smriti Irani, whose family members are principal investors in Eightall Foods and Beverages, the company operating the restaurant.
