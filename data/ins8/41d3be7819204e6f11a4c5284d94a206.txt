SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil, May 31 (Reuters) - Electric aircraft company Eve Holding Inc, which is controlled by Brazil's Embraer SA, is not rushing to be the first firm to flight an eVTOL, co-CEO Andre Stein said on Tuesday.

Eve, which is set to manufacture so-called "flying taxis," debuted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier in May after combining its business with Zanite Acquisition Corp.

Stein said during an event that Eve is focused on making sure it's going in the "right direction" rather than rushing to show investors a prototype.
