While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the Gem Diamonds Limited (LON:GEMD) share price up 21% in a single quarter. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. In fact, the share price is down 36%, which falls well short of the return you could get by buying an index fund.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
