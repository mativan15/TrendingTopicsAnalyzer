The suspect was later found because he left his wallet at the crime scene.

On Apr. 29 at approximately 3:00 AM, the Memphis Police Department (MPD) got an aggravated assault call at a McDonald's, which is in the 7000 block of Shelby Drive.

When officers arrived, they spoke to the manager who told them there was an argument between an employee and a customer at the drive-thru.

The manager refunded the customer, but the man became more irate claiming that he was owed more money, according to an affidavit.
