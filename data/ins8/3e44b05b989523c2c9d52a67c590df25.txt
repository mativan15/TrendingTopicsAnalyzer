FAIRFAX COUNTY. Va. (CW44 News At 10 | CNN) — A jury has found both Amber Heard and Johnny Depp liable for defamation in their lawsuits against each other.Depp sued Heard, his ex-wife, for defamation over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described herself as a 'public figure representing domestic abuse.' Though Depp was not named in the article, he claims it cost him lucrative acting roles. Heard countersued her ex-husband for defamation over statements Depp's attorney made about her abuse claims.
