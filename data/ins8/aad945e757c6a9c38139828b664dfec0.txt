Shamelessness is a much under-rated quality in politics and Liz Truss turns out to possess it in spades. Her performance at PMQs largely consisted of changing the subject whenever any of her almost unlimited number of recent hapless U-turns was raised. And yet she somehow put in a confident showing, even seeking to present her enforced retreats as a virtue. She, for instance, repeatedly referenced an energy price guarantee that has been completely re-written by her new Chancellor as a triumph and even berated Keir Starmer for allegedly having 'no plan' of his own.
