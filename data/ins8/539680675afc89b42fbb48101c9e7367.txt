The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's refusal to approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on spot bitcoin trading is premised on a distinction without a difference, according to one of five briefs filed on Wednesday in support of asset manager Grayscale Investment's suit against the agency. 
The friend-of-the-court brief, signed by former U.S. regulatory officials, points out that the SEC is fine with ETFs based on a futures index that has an almost perfect correlation with a gauge based on spot prices.
