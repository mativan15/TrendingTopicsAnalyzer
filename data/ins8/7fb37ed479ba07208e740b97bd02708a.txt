The biggest threats facing small business owners over the next year include paying back government Covid-19 loans, lack of consumer spending, and hefty fuel price increases, a poll has found.A poll of 1,000 small or medium enterprise (SME) bosses found two-thirds of those who had been running their business since before the pandemic admitted the last two years had been the most challenging since they started their venture.Nearly half of them (47 per cent) feared the next 12 months could prove even more difficult, with 12 per cent admitting to a strong possibility they would have to shut up shop.
