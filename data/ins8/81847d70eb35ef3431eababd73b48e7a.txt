Accusations of price-gouging predictably follow the skyrocketing cost to fill up at the gas pump, but Connecticut officials can't easily prove it.

The office of Attorney General William Tong said it has received 227 complaints of price-gouging, accounting for about 20% of the state's 1,156 gas stations. His office investigated 103 that drew an 'inquiry, a conversation, a visit from an investigator,' Tong said. Letters to gasoline retailers sought details on prices charged to customers and paid to suppliers, profit margins and other information.
