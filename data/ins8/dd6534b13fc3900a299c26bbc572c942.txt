Economic growth achieved by 'trampling over nature and its protections' will not deliver a healthy or sustainable economy, the head of Natural England has warned.

Tony Juniper, chairman of the government conservation agency, warned centuries of liquidating nature for growth had brought the world to the 'doorstep of disaster' with potentially catastrophic climate change and mass extinction of plants and animals.

And amid concerns the Government is set to bring in new spending cuts and could row back on plans to pay landowners for efforts to restore nature, Mr Juniper warned spending on the environment should be seen as an investment that brings returns, not an 'unaffordable cost when times are hard'.
