Almost the very moment Daniel Enriquez was senselessly murdered last Sunday on the Q train, Eric ­Adams, dressed in designer bright-red jacket and navy-blue pants, was pressing the flesh with celebs at an event a few blocks away.

Adams is a frequent customer at some of the city's glitziest and most pricey restaurants (on a salary of around $250,000).
