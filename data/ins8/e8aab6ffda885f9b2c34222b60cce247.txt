Published: 15:49 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 15:49 EDT, 19 October 2022 Italy's incoming premier Giorgia Meloni has issued a stark warning to Silvio Berlusconi that he risked losing influence in a new government due to his friendship with Vladimir Putin as she asserted a strong pro-Nato position on Russia's war in Ukraine. 'Italy will never be the weak link of the West with us in government,' Ms Meloni said. She was responding to private comments by Mr Berlusconi to his Forza Italia lawmakers this week in which the three-time premier boasted of having re-established contact with Mr Putin and exchanged gifts of vodka and wine over his recent 86th birthday, while justifying Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
