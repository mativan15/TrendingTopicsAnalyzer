The Ohio Supreme Court issued an opinion removing a Cleveland Municipal Court judge from the bench, citing multiple "unprecedented" incidents of misconduct. In a 5-2 vote on Tuesday, the justices voted to indefinitely suspend Judge Pinkey S. Carr's law license, precluding her from being a judge. The justices agreed with the court's Board of Professional Conduct that Carr "ruled her courtroom in a reckless and cavalier manner, unrestrained by the law or the court's rules."MORE: Judge rejects special master's request on seized documents, handing win to Trump Carr, who had been a judge since 2012, was suspended without pay.
