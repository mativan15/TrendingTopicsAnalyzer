TAMPA — The ex-president of the now-defunct Central Pasco Chamber of Commerce caught a break last week in federal Judge Charlene Honeywell's courtroom when his sentencing hearing for stealing more than $100,000 in chamber funds was abruptly cut short and rescheduled for Feb. 3.

That means David Lee Gainer Jr., who pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud in June, will have another five months or so of freedom with his family in Lutz. Then, under federal sentencing guidelines, Judge Honeywell could order Gainer, 51, to spend up to 60 years in federal prison.
