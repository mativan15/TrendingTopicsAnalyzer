Shares of Parkland Corporation (PKI.TO)(PKIUF) fell as much as 13 per cent on Wednesday as the Calgary-based fuel and retail company forecast weaker third-quarter financial results.

Parkland says it expects to book $325 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a more than 10 per cent decrease from the $364 million reported in the same period last year.
