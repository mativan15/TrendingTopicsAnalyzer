The Turkish lira is down 28 percent against the US dollar since January
Turkey's central bank on Thursday cut its policy rate for the third consecutive month despite plunging lira and an annual inflation rate that has soared over 83 percent.The central bank said it was cutting its one-week repo rate to 10.5 percent from 12 percent, with a surge in consumer prices it said was "driven by the lagged and indirect effects of rising energy costs" caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.The decision comes right after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the central bank would keep cutting rates every month for "as long as I am in power".
