(AP) - Detroit Lions defensive lineman Levi Onwuzurike is out for the season after having back surgery earlier this month. Lions coach Dan Campbell made the announcement Monday. "That's a little bit of a gut punch," he said. Detroit has struggled over the years in part because of its difficulties to select productive players in the second round of the NFL draft, and Onwuzurike is the latest example.
