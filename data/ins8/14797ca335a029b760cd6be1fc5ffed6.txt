If you value your privacy online, it's a good idea to use a VPN, or virtual private network. But when it comes to choosing the best VPN to meet your needs, keep in mind that quality should always come before cost. You shouldn't risk using an untrustworthy VPN service just to save a few bucks each month. If you absolutely must use a free VPN, it's better to take advantage of the introductory versions or free trials offered by a service from our list of trusted VPN providers.  Yes, you read that right: If you have to use a free VPN for a short period of time, your safest bet is to test-drive a free trial or take advantage of a money-back guarantee on a safer paid VPN service.
