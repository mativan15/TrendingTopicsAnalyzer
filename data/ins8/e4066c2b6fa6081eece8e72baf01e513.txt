The FDA will now make a decision on the company's New Drug Application (NDA) by Sept. 29. Previously the date was set for June 29. In March, a majority of an advisory panel of the FDA had voted against the approval of AMX0035 citing that data from single-trial & open-label study did not establish that the drug was effective.
