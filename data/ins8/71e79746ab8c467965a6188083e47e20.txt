PETALUMA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ygrene, one of the nation's leading property improvement financing companies, announced today that effective immediately, their residential property improvement financing will no longer require a 'hard pull' of consumers' credit, preventing any impact to their credit score during the application and funding process.

Ygrene is now the only residential property improvement financing company to require only a 'soft pull' of consumers' credit information which provides the company with needed underwriting information to determine applicants' eligibility without impacting their credit score - unlike a 'hard pull' that can impact consumers' credit scores.
