– Shares of Tesla Inc slipped about 3% on Thursday after Chief Executive Elon Musk said it was a 'little harder' for the electric-vehicle maker to garner demand in the face of a weakening global economy.

Tesla is recession-resilient but not recession-proof, the world's richest man said on a post-earnings call, pointing to the slowdown in China, Europe and the United States.

Musk added that he was confident of a record fourth quarter, but the company said full-year deliveries would miss its 50% growth target.
