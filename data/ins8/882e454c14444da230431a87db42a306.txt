Elon Musk may love Dogecoin, but the cocreator of the meme-inspired cryptocurrency isn't fond of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO.

'He's a grifter. He sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he's promising, but he doesn't know that. He's just really good at pretending he knows. That's very evident with the Tesla full-self-driving promise,' Jackson Palmer said of Musk in an interview with Australian news outlet Crikey that published Monday.

Palmer, who is Australian, said he and Musk have an 'interesting past,' mentioning the first time he messaged Musk on Twitter years ago.
