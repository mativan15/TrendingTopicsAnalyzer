TORONTO (Reuters) - A larger-than-life politician, Ontario premier Doug Ford beat back criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic to win a second term for his party on Thursday, but he faces an affordability crisis and a strained health system.

Media projected Ford's right-leaning Progressive Conservatives to win a big majority in Canada's most populous province shortly after the close of voting, in line with the party's lead in opinion polls.

The son of a provincial politician and inheritor of a lucrative family business, Ford has made himself known for his folksy style and painted himself as someone looking out for the little guy and who pierced the political "bubble" even as some criticized him for using his position to reward his friends.
