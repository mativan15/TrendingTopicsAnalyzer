 Independent councillor Davinder Singh Rony, who recently joined the Aam Aadmi Party and his two aides, were arrested for extortion at a government mining site on Friday. Junior engineer-cum-mining inspector Hardeep Kumar had lodged a complaint against the three accused – Rony, Amandeep Singh, and Harjeet Singh – alleging that they were charging more than the fixed rate at the government desilting site.
