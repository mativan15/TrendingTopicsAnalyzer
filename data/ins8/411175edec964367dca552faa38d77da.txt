ATLANTA — DeMeco Ryans huddled the 49ers' defense for a stern sideline speech as the game fell further out of reach Sunday.
It wasn't a big huddle.
This was a different defense without Nick Bosa and eventually seven starters in total missing because of injuries. This wasn't the NFL's No. 1 crew. But Ryans' message was simple: 'Do your job.'
By the time Ryans lashed out in that minute-long sideline huddle, the Atlanta Falcons already had built up a 28-14 lead, and that held up as the final score before a bipartisan crowd in the 49ers' first visit to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
