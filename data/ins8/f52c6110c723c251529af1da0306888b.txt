Around 400 products, including Banarasi Zardozi, Gir Kesar Mango, Firozabad Glass, Kancheepuram Silk, Kangra Paintings and Araku Valley Arabica Coffee, are set to get a global branding push as India seeks to promote them globally to boost their exports. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) plans to hold roadshows, car shows, product demonstrations and free product trials for products tagged with Geographical Indications (GI), as part of the plan

"This is a part of a larger plan to explore the export potential of GI products," a government official told ET.
