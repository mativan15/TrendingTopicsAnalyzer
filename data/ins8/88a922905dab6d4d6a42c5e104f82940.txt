SAN FRANCISCO — The Warriors entered training camp with everything seemingly coming together for a vigorous title defense this season.
Stephen Curry looked to be picking up where he left off last season, and Draymond Green was praised for how well conditioned he was heading into camp. Klay Thompson and James Wiseman were finally healthy, and Jordan Poole was on the brink of securing a huge payday. Young guys  such as Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody dedicated their offseason to taking major developmental leaps in Year 2.
