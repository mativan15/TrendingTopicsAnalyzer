In 2021, Microsoft stepped up its investment in its advertising business with the pending $1 billion acquisition of adtech platform Xandr. But the tech giant, which made $10 billion in ad revenue last year, has suggested that it's not done shopping yet."There are scenarios where we can grow organically, and candidly, there are areas where we will have to grow inorganically," Rob Wilk, corporate VP of Microsoft advertising, said at Luma's Digital Media Summit in New York in May.Wilk wants to get the ad industry to take notice of Microsoft's entire ad offering, not just its core search business that it has run for years.
