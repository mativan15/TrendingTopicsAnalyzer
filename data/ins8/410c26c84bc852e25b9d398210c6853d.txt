A London-based cryptocurrency hedge fund is staying afloat despite the sharp downturn this year in the price of digital assets.

Nickel Digital Asset Management's market-neutral arbitrage fund is down about 0.6% this year, versus bitcoin's drop of about 40% and the tech-focused Nasdaq retreating about 24% over the same period. As of April 30, the cumulative performance of Nickel's arbitrage fund since inception in June of 2019 reached just over 30%, net of all fees.
