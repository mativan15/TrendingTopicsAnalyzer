Elon Musk has been hit with a lawsuit from a Twitter shareholder who accuses the Tesla CEO of criticizing the company he has agreed to buy and sowing doubts about the deal in order to drive down Twitter's value.The proposed class action, filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims Musk aimed to drive down Twitter's stock price because he either wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a lower purchase price.The suit, which also names Twitter, argues that Musk's attacks violated both the nondisparagement and nondisclosure clauses of his contract with the company.
