Game 2 of the ALCS was a close one. At one point, just before the ninth inning, a fan rushed the field to chat with Jose Altuve.

The man did manage to tell Altuve that the Astros needed to win game 2, because he spent all his money on the ticket. He also gave Altuve a hug.

The man was trying to get his phone ready for a selfie, which Altuve was more than happy to do, but security got there first.
