Immerse yourself in an experience of mining wealth in the early 1900s by visiting this perfectly preserved mansion. Once owned by the illustrious Campbell family, the house, its grounds, and the ornate carriage house are now known as 'the largest artifact' in the collection of the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture.
Each of the house's rooms tells a story, from the gilded golden guest reception room to the long dining room filled with striking blue-and-white Dutch tile. While the whole place has an air of time-travel about it, some (the kitchen in particular) will transport you right back to when the Campbell's Swedish cook, Hulga, hummed a tune while baking tray after tray of her famous Christmas cookies.
