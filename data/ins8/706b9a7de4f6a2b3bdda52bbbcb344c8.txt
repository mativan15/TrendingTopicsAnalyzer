Around half-a-million hospital workers are set to be given the opportunity to go on strike over pay in the coming months, it has been revealed.
Nurses, doctors, ambulance crews, porters and cleaners are all set to be balloted for strikes, which could leave thousands of hospitals short of staff.
Unison has announced that its members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, will all vote in the coming weeks on whether to mount a campaign of industrial action.
Members of other health unions representing nurses, midwives, ambulance crews and physiotherapists are also being balloted for industrial action.
