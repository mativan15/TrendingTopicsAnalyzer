The Watcher is the latest true crime series to land on Netflix and shake its viewers to the core. Although the series ended with multiple potential suspects, it was Dean Brannock's (played by Bobby Cannavale) actions which left fans talking and thankfully actress Naomi Watts explained its hidden meaning. The thrilling drama followed the lives of Dean and his wife Nora Brannock (Naomi Watts) after they moved into their dream New Jersey home. After three days of bliss, they were suddenly plagued with mysterious letters about their marriage from an anonymous stalker who signed the notes as The Watcher.
