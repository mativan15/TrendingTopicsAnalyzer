The Los Angeles Clippers are expected to name Reggie Jackson the starting point guard to open up the 2022-23 season, league sources told Yahoo Sports.

Jackson was in a preseason battle with five-time All-Star John Wall for the starting point guard nod.

Jackson is expected to join a lineup featuring Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Marcus Morris and Ivica Zubac.

It is unlikely Wall will play back-to-back games to start the year, sources said. He had a strong exhibition campaign, but Jackson has continuity with the personnel from his two-plus seasons with the team.
