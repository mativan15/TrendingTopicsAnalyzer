The more you watch and study the 2021 season for the Raiders, the more impressive the season looks for Hunter Renfrow. The former Day 3 pick from Clemson was money all year for the Raiders and he made several game-changing plays to help the team make the playoffs.

In a recent article by Cynthia Frelund of NFL Network, she named some of the NFL's most underappreciated players heading into the 2022 season.
