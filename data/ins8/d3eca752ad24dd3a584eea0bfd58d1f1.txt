A feature of the bill, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the legal agreements, is that it sets up separate 'streams' for different kinds of employers, but one source said this was already creating confusion.One of the government's stated objectives is to improve wages in sectors such as childcare and aged care where many of the workers are women, salaries are low compared to other sectors and many employers receive federal assistance.Business Council of Australia chief Jennifer Westacott has hardened her objections to the workplace laws.
