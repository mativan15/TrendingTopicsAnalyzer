'Being criticized does not mean I have to leave my community,' said haredi women's right activist Esty Shushan. 'It means I have to stay and try to fix it.'

Sitting among a group of women journalists at the '1868' kosher meat restaurant near the city center only days before Rosh Hashanah, Shushan shared her journey to feminism.

Shushan's story is the focus of a new documentary, ' Women of Valor,' which is available on HOT and has been shown at several movie festivals. She herself is a symbol of tensions within an ultra-Orthodox community that is slowly evolving but uncomfortable with change.
