Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the Codorus Valley Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVLY) share price is up 22% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 12% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 17% higher than it was three years ago.
