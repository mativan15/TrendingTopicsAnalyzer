That was so last quarter.

Last this afternoon, the streaming giant reported its third-quarter earnings, and the results are above their bold forecast.

In a classic case of under-promising and over-delivering, Netflix added 2.41 million subscribers from July to September 2022., which doubles the 1 million new subscribers the company had predicted.

Netflix also pulled in $7.93 billion in revenue versus the $7.85 billion expected.

In a letter to its shareholders, the company said:

After a challenging first half, we believe we're on a path to reaccelerate growth.
