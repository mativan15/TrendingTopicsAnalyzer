Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Money3 Corporation Limited (ASX:MNY) share price is down 40% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 5.0%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 12% in the last three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 11% in the last 90 days.
