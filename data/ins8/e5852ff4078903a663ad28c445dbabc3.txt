By Australian Associated Press Published: 13:35 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 13:35 EDT, 3 June 2022 Brad Thorn is optimistic his Queensland Reds' tradies will benefit from the ultimate apprenticeship after bowing out in a Super Rugby Pacific quarter-final loss to the Crusaders. The Reds were beaten 37-15 in Christchurch on Friday, but not within giving the powerhouse side a mighty fright. Down 16-8 at halftime, they scored first in the second half and would have led if five-eighth Lawson Creighton's penalty kick with 30 minutes to play had been accurate.
