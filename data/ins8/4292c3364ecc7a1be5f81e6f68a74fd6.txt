This week I got an opportunity to travel to Columbo in Sri Lanka during a transit flight to London. I wanted to utilise the long layover to visit the country which is at the peak of its economic, political and social turmoil. I was advised against going into the city marred by social unrest, protests, and political upheavals but I still went ahead since I had visited Columbo 15 years ago and wanted to see the beautiful country again. As soon as I landed, I found the arrival terminal of the airport not busy or crowded considering that global travel has opened up and flights were occupied to the highest capacity.
