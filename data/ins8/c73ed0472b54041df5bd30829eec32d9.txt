NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday inquired from the Union government whether the electoral bonds floated from time to time for funding of political parties through donations were transparent and whether the system provided for identification of the funds source .Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna that the bonds were absolutely transparent. 'The prescribed methodology of receiving monies through electoral bonds is so transparent that it is impossible for political parties toget unaccounted or black money as donation,' he said.
