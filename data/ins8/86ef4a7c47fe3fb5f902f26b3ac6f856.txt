Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's plan to reorganize the bank's corporate structure is raising alarm bells — with junior bankers fearing it could cost them their jobs, sources told The Post.
Earlier this week, reports citing anonymous sources said the Wall Street giant was combining its various business units into three divisions — and that one of them would house both the trading and investment banking, the bank's two most prestigious and competitive operations.
Goldman confirmed the plans as it announced quarterly earnings on Tuesday — with Solomon telling CNBC in an interview that there's a 'good chance' of a recession as the bank mounts its overhaul.
