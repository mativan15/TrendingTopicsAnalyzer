BASKING RIDGE, N.J. - A survey commissioned by Verizon found 51 million Americans don't know how much they spend on their home internet – and those who do estimate paying an average of $137 per month1 – or more than five times the price Verizon offers. With rising gas, food and home utility prices forcing Americans to find ways to save, Verizon is helping customers by offering Home Internet for just $25 per month2 with no promotional price creep – a fraction of what they think they're currently paying.
