TORONTO and CALGARY, May 30, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Commissioner of Competition's application to seek an interim injunction has been resolved on the basis that Rogers Communications Inc. ('Rogers') and Shaw Communications Inc. ('Shaw') have agreed to not proceed with closing their proposed merger (the 'Transaction') until either a negotiated settlement is agreed with the Commissioner or the Competition Tribunal (the 'Tribunal') has ruled on the matter. As a result, there is no need for the Tribunal to hear the Commissioner's application for an interim injunction.
