ROME (Reuters) -Italy's manufacturing sector grew at the slowest pace for a year-and-a-half in May, a survey showed on Wednesday, with business hit by material shortages and weak client demand.

The S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Italian manufacturing came in at 51.9, down from 54.5 in April but still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction - the 23rd straight month of expansion.

The May index level fell short of a median forecast of 53.5 in a Reuters survey of 15 analysts.
