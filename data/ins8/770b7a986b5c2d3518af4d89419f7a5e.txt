Several hundred Milwaukee business and community leaders got a preview Wednesday evening of the much-anticipated "Beyond Monet: The Immersive Experience" exhibit. Check out the attached slideshow to see photos from the event and get your first look at the exhibit.

The exhibit will run Oct. 20 to Jan. 8, 2023.

Beyond Monet is the second immersive art exhibit brought in by the Wisconsin Center District. In 2021, the Wisconsin Center District celebrated the introduction of "Beyond Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience," which was both the exhibit's and Wisconsin Center's highest grossing event in history.
