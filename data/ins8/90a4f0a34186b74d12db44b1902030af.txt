The Lord of the Rings franchise can reach the $6B-plus scale of Marvel and Star Wars, according to the man who brokered the sale of the IP to Sweden's Embracer Group, who revealed new information about the deal.

	ACF Investment Bank CEO Thomas Dey told Mipcom Cannes Lord of the Rings is one of around six 'pieces of IP of this magnitude on the planet,' which will now have its potential unlocked by Embracer. Embracer picked up the motion picture, video game, board game, merchandizing, theme parks and stage production rights relating to The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit franchises over the summer as well as matching rights in other Middle-earth-related literary works authorized by the Tolkien Estate and HarperCollins, which have yet to be explored.
