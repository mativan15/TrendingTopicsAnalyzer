Foxconn Technology Group took the wraps off two new electric vehicles on Tuesday, prototypes that embody the iPhone maker's ambitions of carving out a slice of a market led by the likes of Tesla. The company, whose main listed arm is Hon Hai Precision Industry, unveiled the Model B crossover SUV and Model V pick-up truck at its event in Taipei. Foxconn founder Terry Gou, 72, introduced the Model B by driving it onto the stage. The pick-up will be produced in Taiwan, Thailand and the US, Hon Hai chairman Young Liu said.
