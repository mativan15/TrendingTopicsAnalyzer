China must use its diplomatic leverage over isolated Myanmar to tackle the scam networks menacing Asia, a Kuala Lumpur-based rights group said on Monday (Oct 17), as it warned Malaysians were among the hundreds still trapped inside the Mekong region's massive online fraud industry. The scams are run mainly by Chinese gangs, paying or duping young people to target their compatriots with fake investments, fictional romances or cash transfers to bogus police officers. Hong Kong police last week said tens of millions of dollars had been scammed from city residents alone, mainly from the industrial-scale call centres based in Cambodia and 'special economic zones' on the Laos and Myanmar borders.
