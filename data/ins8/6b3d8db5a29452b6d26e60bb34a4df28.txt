There was a time when getting your hands on a full-size Nintendo Switch was almost as hard as finding a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in stock. Fortunately, things have calmed down enough that you can even find one of these nifty handhelds on sale occasionally. Right now, Woot has a selection of new Switch consoles -- including the upgraded OLED model -- on sale for up to $30 off. These deals are only available until 9:59 p.m. PT (12:59 a.m. ET) tonight, and there's a good chance it may sell out before then.
