PITTSBURGH, May 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- "We thought there should be a safe way to experience a shopping mall or large concert venue from home," said one of two inventors, from Elk Grove, Calif., "so we invented the MONEY & CONCERT VIRTUAL REALITY. Our design would enhance fun and socialization while reducing the spread of the corona virus."
The patent-pending invention provides a virtual and immersive way to enjoy shopping malls and concerts. In doing so, it eliminates the need to travel and attend a crowded public space.
