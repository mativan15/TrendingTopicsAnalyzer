SergeyZavalnyuk/iStock via Getty Images The background here Ferrexpo plc (OTCPK:FEEXF) (OTC:FEEXY) is a perfectly sensible iron-ore producing organization in the Ukraine. They can and do ship by train into Europe and also by sea to the world. They make significant profit doing this, seem well managed, and have decades of reserves left available to them. They're also trading at a 25% yield and a P/E of 1.5. So, clearly, they're a screaming buy. Except not so much, for they're in Ukraine. Where, as we might have noted, there's a certain amount of bother going on.
