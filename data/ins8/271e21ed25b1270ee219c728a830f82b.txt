Millions of pensioners haven't forgiven former Chancellor Rishi Sunak for his decision to suspend the triple lock mechanism in the wake of the pandemic. That move is costing them up to £480 a year in lost income.Suspending it once was bad enough, doing it a second time will spark outrage as inflation rockets.The triple lock increases the state pension each year either by earnings, inflation or 2.5 percent, whichever is highest.If the government does stand by the triple lock, pensioners will be on course for a 10.
