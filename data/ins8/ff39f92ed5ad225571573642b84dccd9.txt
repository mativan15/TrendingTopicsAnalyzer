INS Vikrant was launched with much fanfare last year, as it happened to be the first indigenous aircraft carrier to with the Indian Navy. Currently, it is undergoing sea trials in Karwar near Gujarat. The Prime Minister will be commissioning this maiden aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy on the 15th of August 2022, commemorating the 75th Anniversary of India's independence. The US manufacturer, Boeing, will be sending two F-18 Super Hornet fighters that are to be undergoing aerial trials onboard the INS Hansa.
