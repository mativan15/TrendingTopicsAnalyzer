Kansas City has opened the door for builders to submit plans that could receive a boost from its newly active affordable housing fund.

A second application round for the city's Housing Trust Fund will remain open through Nov. 7, through which submitted proposals could win awards from upward of $10 million in available funding.

The round follows a City Council vote in August to appropriate $7.95 million from the Housing Trust Fund to an initial 14 housing projects recommended by the fund's nine-member board.
