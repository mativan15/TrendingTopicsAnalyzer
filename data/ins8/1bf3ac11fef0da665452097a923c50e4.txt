In 1979 Jimmy Carter famously had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House West Wing. Seven years later, Ronald Reagan not-so-famously had them taken down.

Carter's goal was for America to draw 20% of its energy from solar power by 2000. Twenty-two years after the passing of that date, we're only halfway there.
