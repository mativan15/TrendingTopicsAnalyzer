The CBI has brought ABIL group chairman Avinash Bhosale, who was arrested in Mumbai in connection with an alleged corruption case involving founder Rana Kapoor and Kapil Vadhawan of DHFL, to Delhi for questioning, officials said on Wednesday. Bhosale, who was being investigated in Mumbai, was brought to the national capital Tuesday night, they said. The agency is probing if the Yes Bank and DHFL scam had spread its tentacles across noted builders of Maharashtra and their companies were allegedly used to route the proceeds of crimes in the form of loans, among others, officials said.
