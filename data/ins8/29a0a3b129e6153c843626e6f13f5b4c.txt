With a combined revenue of roughly $67 billion, Certified B Corporations have a large global footprint. There are more than 5,000 B Corps operating in over 70 countries across 150 industries and disciplines. Westmount is one of only a handful of California-based registered investment advisory firms to attain this distinction.

"As a leading wealth advisor in Southern California, we understand quite well how the decisions we make as a business impact our clients and other stakeholders—our staff, strategic partners, and community members," said Jim Berliner, Westmount co-founder and chairman.
