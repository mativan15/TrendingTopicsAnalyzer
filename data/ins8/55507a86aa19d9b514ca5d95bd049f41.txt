Published: 21:55 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 00:10 EDT, 31 May 2022 Household and business electricity bills will jump across Queensland on the back of high demand, plant outages and higher coal and gas prices. The Queensland Competition Authority has allowed retailers outside the suburban southeast to lift typical residential electricity bills by $119 to $1290 and business bills by $215 to $2334 in 2022/23. The decision comes after the Australian Energy Regulator last week said residential bills in the suburban southeast could rise by $165 and $220, to between $1620 and $1961, and business bills could be lifted by $705 to $3446 next financial year.
