Tottenham have been told that selling Harry Kane for £88million in the summer would represent 'good business' as the England captain has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Spurs' star man has less than two years left on his contract at the club and he does not appear to be close to extending his deal to stay in north London.Bayern Munich's CEO Oliver Kahn and head coach Julian Nagelsmann have both spoken openly of their desire to bring Kane to the Bundesliga to follow Sadio Mane, while Chelsea co-owner and acting sporting director Todd Boehly is reportedly keen on bringing established Premier League talent to Stamford Bridge, including Kane.
