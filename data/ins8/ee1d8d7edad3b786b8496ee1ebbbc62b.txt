Sisters Niki and Ritika Shamdasani founded Sani, because they, like many other South Asian-Americans, struggled to find formalwear in the U.S."The stat we found is 82 percent wait to go to India to shop, even if they have weddings here, because it has traditionally not been super accessible," said Niki. "So we said, let's design the pieces that we want to see."They started the brand in 2017, and just three years later, Sani had become the first South Asian brand to be carried by Rent the Runway. It was a huge success, selling out in 48 hours and driving a surge of traffic to the Sani site.
