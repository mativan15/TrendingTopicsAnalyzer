On Friday, May 20, share prices dipped into what is called bear territory — 20 per cent below the previous peak. This was a very short, intraday dip that missed the 20 per cent by a bit, but it still rattled investors. Wall Street zoologists say a bear market is driven by investors who expect share prices to fall and who believe that just when you think things can't get worse, they do.There have been 14 bear markets since 1945, lasting an average of 9.5 months. The most recent occurred in March 2020, when the pandemic began.
