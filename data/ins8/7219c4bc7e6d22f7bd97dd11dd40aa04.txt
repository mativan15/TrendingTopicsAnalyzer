Price Action

BTC and ETH returned a portion of their Monday gains as volume and volatility continued to decline in cryptocurrency markets.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was relatively flat, falling 1.64%.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) aligned with the CMI; its price dropped 1.77%. Trading activity was muted again and overall volume trailed bitcoin's 20-day moving average. The decline marked the fifth consecutive day and ninth of the last 10 of lower-than-average volume.
