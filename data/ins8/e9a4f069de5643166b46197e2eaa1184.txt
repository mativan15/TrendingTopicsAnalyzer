Bowen Byram had a goal and an assist and Evan Rodrigues also scored for Colorado, which has dropped two straight.

Kuhlman put the Kraken ahead when he maneuvered around Kurtis McDermid and beat Pavel Francouz with 7:54 left in the third.

The game was scoreless after the first period but the teams combined for three goals in the first six minutes of the second. Schwartz scored a power-play goal at 1:38 with a one-timer from the slot, and McCann's second goal of the season made it 2-0 just 22 seconds later.
