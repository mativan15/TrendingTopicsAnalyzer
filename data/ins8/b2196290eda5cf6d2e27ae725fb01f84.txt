The Financial Action Task Force added Myanmar to a group of high-risk countries, known as the ‘black list,' citing its failure to make enough progress in addressing illicit financial flows.The failures 'were first identified in a report in September 2018; more than four years later many of those issues remain,' said T. Raja Kumar, the president of the FATF, following the decision.
