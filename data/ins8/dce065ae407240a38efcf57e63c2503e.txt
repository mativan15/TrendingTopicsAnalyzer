The Confederation of Indian Industry partnered with Indian Oil Corporation to launch project 'Vayu Amrit', a crop residue management initiative, in Punjab's Sangrur on Wednesday. Crop residue burning should be avoided at all costs as it adversely impacts the environment, Sangrur's Deputy Commissioner Jitendra Jorwal said. He said farmers now have access to processes and machinery to avoid burning of crop residue. "We should make Sangrur a model district for zero crop residue burning," said Jorwal while speaking at the launch of the CII and Indian Oil Corporation-supported crop residue management initiative, project Vayu Amrit, in village Nagri in Sangrur.
