The Punjab government has sought the release of ₹1,760 crore outstanding rural development fund (RDF) from the Centre for the past two procurements of food grains – paddy in 2021 and wheat in 2022. Also, the government has asked the Centre's ministry of food, civil supplies and public distribution to permit 3% RDF against the total procurement which has been lowered to 2% in 2020. The state officials are expected to take up the matter during Wednesday's meeting with the Union agriculture minister.
