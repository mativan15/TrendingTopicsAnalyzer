Jim Chalmers has revealed the cost of the stage 3 tax cuts has blown out by $11bn.The Treasurer said on Thursday the latest Treasury costing of the policy had jumped from $243bn over a decade to $254bn.Dr Chalmers made the revelation on ABC Radio National, five days before he hands down his first federal budget.The revelation is likely to reignite debate over the equity of the tax cuts for workers on higher incomes at a time when the budget is facing considerable strain.The cuts, which are due to come into effect in July 2024, would mean no one earning up to $200,000 a year will pay more than 30 cents of the dollar in tax.
