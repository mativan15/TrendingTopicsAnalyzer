The Monetary Committee at the Bank of Israel, chaired by Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, recently published their decision on the interest level, according to which the interest rate will increase by 0.75% - from 2% per year to 2.75% per year.

In the last six months, the Bank's interest rate jumped from 0.1% to 2.75%.

At the same time, the banks raised the prime interest rate to 4.25% per year.

The increase in the prime interest rate increases repayments on average mortgages, which are around one million shekels, by about 200 shekels per month.
