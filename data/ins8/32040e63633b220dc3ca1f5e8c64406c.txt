John Cena has become one of the most recognisable stars on the planet but he looks wildly different in photos taken early in his career.
The WWE legend turned Hollywood actor competed as a bodybuilder before he caught the eye in Vince McMahon's company, and this marks two decades sing his debut alongside the likes of Brock Lesnar, Batista (Dave Bautista) and Randy Orton in the famed class of 2002.
To celebrate his achievement, WWE is dedicating June to Cena and his rich legacy, and they have marked the occasion with an epic gallery of rare and unseen photos.
