AT&T (T 7.72%) is back to being a telecom company after the spinoff of Warner Media put an end to its disastrous run as an entertainment conglomerate. While getting out of the media business was the right move for the company, its stock has been punished this year as the economic winds shifted. AT&T was forced to slash its full-year outlook for free cash flow a few months ago as customers started delaying payments.
The poor performance of AT&T stock can partly be attributed to the bridges the company has burned with investors.
