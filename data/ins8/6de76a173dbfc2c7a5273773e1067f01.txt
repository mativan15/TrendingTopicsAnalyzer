More than two-thirds of 65-year-olds are leaving their money in their KiwiSaver accounts, even though they have become eligible to withdraw it, ANZ says. It said, of the members of ANZ's KiwiSaver schemes who became eligible to make a withdrawal in the 12 months to April 2022, 71% made no withdrawal, 17% made a partial withdrawal and 12% withdrew all their savings. 'The way we have traditionally thought about retirement is changing. We are living a lot longer, and more people are working beyond the official retirement age,' said ANZ managing director for funds management, Fiona Mackenzie.
