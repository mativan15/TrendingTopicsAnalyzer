Tim Burton has reflected on his ‘special connection' with Johnny Depp and his favourite thing about working with the actor.
Filmaker Burton, 64, has worked with Depp, 59, on numerous occasions for projects including Edward Scissorhands (1990), Corpse Bride (2005), and Alice in Wonderland (2010).
In fact, the pair have collaborated on eight films and are close friends away from the screen too, and have achieved success with many of their projects.
Speaking about why he and Depp work so well together, Burton shared that their ideas are similar and, upon their first meeting, felt like they bonded over both being ‘white trash.
