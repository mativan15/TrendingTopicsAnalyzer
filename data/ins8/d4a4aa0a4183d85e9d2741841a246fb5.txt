Stuart McKinstry feels Motherwell's last two displays against the Old Firm show they are perfectly capable of springing a Scottish League Cup surprise at home to Celtic on Wednesday.
Well lost 2-1 at Celtic Park in the Scottish Premiership at the start of this month and then were defeated by the same scoreline at home to Rangers on Sunday.
"We were unfortunate against Rangers, but we have a big game to look forward to on Wednesday and we can take confidence into the Celtic game," said on-loan Leeds United winger McKinstry, who pulled a goal back against the Ibrox side.
