Published: 20:35 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 20:35 EDT, 17 October 2022 No. 20 Texas, based on three consecutive wins and a powerful offensive attack, will be the favorite when it plays No. 11 Oklahoma State on Saturday afternoon in a key Big 12 Conference dustup in Stillwater, Okla. Expect the contest to be a battle, especially in the trenches, as both teams have run-first mentalities. The Longhorns (5-2, 3-1 Big 12) head north after a 24-21 win over Iowa State last Saturday. The victory was Texas' third straight and allowed it to jump two spots in the AP rankings to its highest spot in the poll this season.
