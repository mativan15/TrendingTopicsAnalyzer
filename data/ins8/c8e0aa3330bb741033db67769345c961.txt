Earlier this month, Apple finally launched its self-service repair program that lets customers buy official parts to fix their own devices. In addition to the parts, Apple is also selling (or renting) the tools necessary to do the repairs.As you might expect, people who write for tech publications and people who make YouTube videos are getting them and cracking open their iPhones. Those tools are the exact same tools as Apple uses to fix your iPhone, and if you rent them, they show up in two large Pelican cases weighing about 80 pounds.
