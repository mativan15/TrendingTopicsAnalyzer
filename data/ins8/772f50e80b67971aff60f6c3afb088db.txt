State Congress chief Nana Patole on Wednesday said a protest will be held in Shirdi on Thursday against the ED summoning party president Sonia Gandhi and Lok Sabha MP Rahul Gandhi to appear before it on June 8 in connection with the National Herald money laundering probe.
'We will keep our plan before the public in the protest,'' Patole told mediapersons in Shirdi.
Patole, along with other Congress leaders, were in Shirdi to attend the first day of the two-day Nav Sankalp Shibir being held to revamp state Congress units in the country.
