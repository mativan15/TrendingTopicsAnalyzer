Fireworks during Diwali worsen the air quality as low wind speeds trap the pollutants in the lower atmosphere

People who let off firecrackers in Delhi during Diwali will face up to six months in jail, the city's environment minister has announced amid worsening pollution levels in the Indian capital.

The government has also imposed a fine of 200 Indian rupees ($2.41; £2.15) on those caught bursting firecrackers.

The rules are part of a broader ban on firecrackers announced in September to help curb extreme pollution.
