The City veteran John Allan is preparing to step down as chairman of Barratt Developments, Britain's second-biggest housebuilder by market value.Sky News has learnt that Barratt has instructed headhunters at Russell Reynolds Associates to identify a successor to Mr Allan, who also chairs Tesco.
The process, which is unlikely to be concluded until next year, comes at a sensitive time for the UK housebuilding sector, with many of its biggest companies critical of a £3bn building safety levy forced through by ministers two months ago.
