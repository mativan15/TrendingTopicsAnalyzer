The 3-2 Chargers and 2-3 Broncos appear to be heading in opposite directions. Led by a young, franchise QB in Justin Herbert, the Chargers have won two straight and are the biggest obstacle to the Chiefs winning the AFC West for the seventh consecutive year. Meanwhile, the Broncos traded for veteran quarterback Russell Wilson this offseason and signed him to an enormous contract extension -- only to watch its offense sputter for the first five weeks, including two straight losses. The Broncos will look to get the Wilson era moving in the right direction tonight in Los Angeles against Herbert and the Chargers.
