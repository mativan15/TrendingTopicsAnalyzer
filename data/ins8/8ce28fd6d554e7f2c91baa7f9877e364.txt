French immersion was the last straw between Premier Blaine Higgs and Dominic Cardy.The education minister's dramatic resignation last week was sparked by the premier's insistence that immersion be replaced next fall by a yet-to-be-defined new program.There's no starker illustration of their disagreement over that September 2023 date than the Higgs government's own website.As of 4:30 p.m. on Monday, the "Evolving French Language Learning" page still showed a slow and careful two-year consultation process leading to implementation in September 2024 – a timeline Higgs has now publicly rejected as too slow.
