Elon Musk, who appears to be moving forward with his precarious deal to buy Twitter, seemed to be basking in the prospect of a changing social media landscape, with himself, Donald Trump, and Kanye West at the helm. On Tuesday, he shared a meme of their heads superimposed on the Three Musketeers: 'In retrospect, it was inevitable,' he captioned the now deleted image. And in a since deleted tweet from Monday, Musk shared a meme depicting himself and West using Twitter and Parler to combine their powers: 'Fun times ahead!'West, a star rapper, producer, and fashion mogul who now goes by Ye, said Monday that he is planning to buy Parler, the minor Rebekah Mercer–funded social media network that launched in 2018 as a safe space for the Trump wing of the Republican Party, and has become an online home for anti-government militia groups, QAnon fanatics, and the like.
