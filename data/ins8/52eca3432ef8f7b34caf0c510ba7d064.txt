Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has blamed recent protests in Iran on foreign 'enemies' seeking to overthrow the Islamic Republic.
He also said on Saturday that the United States and its allies were waging a 'psychological war' against Iran by accusing it of piracy for seizing two Greek ships after the US confiscated Iranian oil from a tanker.
'Today, the enemies' most important hope for striking a blow at the country is based on popular protests,' Khamenei said, referring to weeklong protests over the collapse of a building in southwestern Iran that killed 37 people last month.
