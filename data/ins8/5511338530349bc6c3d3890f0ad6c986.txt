A contestant on Thursday night's The Chase Australia stunned host Larry Emdur by declaring the moon landing was a hoax.

Answering questions first up in the episode, new mum Laura told Emdur that she loved 'conspiracy theories'.

'Aliens, love anything to do with space and all that kind of thing,' she said.

'Do you believe that man has walked on the moon?' Emdur asked.

'No,' she replied.

'Absolutely not?' Emdur said.

'No I don't, I think that was a conspiracy,' Laura said.

'I wish you lots of luck,' Emdur said, before starting the round.
