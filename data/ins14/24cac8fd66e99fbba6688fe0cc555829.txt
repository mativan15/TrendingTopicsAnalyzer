The combination of analytics, automation and augmented intelligence will drive the future of business. That was the message delivered by Ray Wang, founder and analyst at Constellation Research, who spoke recently during the Graph + AI Summit, the spring edition of the biannual open conference hosted virtually by graph data and analytics vendor TigerGraph. According to Wang, nearly two-thirds of the companies that made up the Fortune 500 in 2000 are now gone, having been acquired, merged with another company or gone bankrupt.
