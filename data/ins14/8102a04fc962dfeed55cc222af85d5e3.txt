It was another down day for stocks, with Treasury yields climbing amid hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials and swaps pricing in a 5 per cent peak policy rate in 2023. The pound wavered after Liz Truss resigned as U.K. prime minister. The wariness around economic challenges has been so pronounced that it doesn't take much see the S&P 500 dropping at least 1 per cent after posting a rally of the same magnitude earlier in the day. That's the 16th time the gauge posted intraday swings of that size in 2022 -- the most for any year since the financial crisis.
