David de Gea has expressed his wish to stay at Manchester United for "many more years" ahead of his contract expiring in 2023.

If De Gea features in the Red Devils' meeting with Newcastle United at Old Trafford on Sunday, he will become just the 11th man to make 500 appearances for United in their illustrious history.

Only Ryan Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton, Paul Scholes, Bill Foulkes, Gary Neville, Wayne Rooney, Alex Stepney, Tony Dunne, Denis Irwin and Joe Spence have previously reached that landmark at United.
