German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday that his country will supply Ukraine with new anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems, stepping up arms deliveries amid criticism that Germany isn't doing enough to help Kyiv in its time of need.Scholz told MPs that the government has decided to provide Ukraine with IRIS-T missiles developed by Germany together with other NATO nations, and radar systems to help locate enemy artillery.It came in the face of claims at home and abroad that Germany has been slow to provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs to defend itself against the Russian onslaught.
