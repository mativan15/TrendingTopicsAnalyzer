The latest CBS News/YouGov polling suggests that voters would prefer Republicans to take control of the House after the November midterms.

The BattleGround Tracker, which estimates how many seats each party is predicted to win in the House of Representatives, showed that Republicans had stabilized their lead at 224 seats, while Democrats hold 211. However, the GOP lead in the model had diminished in the past two months.

The latest polling found that 65 percent of voters said they believe the economy is getting worse, with 20 percent saying it is staying the same and 15 percent saying it is getting better.
