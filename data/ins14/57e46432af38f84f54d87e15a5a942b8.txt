Published: 11:31 EDT, 1 June 2022 | Updated: 11:31 EDT, 1 June 2022 Elon Musk has a new lady in his life, just five months after welcoming another child with his former partner Grimes - and the pair have already taken their romance overseas, making one of their first public outings as a couple in the upscale French town of St. Tropez this weekend. The SpaceX founder, 50, was seen putting on a very cozy display with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, 27, while enjoying lunch in the coastal European town, seemingly confirming that he is in a relationship with the rising on-screen star, three months after they were first linked.
