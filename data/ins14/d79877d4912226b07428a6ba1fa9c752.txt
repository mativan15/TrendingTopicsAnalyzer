Not so much a sports movie, but rather a film that deals with the business of sport, Hustle has something in common with Oliver Stone's thunderous American football drama, Any Given Sunday. The sport in this case is basketball – Adam Sandler plays Stanley, a jaded scout who hauls himself around the world in search of fresh talent – but the film is charged with a similar kinetic crackle to that of Stone's picture.Stanley's enthusiasm for the game is dulled by the corporate muscle flexing of his boss (Ben Foster), and his health is taking a beating from the room service.
