A Parliamentary staffer who stole $55,200 from his office in an 'act of revenge' has paid it all back ahead of being given community work and supervision by a judge. The man, whose name is suppressed but once worked for the Parliamentary Counsel Office which drafts and publishes legislation, had pleaded guilty to one charge of obtaining the money by deception. Wellington District Court judge Craig Thompson​ said he had been in a position where he was personally trusted, but had found a way to work around the systems in the office.
