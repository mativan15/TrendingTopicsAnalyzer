For the second time in a year, billionaire mogul Ye, aka Kanye West, sat down for an extended interview on Revolt's popular interview show Drink Champs. Joined by hosts and hip-hop legends N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN, Ye used the near three-and-a-half-hour conversation Oct. 16 to double down on his antisemitic views on why he, a billionaire, is being held down, as well as share factually incorrect conspiracy theories about George Floyd's murder, the media, and the movement against police brutality.
But it's not just Ye who's drawing ire after the podcast, but Drink Champs itself, as longtime fans and new critics have called them out for giving the rapper such a large platform during his disturbing downward spiral.
