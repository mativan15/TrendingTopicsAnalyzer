PARIS — French luxury skiwear brand Fusalp is looking to break new ground, particularly in the U.S., with the backing of new investors who will enter its capital on Tuesday.

'We are a family-owned company, so we like to know our partners very well. We had this conversation for some time, speaking about the business, getting to know each other and now we feel that we need to really seize the moment to develop ourselves, especially in America. [So] we felt they could be the right partners because [we share] the same ways of seeing business, continuity and strengthen the business in the long term,' Fusalp co-president Sophie Lacoste told WWD.
