This offseason the Raiders were faced with the decision of whether to pick up the third-year option on their three 2019 first round picks. They opted for none of them. And with the trade deadline, two of them are being actively shopped according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.
The report says both DL Clelin Ferrell and S Johnathan Abram are on the trade block with one NFC Exec quoted as saying the Raiders have been 'aggressive' in replacing players from the former regime with players who better fit 'their personality.
