Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull — an architect of the stage 3 tax cuts — says he would not consider them now, given the state of the budget, but that Scott Morrison had made the situation worse by increasing their costs.The stage 3 tax cuts will abolish the 37 per cent marginal tax rate and lower the 32.5 per cent marginal tax rate to 30 per centThese cuts, due to come into effect in 2024, are set to cost the federal budget around $254 billion over a 10-year periodMalcolm Turnbull has cautioned Labor against scrapping the cuts, citing the electoral risk of going back on an election promise"I don't think you would legislate them, certainly not in the way they were changed in 2019, today," he told the ABC's The Business.
