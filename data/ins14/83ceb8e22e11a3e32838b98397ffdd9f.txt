Shares of semiconductor names Lam Research (LRCX 6.50%), Applied Materials (AMAT 1.50%), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.90%) were up strongly today before retreating somewhat with the overall market to a gain of 6.4%, 1.5%, and 2%, respectively, as of 12:44 p.m. EDT.  
Most tech stocks were up early today on the news of a drop in jobless claims, as well as the resignation of embattled U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss after only six weeks on the job. However, these chip-oriented names likely surged higher due to Lam Research's earnings beat last night, as well as its commentary about 2023 that may have reassured some investors.
