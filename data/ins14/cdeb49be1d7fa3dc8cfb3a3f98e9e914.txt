By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:45 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 23:45 EDT, 30 May 2022 Star Entertainment has been called to give evidence at an inquiry into proposed gambling and money laundering laws in Queensland. A parliamentary committee is probing the legislation introduced after probes into Crown and Star in multiple states. The changes would allow more cashless gambling, and impose penalties of up $50 million for legal breaches. Legal Affairs and Safety Committee chair Peter Russo says Star and Townsville operator Reef have been asked to give evidence at the inquiry starting on July 11.
