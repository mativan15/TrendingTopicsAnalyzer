Are we living through the movie 'Idiocracy'? 
In that spoof, Americans were dumbed down by a diet of silly television shows and stupid advertising, as well as porn stars and wrestlers famous for being famous. That led voters to elect political leaders who took the nation to the verge of starvation because they did not know to water crops. 
Well, that's an old satire. 
But what can you say about today's real life congressional leaders? 
It is no joke to watch them standing by in the last month as social media companies give platforms to gunmen to plan violence online.
