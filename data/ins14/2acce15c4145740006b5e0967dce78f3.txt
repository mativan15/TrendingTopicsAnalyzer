Even a 25% decline in the stock market is not enough to bring valuations down to attractive levels, Goldman Sachs' David Kostin said in a Friday note.The S&P 500 has made good progress during this year's downward trend on denting valuations, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio falling to 15.8x today from 21x at the start of the year. Still, a forward P/E multiple of 15.8x falls in the 66th percentile on a historical basis, according to the note."On top of this, many investors are skeptical about the EPS forecasts that underlie that metric," Kostin said.
