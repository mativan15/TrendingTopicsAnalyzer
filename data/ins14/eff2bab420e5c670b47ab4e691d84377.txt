Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Entertainment Kanye West agreed to buy conservative social-media app Parler just weeks after being kicked off of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for making antisemitic comments. Parlement Technologies announced on Monday that it entered into an agreement in principle to sell Parler, to Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), according to a statement. "In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves," Ye said in the statement.
