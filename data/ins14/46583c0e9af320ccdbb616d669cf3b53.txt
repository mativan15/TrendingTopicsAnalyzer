As the economy braces for a slowdown, these technology stocks could prove a bright spot for investors looking to play the market, Morgan Stanley says. Risks of an economic downturn continue to rise as inflation hovers near record highs and rate hikes from the Federal Reserve are underway for the first time in more than three years. Morgan Stanley is pricing in a 35% probability of a recession, up from a 5% estimate at the beginning of 2022. But in this environment of slowing economic growth, the bank said in a note Wednesday that opportunities exist in many beaten-up Big Tech names.
