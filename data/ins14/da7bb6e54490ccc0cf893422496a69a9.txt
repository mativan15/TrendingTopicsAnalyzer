Monday is set to be the busiest day for British airports in three years, a travel expert has claimed, as Britons were warned to brace for further delays and cancellations.Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said he believed the chaos at Britain's airports would get 'worse' following the Jubilee Bank Holiday.His warning came as aviation data firm Cirium said 291 departures from major UK airports had been cancelled between May 25 and Tuesday. Travel firm Tui also announced it had taken the 'incredibly difficult decision' to axe 43 flights a week for the rest of June at Manchester airport.
