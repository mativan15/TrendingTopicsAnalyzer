"What's going on guys? Pro the Doge here, A.K.A. SlumDoge Millionaire," Glauber Contessoto declares to his hundreds of thousands of followers online.Mr Contessoto has the kind of rags to riches tale that has drawn many people to cryptocurrency. "It took me two months to become a millionaire."According to his own account, Mr Contessoto grew up poor in a family that emigrated to the United States from Brazil and was determined to make money.He dabbled in the music business, dabbled in the stock market, and then, last year, turned to cryptocurrency — specifically Dogecoin, a digital currency based on an image of a Shibu Inu, a Japanese hunting dog, a popular internet meme.
