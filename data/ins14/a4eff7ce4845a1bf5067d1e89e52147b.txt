(Bloomberg) -- Tokyo's yen watchers continued to speculate whether Japan conducted a stealth intervention last week, zeroing in on the volatility seen after Thursday's surprise US inflation data.By one estimate, authorities may have spent around 1 trillion yen ($6.7 billion) to support the currency, a figure gleaned from a larger-than-expected Bank of Japan daily current account deficit. That would be just over a third of the 2.84 trillion yen spent in September, when Japan stepped in to help prop up the currency for the first time since 1998.
