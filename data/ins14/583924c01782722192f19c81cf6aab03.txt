Home renovations can be a real money pit—but for one English couple, remodeling their kitchen revealed a pit filled with money.

As the unnamed family peeled back the 18th century floorboards and concrete below their East Yorkshire home during a 2019 remodel, they unearthed a small pot filled with 264 gold coins that date back to the early 1600s. Those coins were just auctioned off one-by-one, going for a total of $842,330.

The coins are believed to have belonged to the Fernley-Maisters, a family which was involved in the Baltic maritime trade network out of the port city of Hull, located nearby to where the bounty was found.
