Another season marks another ALCS appearance for the Houston Astros, who have now reached the final round of the American League playoffs for a record sixth straight year after sweeping the Mariners in the ALDS on Saturday.

Houston has experienced significant success in the ALCS during this golden era. The Astros reached the World Series in 2017, 2019 and 2021, registering ALCS wins over the Yankees in 2017 and 2019, and over the Red Sox in a six-game series last year. Another victory against New York (or Cleveland, TBD) this season would give the Astros four World Series appearances in a six-year span, a mark exceeded only by the Yankees—who reached the championship round five times from 1996-2001—across the last 30 years.
