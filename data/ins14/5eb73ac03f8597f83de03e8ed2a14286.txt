Q: Names like Donovan Mitchell and Bradley Beal keep getting thrown out there as players the Heat should get this offseason. In the case of Mitchell, why would the Jazz take on a contract like Duncan Robinson's and what else would we need to throw in there to entice them? In the case of Beal, he would be forgoing a lot of money to sign with us would he not? – Jake, Tallahassee.
A: Because you never know unless you try. And this is something where the Heat get caught when Pat Riley talks of harpooning a whale and they come up empty.
