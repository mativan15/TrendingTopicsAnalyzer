metamorworks/iStock via Getty Images Signature Bank's (NASDAQ:SBNY) stock dipped 3.3% in Tuesday premarket trading as its third-quarter results came in mixed, though its bottom line exceeded expectations as its net interest income was buoyed by higher interest rates. Q3 EPS of $5.57 surpassed the average analyst estimate of $5.42 and jumped from $3.88 in the year-ago period. Total income of $717.74M, however, missed the Wall Street consensus of $737.63M, but climbed from $512.2M a year before. Net interest income (before provision for credit losses) shot up 40.
