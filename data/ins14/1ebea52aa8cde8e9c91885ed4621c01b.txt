Garmin is already a formidable brand in the world of smartwatches, and now it's revealed a pair of new Forerunner smartwatches – one of which, we're excited to say, is fitted with a solar panel to improve battery life.

Called the Forerunner 955 solar, this watch is also packed with health- and fitness-tracking features that we suspect will see it make an appearance in our roundup of the best Garmin watches, once we've tried it out for ourselves.
