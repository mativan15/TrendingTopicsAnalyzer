New Zealand's local hero of the year is urging South Cantabrians to help fill job vacancies for the 2023 census starting in late January. Dave 'Brown Buttabean' Letele has teamed up with Persolkelly Recruitment and is putting the call out to help fill 77 jobs in South Canterbury for a role he says 'gives back and gets you fit.' 'If we want change in our communities we first have to be seen and heard – and helping deliver the census is a great way to make sure your friends, whānau and neighbours are all counted,' Letele, in a media release, said.
