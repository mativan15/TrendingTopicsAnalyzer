LiAngelo Ball finds himself on the outside looking in as the Charlotte Hornets began finalizing their roster.

Ball was waived along with three others on Saturday, when the Hornets trimmed their 20-player training camp roster in advance of Wednesday's season opener in San Antonio. Jalen Crutcher, Xavier Sneed and Charlotte native Ty-Shon Alexander were also released, bringing the Hornets roster to 16. The maximum allowed is 17, leaving a spot presumably for restricted free agent Miles Bridges pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence case, which has been pushed back six times and for which the next hearing is scheduled Monday.
