The NSE Nifty 50 index was 0.73% higher at 17,311.80 at close, and the S&P BSE Sensex advanced 0.85% to 58,410.98. "Rallies triggered by market positioning will be temporary because there won't be any follow-on fundamental support for the rally," said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
