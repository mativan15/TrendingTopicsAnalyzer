Wellington Phoenix midfielder Yan Sasse has seen his three-game suspension reduced following an appeal. Sasse was slapped with the ban after he was sent off for serious foul play in the Phoenix's A-League Men season opening 1-1 draw with Adelaide United. The Brazilian slipped as he challenged for the ball and clattered into the legs of Adelaide defender Javi Lopez. The Phoenix challenged the decision to issue Sasse with a three-match suspension and were successful with their appeal, getting it downgraded to two games.
