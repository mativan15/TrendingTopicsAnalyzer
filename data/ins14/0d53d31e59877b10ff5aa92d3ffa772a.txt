Noting that there has been non-compliance of its earlier orders, the Delhi high court on Thursday summoned Joint secretary, Ministry of Sports for overlooking violation of the National Sports Code by several National Sports Federations (NSFs).A bench of Justices Najmi Waziri and Vikas Mahajan asked the official to appear before the court on June 3, while observing that the union government should ensure that financial aid is not given to these NSFs if they are not following the National Sports Code, 2011.
