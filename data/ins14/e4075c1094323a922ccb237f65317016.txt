Shares of Generac Holdings Inc. suffered a record selloff on Wednesday after the manufacturer of home generators and solar equipment issued an earnings warning and cut its growth outlook, citing pressure on residential sales.That prompted KeyBanc analyst Jeffrey Hammond to back away from his longtime bullish stance on the stock, saying it's 'tough to defend this one.' The stock GNRC, -24.44% plummeted 24.8% in afternoon trading, putting it on track for the lowest close since June 2020 and the biggest one-day decline by far since going public in February 2010.
