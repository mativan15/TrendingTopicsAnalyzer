Black Friday is typically one of the best times to bag a deal on an Apple Watch all year round. It's a calendar date that comes right at the end of the year - when you have several new models to contend with and generally plenty of stock on the older ones too. Right now, we've got some fantastic options, from the latest Apple Watch 8 and SE 2 to the older (and much cheaper) first-gen SE and Apple Watch Series 3.Simply put, there's wearable for everyone, and we expect every model to be featured in this year's Black Friday Apple Watch deals.
