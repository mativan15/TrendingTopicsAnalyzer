Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Chinese economy was now more inward-looking, less accessible and deeply ingrained with Xi's 'ideological touch.''It's not the China that I grew accustomed to for the last 30 years,' said Wuttke, who has lived in the country since 1993.Three decades ago, China's leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, captured the nation's attention with a tour of southeastern coastal cities to rally support for economic reforms. A wave of young people, inspired by Deng's commitment to open China to the rest of the world, flooded into major cities to pursue business opportunities.
