Back in May 2021, AT&T CEO John Stankey declared the company would put greater focus on expanding its fiber footprint. In fact, he went further and said AT&T would home in on "the single goal of offering the best fixed-broadband service in the market."In 2022, AT&T has leaned into that goal by announcing new multi-gig plans in more than 70 cities. The new speeds are available to just over 5 million customers right now, with that number expected to grow throughout 2022. So, where does that put AT&T now? If you're living in one of the 21 states where AT&T provides internet service and eligible for one of the company's fiber plans, then you're in a perfect spot.
