(Bloomberg) -- UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's government caved in to demands from MPs in her own Conservative Party to allow for a free vote on buffer zones to exclude protests around abortion clinics, a sign her party managers are keen to avoid clashes with mutinous backbenchers.The House of Commons is set to vote on Tuesday on a cross-party amendment to the government's Public Order Bill that would make it a criminal offense to harass, obstruct or interfere with any woman or member of staff arriving at an abortion clinic.
