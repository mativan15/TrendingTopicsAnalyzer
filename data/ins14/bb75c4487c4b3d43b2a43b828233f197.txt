Nick Sirianni threw his head back as he walked into Philadelphia's locker room and bellowed, ' How ‘bout them Eagles! ' The Eagles coach took delight in echoing the old Dallas catchphrase.

Sirianni had every reason to revel in the moment: The Eagles are the only undefeated team in the NFL.

That's right, 6-0 for only the third time in franchise history, and first since the 2004 season when Donovan McNabb, Terrell Owens & Co. raced all the way to the Super Bowl.

Jalen Hurts, C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Darius Slay have the Eagles thinking a return trip is in order after a 26-17 win over the Cowboys on Sunday night in front of a packed house that included first lady Jill Biden, rapper Meek Mill, Joel Embiid and actor Bradley Cooper.
