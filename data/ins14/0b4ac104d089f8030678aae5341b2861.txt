JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy defended his record against sharp criticism from two major rivals during a televised debate Wednesday, arguing the state is 'better off today than it was four years ago' under the administration of one of those challengers.

Independent former Gov. Bill Walker, who held the office from 2014 to 2018, and Democrat Les Gara disputed Dunleavy's characterization. Gara, a former state lawmaker, in response to questions frequently contrasted his positions to Dunleavy's.
