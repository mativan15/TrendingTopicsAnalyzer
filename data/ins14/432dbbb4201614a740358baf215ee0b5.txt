The NBA Finals have arrived and we should be in for a great matchup between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics. Let's see if we can start out the Finals with three props winners, too.
I've written about my takes on the series and Game 1 elsewhere, but it's important to note my Game 1 lean toward the Warriors here because it will inform my angles below.
I like the Warriors to win and cover because they've been incredible in Game 1s and are 21-2 since the start of the title runs in 2015, and because the Celtics have a serious rest disadvantage coming off a tough Game 7.
