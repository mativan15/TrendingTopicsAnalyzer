Captains of Indian industry took home an average 4% higher compensation last fiscal year, a moderate increase from the pre-pandemic period as boards increasingly link corner room payouts to performance and outcomes. The average increase in the compensation of professional chief executive officers and managing directors in fiscal 2022 was a tad higher than the 1% rise seen in FY21, but was less than the pre-Covid average hike of 7.5% in fiscal 2020, according to an ET analysis of 220 of the BSE 500 companies for which the numbers are available.
