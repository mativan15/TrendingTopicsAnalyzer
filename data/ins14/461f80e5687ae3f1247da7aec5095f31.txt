Intel expects the initial public offering of its Mobileye business unit to muster a valuation of $16 billion, a fraction of the nearly $50 billion figure the autonomous driving division was expected to fetch earlier this year.
According to an SEC filing [PDF] Tuesday, Intel will offer 41 million shares of common stock priced at between $18 and $20, which should raise $738 million to $820 million.
Intel announced in December its intent to take Mobileye public in mid-2022 via an IPO. By April, the chip giant appeared to take the first steps toward realizing this plan, tapping Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to lead the IPO targeting a valuation as high as $50 billion.
