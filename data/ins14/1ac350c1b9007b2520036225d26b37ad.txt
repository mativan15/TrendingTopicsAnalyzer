Shares of Union Pacific Corp. UNP, -0.78% dropped 5.0% toward a near two-year low in premarket trading Thursday, after the railroad operator reported third-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, due to increased pricing and fuel surcharges, but cut its outlook for carload growth and stock repurchases. Net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $3.05 a share, from $1.67 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $3.19 beat the FactSet consensus of $3.
