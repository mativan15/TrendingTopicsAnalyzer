Word on Thursday was that Patriots quarterback Mac Jones believes he'll be well enough to play on Monday night against the Bears after missing the last three games with an ankle injury, but Thursday's practice didn't do anything to confirm that.

Jones was listed as a limited participant on the team's first injury report of the week. That's the same level Jones was at during practice the last two weeks before being ruled out of playing on Sunday.
