Emphasizing the country's diversity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly radio broadcast 'Mann Ki Baat' on Sunday said the varied attire, cuisine and culture in different regions is the hallmark of India. In the 89th episode of Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi said, "Our country is a rich treasure house of many languages, scripts and dialects. Varied attire, cuisine and culture in different regions is our hallmark. As a nation, this diversity strengthens us and keeps us united. I wish to share with all of you a very inspiring example related to this, which is that of daughter Kalpana.
