In the recently concluded elections in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the ruling party in Tamil Nadu, most of those who already held the posts at different rungs in the party were re-elected unanimously, thus preserving the status quo even as the party seeks to build on its gains. There could have been no better time for such elections—the DMK is back in power in the State after a decade and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the party which has ruled Tamil Nadu the longest, is a pale shadow of its former self because of infighting and dissent.
