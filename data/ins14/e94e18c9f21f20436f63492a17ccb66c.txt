Mounties in Nanaimo, B.C., say they were in the process of arresting a robbery suspect when she herself was robbed by an opportunity-seeking thief. Police were called to a report of an armed robbery at the Co-op gas station at 60 Victoria Cres. at approximately 11 a.m. on Oct. 13. A 27-year-old woman allegedly pointed a gun at the clerk and made off with cash stuffed into a backpack. A responding officer found the woman still in the parking lot and holding a small, snubbed-nose pistol. The woman dropped the pack and the pistol, which the officer quickly determined was a plastic toy.
