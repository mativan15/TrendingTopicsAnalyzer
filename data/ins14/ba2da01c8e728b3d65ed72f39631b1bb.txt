D3Damon/iStock via Getty Images Background Novonix (NASDAQ:NVX) is at the cutting edge of disruptive battery material technology. Historically, battery anodes have been a mixture of nickel, cobalt, copper, and lithium for lithium-ion batteries. However, Novonix has introduced graphene as a substitute for some metals due to its strength and conductivity. Novonix then utilizes graphene technology in a new battery anode. This technology will enable battery producers to manufacture at scale since graphene can be made in a lab and doesn't need to be mined.
