CareRx Corp. CRRX-T (+13.68%)

Recently, the Toronto-based firm signed a contract to provide services to hundreds of seniors across facilities in Atlantic Canada. CareRx offers specialty pharmacy services, like delivering medications, to over 97,000 seniors in long-term care homes, retirement homes, assisted living facilities and group homes across Canada. After plunging almost 41 per cent since October 2021, news of the deal sent shares of CareRx up.
