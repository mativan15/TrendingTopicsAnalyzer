Saudah Karangwa, from east London, started 'prepping' after experiencing bare supermarket shelves during the pandemic.
'Seeing there were shortages and so many people panicking gave me a wake-up call,' she said.
When the war in Ukraine began in February, she intensified her efforts, fearing a similar crisis. She used as much of her savings as possible to gradually buy extra non-­perishable food and supplies. Ms Karangwa, a former nurse who is a stay-at-home mother with five children, now has enough for her family to be able to live comfortably for at least six months if needed.
