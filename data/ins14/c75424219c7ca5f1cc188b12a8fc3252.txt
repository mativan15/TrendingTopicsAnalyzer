Opposition parties in Punjab Monday slammed the ruling AAP's national convener Arvind Kejriwal for comparing party leaders Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain with freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and demanded an unconditional apology from him.
Punjab Congress chief Amrinder Singh Raja Warring lashed out at Kejriwal for his Sunday comments and said it was for the first time in history that someone had invoked the great martyr's name for corruption.
He asked why the Delhi chief minister was scared of investigations.
