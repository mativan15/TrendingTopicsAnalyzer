The Bank of England has confirmed it will push ahead with selling £80bn of UK government bonds from the start of next month, a day later than planned, despite fears over choppy conditions in financial markets after the mini-budget.The central bank said it would delay the start date to 1 November to avoid a clash with the government announcing its debt-cutting plan, which is due on Halloween.The decision to push ahead comes despite swirling speculation that Threadneedle Street could be forced into a lengthier delay in order to smooth over turmoil in bond markets after Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-received mini-budget.
