Viorika Get to Know FinWise FinWise (NASDAQ:FINW) share price is too cheap for a fast growing fintech firm and deserves to compete for a spot in your portfolio. FinWise is ripe for a share price upswing as it becomes more well known (11/2021 IPO) and works out of its miscategorized microcap ($117M) shell. On the surface FinWise is categorized as a run of the mill regional bank but their run of the mill services account for less than 4% of their revenue. FinWise would be more properly categorized as a financial technology bank that provides online lending services.
