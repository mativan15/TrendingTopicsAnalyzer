Embracing a more ambitious treaty platform could help Labor retain inner-city seats under threat from the Greens at next month's Victorian election without costing outer suburban votes, according to a new poll.The polling comes ahead of a landmark agreement between the Andrews government and the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria on the final elements of the state's treaty framework, which is expected to be announced before the election campaign begins in earnest on 1 November.The Redbridge polling was commissioned by the assembly – the body elected to develop the treaty framework – and was conducted last month.
