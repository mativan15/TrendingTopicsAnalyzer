A Wellington woman who is giving up her dogs because she is living in a van says the Government needs to act on the housing crisis. Ariel Rose, 39, is looking for homes for her two pitbull cross dogs, Amy and Eddie, four-year-old litter-mates that she has raised since they were puppies. 'I'm in a very difficult situation and I am living in my vehicle,' Rose said. 'I've hand-raised these dogs and both are fully vaccinated, used to be boarded and de-sexed. They are good friends but our situation is very hard, and I need some help.
