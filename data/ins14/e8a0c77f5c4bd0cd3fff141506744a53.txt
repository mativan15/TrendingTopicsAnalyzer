David and Viv Boardman have just arrived in Germany after a long bus-ride between Lille and Dusseldorf. They're in the middle of a five-month stint backpacking around Europe, America and Australia, deciding where to go a week in advance, and they'll return home when their money runs out. They haven't recently finished school or university – they're both 66 and on a 'grey gap year'.The pair are spending several months exploring the world for the first time in their lives after growing up in a time when extended travel was not the norm.
