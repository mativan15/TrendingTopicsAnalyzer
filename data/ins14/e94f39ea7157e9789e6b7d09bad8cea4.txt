LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Liz Truss is fighting to remain in power after the collapse of her economic programme shattered her authority just over six weeks into the job.The sight of Truss sitting expressionless in parliament on Monday as her new finance minister ripped up the programme of tax cuts and deregulation that secured her elevation to Downing Street has prompted calls for the 47-year-old to quit.Already a handful of Truss's Conservative lawmakers have said she must stand down, but Britain's dominant political party is deeply divided after 12 years in power, limiting its ability to agree on a replacement that could unite the warring factions.
