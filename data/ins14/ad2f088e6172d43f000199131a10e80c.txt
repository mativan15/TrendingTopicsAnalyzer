By Reuters Published: 21:19 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 21:19 EDT, 20 October 2022 Oct 20 (Reuters) - Peru's finance ministry on Thursday called for "urgent measures" after Fitch Ratings revised Peru's credit rating outlook to negative on its recurrent political turmoil, adding it had put the country's investment grade at risk. Fitch said earlier on Thursday that a deterioration in political stability and government effectiveness had increased downside risks to the country's ratings. It affirmed Peru's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating at "BBB," just one notch above junk.
