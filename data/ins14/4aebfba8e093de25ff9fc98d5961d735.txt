Washington's warning was prompted by a row over the takeover of British firm Ultra Electronics, a supplier of secret tech to nuclear submarines. Cobham, the private equity-backed buyer, is another UK defence business. However, if the deal goes ahead, it will in effect put Ultra under the control of the American Advent International, which has owned Cobham for the past 18 months and has already sold off most of its assets.Intelligence sources said Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will jeopardise future partnerships between the UK and US if he blocks the £2.
