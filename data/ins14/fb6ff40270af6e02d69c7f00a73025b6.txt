(Bloomberg) -- South Korean lawmakers plan to discuss stepping up government oversight of Kakao Corp. after hours-long service outages over the weekend prompted criticism over the internet giant's reliability. The ruling People Power Party said its lawmakers and government officials will meet Wednesday to discuss possible revisions to the broadcasting communications law so that private data centers, such as those housing Kakao and Naver Corp. servers, come under the same regulations as other national disaster management facilities during emergencies.
