The 2022 Austin Regional will have no shortage of fireworks.
Perennial powerhouse Texas will host dominant mid-major programs Louisiana Tech, Dallas Baptist and the high flying offense of the Air Force Falcons.
No. 9 Texas (42-19) has had a roller coaster of a season. The Longhorns ranked No. 1 in the country to start the season and looked the part through the first two weeks. Texas enjoyed wins over Alabama, Tennessee and LSU before news broke that preseason All-American Tanner Witt would miss the rest of the season with an elbow injury.
