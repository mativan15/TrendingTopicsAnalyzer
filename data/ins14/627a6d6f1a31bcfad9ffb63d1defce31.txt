Steelmaking in Britain could be at risk unless the government provides more support for the industry to adopt green technologies, MPs have warned.MPs on the environmental audit committee said they had heard evidence that government initiatives to support decarbonisation 'lacked ambition compared with other countries'.The committee has written to Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, to express concern that 'unless investment is forthcoming in clean steel technologies and facilities in the UK, there is a real risk of further contraction of the industry in the UK, with increased dependency on imported steel in future'.
