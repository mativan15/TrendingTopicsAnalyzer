We're just over halfway through the month now, which means there's a fresh batch of Xbox Game Pass games, but unfortunately a number of titles will also be leaving the service soon.The first title alphabetically to be leaving Game Pass is Remedy Entertainment's Alan Wake: American Nightmare, the 2012 spin-off/ follow-up to the main game, Alan Wake. American Nightmare will no longer be on Game Pass from October 31, as will the rest of the titles leaving the service. The incredibly beautiful Backbone, where you play as a raccoon detective with a post-noir setting, will also be leaving.
