Emily Maere had gone into the city of Blantyre to buy stock for her little grocery shop. As usual, she decided not to travel with cash but to use an ATM when she got there.This time, Maere, 25, from Neno in southern Malawi, was mugged. To her shock, her attackers were children. 'No sooner had I finished the withdrawal than the group of street children attacked me, snatching my purse,' she says.Last month, a homeless 16-year-old, Precious Kalajila, was shot by police at 2am on the streets of the capital, Lilongwe.
