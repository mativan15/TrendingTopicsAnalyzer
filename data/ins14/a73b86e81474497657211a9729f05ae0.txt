Thursday, June 2, 2022 Bloomberg, Treasury Tax Official Leaving Biden Administration: The Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary of tax analysis, Kimberly Clausing, is leaving the Biden administration. Clausing, an expert on corporate profit shifting, was part of the administration's team that sought to recoup money the government was owed but didn't collect. She pushed to increase taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans, including upping the domestic corporate rate to 28%. Tuesday was her last day, according to people familiar with the matter.
