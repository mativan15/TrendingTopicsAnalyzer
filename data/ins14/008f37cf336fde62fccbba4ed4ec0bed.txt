Indiewire 'Thank you for communicating and being like family. I love you for that,' Star (Sarah Walker) tells An (Ziyin Zheng) in the final moments of 'Queens of the Qing Dynasty.' The moment feels like a closure point, as if the close friendship between the characters has run its course. But rather than a goodbye, it instead feels like the friendship is being put in a box, carefully placed in the back of a closet. The intensity of this moment for Star and An is over, but they are both forever changed simply by knowing each other.
