An alleged phone call made by an inmate of Tihar jail, Shahrukh, to Canada has been detected by the Delhi Police's Special Cell. During the probe into the murder case of Sidhu Moose Wala, a call was reportedly traced to have originated from the Tihar jail, said sources.

Sources said Shahrukh was allegedly using a mobile application to talk to Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, who has claimed the responsibility for killing Sidhu Moose Wala. 
Soon after the detection, Shahrukh was brought to the Special Cell office for questioning.
