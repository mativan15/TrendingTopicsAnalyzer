Qualcomm has put up some eye-popping growth numbers under CEO Cristiano Amon while also expanding into hot areas such as in-car technology.

However, shares of the tech giant are trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of about 10.7 times — more comparable to a stodgy value stock than a fast-growing tech company like Qualcomm.

Amon says investors should rethink how they are viewing Qualcomm, and do it quickly.

"I think it's really a mistake for the market to continue to look at Qualcomm and say this is a communications company for the mobile market.
