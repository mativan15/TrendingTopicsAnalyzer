HOUSTON — This was the steal game.
The Astros rolled out one substantial advantage from lots of rest to home field to having the likely AL Cy Young winner in Justin Verlander making his 32nd postseason start against Jameson Taillon — a No. 4 starter making his playoff starting debut.
And as lopsided as it all sounds, the Yankees had a chance to steal this game and all the positive implications that would have gone along with taking the opener of this AL Championship Series. But that didn't happen.
