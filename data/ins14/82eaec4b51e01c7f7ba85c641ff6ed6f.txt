Universities will be required to ring-fence more places for students outside the CAO points race under new Government policy proposals.The proposals form part of a wider plan to create a more 'unified' third level system with stronger links between further education and higher education.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris said reform of third level must involve creating better pathways between the further education and higher education sector.'I want a system where, irrespective of whether a learner enters into further or higher education or a research career, the system responds to their individual talents, ambitions and motivations, ensuring that their every step is a step forward,' Mr Harris said.
