Ministers have been warned of potential power cuts to as many as six million households this winter, with the Government reportedly drawing up plans for rationed electricity if supply issues deteriorate.Government modelling of a 'reasonable' worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages in winter if Russia cuts off more supplies to the EU, it's claimed. Limits could be imposed on industrial use of gas, including on gas-fired power stations, causing electricity shortages.As a result, six million homes could see their electricity rationed, primarily during morning and evening peaks, in curbs that may last more than a month, according to The Times.
