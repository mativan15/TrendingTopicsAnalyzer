The Manitoba Moose kicked off their 2022-23 regular season Saturday with a matinee tilt against the Rockford Icehogs. Despite the 5 - 4 overtime loss at the home opener, marketing manager Raquel Payne said the Moose are excited to be back on the ice, "We came off such high energy games last season, and we've been waiting for this moment to come back and show (the fans) that redemption mode," she said. Payne said the team has a good mix of new young talent and older experience. "Every year we get some new faces, and we have some veterans as well, so having that mix kind of puts up in a really good spot we get new energy, but we also have that familiarity for fans to recognize and come back and root on those guys," she said.
