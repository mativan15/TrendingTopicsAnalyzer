Buyers who want to make Central Denver their home can take advantage of the final opportunity to buy a CityHomes at Boulevard One luxury townhome from Koelbel Urban Town Homes. Koelbel has two townhomes from its Atlas Series available and plans to release three more soon.
'Due to a high demand for housing, Koelbel is releasing a limited number of homes at a time so we can better manage our construction timeline,' says Dana Keller, Koelbel's vice president of sales and marketing. Join Koelbel's interest list to stay up to date on available properties.
