While the inside of a jail cell would be cause for fright under normal circumstances, its conversion into a haunted maze on Sunday offered a much more fun, although still scary, experience.   Thousands attended the return of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station's Haunted Jailhouse and Carnival, marking the first time it's been held since 2019. The event, once again done in collaboration with the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Clarita Valley, was also the first to be held at the new sheriff's station on Golden Valley Road.
