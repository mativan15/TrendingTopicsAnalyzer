NEW DELHI: The Congress party has come down heavily against the central government over summons by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against interim party president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul in connection with the alleged National Herald money laundering case. Addressing a press conference in the national capital, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said 'those who believe in the ideology to support the British rule are now conspiring to clamp down the voice of the Independence movement'. The ED has summoned Sonia Gandhi on June 8 in connection with the case.
