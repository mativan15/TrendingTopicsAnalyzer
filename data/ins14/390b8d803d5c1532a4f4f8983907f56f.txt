The Arizona Cardinals offense is broken. It has been since Dec. 13, 2021. That was the last time star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins suited up for the Cards.
Since that date, the team has struggled to find the form that allowed it to win the first seven games of 2021 and build a 10-3 record through that fateful date when Hopkins suffered a season-ending knee injury.
Arizona lost three of the next four games before losing one of the ugliest playoff games in recent memory to the Los Angeles Rams. The struggles have carried over into this season, where the Cardinals are off to a 2-4 start and Kyler Murray has yet to find the type of production that made this offense so lethal with Hopkins.
