Eddie Jones finalises his squad for the autumn internationals this morning as England prepare to face Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa in November.
England will definitely be without first-choice hooker Jamie George, who is out of action for 10 weeks with a foot injury, meaning Exeter's Luke Cowan-Dickie is likely to be handed the No 2 shirt. There was better news on the injury front with England captain Courtney Lawes returning to contract training with Northampton Saints following concussion.
