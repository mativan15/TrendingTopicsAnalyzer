I invested in Tesla early and now have a low 8-figure nest egg. I want to live off the interest and leave my kids money so they ‘don't have to struggle like I had to.' Do I need a financial adviser?

Getty Images Question: I'm considering quitting working soon. I invested in Tesla early on and 100x-ed and am at a very low eight-figure value now. I see several funds claiming to return around 10% annually, but I am afraid considering Madoff had similar return schedules. However, the alternative of financial planners only offering 3-4% seems unimpressive, especially considering inflation these days. Don't financial advisors return very little? What is a realistic return I can expect if I want to preserve my principle and live off of interest so I can leave that to my children so they don't have to struggle like I had to?
