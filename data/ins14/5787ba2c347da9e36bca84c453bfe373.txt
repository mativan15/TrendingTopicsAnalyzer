Actress Anna May Wong is set to become the first Asian American to be featured on US currency.

The US Mint will begin shipping more than 300 million coins featuring actress on 24 October, with Ventris Gibson, the director of the US Mint, describing Wong as 'a courageous advocate who championed for increased representation and more multi-dimensional roles for Asian American actors".

"This quarter is designed to reflect the breadth and depth of accomplishments by Anna May Wong, who overcame challenges and obstacles she faced during her lifetime," said Gibson.
