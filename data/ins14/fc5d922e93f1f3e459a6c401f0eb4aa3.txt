Sudhakaran, while answering a query during an interview on how different are politicians from southern Kerala when compared with those from the Malabar region, had said that while returning from Lanka on the Pushpaka Vimanam, after defeating Ravana, Lakshman briefly entertained the thought of pushing his brother -- Lord Ram -- into the sea and go away with his wife Sita.
