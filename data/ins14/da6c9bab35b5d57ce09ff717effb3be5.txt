Few developers would willingly shun the past creations of their studio, but Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson is one of them. He's itching to draw a line in the sand, and clear up a popular misgiving: Diablo Immortal is not simply Diablo 3 on your phone. For Fergusson, it's much more. A fully-fledged MMORPG that will support buckets of social systems at launch and live service content for years to come, it's a grand expansion of the core Diablo formula. It's also a change of pace. With a mobile-first design that's allowed for granular experimentation right the way down to its control scheme, the game's taking significant deviations from its action RPG stablemates.
