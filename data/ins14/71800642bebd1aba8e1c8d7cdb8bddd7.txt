Published October 21, 2022 11:33pm EDT Fox News host Sean Hannity slammed Democratic leadership over the last two years in Friday's opening monologue and says the left's agenda is a "failure" while heading into the 2022 midterm elections. SEAN HANNITY: After two years with Democrats in control, the House, the Senate, the White House, Americans are less safe, they are less secure, they have less money, they have more debt. Their energy costs and grocery costs are through the roof. More than two thirds of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
