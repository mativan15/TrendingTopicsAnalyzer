PMK president Anbumani Ramadoss on Sunday said that decision of the Fee Fixation Committee to hike the fees of private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu by ₹35,000 – ₹1,00,000 and the maximum fee that can be charged being fixed at ₹29.40 lakh was unjustified. Dr. Anbumani added the government must create a situation where poor and middle class students are also able to study in private medical colleges without experiencing financial burden. The State and Central government didn't intervene when the private medical colleges managed to dismantle Medical Council of India's direction that 50% of the seats in private medical colleges should be charged the same fee charged in government medical colleges, he charged.
