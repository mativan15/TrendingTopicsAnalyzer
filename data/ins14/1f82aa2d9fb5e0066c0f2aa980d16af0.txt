There's a new ramen shop in Oakland, California, and something wild happened last Friday. A woman ran into the restaurant . . . saying her life was in danger . . . and a man ran in after her and put her in a chokehold. The employees at the restaurant were dressed as Power Rangers . . . yes, seriously . . . and they immediately jumped to the woman's aid. The Yellow Ranger and the Black Ranger asked the man to leave, but then he swung at them.
