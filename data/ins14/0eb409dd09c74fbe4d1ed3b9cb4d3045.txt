Albany Democrats are slated to pass legislation this week imposing new restrictions on semi-automatic rifles, bullet-proof vests and large-capacity magazines following deadly mass shootings in Buffalo and Texas. 
'New York already has some of the toughest gun laws in the country but clearly we need to make them even stronger. New Yorkers deserve to feel safe in schools, in grocery stores, in movie theaters, in shopping malls and on our streets,' Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a release on the measures.
