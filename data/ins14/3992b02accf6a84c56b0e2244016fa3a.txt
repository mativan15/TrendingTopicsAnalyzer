South Carolina A three-bed house in South Carolina has been sold as an NFT (non-fungible token) to a real estate investor for $175,000.The sale of the house was paid for in USD Coins—a digital stablecoin pegged to the United States dollar—through the NFT marketplace Roofstock onChain."I never imagined I could buy and finance a house with a simple click, rather than going through the time-consuming and cumbersome traditional settlement and mortgage process," said Adam Slipakoff, a seasoned real estate investor and the buyer of the property, in a press release.
