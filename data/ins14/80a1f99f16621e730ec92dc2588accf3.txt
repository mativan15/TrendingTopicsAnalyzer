ASHLAND – Arrows Landing, a housing complex under construction meant to help spur economic development has raised questions within the city's school district about the loss of potential tax revenue.

The Mifflin Avenue development is within a 100% community reinvestment area (CRA), which means property owners would be in line for a tax break. For the CRA to kick in for housing, 12 or more units have to be built in the area.
