The Carolina Disability Alliance at UNC-Chapel Hill's Kenan-Flagler Business School is launching a new conference aimed at connecting employers with MBA graduate students, recent MBA grads and business students in their final years of undergraduate study.

Held Nov. 11-13, EMPWR 2022: Beyond Accessibility has been envisioned to bring qualified talent that goes largely untapped – aka: the disability community – to the table with leading businesses. About 25 percent of the U.S. population is in the disabled community, and yet EMPWR estimates that only about 5 percent of employees at top firms are self-identifying as disabled.
