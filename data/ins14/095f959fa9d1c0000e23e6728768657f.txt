Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) said Tuesday that it expects its total sales to remain flat in 2023, with more marked growth starting the following year — though, it said it hopes to work with more small and mid-size contractors to drive more growth in the meantime.

In its third-quarter earnings call with analysts, Chairman, President and CEO James Taiclet said Tuesday that while the Bethesda defense giant beat earnings estimates and increased its contract backlog by $5 billion to $140 billion, it expects global supply chain challenges will continue to slow production of its flagship F-35 fighter jets and other aircraft for another 15 months or so.
