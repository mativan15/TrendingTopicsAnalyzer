The U.K.'s opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has joined calls for Liz Truss to give up the roughly $130,000 a year of public money she is set to be entitled to as a former British prime minister. 'She should turn it down,' Starmer said during a TV appearance Friday. 'I think that's the right thing to do. She's done 44 days in office, she's not really entitled to it, she should turn it down and not take it.' The generous allowance was first made available after the resignation of Margaret Thatcher in order to provide assistance to former prime ministers still active in public affairs.
