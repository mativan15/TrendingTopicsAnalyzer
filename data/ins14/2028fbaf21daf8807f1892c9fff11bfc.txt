Yasmin Evans is ready to get her sequins on and shimmy across the Strictly Come Dancing ballroom after revealing her dreams of appearing on the hit series.
The Heart Radio presenter has made her ‘obsession' with the BBC competition crystal clear and has even put her agent on the case of getting her signed up for the show. 
However, luck wasn't on her side this year with Strictly currently in full swing with the likes of Will Mellor, Fleur East and Kym Marsh among those who won a spot on the line-up.
