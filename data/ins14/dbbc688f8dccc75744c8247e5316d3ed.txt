National Australia Bank Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan said the increased frequency of flooding in Australia and New Zealand is prompting the lender to rethink its funding in areas prone to inundation in the future.

The more extreme weather patterns will have an impact on insurance premiums, which will affect whether people can continue to live in areas vulnerable to flooding, McEwan said Tuesday at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle event at the Australian High Commission in Wellington.
