Elon Musk said he will continue to fund Starlink satellites in Ukraine 'for free' after a recent standoff with the US Department of Defense over the cost of their deployment.

The shift comes a day after Musk threatened to cut financial support for SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine, having claimed that the operation had cost his company $80 million so far. The Pentagon had responded by confirming it's in talks with SpaceX, while adding that the US is looking at other options.
