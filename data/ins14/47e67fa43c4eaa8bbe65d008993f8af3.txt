People living in rural, regional and remote communities across NSW are being encouraged to have their say on a new plan for the future of regional health.

Minister for Regional Health Bronnie Taylor said the community's feedback will be absolutely critical in developing the Regional Health Plan 2022-2032.



'We know our regional communities care deeply about their healthcare services and this is their opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to shaping the future of their healthcare system,' Mrs Taylor said.
