'Now it officially gets dark,' Bill Hader says of the opening sequence in 'Barry' Season 3 Episode 7 – as if this season hasn't already been dark enough. But as the HBO series' third season nears its conclusion, the story is barreling towards levels of darkness and intensity it hasn't hit before.

That's all by design, Hader said in TheWrap's latest episodic interview with the co-creator, who also directed these final two episodes of the season. Barry finds himself in the custody of the father of Ryan Madison, the man he was originally sent to Los Angeles to kill in the show's first episode.
