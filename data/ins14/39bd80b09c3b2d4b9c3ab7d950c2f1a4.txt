Greens housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather said Labor's plan was barely a drop in the ocean, noting modelling had shown the need for social and affordable housing increased by about 14,000 homes a year.'It's not even a question of not being good enough, it will literally see the situation get worse,' he said.The Greens, who want to see 275,000 social and affordable homes built in five years, are willing to negotiate to see the legislation passed. Chandler-Mather said he wanted a commitment to fund more homes, and the government should begin work right now to build them.
