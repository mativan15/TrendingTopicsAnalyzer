Not too happy with your purchase on Steam and want your money back? Well, there's some rules you'll need to play by first.
Valve's Steam storefront is basically the face of PC gaming. Despite efforts by Epic Games to court people with their wild sales and free games, Steam is still where it's at. 
Originally launched in 2004, specifically for Half-Life and Counter-Strike series, it soon morphed from a buggy way to access Vale's own games to an industry-dominating store. 
However, in 2015, after the European Union came down hard on Valve for its zero-refund policy, Steam relented, but the hoops you have to jump through to get your money back can be pretty confusing.
