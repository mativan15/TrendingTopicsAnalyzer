Collider.com Trigger Warning: The following includes references to suicide. Hollywood's silent film beginnings launched the careers of legendary actors, the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Mary Pickford. Their names live on, the embodiments of an era that would revolutionize entertainment for the masses. One name, however, is often overlooked: Lon Chaney. One may not be familiar with his works, but you would definitely know the face... or at least one of his 'thousand faces', Quasimodo from the 1923 silent film The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or the Man in the Beaver Hat from1927's London After Midnight – a look that inspired the appearance of the monster in The Babadook – for example.
