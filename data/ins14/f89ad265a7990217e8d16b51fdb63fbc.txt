Texas is trying to add requirements to the FTX acquisition of assets from Voyager Digital, which is operating under federal bankruptcy court protection, claiming both cryptocurrency exchanges are not complying with state laws. Documents filed in the bankruptcy case on Friday also revealed that FTX and its principals, including CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, are under investigation by the Texas State Securities Board. The state alleged in a limited objection to the asset purchase that FTX and Voyager are operating money-transmission businesses without required licenses.
