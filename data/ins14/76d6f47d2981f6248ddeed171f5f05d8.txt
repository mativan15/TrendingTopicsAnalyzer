Tyreek Hill just wanted some attention.

Or some more followers on social media.

Or your, um, underwear in a wad.

It's a warm, still Sunday afternoon, and Hill has returned to Kansas City for a youth football camp he scheduled before the Chiefs traded him to Miami in March. In a seven-minute interview, it's evident he still feels some sort of attachment to this place, and even more so this place to him. About 700 kids shelled out $350 a pop for the camp.

But in the moments after he reminisces — 'Kansas City is always gonna have my heart,' he opened — he wants to applaud his own work this week.
