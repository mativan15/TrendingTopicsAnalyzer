Florida Panthers

Trailing by a goal early on Saturday against the Buffalo Sabres, Florida Panthers forward Colin White found his way to the slot after an offensive zone faceoff. Anton Lundell scooped up the loose puck behind the net and sent a pass to Eetu Luostarinen, who quickly fed it to White.

White then ripped a one-timer that got past Eric Comrie, his first with the Panthers and the 100th point of his NHL career.

'It was awesome,' White said during an intermission interview on Bally Sports Florida.
