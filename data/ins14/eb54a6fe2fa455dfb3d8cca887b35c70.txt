Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are the upcoming next monster-catching games that will see players transported to a new region with new and returning Pokémon on the Nintendo Switch.Pokémon has traditionally released new generations of games as two separate titles, starting with Red and Blue, each with its own exclusive monsters, when the franchise first launched in 1996. Scarlet and Violet look to continue that trend after the standalone Pokémon Legends: Arceus.Now, the Pokémon Company has announced that a new trailer will be arriving in June to show off new features players can expect in the next instalment.
