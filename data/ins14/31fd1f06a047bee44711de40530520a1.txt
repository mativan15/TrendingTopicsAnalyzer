NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The global faucet market is fragmented, with the presence of a large number of players. In addition, the unorganized sector in emerging economies dilutes the market share of global players in the region. To tackle this and maintain competitiveness, organized players are focusing on product differentiation through technological advancements as well as pricing their products at lower rates. The vendors in the market are also focusing on launching products with longer lifecycles and increasing the cost of switching between the products.
