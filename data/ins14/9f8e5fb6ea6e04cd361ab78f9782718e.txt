The finance ministry has asked key infrastructure ministries and departments to speed up projects, setting a target of achieving at least 60% of the FY23 capital expenditure budget target by the end of September. North Block wants to push capital expenditure to support the economy buffeted by high inflation, geopolitical risk and monetary tightening. "We aim to achieve about ₹4.45 lakh crore, which is 60% of the annual target, by the September quarter," a government official told ET, adding that infrastructure projects will be closely monitored to prevent any delays.
