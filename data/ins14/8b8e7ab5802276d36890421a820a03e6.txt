What qualifies you to hold this position? I have always been drawn to public service. I entered this race to offer neighbors a choice to the status quo representation of late. Since entering 'choice' has become an important right to preserve. I will fight for the medical healthcare decisions for a woman (or anyone for that matter!) be between their medical doctor and themselves PERIOD!

What would your top priorities be if elected? Preserving and individual's right to make their own healthcare choices.
