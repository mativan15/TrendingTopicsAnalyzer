The lessons Joshua Hanosh learned in running a nonprofit animal sanctuary provided the framework for his digital marketing agency.

Hanosh and his wife, Danielle, founded Blackberry Creek Animal Sanctuary in Colfax in 2014 as a way to rescue animals and teach and provide therapy to youth and adults. In the process of running the nonprofit, he learned the ins and outs of marketing and building a website, which led the former math and computer science teacher to quit his job and start his own company called Dedicated Designs.
