EXCLUSIVE: Children's TV bosses from all over the world met at Mip Junior last night to discuss major challenges and seek co-production alliances, as the BBC's Patricia Hidalgo tells Deadline a commercial strategy is the best way to safeguard kids programing. 

	The group of around 20 people who run children's public broadcasting channels from the likes of Australia, France, Italy, Spain and Scandinavia talked about the immense challenges faced from wealthy competitors, according to BBC Children's & Education Chief Hidalgo, as inflation pushes up costs and under-18s' attention turns elsewhere.
