Pubs, bars and clubs across England and Wales will be allowed to stay open for longer to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee during the Bank Holiday weekend.

Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrated her 96th birthday in April, became the first British monarch to reach the milestone after celebrating the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne on 6 February 2022.
