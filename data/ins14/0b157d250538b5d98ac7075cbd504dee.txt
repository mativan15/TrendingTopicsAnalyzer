PHILADELPHIA–Philadelphia 76ers star James Harden has been doubted recently. After a bit of a down year in the 2021-22 season where the hamstring injury was really bothering him and was clearly affecting his efficiency, there were whispers that it was curtains for him.
However, he has been terrific in these first two games to start the season and he had 31 points with 16 coming in the fourth quarter in Thursday's 90-88 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Philadelphia found themselves trailing Milwaukee by 13 in the fourth quarter before Harden went off in order to lead the Sixers to a near comeback before the Bucks closed it out.
