Canopy Growth Corp. shares fell sharply on Friday after the cannabis company posted a wider-than-expected loss and said it continues to face headwinds in its core Canadian cannabis business. Canopy Growth said its recreational business-to-business net sales fell 40% in Canada because of insufficient supply of 'in-demand' flower products and 'continued price compression' particularly in the value-price dried flower business. Business-to-consumer sales in Canadian cannabis fell 26%, 'driven by increased competition from the rapid increase in third party retail locations,' the company said.
