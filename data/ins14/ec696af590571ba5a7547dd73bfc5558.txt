Tulsi Gabbard called US President Joe Biden 'Adolf Hitler' and said that the two feel that they know best on how to lead a country. According to former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Biden is promoting war by arming Ukraine against Russia as the war in Europe continues unabated. Tulsi Gabbard was campaigning with Republican Senate hopeful Don Bolduc in Manchester, when she denounced Joe Biden's speech in Philadelphia. 
During the speech, the US President Biden said that those who did not vote for him and the Democratic party and were backing former US President Donald Trump, showed that they were with the extremists.
