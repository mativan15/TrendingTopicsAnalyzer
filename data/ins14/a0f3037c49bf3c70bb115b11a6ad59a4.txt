Cedar Fair L.P. FUN, -1.33% said Thursday that year-to-date revenue through Memorial Day weekend was $343 million, a record for the period and up 21% from the same period a year ago, as general demand and season pass attendance remain ahead of pre-pandemic 2019 levels. The increase from last year was driven by a 28% rise in per capita in-park spending to a record $59.70, and 13% growth in out-of-park revenue to $45 million. Those increases helped offset a 210,000 decline in attendance to 5.2 million guests, hurt by 14 fewer days in the latest period and continued disruption within group sales.
