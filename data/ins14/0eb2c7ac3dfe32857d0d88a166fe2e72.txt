The NHS is setting up data-driven "war rooms" as it prepares for what could be England's "toughest winter on record", new plans have revealed.Under the government's winter preparation plan, which aims to help the NHS cope during the colder months, the 24/7 "care traffic control centres" are expected to be created in every local area.
The hubs, led by teams of clinicians and experts, will manage demand and capacity across England by constantly tracking the number of beds available and people attending hospital.
