My doctor recommended I start getting regular mammograms a couple of years ago.

I have dense breast tissue, which makes it harder to detect potential problems in mammograms.

I wish I could get my ultrasound right after my annual mammogram and not wait several days.

Several years ago, I started to get regular mammograms, as recommended by my doctor, and quickly discovered that "routine," for me, was far from routine.

I'm one of the 40% to 50% of women in my age bracket who have dense breast tissue.
