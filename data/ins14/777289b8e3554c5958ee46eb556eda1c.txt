Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on May 28 congratulated Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik for "exposing" the farce behind the 'drugs on cruise' case involving Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. Talking to reporters in Kolhapur, Mr. Raut said, 'Malik is paying the price for exposing the farce behind the case and the real face of the BJP.' The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on May 27 gave a clean chit to Aryan Khan in the 'drugs on cruise' case, in which he was arrested and spent 22 days in jail.
