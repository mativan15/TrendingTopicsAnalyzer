Lawyers filed a multimillion-pound claim on Friday against administrators of the collapsed fund of Neil Woodford, the fallen star of British stock picking, in an attempt to recoup heavy losses of hundreds of thousands of savers.It marks the third anniversary of the suspension of the Woodford Equity Income Fund, which managed £3.7bn when it was frozen on June 3 2019 after investors rushed to withdraw their money.Many investors were unable to access trapped savings as the collapse ballooned into the biggest British investment scandal of the decade, destroying the reputation of Woodford, once regarded by many as the country's most celebrated and successful fund manager.
