Kingston city councillors that served from 2018 to 2022 faced a term like no other council has experienced, featuring the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing drug poisoning and housing crises.
Gearing up for Monday's municipal election, half of the current councillors will not be seeking re-election.'I was fortunate in the last four years that I worked on two jobs that I'm really passionate about, but it really lead to a life that had no balance,' says outgoing city councillor Bridget Doherty.For many councillors, the workload alongside other jobs and responsibilities proves difficult.
