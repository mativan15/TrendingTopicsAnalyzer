Jeremy Hunt is to delay a penny cut in income tax, the flagship announcement in the disastrous mini-budget, to help plug a black hole in the public finances that had reached £72 billion.In the latest in a series of government U-turns, the new chancellor is expected to announce that plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax next April will be pushed back by a year.The cut to 19 per cent will now take effect at the time previously proposed by Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, who was Liz Truss's leadership rival.
