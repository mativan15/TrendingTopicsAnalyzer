Congress said the "premature" release of the convicts in the Bilkis Bano case "is a stain" on the central government that can never be washed off. AICC spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the Modi government that had "maintained a studied and deliberate silence" at the time of the release of the convicts, was finally "constrained by the orders of the Supreme Court" to reveal that not only was the Ministry of Home Affairs aware of the release, but that it actually supported it, in defiance of the objections by senior officials of the CBI and a special judge.
