U.S. equity futures slipped in pre-market trading Tuesday after a bounce last week snapped the longest losing streak for the S&P 500 in over 20 years.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 dipped 0.3%, and Dow Jones Industrial futures fell 120 points, or 0.4%. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq Composite traded near the flatline. The moves come after all three indexes logged weekly gains of more than 6%, clawing back from seven consecutive losing weeks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and eight weeks of losses for the Dow.
