A puppy farming gang raked in £850,000 from selling sick and dying dogs to unsuspecting owners who were left with expensive vet bills.

The four members of the gang advertised dogs as 'bred at home' in Essex – when in fact many were sourced from unlicensed puppy farms in Swindon and Wales.

One of the group, Stacey Hayward, had her licence to sell puppies revoked in 2018 due to so many falling ill and her breeder's license expired later that year.
