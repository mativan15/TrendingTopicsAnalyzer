Published: 09:34 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 09:34 EDT, 17 October 2022 China's ruling Communist Party says it has investigated almost five million members for possible corruption over the last decade, with formal criminal cases brought against 553. Whether that will curb a widening economic slowdown and restore faith in the authoritarian system remains unclear. The party has 96 million members and has long run its own internal system of keeping cadres in line through a mix of offering privileges and threatening severe punishment for taking bribes, selling offices or otherwise abusing authority.
