The Cincinnati Bengals will face their former starting quarterback Andy Dalton for the third time in as many years as they play the New Orleans Saints in NFL Week 6. Since benching the 34-year-old TCU alum on his birthday then releasing him on April 30, 2020, Dalton has beaten his former team in consecutive seasons.

Kickoff at the Superdome is scheduled for 1 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on CBS (Local 12).

The Bengals (2-3) have struggled to find consistency through the first five games of their AFC title defense, and Dalton and the New Orleans Saints (2-3) represent the latest chance for the team to right the ship.
