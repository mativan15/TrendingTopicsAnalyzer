Construction of artificial waterfalls and floating fountains in Neeli Jheel at the heart of the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to boost eco-tourism may disturb wildlife and result in man-animal conflicts, experts said Monday.Mining operations at Bhatti mines, spread over 2,166 acres, were stopped around 35 years ago. Deep pits created during decades of excavation have transformed into beautiful lakes with clear blue water. Neeli Jheel, located 15 kilometres from the main entry gate of the sanctuary, is the largest of them.
