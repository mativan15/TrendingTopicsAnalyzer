Yale professor Jeff Sonnenfeld is calling out their silence.Sonnenfeld, a vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility, applauded Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon for speaking up but said more is needed."This voice is a start but still not the loud chorus of CEOs and other leaders needed," the Yale professor told CNN in an email on Friday.Sonnenfeld, whose list of companies cutting ties with Russia pressured other brands to do the same, noted that many leaders have shied away from making statements following Tuesday's shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
