OVER two months to go, but I'm fairly confident in saying BBC1's I Can See Your Voice has just provided the best light entertainment reveal of 2022.
A duet involving Spandau Ballet legend Tony Hadley, whose 2ft height advantage over his partner was unavoidable even before he fed him the line: 'Nothing left to make me feel small, luck has left me standing so tall . . .'

But could Tony's new friend, who went by the title 'Go the distance', actually sing? 
That was the question which had reduced Amanda Holden and Alison Hammond to quivering wrecks and Jimmy Carr to a constipated frown for the last minute.
