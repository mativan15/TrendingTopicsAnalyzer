Draymond Green, the two-time Olympic gold medalist and professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors, says he's working with well-known investors involved in the tech space. That wasn't a massive secret — Green has historically been quite public about his investments, like SmileDirectClub — but until this morning at TechCrunch Disrupt, he hadn't previously named his go-to investing partners.
When asked by TechCrunch's Brian Heater on stage whether he was looking to start an investment fund, Green replied that he wasn't because he's already involved with a group of prominent VCs, including Chamath Palihapitiya, Bill Gurley, Jason Calacanis and Bill Lee.
