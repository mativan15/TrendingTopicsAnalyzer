Why did the Archbishop of Canterbury lose his nerve? He was asked in an interview whether there should be forgiveness for Prince Andrew — who, you remember, gave a large sum of money to a lady called Virginia Giuffre with whom he denied misconduct. If we pass lightly over the legal question and onto the moral one, the prince seems to feel he has done something wrong, if not criminally wrong, and he may be trying to put it right.The archbishop, unlike the rest of us, has spiritual dealings with the royal family and may have known what he was talking about when he observed that Andrew was trying to make amends.
