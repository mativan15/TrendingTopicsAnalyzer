Ten years from now, a young woman in the rural South turns to a lucrative side hustle to pay for her mother's medical treatment: playing virtual reality games to help rich clients level up. But as we see in The Peripheral, her latest gig is far more than a game, and the world it opens up is incredibly vivid, dangerous, and complex.That's the very basic set-up for Prime Video's new series, which is based on the 2014 novel by cyberpunk legend William Gibson, is produced by Westworld's Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, and was created for TV by novelist turned screenwriter Scott Smith (A Simple Plan, The Ruins).
