The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Friday ordered that the body of a civilian dubbed a terrorist and killed by police during an encounter in Hyderpora last November be exhumed and handed to his family for last . The court also ordered the administration to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the deceased Amir Magrey's father, the petitioner, if the body has been decomposed or is likely to pose a risk to public health and hygiene during the burial. 
 "I am inclined to allow this petition of the father of the deceased Amir Latief Magrey and direct the respondents (Jammu and Kashmir government) to make arrangements for exhumation of the body/remains of the deceased.
