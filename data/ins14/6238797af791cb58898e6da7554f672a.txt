The London Film Festival might now be behind us, but don't think that means there are no good movies on their way. 
Cinemas and your favourite streaming services aren't disappointing with an eclectic mix of movies dropping this week.

Asian film is also in the spotlight with two thought-provoking films: a sophisticated South Korean thriller and an uplifting semi-autobiographical tale from Chinese-American director Ann Hu.
