Keir Starmer has joined calls for Liz Truss to decline the allowance of up to £115,000 a year she will be entitled to as a former prime minister.

The Labour leader told ITV's Good Morning Britain on Friday: 'She should turn it down. I think that's the right thing to do. She's done 44 days in office, she's not really entitled to it, she should turn it down and not take it.'

The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, also said she should turn down the allowance.

The political leaders' remarks come after a trade union representing civil servants hit out at the entitlement to the perk amid a mounting squeeze on public services and the cost of living crisis.
