Riot Games has announced that the League of Legends K'Sante prestige skin was co-designed by pop singer Lil Nas X as part of his ongoing 'takeover' of the popular MOBA. The K'Sante Prestige Empyrean skin, which was revealed on Monday, definitely stands out from the rest of the brilliant, futuristic Empyrean skin range. The skin, which has a purple and gold colour scheme that extends to K'Sante's ntofo melee weapons, will be accessible on the PBE immediately and will be available in League of Legends on November 3, just a few days before the Worlds 2022 finals.
