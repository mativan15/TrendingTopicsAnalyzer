FLOOD FOULS — One of the federal government's main tools for helping homeowners adapt to climate change is riddled with inequities.Homeowners in white or wealthy communities are taking the lion's share of FEMA grants in most states to elevate their homes out of floods' way, Tom Frank finds in an investigation for POLITICO's E&E News.It's not surprising, but it's stark and indisputable.Policies set by Congress, FEMA and state officials over three decades that restrict grants to people who own homes and can pay for costs not covered by the agency have made it nearly impossible for people who are Black or Hispanic, or who have limited income, to get federal elevation money in most states, E&E News found.
