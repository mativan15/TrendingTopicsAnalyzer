Arizona National Democratic leadership is injecting nearly three-quarters of a million dollars of assistance for Arizona Congressman Tom O'Halleran's campaign this week as Democrats seek a victory in the state's newly redrawn, and largely rural, Republican-tilting 2nd Congressional District.However, the party might be betting on the wrong issue.The six-figure ad buy—first reported by Politico—depicts O'Halleran's Republican challenger Eli Crane as "radical and dangerous" for his uncompromising support of anti-abortion measures even in instances of rape and incest, as well as the Trump-endorsed Crane's myriad allusions over the years to white supremacist ideologies and right-wing militia movements outlined in a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee research memo earlier this fall.
