Dave Smith, a giant of the synthesizer industry who built the Prophet-5 and was bestowed the title 'Father of MIDI,' died Wednesday (June 1). He was 72.
Smith founded synth company Sequential Circuits in 1974, and three years later unveiled the Prophet-5, a revolutionary programmable polyphonic instrument.
It was the first musical instrument with an embedded microprocessor, and it was a game-changer.  

Through the ‘80s, the Prophet-5 was a must-have analog synth. It was to the new wave movement what the Fender Stratocaster is to rock.
