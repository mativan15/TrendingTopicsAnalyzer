WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that the Biden administration condemns Saudi Arabia's jailing of a US citizen for over 16 years over his tweets — after the man's son said President Biden 'sold my father for oil' by ignoring his plight.
Saad Almadi, 72, was sentenced on Oct. 3 to 16 years and three months in prison over 14 tweets that were mildly critical of the Saudi government, according to his son Ibrahim.
Biden outraged Almadi's family by failing to secure his release or even publicly mention his case during a July visit to Saudi Arabia to patch up relations with crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler.
