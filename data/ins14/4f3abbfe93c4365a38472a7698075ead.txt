A Tory MP's son fighting in Ukraine has told of how he helped a fellow British fighter escape a Russian ambush after his leg was blown up by a mine.
Ben Grant, 30, helped drag his comrade to safety as mortars and artillery were fired towards them in woodland north of Kharkiv earlier this month.
The intense fight and dramatic rescue was filmed on a helmet-mounted camera.
The former Royal Marine, who is the son of Conservative MP Helen Grant, said he was ‘terrified' but focused on getting his comrade out of danger after he knelt on landmine that ‘blew half his leg off'.
