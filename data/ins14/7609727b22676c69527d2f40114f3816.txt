May 28—If a sleepy summer isn't quite your speed, the race tracks around West Central Minnesota may be able to add some gasoline-fueled adrenaline to the hottest months of the year.

There's oval track racing Thursday nights at KRA Speedway in Willmar, Fiesta City Speedway in Montevideo and the Madison Speedway. All three tracks are sanctioned by WISSOTA and feature Modifieds, Super Stocks, Midwest Modifieds, Street Stock, Hornets and Pure Stock. KRA also features Mod Fours, while Fiesta City and Madison both have Lake Model racing.
