Come Dine With Me icon Kev Riley – aka Whisk Guy – has revealed he was asked to take part in a special episode of the trippy teatime favourite with ‘What a Sad Little Life You Lead, Jane' hun Peter Marsh.
It's been over 10 years since Riley became an eternal meme, and now he's teased a possible return to the show which sees five home chefs compete to throw the perfect dinner party.
Few have become quite as iconic as Riley or Marsh, however.
Riley's nickname speaks for itself after he impressively shoved an entire whisk in his mouth before using it to whip up a cheese cake to his unsuspecting guests.
