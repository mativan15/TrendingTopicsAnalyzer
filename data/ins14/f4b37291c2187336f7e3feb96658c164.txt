An upcoming vote by Orlando city commissioners may clear the way for the development of 459 new homes.

Commissioners on Oct. 24 will vote whether or not to sell 126 acres of city-owned land to Beazer Homes LLC. If OK'd by commissioners, the city of Orlando would sell the property near Orlando International Airport to Atlanta-based Beazer for $3 million.

Why it matters: Approval of this land sale would lead to the building of hundreds of homes. New residential construction activity is important to the local economy because it generates jobs, as well as subcontractor and vendor opportunities for other businesses.
