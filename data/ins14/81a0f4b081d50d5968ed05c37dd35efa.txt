The price of fruit and vegetables is expected to leap by 8 per cent in the next six months in the wake of major flooding.The production of fruits, grains such as wheat and barley and dairy and livestock is expected to be affected by the disaster unfolding across prime agricultural land in eastern Australia.Jim Chalmers said early government estimates indicated the October floods would bump up inflation by 0.1 percentage points in the December quarter and again in the March quarter of next year.'It is too early for us to put a very precise price tag on the flooding that we're seeing through such large swathes of Australia,' the Treasurer told reporters on Friday.
