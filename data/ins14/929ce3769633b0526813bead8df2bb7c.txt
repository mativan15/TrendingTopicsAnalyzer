Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and his rival, Independent candidate Evan McMullin, took to the debate stage on Monday evening in what has emerged as one of the more unexpectedly competitive Senate races ahead of November.

Lee is seeking a third term in office but recent polling has shown McMullin, a former CIA officer, not far behind. A recent Deseret News-Hinckley Institute of Politics poll shows Lee leading McMullin 41 percent to 37 percent respectively.

The debate, which was held at Utah Valley University, had its share of heated moments, especially one back-and-forth over Congress' certification of the 2020 election on Jan.
