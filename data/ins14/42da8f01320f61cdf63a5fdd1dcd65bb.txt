NEW DELHI: After the ED's summons to its top leaders, the Congress on Wednesday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of hatching a "cowardly conspiracy" against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi , and said the party will not be cowed down by such "vendetta" politics and attempts to suppress the opposition.Congress leaders Randeep Surjewala and Abhishek Singhvi said the party will fight hard "legally, socially and politically".Addressing a press conference, they said party president Sonia Gandhi has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate for questioning in a "fake" money laundering case linked to the National Herald newspaper on June 8, and she was determined to appear before the agency as she has nothing to hide and is not scared or intimidated by such ''cheap tactics''.
