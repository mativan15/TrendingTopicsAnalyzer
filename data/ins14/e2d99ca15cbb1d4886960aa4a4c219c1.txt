Patrick Williams to start at PF in season opener vs. Heat originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago

Billy Donovan has made a decision on the starting power forward spot for the Chicago Bulls' season opener against the Miami Heat Wednesday night.

Patrick Williams will start at the position while Javonte Green comes off the bench, the Bulls' head coach said after Tuesday's practice.

This comes after Donovan experimented with a number of different frontcourt combinations in the team's four preseason games.
