CLEVELAND — When the Yankees made Gerrit Cole the highest-paid pitcher in baseball history with a nine-year, $324 million contract before the 2020 season, they did so with October glory in mind. They saw him as a missing piece in their pursuit of a World Series title, which, despite all of their spending and efforts, has eluded the franchise since 2009.

Asked to save the Yankees from elimination on Sunday in Game 4 of this American League division series against the Cleveland Guardians, Cole, 32, delivered seven strong innings, overcame a potential costly error in his final frame and largely spared the depleted Yankees bullpen.
