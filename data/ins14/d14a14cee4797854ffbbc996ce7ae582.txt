LONDON (AP) — As the Manchester City team bus made its way out of Anfield, there came a parting shot.

An object, supposedly thrown by home fans after the bad-tempered 1-0 loss to Liverpool on Sunday, caused a small crack in the windshield.

It's a rivalry that has turned ugly, the bitterest in the Premier League.

City manager Pep Guardiola had already successfully avoided coins being hurled in his direction during the match. Liverpool, meanwhile, condemned the behaviour of the away fans after offensive chants relating to Hillsborough — the tragedy in 1989 that resulted in the deaths of 97 of its fans.
