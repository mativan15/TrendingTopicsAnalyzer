Jun. 3—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — When children in Johnstown are diagnosed with cancer, the emotional toll on their families is accompanied by the cost of gasoline to drive to treatment centers in Pittsburgh multiple times each week for months or even years, nurse Marlene Singer said.

Johnstown residents battling cancer may have outstanding payments for medication, utilities or mortgages.

As coordinator of the Johnstown Walk of Hope, Singer works to lessen those financial worries.

The nonprofit Johnstown Walk of Hope organization was created in 2016 from what Singer saw as a need to generate funds for local cancer patients' daily lives.
