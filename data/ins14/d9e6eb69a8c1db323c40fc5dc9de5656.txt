Seven residents in the Chicago area face federal charges for collecting at least $16 million in COVID relief money, the United States Attorney's Office announced Thursday. The individuals are charged with wire fraud and money laundering after using small business grants and loans for personal use, a 31-page federal indictment states.

The alleged fraud is tied to a loan program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The program, known as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), is designed to provide loan assistance and grants for small businesses affected by the pandemic.
