Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which is probing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son and Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz in a multi-billion rupees (Pakistani rupees) money-laundering case, on June 4 requested the court to allow their arrest for further investigation. The court, however, extended their pre-arrest bail until June 11. The FIA also filed an interim investigation report against the premier and other suspects in the ₹ 14 billion ($ 75 million) money laundering case against them.
