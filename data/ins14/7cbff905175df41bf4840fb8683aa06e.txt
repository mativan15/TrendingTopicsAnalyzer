For the upcoming Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2, "Potion" reunites producer Calvin Harris with both Dua Lipa, who sang 2018's seductive "One Kiss," and Young Thug, who took the first verse on Harris' "Heatstroke." Melodramatic '80s guitar cheese begins the track with a bit of a head fake — completely disconnected from what follows — but quickly settles into lightly popped electro-funk that shimmers at the surface, taking notes from Daft Punk who took notes from Nile Rodgers. "Potion" plays a strange card trick, though, as it's structured around a scintillating pre-chorus and chorus — Dua Lipa lets us know that this song is about sex by using the word "sex" eight times.
