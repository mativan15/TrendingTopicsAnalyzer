An extra 5600 social and affordable homes will be built by the Queensland government over the next five years in a previously floated move made to preempt crisis talks, but the number is still short of what the sector says is needed.

The state government will pour an additional $1 billion into its housing fund, doubling its size and the number of homes built from its returns by 2027.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the gathering of more than 200 from across the political, government, social service and property sectors that the state had been hit by 'housing's perfect storm'.
