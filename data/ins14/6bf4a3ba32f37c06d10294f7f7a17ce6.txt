Only nine undefeated FBS teams are still standing. Five suffered their first blemishes last weekend, including now-No. 3 Alabama, now-No. 7 USC, now-No. 8 Oklahoma State and now-No. 10 Penn State. The Crimson Tide lost on a last-second field goal. The Trojans lost on a last-minute two-point conversion. The Cowboys lost in double-overtime.
Five more games between ranked teams will be played this weekend, including the first top-10 matchup between Pac-12 teams in nearly six years. But the only battle of unbeatens features Syracuse, as we all expected.
