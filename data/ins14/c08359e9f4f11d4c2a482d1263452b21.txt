After almost a year's delay, the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar has started registering jewellers and launched the pilot test ahead of the formal launch in July.
'The exchange is ready. We are currently testing it. Testing began only a few days ago. Actual transactions are being conducted without a formal inauguration. Gold is a sensitive item and it is happening for the first time in India. So, we are allowing about 20-odd players to come and transact,' said Injeti Srinivas, chairman of International Financial Services Authority (IFSCA) at GIFT City.
