Political commentator Bill Maher slammed Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker as 'unfit for office' and called him a 'f—ing idiot.'

On his HBO show 'Real Time' on Friday, Maher pointed to numerous statements Walker has made and reports about him that have come out that he said show why Walker should not be elected to the Senate.

'He's just a f—ing idiot on a scale on a scale almost impossible to parody,' Maher said.

He said Walker has admitted to threatening violence against multiple people around him, including his ex-wife.
