Most Canadians say they are likely or somewhat likely to continue wearing a mask while travelling by plane or train, even after the federal government made face coverings optional, recent survey data from Nanos Research shows. The survey, commissioned by CTV News, found 55 per cent of Canadians reported they were either likely or somewhat likely to continue wearing masks on planes or trains over the next 12 months. Broken down, 35 per cent of those who responded positively said it was likely they'd wear a mask, while 20 per cent said they were somewhat likely.
