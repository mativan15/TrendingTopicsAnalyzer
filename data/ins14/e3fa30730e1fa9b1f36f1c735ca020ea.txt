High gas prices are making life more expensive for a pregnant woman in northern B.C., who says she has to travel hundreds of kilometres for ultrasound appointments. Stephanie Roberts lives with her husband and two children in Fort Nelson, in B.C.'s far north, about 130 kilometres south of the B.C.-Yukon border. She is currently nine weeks pregnant with their third child, and has to travel to Fort St. John for maternity care — a nearly-800-kilometre round-trip.With fuel prices rising, Roberts is worried about the hit these trips will have on her budget.
