OAKLAND — Residents will decide in November whether to overhaul the way the city's businesses are taxed.
The City Council this week decided to place a measure on the ballot that would require businesses making a lot of money to pay higher taxes and others to pay less.
If passed, the measure would scrap the current tax structure that imposes a flat rate on all businesses' gross receipts and enact a progressive, tiered rate that increases as a company's gross receipts grow.
City leaders describe the proposal as a compromise between one presented earlier this year by Council President Nikki Fortunato Bas and Councilmember Carroll Fife and the pushback from businesses that said they need some tax relief because of the pandemic.
