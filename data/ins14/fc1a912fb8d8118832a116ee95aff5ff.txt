His candidate profile promised citizens a list of jobs 'I can and will do'. But 10 days after being voted in, Westland District councillor Ian Hustwick has resigned, sparking a by-election that could cost the West Coast ratepayers $15,000. An opponent who missed out by 109 votes has criticised the move, saying if he wasn't sure about representing the district, he should not have stood. Hustwick tendered his resignation from the Westland District Council to chief executive Simon Bastion. It takes effect immediately.
