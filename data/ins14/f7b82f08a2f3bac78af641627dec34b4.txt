May 31—What the Cowden-Herrick Beecher City track and field team accomplished Saturday was something never seen in the history of the IHSA.

A team made up of two athletes — seniors Jadon Robertson and Daniel Lucas — helped lead the Bobcats to their first state championship in the school's history. CHBC shared first-place honors with Catlin Salt Fork, finishing the meet with 44 points.

The Bobcats, however, won the initial coin toss — which the IHSA goes to in case of a tie — to celebrate with the large bronze trophy with the words "State Champions Class 1A Boys Track and Field" on it.
