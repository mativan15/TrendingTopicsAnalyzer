The 'Grama One' project offering hundreds of government-related citizen-centric services in villages of Karnataka has achieved a milestone in less than nine months of its launch, logging one crore transactions. The popularity of this project, on the lines of 'Bangalore One' in the city launched many years ago, has drawn the attention of various states which are exploring the possibility of replicating this service delivery model in rural areas, officials said. The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore has taken up a study on the project, launched on January 26 this year by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.
