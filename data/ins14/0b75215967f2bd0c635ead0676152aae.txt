Classic black outfits can never go out of fashion. May it be an elaborate red-carpet event or a star-studded party, Bollywood celebrities embrace black outfits with open arms. And we are simply not complaining. Black outfits are all-time favourites and look stunning on almost all occasions. Karan Johar's 50th birthday bash was a star-studded affair where all the Bollywood celebrities came dressed in glitter, glitz and glamour. We saw some stunning black outfits too. Sara Ali Khan wore a striking sequined tube dress for the birthday bash while Sharvari Wagh wore a vintage-style corset dress in black.
