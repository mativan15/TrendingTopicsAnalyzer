The Memphis Police Department (MPD) released that the reward for information leading to a suspect's arrest has increased after a donation from the victim's family.

The family of Mallory Morgan, 27, a young employee of the University of Tennessee, who was killed as she returned to her apartment one night last month has posted an $18,000 award with CrimeStoppers, a release said.
