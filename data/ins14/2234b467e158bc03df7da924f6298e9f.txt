For 100 years, generations of Minnesotans and people from across the nation have come through the lobby doors of the historic, jewel box theaters in downtown Minneapolis, taking their seats in the Hennepin Theatre District and being transported as the lights dim and the curtain rises.

Over the years, these theaters and the art performed on their stages have surprised and delighted, prodded and provoked. They have explored social issues and ideas and have provided understanding and healing, even through the most challenging of times.
