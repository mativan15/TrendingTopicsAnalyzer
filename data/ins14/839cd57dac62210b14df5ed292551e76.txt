Anne Hathaway has curated an extensive filmography over her decades in the entertainment business. Still, there's a clear choice regarding the one movie she wants her children ― Jonathan, 6, and Jack, 2 ― to view when the time is right.

While you might be forgiven for betting it all on 'Princess Diaries,' the actor revealed her other, perhaps more groundbreaking choice during an appearance on SiriusXM's 'The Jess Cagle Show' on Monday.

'I am really excited to show them ‘The Devil Wears Prada.' It's such a good movie,' Hathaway exclaimed.
