The stock market, in a record-breaking year for market volatility, exceeded the wildest expectations last week. According to Bespoke Investment Group the S&P 500 on Thursday 'had dropped nearly 4% from its pre-market highs before staging an epic rally of 5%.' They point out that this has only happened nine times since 1983. Now investors and traders are wondering what this reversal might mean for the rest of the year. I remember the last occurrence well as it is often part of my teaching on the merits of advance/decline line analysis.
