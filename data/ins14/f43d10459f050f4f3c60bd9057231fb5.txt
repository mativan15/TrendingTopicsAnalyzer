Fitch expects the US economy will enter a mild recession in the second quarter of 2023.

The ratings agency said the upcoming recession will be to the one that occurred in 1990-1991.

The aggregate household balance sheet remains resilient as real estate wealth helps offset some stock losses, Fitch said.

The US economy will enter recession territory in the second quarter of next year, according to Fitch Ratings, but strong consumer finances will help cushion the blow.
