I have no brief for erstwhile UK Prime Minister Liz Truss or her government. But given the government's collapse it is worth asking whether the apparent pension crisis that led to all this sturm und drang was actually caused by those proposed tax cuts. As far as I can tell, the answer is no. This was simply the denouement of a drama that had been unfolding for months and the script written by governments, pension fund managers, companies and regulators of all political hues over many years. For all the headlines to the contrary, it is worth pointing out that the fallout in the financial markets was a liquidity crisis and not a solvency crisis.
