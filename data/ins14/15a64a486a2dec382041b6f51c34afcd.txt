Hundreds of Santander customers have been unable to move their money because of payment systems issues at the bank, ahead of the Jubilee weekend and just as monthly bills are due to be paid. 
Close to 600 customers reported experiencing a 'systems outage' on Wednesday morning, with around half saying they were having problems transferring money out of their accounts. Two fifths said they were having issues with their online banking, while 15pc said they were having problems with the bank's app, according to the monitoring website DownDetector.
