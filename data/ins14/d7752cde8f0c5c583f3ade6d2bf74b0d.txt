Pune City Police's Crime Branch, which is probing alleged malpractices in a kidney transplant conducted at Ruby Hall Clinic, has launched search for a key racketeer who is suspected to have facilitated multiple kidney transplants using forged identities. Police said they are speaking to five persons who have donated kidneys at various hospitals through this nexus. 
Before the Crime Branch took over the probe on May 18, the case was being investigated by officials of the Koregaon Park police station, where a First Information Report (FIR) was registered on May 11 following a court order.
