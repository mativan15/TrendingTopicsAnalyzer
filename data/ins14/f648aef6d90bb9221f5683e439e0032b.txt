Diy13/iStock via Getty Images Utility stocks are often the go-to sector for investors looking for moderate dividend yields with less exposure to cyclical risk factors. Typically, utility companies earn profits consistently since most operate as local monopolies, subject to regulations that nearly guarantee a small profit margin. Utility stocks, such as those in the ETF (NYSEARCA:XLU), are typically more correlated to bonds due to their interest rate sensitivity. Since bonds usually rise as stocks decline, this factor often causes utility stocks to outperform by wide margins during recessions.
