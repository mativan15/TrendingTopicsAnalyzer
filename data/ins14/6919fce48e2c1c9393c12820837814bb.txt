By David Luhnow LONDON--New U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said Monday that he is reversing nearly all the government's proposed tax cuts and will pare back an energy price cap as he moves to undo Prime Minister Liz Truss's debt-fuelled growth plan in an effort to reassure markets about the stability of the nation's finances. Mr. Hunt, speaking ahead of an emergency statement to parliament on the economy, said: "The most important objective for our country right now is stability," as he announced tax and energy subsidy cuts that he said would raise around £32 billion a year for the government.
