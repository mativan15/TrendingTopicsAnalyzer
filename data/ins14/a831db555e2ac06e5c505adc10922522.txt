Travelers passing through Singapore's famed Changi Airport will now have new lounges to luxuriate in as Singapore Airlines unveiled its all-new flagship SilverKris and KrisFlyer Gold lounges on Monday, May 30, the carrier shared with Travel + Leisure. These are the first new lounges from World's Best Awards-winning Singapore Airlines at Changi Airport in more than a decade.

The new lounges, which follow a more than $36-million renovation, both feature luxuries like barista-made coffee, dedicated shower facilities, and Singaporean culinary favorites like laksa, chwee kueh, and dim sum.
