Halloween Ends has been hyped as the final battle between masked killer Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, and the film ultimately delivers on that promise. But many viewers of the movie may be surprised to discover how much screen time is devoted to the story of a brand new character: Corey Cunningham.

Played by Rohan Campbell, the newcomer accidentally causes the death of a child he is babysitting in the film's pre-credit sequence and becomes a pariah in his hometown of Haddonfield, Ill.
