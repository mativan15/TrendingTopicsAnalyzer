'For Sale' signs line the streets of Hillsborough, a small village roughly 40 minutes drive from Moncton.
Mayor Bob Rochon said on Tuesday that so many people are moving in, it's creating stress on the village's infrastructure.'We have an issue with the demand that's being put on the water supply so we're actively looking for another water supply,' he said.He said an influx of come-from-aways looking to take advantage of Hillsborough's relatively lower-priced real estate is breathing new life into the community and bolstering investment into new businesses.
