Nature/iStock via Getty Images It's been about a year since Navitas Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NVTS) went public on October 20, 2021, using a SPAC. NVTS was able to raise $320M in proceeds, giving NVTS an enterprise value of around $1.7B, which some might say was on the hefty side for a company without any profits and expected revenue of just $27M. NVTS went public at a time when semis were riding high and interest was high in newcomers, which helped the stock in its debut. However, much has changed since then, something that is likely to affect the stock going forward.
