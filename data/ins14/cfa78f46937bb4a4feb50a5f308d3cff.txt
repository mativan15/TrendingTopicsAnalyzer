VILNIUS, LITHUANIA — 
Hundreds of Lithuanians are clubbing together to buy an advanced military drone for Ukraine in its war against Russia, in a show of solidarity with a fellow country formerly under Moscow's rule.
Some $3.2 million have been raised in just three days -- out of the $5.37 million needed -- largely in small amounts, according to Laisves TV, a Lithuanian internet broadcaster that launched the drive.
"Before this war started, none of us thought that we would be buying guns. But it's a normal thing now.
