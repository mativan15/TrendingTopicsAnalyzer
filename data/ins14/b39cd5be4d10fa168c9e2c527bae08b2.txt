AgenciesRepresentative imageThe finance ministry is expected to issue a notification in June regarding exclusion of some transactions from the crypto tax. The ministry has been in talks about whether or not to exempt representations received for exemptions. The exemptions might include hospitals using block chain technology, reward points on banks' digital cards and flight miles, reported ET Now. 
The government has clearly rejected the demands to eliminate 1% TDS on crypto transactions and lessen the 30% tax bracket on crypto income which was announced a few weeks ago.
