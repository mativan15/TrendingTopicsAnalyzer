The abolition of house building targets will deal a £17bn blow to the economy and deprive the Treasury of vital tax revenues, major developers have warned the spending watchdog.

In a letter to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Britain's biggest builders say a proposal to drop housing targets will cause the annual number of new homes delivered to plunge by 100,000.

They claim local councils, which are responsible for allocating land for development, will 'significantly reduce' planning permissions when pressure from Whitehall is removed.
