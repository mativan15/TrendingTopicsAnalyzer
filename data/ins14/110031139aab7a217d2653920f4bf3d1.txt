Apple is very careful with the language it's using around the new, juiced-up fertility and cycle tracking features on the Apple Watch Series 8. It can 'inform your family planning' if you're trying to conceive, the company said in the product announcement. It can predict ovulation but only retrospectively. The company isn't making any claims that people could use the features to avoid becoming pregnant, which would take sign-off from the Food and Drug Administration. But people don't just use cycle tracking tech in the ways companies say they should, says Rebecca Simmons, a researcher and fertility awareness specialist at the University of Utah.
