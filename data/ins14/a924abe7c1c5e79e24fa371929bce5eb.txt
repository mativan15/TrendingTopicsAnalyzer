The Truss watch continues

The British pound and government bonds rose on Monday, after Britain's finance minister of three days, Jeremy Hunt, reversed nearly all of the government's promised tax cuts. But the future of the current government remains uncertain, as political analysts and even fellow lawmakers say Prime Minister Liz Truss has all but lost her power.

Hunt overturned most of Truss's promised £45 billion in tax breaks. The fiscal proposals, unveiled last month, were quickly criticized, particularly by investors worried at how much they would raise the public deficit and that they might push up inflation, forcing the Bank of England to raise interest rates.
