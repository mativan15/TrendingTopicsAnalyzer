The claim: Speaker Nancy Pelosi removed President Joe Biden from office

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed President Joe Biden for the presidency in April 2020 and recently commended him for his "great service to our country."

A viral Facebook video, however, claims she has since turned on him and forced him to leave office.

"Watch Pelosi Removes Biden From Wh After ‘2022 Losing' Result," reads part of the Oct. 10 Facebook video's caption. The video was viewed more than 27,000 times in seven days.
