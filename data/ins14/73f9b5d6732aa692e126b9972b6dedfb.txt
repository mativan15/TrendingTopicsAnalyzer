The crypto market has rebounded since its crash earlier this month, and investors sticking with the asset class are rotating back into Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Cardano (ADA-USD).

Coupled with selling pressure seen in equities and bonds in addition to the collapse of Terra's (UST-USD) algorithmic stablecoin, investors sold approximately $640 billion in crypto assets or more than 35% of the asset class' total value between May 4 and May 12.

For crypto, the volatility is nothing new, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Yahoo Finance on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum last week.
