Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN 4.40%) ticked higher over the past week, but the stock remains pressured due to a souring economy, slower consumer spending, and worries the e-commerce giant won't be able to maintain the rate of growth investors have become accustomed to.
I recently expressed doubt Amazon could turn $10,000 into $1 million unless the person was really young and just starting out in the stock market. While that doubt stands, I think the global online retailer remains a good investment, just don't expect it to turn you into a millionaire.
