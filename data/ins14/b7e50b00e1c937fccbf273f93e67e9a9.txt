NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel said that OpenRAN will be ready to form a part of its live 5G network towards the end of 2023 fiscal year as the technology is still maturing and costs reduction will take time. A top executive said that the telco has OpenRAN related contracts in place already with different partners. The telco's initial phase of 5G network deployment is solely based on technology from traditional equipment vendors, which is considered more mature and advanced to support a large scale network.
