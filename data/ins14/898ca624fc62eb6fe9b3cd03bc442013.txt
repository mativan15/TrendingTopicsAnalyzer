Financial planning is difficult in the best of times - and 2022 is definitely not the best of times. A number of factors - namely rising interest rates, high inflation and a volatile market - have come together to create what Goldman Sachs is calling a "financial vortex" that is catching many Americans in its wake, especially those in the "sandwich generation" of Gen Xers who are currently dealing with both aging parents and raising children.

If you need help navigating the financial vortex, consider working with a financial advisor.
