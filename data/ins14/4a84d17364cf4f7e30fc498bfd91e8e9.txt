I read with interest and some sadness the article in Thursday's Tribune ('Personal cost of American politics,' Oct. 20). Friends and I have faced the same problem. I commend those individuals, on both sides, who attempt to explain their political views but are summarily or unfairly rebuffed by friends and family who hold opposing views. It does no good to be 'judge and jury' of someone else's belief system without hearing that person's rationale.

Unfortunately though, so much of what I read today fails to offer any real explanation for an opposing political position.
