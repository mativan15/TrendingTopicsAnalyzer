The rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has agreed to acquire the conservative-oriented social media app Parler, the platform announced early Monday.

Parler is a controversial alternative to apps such as Twitter and Facebook and touts itself as a 'free speech' and 'uncancelable' space. It was forced offline last year for its ties to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The move comes a week after the rapper was locked out of his Twitter account and restricted on Instagram amid a backlash over antisemitic posts.
