Truist Field is turning into a winter wonderland for the holiday season, and it's your chance to try ice skating or snow tubing next to Charlotte's Uptown skyline.

The Light the Knights Festival is shaping up to be a pretty chill time. The Charlotte Knights baseball team is installing a regulation-size ice rink and a snow tubing hill in the outfield when the festival starts in late November.

According to the Minor League Baseball team, the festival will also feature holiday lights, live entertainment, holiday shopping, a visit from Santa Claus, and more activities planned.
