By Reuters Published: 15:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 15:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 The Seattle Kraken placed defenseman Michal Kempny on unconditional waivers Thursday for the purpose of terminating his contract. The 32-year-old signed a one-year, $750,000 contract in July but did not appear in a game for Seattle. The Kraken optioned him to AHL Coachella Valley ahead of the regular season. He'll become a free agent again if he clears waivers. Kempny worked back from three separate lower-body injuries, most recently an Achilles injury, that marred the end of his stint with the Washington Capitals.
