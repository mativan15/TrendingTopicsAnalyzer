The interest rate increase is expected to moderate after the June policy review as better moonsoons and a coordinated approach by the government and the RBI are expected to bring the inflation down. India's weather office has predicted the monsoons to be normal. The southwest monsoon is key for India's agricultural sector, which has remained immune to the pandemic blow and showed consistent growth at around 4 per cent. The recent spike in retail as well as wholesale inflation has spooked everyone and the RBI went for an off-cycle policy hike of 40 basis points to stagger the impact of rate upcycle.
