A wild bison has been born after centuries in the UK. The unexpected birth happened in Kent forest. The new born, who can be seen walking around in the wild, is the first in numerous years. The emergence of the adorable calf surprised rangers in-charge of a landmark initiative that has seen a herd of European bison settle in West Blean and Thornden Woods near Canterbury.

The birth was completely unexpected due to the mammals' ability to display no evident indications of pregnancy - and the fact that there is no bull among the herd.
