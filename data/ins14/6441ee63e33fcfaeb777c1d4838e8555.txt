Happy Friday, Crunchers! It's 27 May 2022, and we are slinking into a long weekend because it's Memorial Day weekend here in the U.S. There's no newsletter on Monday — Haje is going 🍷 wine tasting in Sonoma, and Christine is planning to spend Monday 🛋️ sitting on the sofa doing absolutely nothing, which we celebrate wholeheartedly. We'll see you back here on Tuesday!

Not sure what to do this weekend? Check out this roundup of all the amazing podcasts we published this week.
