Airbus says the Zero Emission Development Centre in Filton, Bristol, has already begun working on technology development. The ZEDC in the U.K. will join other similar sites in Spain, Germany and France. The environmental footprint of aviation is significant, with the World Wildlife Fund describing it as "one of the fastest-growing sources of the greenhouse gas emissions driving global climate change." Airbus is launching a U.K.-based facility focused on hydrogen technologies, a move which represents the firm's latest attempt to support the design of its next generation of aircraft.
