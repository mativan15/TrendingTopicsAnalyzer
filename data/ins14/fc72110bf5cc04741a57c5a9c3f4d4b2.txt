Attorney Michelle Mendez-Palmares is the president of the IBP (Integrated Bar of the Philippines) Cebu City chapter. This week, together with other lawyers from Cebu, they successfully hosted the IBP Regional Conference that included chapters from Western and Eastern Visayas.



The six-day long IBP activity included two days of sports: golf, badminton, chess, bowling, tennis, billiards and basketball. I had the chance to watch the thrilling basketball finals at the Capitol Parish gym on Oct. 12 between two Cebu IBP teams.
