The newly formed Rebel Alliance is a consortium made up of five independent ISPs - Gigabit Networks, Triangle Networks, Air Broadband, Highnet and Trunk Networks. The providers have joined forces to rally the rest of the industry into offering "better service levels" and "lower costs".The independent ISPs - who offer next-gen Gigabit capable broadband - were formed after broadband prices from some providers went up by as much as 9.
