The EU is prepared to respond 'comprehensively' to unionist concerns over Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol, a senior Irish minister has said.Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said negotiations between Brussels and London over the contentious trading arrangements were continuing in a 'positive light', but said an imminent breakthrough was unlikely given the current domestic difficulties preoccupying the UK government at Westminster.Mr Coveney, who held talks with Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton Harris in Belfast on Wednesday, said he did not think anything substantive would emerge before next week's deadline for forming a new powersharing executive at Stormont.
