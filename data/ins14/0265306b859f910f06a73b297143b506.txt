Alec Baldwin is paying tribute to late "Rust" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the one-year anniversary of Hutchins' death.

The 64-year-old actor posted a photo of Hutchins looking into a film camera Oct. 21 on Instagram, writing, "One year ago today…"

Baldwin's post comes a little more than two weeks after Luke Nikas, an attorney Baldwin, announced on Oct. 5. that Baldwin and Hutchins' family had settled a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the actor and others involved in producing 'Rust,' after Hutchins died in an incident on the movie's set in New Mexico last year.
