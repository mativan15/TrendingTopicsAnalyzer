Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson is still being investigated by the NFL after being accused of sexual misconduct by 23 women. With that investigation ongoing, Watson's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, did a radio interview with Sports Radio 610, and explained why he believes Watson did not commit any crimes.

Hardin signed off during the interview by attempting to explain why a "happy ending" was not a crime. His explanation was baffling.
