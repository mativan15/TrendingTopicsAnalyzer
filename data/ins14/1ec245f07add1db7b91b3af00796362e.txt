Commentators on the current state of equity markets have no shortage of explanations. Here is a brief list, which is by no means complete:

1. War in Ukraine: now in month four.

2. Inflation: headline CPI up 8.3% y/y.

3. Fed tightening: target funds rate at 0.75%-1.0% and a least two more 50-basis-point increases projected.

4. Interest rates: Treasury rates have moderated as investors move to Treasuries to protect capital while muni rates move up to 4% tax-free and mortgage rates hit 5% for 30-year.
