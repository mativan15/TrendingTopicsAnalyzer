Labour is calling on Tory MPs to seize an opportunity to end fracking 'once and for all' by backing a move to pave the way for a vote on the issue.

The party will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to put forward a motion which, if passed, would guarantee time in the Commons for a Bill to ban the controversial gas extraction technique for good.

Labour says it wants to give MPs a chance to overturn the Government's decision to lift England's fracking ban, which broke a Tory manifesto promise.
