A second group of investors have filed a multimillion pound lawsuit over the collapse of Neil Woodford's equity income fund, which left more than 300,000 savers nursing losses.
London law firm Harcus Parker has launched proceedings in the High Court on behalf of 1,500 investors, seeking damages of at least £18m against the fund's administrators Link Fund Solutions over its handling of the saga.
The law firm alleges that Link netted millions of pounds in fees but failed to adequately supervise the £3.
