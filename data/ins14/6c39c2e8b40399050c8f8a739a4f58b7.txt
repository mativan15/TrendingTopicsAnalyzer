The cost of crude oils slowed down before Russia led the non-OPEC and OPEC meeting. The prices are now at the cost countries could have positively agreed on a production boost. The global oil benchmark's, Brent crude's, futures decreased by 0.6%. The cost estimation of the decrease is USD 115.58. After the meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC is held, there are high chances of supply rise. Europe and the United States have cramped the group to produce and extract more crude because the prices of the oil have reached above USD 100 per barrel after Russia invaded Ukraine.
