Bernie Ecclestone has insisted that he was not arrested in Brazil after a gun was found in his luggage by airport security as he tried to leave the country earlier this week. The 91-year-old, who previously served as chief executive of the Formula One Group, found himself at the centre of a media storm on Thursday when he was caught up in a 'silly, tiny little incident' that caused plenty of aggravation for himself and his family in Sao Paulo.It was reported local police had claimed that Ecclestone was apprehended due to an unregistered firearm having been spotted in an airport scan, before eventually paying a fine and boarding his private flight to Switzerland.
