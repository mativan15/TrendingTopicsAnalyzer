Four police officers, including a deputy superintendent of police, were on Friday placed on suspension after an inquiry commission found them guilty of unprovoked firing against anti-Sterlite protesters, killing 13, in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi district. The action came days after the Justice Aruna Jagadeesan inquiry commission's report was tabled in the state Assembly on Tuesday, recommending action against 17 police officers. Chief minister MK Stalin on Wednesday assured the assembly that those responsible for the police firing in Thoothukudi during the previous regime will be punished.
