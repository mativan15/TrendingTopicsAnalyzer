SAINT CLAIR — Michelle Swantner doesn't like to talk about herself.

The 56-year-old Saint Clair native likes to talk about her job as a crime unit supervisor with the Pennsylvania State Police, or about the nearly 20 nieces and nephews she has as one of Ronald and Barbara Swantner's six children.

It was the same way 40 years ago, when the extremely humble Swantner didn't have to do much talking.
