Just as its first season is finishing, the Rings of Power are finally picking up steam with the creation of the first rings and the revelation of the identity of Galadriel's boyfriend—sorry, mortal adversary. According to reports, Amazon Prime Video intends to use the Lord of the Rings IP as long as possible since the fires of Mount Doom will not wait for a man (or elf).

The head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, disclosed that five seasons' worth of infrastructure is being built. A tiny city is being constructed.
