(Bloomberg) -- France faces a higher risk of electricity shortages this winter if lingering strikes continue to slow maintenance and repairs of its nuclear reactors, according to the country's power-grid operator. While Electricite de France SA is making good progress on fixing pipes at atomic plants that are affected by so-called stress corrosion cracks, strikes have already forced the utility to postpone several reactor restarts by weeks, Reseau de Transport d'Electricite said on Tuesday in an update of its winter outlook published a month ago.
