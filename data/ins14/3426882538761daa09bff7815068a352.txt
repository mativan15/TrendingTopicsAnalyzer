Declaring a routine vote to be a matter of confidence in the Government is an unusual step.Formal confidence motions, generally called by the opposition, have been much more common throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.But, with the repeal of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, the Government again has the ability to declare any vote it likes to be a confidence matter, meaning defeat will be taken as a sign it has lost the confidence of the House of Commons and should therefore resign.The last time a Government took this step was in November 1994 when John Major faced rebellion from backbench Tories opposed to the Maastricht Treaty.
