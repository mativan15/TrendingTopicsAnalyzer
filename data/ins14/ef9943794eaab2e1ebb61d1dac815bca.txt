(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. consumer chief Dave Clark is resigning, a possible casualty of a slowdown at the crucial e-commerce business he ran.The sudden departure signals that Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is looking for changes in the company's consumer division, which overbuilt during the pandemic and left Amazon saddled with excess warehouse space that the company has since begun looking to sublet.'The past few years have been among the most challenging and unpredictable we've faced in the history of Amazon's Consumer business, and I'm particularly appreciative of Dave's leadership during that time,' Jassy said in a statement.
