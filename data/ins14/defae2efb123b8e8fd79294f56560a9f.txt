May 29—As a Boulder native whose family boasts a rich distance running lineage, Nell Rojas has participated in just about every nuance of the Bolder Boulder at one point or another throughout her life.

By the time Rojas first ran the annual 10-kilometer extravaganza when she was about 8, her family's name already was part of Bolder Boulder lore as her father, Ric Rojas, was the race's first professional champion in 1979.

Over the years, Rojas dabbled in many of the sidelights that make the Bolder Boulder so unique.
