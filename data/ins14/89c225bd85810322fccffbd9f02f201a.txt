Anna Morell, from Disability Rights UK, says while poverty is a factor in looking at the plummeting school attendance rates - taking into account disability is imperative to ensuring future generations are able to succeed academically

A new report from the University of Exeter and the LSE has highlighted that just over 28% of primary pupils and 40% of secondary pupils on free school meals, an indicator of poverty, were persistently absent during the 2021/22 autumn term.

Persistently absent is taken to mean missing 10% of school sessions, a session being a half day.
