The former England captain endured chants of "getting sacked in the morning" by the home fans as Harrison Reed and Aleksandar Mitrovic scored for Fulham before a Tyrone Mings own goal completed Villa's misery. Reed's powerfully-struck shot in the 36th minute gave Fulham a deserved lead after they had gone close several times.
