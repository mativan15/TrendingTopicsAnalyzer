Republican Rep. Michelle Steel and Democratic Navy Reserve intelligence officer Jay Chen are competing to represent the 45th Congressional District straddling Orange and Los Angeles counties.

The race is one of 10 key California contests in the Nov. 8 midterm election that could determine the balance of power in the House. It has been a contentious contest, with Steel sending out mailers using heavily doctored images to attack Chen.

The candidates' answers are drawn from a questionnaire The Times sent to candidates in competitive California congressional races; the responses have been edited for clarity and length.
