Petrol dealers across Maharashtra began a one-day strike Tuesday demanding a hike in their margin/commission which has not been increased since 2017. Though fuel outlets are not closed, the dealers are protesting by not purchasing petrol or diesel for one day. Similar protests are happening across at least 18 states.
According to the dealers, they have been contributing to the country's economy for years. While their investment has doubled in the last five years, their income has not increased, they said.
