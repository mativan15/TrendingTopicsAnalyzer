(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over employment letters to 75,000 people at a virtual event as he looks to tackle India's soaring unemployment less than two years ahead of a national poll and key state elections due in the next few months. 'Central government is working on multiple fronts simultaneously to create more and more jobs,' Modi said at the virtual event, connecting several cities across the country where his ministers were handing out appointment letters to the youth.
