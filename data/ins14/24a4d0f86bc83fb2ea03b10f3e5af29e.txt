Having the same name and date of birth as a noted criminal in Abu Dhabi led to much harassment for Praveen Kumar, a Greater Noida-based businessman, who was kept in custody for nearly four days in the United Arab Emirates. Detained in Abu Dhabi in a peculiar case of mistaken identity, Kumar returned home to Greater Noida on Saturday night. He was travelling to Switzerland with his wife on October 11 and was about to take a connecting flight in Abu Dhabi when he was detained. Back home to a grand welcome by his relatives and friends, Kumar told HT about the entire ordeal he had to face for nearly four days, trying to explain his identity.
