Police and military officers swooped down on a Moscow business centre this week unannounced. They were looking for men to fight in Ukraine – and they seized nearly everyone they saw. Some musicians, rehearsing. A courier there to deliver a parcel. A man in his mid-50s from a Moscow service agency, very drunk, with a walking disability. 'I have no idea why they took him,' said Alexei, who, like dozens of others in the office complex, was rounded up and taken to the nearest military enlistment office, part of a harsh new phase in the Russian drive.
