Introduction to GameFi

As the fastest-growing segment of the blockchain industry, GameFi has attracted tons of attention from crypto enthusiasts, investors, and has started generating mainstream interest. Since 2019, they have been over 3,000 GameFi projects launched across 114 chains.

Many of these games have similar elements, but some rework elements interact in innovative ways. Aside from the gameplay itself, GameFi projects are built on the strength of their tokenomics—otherwise, they're just high-barrier games.
