Singapore CNN Business —

Many Asian countries introduced tougher Covid-19 restrictions than in other continents, a reality that has caused concerns about elevated levels of stress, anxiety and isolation. Now, a number of young entrepreneurs are leveraging technology to provide greater access to mental healthcare there.

In July, Singapore-based Intellect raised $20 million in its Series A funding, the largest amount raised by a mental health start-up in Asia.

Founded in 2019, Intellect runs a mobile app that regularly checks in on users' mood, provides rescue sessions and exercises that tailor to their needs, and allows them to connect with therapists in real time if needed.
