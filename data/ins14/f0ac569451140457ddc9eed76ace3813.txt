King Viserys is no more. You already know that if you've seen the teaser for episode 9, titled The Green Council, which announced the monarch's passing after last week's show. Just before Viserys died, he managed to ensure the realm's disruption when he accidentally gave Alicent the impression he wanted their son Aegon to be king.Don't you hate it when that happens? The Green Council is the second-to-last episode of House of the Dragon's first season. It was one of the best, too. A few characters got to shine like never before, while others showed their true colors for the first time.
