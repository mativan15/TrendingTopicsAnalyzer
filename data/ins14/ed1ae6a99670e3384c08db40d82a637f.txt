LONDON: British Prime Minister Liz Truss battled to retain her grip on power on Thursday, a day after a second top minister quit and rowing and jostling broke out among her lawmakers in parliament in a dramatic breakdown of unity and discipline.Only six weeks into the job, Truss has been forced to abandon almost all of her policy programme after it triggered a bond market rout and a collapse of her approval ratings and those of her Conservative Party.In just six days she has lost two of the four most senior ministers in government, sat expressionless in parliament as her new finance minister ripped up her economic plans and faced howls of laughter as she tried to defend her record.
