If there's a mantra that describes Matt McLain, he described it simply during Arizona Fall League Media Day:
'Have fun, work hard and play baseball.'
McLain, the Reds' No. 5 prospect and No. 73 overall, is no stranger to competition, having grown up in a baseball family. His brother, Sean, was a fifth-round selection by the Dodgers in the 2022 Draft, and his other brother, Nick, transferred from Matt's alma mater of UCLA to Sean's of Arizona State to continue his career on the diamond.
So the Reds ramping up their organizational depth chart with shortstops to provide elevated competition is nothing new to Matt, who has embraced it his whole life.
