NYU Stern released its MBA Class of 2022 employment report today (October 18):

A third top-15 business school in the United States is reporting record salaries for MBAs who graduated earlier this year.

NYU Stern School of Business released its MBA Class of 2022 employment report today (October 18) showing record-high compensation, including the highest-ever median base salary and the highest-ever average total compensation. Stern joins the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and UC-Berkeley Haas School of Business in reporting outcomes that emphasize the continued strong ROI of the degree — and that vindicate the choice of a cohort that began their degree in the worst possible circumstances, when the coronavirus pandemic had shut down most in-person instruction, networking and experiential opportunities were severely curtailed, and there was no end in sight to the crisis and no guarantee that they would ever return to the physical classroom.
