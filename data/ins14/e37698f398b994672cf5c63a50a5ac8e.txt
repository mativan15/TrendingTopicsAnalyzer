When a cornerback does what Tariq Woolen did at this year's NFL Scouting Combine, he usually doesn't stay on the board long once the draft rolls around.
But somehow, all 32 teams let the 6-4, 205-pounder with 4.2 speed fall all the way to the fifth round of the 2022 NFL draft, where the Seattle Seahawks finally scooped him up at No. 153 overall.
Woolen was the No. 58 overall player on our board, and through the first six weeks of his rookie season, even that is looking a bit low.
His latest performance, in Sunday's win over the Arizona Cardinals, featured a leaping interception that helped seal the win late in the fourth quarter, as well as a fumble recovery earlier in the game.
