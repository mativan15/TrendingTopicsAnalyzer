CHUYN Everest Re Group (NYSE:RE) on Wednesday said it expects total pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $730M across its insurance and reinsurance segments for Q3. A majority of the losses stemmed from Hurricane Ian. RE estimated $600M of catastrophe losses in Q3 stemming from the hurricane, and $130M from all other events. "For Hurricane Ian, Everest's loss estimate is based on insured industry losses of approximately $55 billion, driven in part by the significant social inflation in Florida," the company said in a statement.
