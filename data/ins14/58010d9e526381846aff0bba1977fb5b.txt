I spent my first two years (18-20) in the workforce doing basic retail jobs plus a small stint (4 months) running my own department in the second store. I left because I needed a job that could actually pay my bills. Im now making a salary of 37k working for a national bank as a teller but I want to know what my possible career paths are? I've never been one to believe in college but I plan to get a BA in business and eventually follow it with a MS and hopefully start my own business so I don't necessarily want to get a degree just for a job but I understand some jobs might almost certainly require one.
