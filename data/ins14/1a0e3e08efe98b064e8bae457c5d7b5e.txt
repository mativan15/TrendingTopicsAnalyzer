Family dynamics in play for both Eagles defensive players when it comes to one of the game's best rivalries

PHILADELPHIA – The Eagles-Cowboys rivalry means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.

Inside the Eagles' locker room, it's a family affair for defensive tackle Milton Williams and linebacker Kyzir White.

White, 26, grew up outside of Philadelphia, in an area known as the Lehigh Valley, with a father, Kevin White, Sr., who was a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.

Despite his father's love for Dallas, White remained true to his hometown team while starring at Emmaus High School, attending Eagles training camp in the days it was held around the corner from his home at Lehigh University.
