Nearly every new service you sign up for requires a password. What's more, safety requirements vary between sites and apps, making creating new, unique codes harder to generate and remember. As tempting as it might be to use the same credentials across all of your accounts, all it takes is a security breach for hackers to steal your online identity.
That's where Enpass could help. This password management tool is like a digital vault that keeps your login codes secure and easily accessible. Lifetime Individual Plans are on sale for just $25, meaning you can officially toss those sticky notes stuck on your monitor bezel.
