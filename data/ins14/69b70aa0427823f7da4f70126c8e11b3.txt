SINGAPORE, May 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- After a decade's development, the crypto market has shown how technology can fuel financial innovation, but also revealed the vulnerability of technology when it's related to tremendous cash flow. All crypto exchanges, big or small, centralized or decentralized face security challenges. However, it is one of the prerequisites for crypto exchanges to guarantee the security of the platform if the exchange wants sustainable growth. One year after its development, MoonXBT, the innovative social trading platform and the number three crypto exchange in Vietnam has recently established partnership with Fireblocks and Certik to level up its security in the aspects of asset management and code safety respectively.
