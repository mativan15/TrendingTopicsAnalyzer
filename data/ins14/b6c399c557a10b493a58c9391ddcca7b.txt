The United States women's soccer team will face the Netherlands, Vietnam and an as-yet-unknown playoff winner at next year's Women's World Cup — a fortunate draw, even if it included the Dutch, the team the Americans beat in the final to win their most recent world title in 2019.

The Americans learned their first-round opponents at the tournament's draw on Saturday and will enter the tournament in Australia and New Zealand — the first co-hosts in the World Cup's history — as the two-time defending world champion.
