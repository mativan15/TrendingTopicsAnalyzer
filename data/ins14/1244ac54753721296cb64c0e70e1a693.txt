Sacramento Kings rookie Keegan Murray was placed in the health and safety protocol over the weekend and could miss the start of the season, according to Jason Anderson of the Sacramento Bee.
Murray missed the final two games of the preseason due to what the Kings called a non-COVID illness. He managed to practice with the team on Thursday but was eventually ruled out of playing in their finale on Friday versus the Los Angeles Lakers.
The fourth pick entered the health and safety protocol on Friday, leaving his status for the season opener on Wednesday in question.
