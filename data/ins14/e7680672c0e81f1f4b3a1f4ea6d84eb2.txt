U.S. stocks fell early Tuesday after a bounce last week snapped the longest losing streak for the S&P 500 in over 20 years.

The benchmark index was down 1.2% about 45 minutes into the trading session, a drop that follows the S&P 500's best week since November 2020.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off about 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.4%.

These moves come after all three indexes logged weekly gains of more than 6%, clawing back from seven consecutive losing weeks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and eight weeks of losses for the Dow.
