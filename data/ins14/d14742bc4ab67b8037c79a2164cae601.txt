House Republicans are eying an overhaul to federal entitlement programs if entrusted with the majority this November. GOP lawmakers say next year's need to hike the debt limit, a cap on how much the federal government can borrow to meet expenses, presents an opportunity to put federal safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare on the path to sustainability. "We're going to make sure that if you've paid into the system, your benefits are not going to be cut," said Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, who is running to be the top Republican on the House Budget Committee.
