As the Arizona Cardinals offense flails around this season, you have probably heard a time or 50 that Kyler Murray needs DeAndre Hopkins back.

It's a suspect excuse for a $230 million quarterback, but we'll start to find out on Thursday night if it was true.

Hopkins is back. He returns from a six-game suspension for a violation of the NFL's performance-enhancing drug policy. He'll make his season debut against the New Orleans Saints on Thursday night in a game that will be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.
