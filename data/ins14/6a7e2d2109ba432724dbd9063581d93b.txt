By Renee Fry, Founder and CEO, at Gentreo getty While it has been predicted for some time, the U.S. is now in the midst of the biggest transfer of wealth in modern history. According to Federal Reserve data, at the end of the first quarter of 2021, Americans aged 70 and above had a net worth of nearly $35 trillion. Whether or not Americans prepare for this wealth transfer will decide how much money goes to lawyers and courts and how much will go to family and friends. If an individual has no estate plan, anywhere from 3%-8% of the estate's value is lost to unnecessary probate costs and legal fees.
