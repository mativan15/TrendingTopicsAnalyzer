In their first debate rematch since 2018, Georgia candidates for governor Stacey Abrams and Gov. Brian Kemp highlighted their campaign messages and drew sharp contrasts with their opponents.Much of the conversation focused on crime, the 2020 pandemic and election, and education. Noticeably missing from the debate were questions and answers about the economy – a big omission in a state where Atlanta has the second-highest inflation rate in the nation.The debate was held at the Atlanta Press Club on the first day of Georgia's early voting period.
