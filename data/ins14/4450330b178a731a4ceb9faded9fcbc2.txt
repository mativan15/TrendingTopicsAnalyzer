Once almost defined by its notoriety as a dumping ground for American spring breakers, these days Cancun — much like its Mediterranean cousin Ibiza — has settled into a more refined lifestyle. There's still plenty of misadventure for anyone so inclined, but the service and expectations of the guests are now as high as the prices. In the dedicated Hotel Zone, there's a wealth of all-inclusive resorts looking to provide everything their guests desire, all with the shake of a magic wristband. Beyond that, a new wave of hotels have opened further along the Riviera Maya, providing everything from expensive opulence to dedicated resorts for children.
