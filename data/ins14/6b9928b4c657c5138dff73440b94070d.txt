The Indian rupee ended flat on Monday, while its Asian counterparts dropped on recession fears, as the Reserve 's likely intervention continued supporting the local currency. The partially convertible rupee closed unchanged at 82.35 per dollar, having traded in an extremely narrow six paisa range all session. The RBI was likely selling dollars and receiving forwards through state-run banks as the central bank tries to keep the currency around 82.40 levels, traders said. The forwards market had been quite "volatile," said a Mumbai-based trader.
