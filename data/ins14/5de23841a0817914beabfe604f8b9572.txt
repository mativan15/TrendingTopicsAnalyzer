Zuddl Studio we want to give event organizers a simple web-based tool that gives them studio-quality production while also eliminating any last-minute hiccups while streaming an event. BOSTON and HYDERABAD, India (PRWEB) May 28, 2022 Zuddl, an event platform provider, launched Zuddl Studio - a powerful yet simple web-based video production and streaming platform that empowers companies, agencies, and freelancers to create broadcast-quality video content themselves. With this product, Zuddl aims to enable organizers to produce and stream high-quality video content year-round rather than just for their most important events - all at a fraction of what it would cost when outsourced to an external agency.
