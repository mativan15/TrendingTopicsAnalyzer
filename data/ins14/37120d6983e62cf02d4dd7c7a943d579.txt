The Tysons Community Alliance, a recently established publicly chartered organization aimed at enhancing Tysons' attractiveness as a walkable urban center, won't be as dominated by business voices as the group it's replacing.

The Alliance, a nonprofit, means to serve as a 'collaborative framework' helping various industry, government and other community actors build consensus about how to solve shared challenges and enhance Tysons' 'sense of place,' Rich Bradley, the organization's acting CEO, said in an interview.
