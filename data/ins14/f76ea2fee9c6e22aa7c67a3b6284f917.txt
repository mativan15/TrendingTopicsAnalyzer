It looks like nVent Electric plc (NYSE:NVT) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase nVent Electric's shares on or after the 20th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 4th of November.
