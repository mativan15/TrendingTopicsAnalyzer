We have all likely become used to paying hefty prices for a new iPhone over the years - but how about spending a five-figure sum on an old one?Fifteen years after it launched at a starting price of $499 (£269 at the time), an unopened version of Apple's original handset - also known unofficially as the iPhone 2G, iPhone 1 or original iPhone - has sold at auction for $39,339 (£34,887).
The factory-sealed box contains a device with a whopping eight gigabytes of storage (the iPhone 14 starts with 128GB), a camera with two whole megapixels (the iPhone 14 Pro has 48 on one of its multiple lenses), and even a headphone port (remember those?).
