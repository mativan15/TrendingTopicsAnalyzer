The country's sugar production is projected to be 36.5 million tonnes in the 2022-23 marketing season, an increase of 2 per cent compared to the year-ago period, industry body ISMA said on Monday. The marketing season will be starting this month. The production in India, the world's major producer of the sweetener, stood at 35.8 million tonnes during the 2021-22 marketing season. The season is from October-September. With an estimated increase in production despite higher diversion for ethanol, ISMA expects export to be around 9 million tonnes this season.
