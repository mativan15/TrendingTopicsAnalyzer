Oct. 21—Cole Godbout's University of Wyoming football career got off to an inauspicious start.

The defensive lineman spent the summer of 2018 attending classes and working with the Cowboys' strength and conditioning staff alongside his new teammates. However, he started feeling under the weather when he returned home to Hudson, Wisconsin, and was eventually diagnosed with mononucleosis.

He remained at home for the next few weeks, instead of returning to Laramie and starting fall camp with the rest of his team.
