At Orangetheory Stadium, Christchurch: Canterbury 24 (Fergus Burke tries 34min, 57min; Fergus Burke con, 4 pen) Bay of Plenty 10 (Naitoa Ah Kuoi try 52min; Wharenui Hawera con, pen). HT: 11-3 Canterbury are now one step away from breaking their NPC title ‘drought', after Bay of Plenty again felt the Christchurch curse in their semifinal on Saturday night. While many teams would give up anything to go just four years between triumphs, the perrenial prize winning Cantabs are in the midst of their longest dry spell since 1997.
