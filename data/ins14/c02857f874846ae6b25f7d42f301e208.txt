It's time to buy emerging software stocks Vertex and Workiva , according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Adam Hotchkiss initiated coverage of the two companies with buy ratings while identifying firms supporting "essential" processes that have the greatest upside from here. "We believe that growing complexities impacting back office functions across SMBs, the mid-market, and the Enterprise are accelerating the pace of digital transformation," Hotchkiss wrote in a Friday note. "In particular, while many investment themes across base layer software solutions like CRM & back-office ERP systems are already well understood, we believe that the emerging Software ecosystem being built around base levels of functionality has a significant adoption runway over the long-term as innovations drive incremental productivity gains, creating multi-billion dollar profit pools in various segments of the market," he added.
