(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. shares tumbled in premarket trading, falling further below Elon Musk's offer price, on concern the deal may come under government scrutiny.The stock fell as much as 16% to $43.91 after Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration is mulling whether the US should subject some of the billionaire's ventures, including the deal for the social media company, to national security reviews.Twitter had inched closer to Musk's $54.20 a share offer price before the report, with Wall Street appearing increasingly confident that the deal would close.
