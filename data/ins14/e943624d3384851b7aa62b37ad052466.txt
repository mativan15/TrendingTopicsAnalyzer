Jake Guarnera pulled down his second offer from a Big Ten football program last week when Rutgers football got involved with the class of 2024 offensive lineman from Ponte Vedra High School (Ponte Vedra, FL).
Listed as a 6-foot-4, 275-pound offensive lineman, Rutgers is his second Power Five offer and second offer from a Big Ten program. Earlier this year, Penn State football offered Guarnera.
His three current offers now stand at Penn State, Rutgers and South Florida. But more could be on the way.
