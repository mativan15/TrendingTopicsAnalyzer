Mercedes-Benz has expanded its all-electric EQ range this week with the EQE SUV and the high-performance AMG EQE 53. Starting with the more pedestrian EQE, the large electric GLE-equivalent will come in three initial flavours – the 350+, 350 4Matic, and 500 4Matic. In order, these get a 215kW/516Nm rear-wheel drive powertrain, a 215kW/765Nm all-wheel drive powertrain, and a 300kW/858Nm AWD powertrain. Mercedes says the EQE SUV gets the same tech as the EQS while being 'more dynamic,' thanks in part to a 3030mm wheelbase, 90mm shorter than that of the EQE sedan.
