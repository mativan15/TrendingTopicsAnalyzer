Age: 56

What qualifies you to hold this position? I am a person who believes in serving others. We need to support our families, communities, and cities through personal service. I bring prior experience from serving in the Army Reserve for 35 years. Since retiring from the Army Reserve I still feel I have the experience and skills to serve our community as a Bayport City Council member.

What would your top priorities be if elected? My top priorities are public safety, which should always be the highest priority for our community; fiscal responsibility where I believe that sound financial strategic planning is critical to ensure that available resources are used appropriately and wisely, and city infrastructure maintenance, which is one of the most significant costs to a city.
