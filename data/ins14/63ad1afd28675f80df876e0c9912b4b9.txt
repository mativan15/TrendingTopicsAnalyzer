Tom Cruise has recently been in the news for the stellar sequel to Top Gun, titled Top Gun: Maverick, which reportedly grossed over 1.5 billion dollars worldwide and this is when Cruise has recently touched 60 years. Critics and fans alike feel that Top Gun: Maverick has revived the old fashioned way of ‘going to the movies,' by being a massive global hit. This has established Tom Cruise as a movie star over many decades and has proved his consistent versatility as an actor and producer. However, there was a time when even Tom Cruise would get the jitters, such as when he went to meet his idol, the yesteryear star, Paul Newman.
