It is doubtless a positive to see that the Vacasa, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCSA) share price has gained some 39% in the last three months. But that's small comfort given the dismal price performance over the last year. Like a receding glacier in a warming world, the share price has melted 65% in that period. It's not that amazing to see a bounce after a drop like that. It may be that the fall was an overreaction.

So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
