The Biden administration on Thursday announced a slate of new sanctions against Russia, targeting the financial networks that the country's elites use to hide and move money for luxury purchases. The ramped-up punishments on Moscow for the attack on Ukraine included sanctions on individual oligarchs with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. also imposed export controls on 71 companies, blocking them from obtaining technologies used by the Russian military to wage the war. 'President Putin's war against Ukraine is also an attack on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, enshrined in the UN charter,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
