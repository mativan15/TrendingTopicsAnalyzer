Phone in caller Michelle, from Tyne and Wear, discussed how much money the British Government was set to start paying her to help households with the energy price hike. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced his new relief scheme to help the most vulnerable people around the country. Michelle discussed insulating British council houses around the country and claimed a lot of them had already had insulation installed to keep homes warm. She criticised people for 'moaning' about how much the Government is set to start paying because the country has just come out of a pandemic.
