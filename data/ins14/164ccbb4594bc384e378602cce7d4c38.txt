Suspect in shooting of former Wisconsin judge had frequent legal trouble, but friends surprised by accusations

Douglas K. Uhde, 56, the suspect in the shooting death of former Juneau County Judge John Roemer, was sentenced by Roemer in 2005 on a burglary charge in Adams County. After escaping in 2006, Uhde was captured and eventually served prison time until April 2020.

Longtime friend Kevin Baden said Sunday that after being released from prison Uhde stayed with Baden family members in northern Michigan, but was kicked out twice, once for talking about dressing up in a clown costume and "taking care of" a judge in Roscommon County, Michigan.
