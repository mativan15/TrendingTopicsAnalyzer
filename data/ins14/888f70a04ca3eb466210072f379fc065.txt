Oct. 20—"Putting together a food truck park has been a dream of mine for probably over 10 years," said

Mike Shiyaneko, owner of Golden State Trailers, a local food trailer manufacturing company in Olivehurst. "I just never thought it would become a reality here in California."

Shiyaneko is originally from Oregon, a place well known for its established food truck culture. In Oregon, "food truck pods" have become a permanent staple of the culinary landscape, opening up a wide swath of variety and convenience for both residents and entrepreneurs.
