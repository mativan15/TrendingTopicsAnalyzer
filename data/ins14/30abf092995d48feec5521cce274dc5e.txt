Broadcaster ITV and postal delivery group Royal Mail are being ejected from the UK's blue-chip share index in its latest reshuffle.Both companies are dropping out of the FTSE 100 index after their values fell amid the cost-of-living crisis and the economic turmoil caused by the war in Ukraine.ITV felt the axe as investors worried that advertising revenues would be hit by the slowdown in the UK economy, as inflationary pressures hit corporate profit margins and leave consumers with less disposable income.
