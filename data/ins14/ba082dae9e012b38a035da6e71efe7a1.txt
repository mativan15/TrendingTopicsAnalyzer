Tesla CEO Elon Musk hit back at billionaire Bill Gates on Twitter after the Microsoft founder downplayed his attempt to short Tesla stocks Saturday.
Gates made the comments during an interview with French YouTuber HugoDécrypte. Musk has recently accused Gates of not being serious about fighting climate change because he made a 'half-billion dollar' bet against Tesla.
Gates argued he had put more money toward climate change than Musk or anyone else, to which Musk responded 'Sigh.'
'I give a lot more to climate change than Elon or anyone else,' Gates said.
