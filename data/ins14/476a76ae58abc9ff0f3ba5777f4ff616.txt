After a controversial and troubling couple of weeks, Kanye West returned to Drink Champs for Round Three with hosts N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN. While the 45-minute interview hasn't been posted to YouTube, it can be viewed on the Revolt TV website. After a brief introduction, West immediately went into a diatribe about 'the Jewish people,' arguing that he's not an anti-Semite because he's also a Jew 'as the blood of Christ.' However, he then went on a rant about how the Jewish people control all facets of media and entertainment, even blaming 'Jewish Zionists' for recent news stories about how his ex-wife Kim Kardashian and her ex-boyfriend Pete Davidson (who Kanye called 'a heroin addict') have sex in front of a fireplace.
