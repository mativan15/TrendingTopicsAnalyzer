'My life is very Forrest Gumpian,' Pam Grier said halfway through a marathon phone interview, and she has the anecdotes to back it up.

Of performing in a gospel group with Philip Bailey, later of Earth, Wind & Fire, as a teen in Denver.

Of singing backup for Bobby Womack and then Sly Stone, alongside Stevie Wonder's Wonderlove, when Jimi Hendrix walked into the studio to jam — and it was only her first week in Los Angeles.

Of loading her boyfriend Richard Pryor's injured horse into the back of her Jaguar to take it to the vet.
