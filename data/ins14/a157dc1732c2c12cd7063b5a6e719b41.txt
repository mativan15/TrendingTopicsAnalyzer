On 18 and 19 October at the European Business and Nature Summit, European businesses will join the European Commission and partner organisations advocating for an ambitious outcome of the UN Biodiversity Conference COP15. The COP15, which takes place in Montréal in December, will negotiate a Global Biodiversity Framework – essential to safeguard nature and the many ecosystem services we depend on for our health, wellbeing and economy. Today, nearly 1 million species are at risk of extinction globally and nearly 80% of all habitats in Europe are in poor condition.
