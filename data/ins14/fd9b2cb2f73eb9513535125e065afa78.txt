Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. Unfortunately the Rotork plc (LON:ROR) share price slid 21% over twelve months. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 1.2%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 8.5% in three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 13% in the last 90 days.
