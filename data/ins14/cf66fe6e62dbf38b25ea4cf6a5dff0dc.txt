Ram's boss has talked more about the company's plans for electric pickup trucks, which seems to involve a 'better late than never' approach, to an extent. First off, the 1500 EV will arrive in 2024, possibly badged ‘Revolution' using the STLA Frame architecture designed for electric vehicles. CEO Carlos Tavares said that he knows the truck will be late to the game, but that its package towing, payload, time to charge and range will make up the delay. Tavares, speaking at the Dare Forward 2030 long-term plan presentation for Stellantis in Amsterdam, showed off more teasers of an electric Ram, with red taillights sweeping up the edges and across the top edge of the tailgate.
