GREEN BAY, Wis. — No one knows Quinnen Williams better than his brother Quincy. 
And, after the Jets' defensive tackle absolutely terrorized the Packers in the Jets 27-10 win Sunday at Lambeau Field, sacking Aaron Rodgers twice, stripping him of the ball once, hitting him three times and blocking a field goal, The Post asked Quincy about what he saw in Quinnen. 
'What did I see out of my brother? Animal,' Quincy, the Jets linebacker, who had a day for himself as well with a team-high 14 tackles after missing the past two games with an ankle injury.
