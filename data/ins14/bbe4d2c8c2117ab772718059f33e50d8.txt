Right now, the crypto market is sending a clear signal that Ethereum (ETH 0.74%) has won the battle of the Layer 1 blockchains. While it might be down 65% for the year, every one of its primary Layer 1 blockchain challengers has seen even bigger losses. For example, Cardano (ADA -0.92%) is down 73%, Algorand (ALGO -1.29%) is down 81%, Solana (SOL 0.89%) is down 82%, Avalanche (AVAX 0.20%) is down 86%, and Fantom (FTM 0.79%) is down 92%. 
Of these, the two that have the most potential to pop are Solana and Avalanche.
