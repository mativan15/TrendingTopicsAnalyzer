Taoiseach Micheal Martin says he does not believe there is a growing tolerance of violence in Ireland after recent incidents where videos of groups singing pro-IRA songs were posted on social media.Mr Martin said people in Ireland had demonstrated their 'antipathy' to the IRA campaign of violence over 30 years.A video posted on social media at the weekend, which appeared to show passengers at Dublin Airport singing a song in support of the IRA, was widely condemned.The video features lyrics from Celtic Symphony by The Wolfe Tones.
