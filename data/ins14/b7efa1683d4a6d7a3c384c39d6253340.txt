In politics more than in anything else, what goes around seems to come around — and quickly. In this respect, former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's disqualification by the country's Election Commission is a cautionary tale — do not do unto your enemies what you may not want them to do unto you.
Five years after Nawaz Sharif's disqualification from holding office following his conviction in a case relating to the Panama papers — a case that the Pakistan Supreme Court took up on Imran's petitions — Imran himself has been disqualified for 'making 'false statements and incorrect declarations' in a matter pertaining to the sale of certain items from the government's toshakhana into which all gifts and presents from foreign dignitaries or governments to the head of government or other high officials must be deposited, if they are above a certain value.
