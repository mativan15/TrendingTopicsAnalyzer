Asteroid "7335 (1989 JA)" to pass Earth today, says NASA. An astronomer at The Virtual Telescope Project has captured a breathtaking photo of a gigantic asteroid nearly four times bigger than the Empire state building. The mile-wide asteroid hurtling toward Earth looks stunning against the backdrop of space. The space rock is likely to make a close pass by Earth from a distance of 2.5 million miles on May 27. According to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab records this is the 12th time since 1916 that this asteroid has dazzled Earth.
