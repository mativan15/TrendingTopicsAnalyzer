New Delhi: A uniform civil code (UCC) is desirable but it is for Parliament to legislate one, the government has told the Supreme Court. Personal laws based on religion are an 'affront to the nation's unity', the government told the apex court, adding that UCC will ensure the integration of India by bringing different communities on a common platform through an unvarying legal regime. At the same time, the central government maintained that it is only for elected representatives and the legislature to decide whether the country should have a UCC, and no court can issue directives to Parliament to frame a specific statute.
