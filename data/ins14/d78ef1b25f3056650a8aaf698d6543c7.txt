A senior Labour MP has accused two Government ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister Therese Coffey, of 'bullying' and 'intimidating' Conservative MPs as a vote on fracking in the House of Commons descended into chaos on Wednesday night.Chris Bryant, MP for Rhondda, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that he saw 15-20 Conservative MPs surrounding at least one Tory colleague as they wavered on which way to vote on the issue and amid confusion over whether it was a confidence vote in Liz Truss's Government.
