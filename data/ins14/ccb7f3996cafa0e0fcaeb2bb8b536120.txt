A video of a 12-year-old boy crying in frustration as his 9-year-old sister refuses to let him teach her math has gone viral on Chinese social media.

According to Chinese news outlets, the viral moment occurred on Oct. 11 in the siblings' home in Anshan, China. Their mother, identified by her surname Zhong, posted the video of them online last week.

Zhong shares that her son volunteered to help his younger sister with her math homework after seeing their mother grow upset with her. Although the boy's approach is gentle at first, he can be seen becoming increasingly frustrated in the video after his sister does not follow his instructions.
