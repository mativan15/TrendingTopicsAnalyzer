Calling it the first such programme for Pasmanda Muslims by a political party in the country, the BJP's minority wing is organising a meeting of 'intellectuals' of the community in Lucknow Sunday.
The meeting comes three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the party to reach out to 'the deprived and downtrodden' sections among all communities at the BJP National Executive in Hyderabad, seen as an outreach to the Pasmanda (backward class) Muslims.
