Iran continues to be gripped by nationwide protests against the Islamic regime, demonstrations sparked by the death, on Sept. 13, of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini who died while in police custody after having been arrested by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab. The protests are the largest and most sustained bout of civil unrest to grip Iran since 2009 and are seen by many as a true threat to the future of Iran's Islamic rulers.
