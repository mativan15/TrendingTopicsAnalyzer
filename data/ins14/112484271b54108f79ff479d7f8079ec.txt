GameStop stock soared more than 20% on Thursday, extending its two-day rally to as much as 67% amid renewed momentum in meme stocks.Other meme-stocks that have seen a more than 10% surge over the past two days include AMC Entertainment, Bed Bath and Beyond, and SoFi Technologies, among others.The rally comes amid a bounce in the broader stock market that some believe could turn into a sizable rebound, after the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 fell nearly 30% and 20% from their respective highs. Hence, the current uptrend in meme stocks could be attributed to a more risk-on stance from investors following seven straight weeks of losses in the S&P 500.
