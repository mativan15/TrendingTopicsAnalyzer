Certain customers of Chase, the consumer and commercial banking arm of JPMorgan Chase, can now get access to their paychecks sooner. The bank announced Wednesday that its Chase Secure Banking customers will get access to payroll, tax refunds, pensions, government benefits and certain other direct deposits up to two days early. Eligible customers are automatically enrolled in the new service, which starts this month, Chase said. JPMORGAN PLANS TO HIRE 2,000 TECH WORKERS BY YEAR'S END: REPORT "Millions of customers rely on payday to keep up with their bills, so having early access helps them manage unexpected expenses and avoid potential late fees," Chase Consumer Banking CEO Jennifer Roberts said in a statement.
