(Bloomberg) -- Tom Cruise isn't simply taking on what appears to be Russian-made fighter jets in his remake of the 1986 classic 'Top Gun': He's also angering China.    The sequel 'Top Gun: Maverick' features Cruise's character wearing a bomber jacket with the Taiwanese flag, something considered an independence symbol by authorities in Beijing, who view the island as part of its territory. The government of President Tsai Ing-wen asserts Taiwan is already a de facto independent nation in need of wider international recognition.
