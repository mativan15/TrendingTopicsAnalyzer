PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) — Washington State had its best season in a decade last year, but coach Kyle Smith lost most of that team to graduations and transfers.

No problem, Smith has recruited another deep roster of talented players for his fourth campaign on the Palouse.

Last year, the Cougars finished 22-15 and reached the NIT semifinals, where they lost to Texas A&M. They were fifth in the Pac-12 at 11-9.

But the only returning starters are guard TJ Bamba and forward Mouhamed Gueye. Bamba averaged 7.
