Click here for a complete list of our election recommendations. Santa Clara has not updated its business tax since 1992.
Today, the city's top 10 businesses, which include Intel, Applied Materials and Nvidia, have a total market cap of more than $1 trillion. Yet, under the current structure, each pays a maximum business tax to the city of $500 a year. That's ridiculous.
Meanwhile, Santa Clara faces a $27 million budget deficit that could restrict the city's ability to meet its public safety, infrastructure and basic services needs, both now and for the future.
