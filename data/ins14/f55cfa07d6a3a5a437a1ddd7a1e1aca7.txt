Shares of Zymeworks (ZYME 17.67%) were soaring 17% higher as of 10:54 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The big jump came after Zymeworks and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ -1.20%) announced an exclusive licensing deal for zanidatamab. Jazz will pick up development and marketing rights for Zymeworks' bispecific antibody therapy that targets HER2-expressing cancers in all territories, except in Asia/Pacific, where Zymeworks already has licensed the drug. 
So what
Jazz will fork over an up-front payment of $50 million to Zymeworks once the transaction is approved by regulators.
