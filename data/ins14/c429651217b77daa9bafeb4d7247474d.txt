Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has ordered an immediate lockdown and imposition of a dusk-till-dawn curfew for three weeks in two districts in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola.
Places of worship, markets, bars and entertainment will be closed and restrictions have been placed on movement in and out of the two central districts of Mubende and Kassanda for 21 days.
'I now direct as follows: movements now into and out of Mubende and Kassanda districts are now prohibited,' said Museveni in a televised address on Saturday.
