Tesla Inc. shares tumbled about 50% from their all-time high, amid a broader selloff in the US stock market that has hit growth and technology companies especially hard.
The electric vehicle-maker's shares closed down 7.6% to $204.99 on Friday, taking its market capitalization to $642 billion. The decline has now sliced in half the stock's Nov. 4 record closing high of $409.97. The plunge comes amid a wider meltdown in the markets, as the specter of an economic slowdown rattles investors already bracing for the impact of rising inflation and higher interest rates.
