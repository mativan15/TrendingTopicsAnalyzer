Rowing Canada has signed an agreement to join Abuse-Free Sport, three weeks after an independent report Olympic champion Marnie McBean called "shocking" revealed a toxic environment in the sport. The national federation will be able to access the new Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner following a transition period that will end no later than Dec. 13. "The sport community is in need of a consistent national safe sport program and this is a great step forward for everyone involved in sport in Canada," said Jennifer Fitzpatrick, Rowing Canada's director of partnerships and sport development.
