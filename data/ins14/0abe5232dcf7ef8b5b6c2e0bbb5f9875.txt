The Minnesota Wild and goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury are not off to the start they would have hoped for in 2022-23, losing their first three games of the campaign.

Things have been especially rough for Fleury, who has allowed 11 goals over his first two games this season and was pulled from Saturday's loss to the Los Angeles Kings after the first period.
