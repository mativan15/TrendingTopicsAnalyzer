Peter Schiff, an American stock broker, argued the Government needed to 'do the opposite' of their fiscal measures in order to prevent the cost of living crisis now threatening the nation.The economic schemes, including furlough, were questioned by Mr Schiff who suggests these have driven prices up in the aftermath of the pandemic.GB News host Mark Steyn said: 'The cost of living is the cost of lockdown, is it not?'Mr Schiff replied: 'Well sure, we didn't get all that for free.'A lot of people took vacations, they went home, they didn't work and, meanwhile, governments just printed a lot of money.
