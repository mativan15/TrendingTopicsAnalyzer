Residents at risk of flooding should be relocated and emergency services merged, a northern New South Wales mayor has told a parliamentary inquiry.The Tweed shire mayor, Chris Cherry, said the region is at great risk from climate change and has a higher proportion of vulnerable and low socio-economic residents.Flood mitigation and levees can only go so far, Cherry said.'The single thing that is going to mean that we're not back here in the future doing exactly the same thing is getting people out of the floodplain,' Cherry told the inquiry into the state's response to this year's floods on Wednesday.
