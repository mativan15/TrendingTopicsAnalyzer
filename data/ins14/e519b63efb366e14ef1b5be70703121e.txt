Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOLD) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.
