CHUNYIP WONG Real estate services firm CBRE Group (NYSE:CBRE) has been a fantastic stock over the past 6 years, having returned nearly 16% annually while the largest REIT ETF (VNQ) has returned less than 4%. CBRE has been a beneficiary of: Ongoing institutionalization of real estate whereby assets are increasingly owned by professional owners who outsource many services to CBRE and up until recently, transacted properties more frequently than individual owners. Low interest rates which, until recently, have bolstered REIT and private fund returns and helped attract more capital to the real estate asset class driving transactions, financings, and demand for services.
