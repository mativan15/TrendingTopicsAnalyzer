The United States on Friday imposed fresh sanctions over North Korea's missile launches, including on two Russian banks, after Russia and China blocked action by the UN Security Council. The Treasury Department said it was freezing any US assets and criminalizing transactions with the Far Eastern Bank and Bank Sputnik, Russian institutions accused of working with North Korea.
 It also targeted Jong Yong Nam, alleged to be working out of Moscow-allied Belarus for North Korea's weapons research body, and a trading company affiliated with state carrier Air Koryo, which is already under sanctions.
