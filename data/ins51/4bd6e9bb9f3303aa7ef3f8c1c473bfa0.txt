Jose Luis Pelaez Inc The 2022 bear market has created potentially life-changing opportunities for long-term investors. That's not to say that it's over. Morgan Stanley's Chief Investment Officer, Mike Wilson, just provided his latest weekly update: inflation has likely peaked (great news) bond yields are close to peaking or have peaked (more great news) a potential 7th bear market rally has started which could take the S&P to 4,000 to 4,150 by year end (up to an 18% rally) Q4 earnings season is when poor 2023 guidance causes earnings estimates to finally bottom and the stock market finally bottoms around 3,000 to 3,200 in five to eight months So far in 2022 Mike Wilson has nailed it, but he's not infallible, and that's why I'm still eager to buy and recommend the world's best blue-chip bargains.
