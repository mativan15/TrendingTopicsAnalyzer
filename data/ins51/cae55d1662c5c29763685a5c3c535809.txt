Germany's government has stood down the president of its Federal Office for Information Security, Arne Schönbohm, over his links to Russia.
Schönbohm's woes erupted last week when late-night chat show ZDF Magazine Royale branded him a "Cyberclown" in a Twitter thread that detailed some of the wurst moments of his career:

Was das BMI zu Arne Schönbohm wusste. Ein Thread (1/12) #cyberclown
— ZDF Magazin Royale (@zdfmagazin) October 10, 2022
Among the matters raised in the thread were Schönbohm's founding of a lobby group called Cyber Security Council Germany.
