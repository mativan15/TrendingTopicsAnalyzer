Finance chief urges firms to refrain from hiking goods prices to curb inflation SEOUL, June 2 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's finance minister on Thursday called on local companies to refrain from hiking prices of products and wages as the move could add upward pressure to already high inflation. Finance Minister Choo Kyung-ho made the call during his first meeting with the heads of six business lobby groups at a time when inflationary pressure has mounted amid soaring fuel and food costs. "We hope companies can digest factors that cause price hikes as much as possible through ways to enhance productivity and other means," Choo said.
