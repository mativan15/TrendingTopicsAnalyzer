The ever-increasing domestic T20 leagues are squeezing bilateral ties and Test cricket runs the risk of witnessing a reduction in its volume in a decade's time, warns ICC chairman Greg Barclay. Barclay, who was appointed as ICC chair in November 2020, said the world body will face a serious challenge in deciding the next Future Tours Program starting next year."There is a men's and women's event every year and the growth of domestic leagues are forcing things from the bottom and ... what is getting squeezed is bilateral cricket and so we are trying to fit everything in," Barclay told BBC's Test Match Special during the ongoing first game of the three-match series between England and New Zealand at Lord's.
