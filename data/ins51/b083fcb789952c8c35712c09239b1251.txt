The Chicago Bulls opened the regular season with a 116-108 win over the Miami Heat, a team projected to be at the top of the Eastern Conference this season.

The win was a reassurance for the Bulls, who won the opener without max-contract star Zach LaVine.

Here are seven takeaways from the game.

1. With Zach LaVine out, Alex Caruso stepped into the starting lineup.

LaVine was sidelined to manage his left knee after undergoing arthroscopic surgery in the offseason. Coach Billy Donovan said the absence was an 'expected' part of LaVine's recovery despite the guard's insistence after practice Friday that he was 'healthy' and prepared to play.
