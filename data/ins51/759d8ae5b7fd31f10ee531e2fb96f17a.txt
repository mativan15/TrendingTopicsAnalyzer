A 'sophisticated' email scam targeting the Hamilton Citizens Advice Bureau has prompted a strong warning for people to be vigilant and not give out passwords online. It follows the hacking of the bureau's email account on Monday, and the sending of several hundred fake invoices and requests for passwords. Scammers hacked an office email account after fooling a worker into giving out their details with a 'phishing' email supposedly from another bureau office, bureau manager Vicky Haden-Jones said.
