One fortunate Conservative can win a luxury holiday and £500 in spending money by entering the 'Conservative Lottery' – a party money-spinner that brought in £2 million last year. All proceeds go to the party, which promises to spend it on 'protecting the new heartlands we won in 2019' and 'supporting the campaigns and candidates working to unleash Britain's potential'.
The winning ticket holder will be flown out to the Stella Island Luxury Resort and Spa on the north coast of Crete. It describes itself as an 'ideal destination for couples in love and for the ones on their honeymoon'.
