Published: 14:30 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 14:30 EDT, 2 June 2022 A Yale Medical-educated doctor has claimed that flying too often can ruin your sex life, warning that the stress caused by regular travel could cause a person's natural libido to drop. Doctor Florence Comite, from Brooklyn, New York, recommended that people treat their flying habits with care – or potentially see their sex lives suffer. Dr. Comite, who was educated at Ivy League college Yale Medical School, explained how the anticipation, anxiety, claustrophobia, and worries around lack of space - which often comes with being on an airplane, especially if you're sitting in cramped economy seats - can drive down someone's libido.
