Just a few months into his TV broadcasting career, Jason Garrett could already be in line for a promotion.

The former Cowboys coach has been working with NBC on USFL coverage, which began in April. Now it appears he may be taking over for Drew Brees in the booth for Notre Dame football games this fall and possibly in the studio for Football Night in America, the network's Sunday night NFL pre-game show.

The report comes from the New York Post. NBC declined to comment, according to the paper.

Garrett, 56, has been teamed with Jac Collinsworth (son of Cris Collinsworth) for the relaunched USFL's first season and done well, by all accounts.
