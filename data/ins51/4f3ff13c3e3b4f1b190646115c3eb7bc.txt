Rail unions will walk out for the best of a week in early November in the latest twist to long-running row that shows little sign of abating.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers union (RMT) working at Network Rail are to walk out on Nov 3, Nov 5, and Nov 7.

There are no strikes currently planned by drivers union Aslef and the TSSA, which represents station and on-board staff.
