Finance can never become truly decentralized, a member of the Bank of England's financial-stability committee has said, citing an unfair advantage for insiders and the need to respond to unforeseen events.

Carolyn Wilkins is the latest in a line of regulators to cast doubt on governance structures within decentralized finance (DeFi) – noting that poor decision-making led to the collapse of Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers in the 2008 financial crisis.

'I think there are hard limits to how decentralized a system can become in practice,' said Wilkins, a research scholar at Princeton University who sits on the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), in a speech published on Wednesday.
