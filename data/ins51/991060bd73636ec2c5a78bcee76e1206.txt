By Michael Dabaie Chewy Inc. shares were up 19% at $27.86 after first-quarter results beat analyst views. The online pet retailer after the bell Wednesday reported net sales rose almost 14% to $2.43 billion, a bit above FactSet consensus for $2.41 billion. Earnings per share decreased to 4 cents from 9 cents, but came in above FactSet consensus for a loss of 11 cents. "Net sales growth was driven by resilient consumer demand and pricing strength in our consumables and healthcare categories, while nondiscretionary categories such as hard goods remain pressured, which we believe is a result of strong year-over-year comps and the current inflationary environment," Chief Financial Officer Mario Marte said in the company's earnings call.
