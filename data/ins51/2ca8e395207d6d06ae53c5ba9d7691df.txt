Politics has become very divisive in recent years, if elected, what would you do to improve the tone? My leadership style is to listen and address concerns that block agreement. During my two terms as a MN State Representative from 2011-14, I effectively brought opposing sides together when I chief-authored four unanimously passed House bills that were signed into law by Governor Dayton. I will use this same approach as I serve in the MN Senate.

What would your top priorities be if elected? My top priorities are to provide permanent tax relief to Minnesotans to fight the damage to family budgets caused by 40-year high inflation; address the dramatic increase in crime by holding accountable 1) violent criminals and 2) judges and prosecutors for doing their jobs; and, improve education by listening to parents and focusing on academics.
