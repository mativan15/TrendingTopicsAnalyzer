A temporary ban on Waste to Energy (WtE) plants has been called for by a group which says it is focused on building a more sustainable New Zealand. Waste Management Institute New Zealand's (WasteMINZ) behaviour change sector group is calling on the Government to take decisive action on the issue by declaring a moratorium on any WtE proposal that aims to process municipal waste until key concerns are addressed. Group member Ingrid Cronin-Knight said there were five WtE incinerators they were aware of which have been proposed in small New Zealand communities - Waimate, Feilding, Hokitika, Gisborne and Te Awamutu - which aim to take municipal waste.
