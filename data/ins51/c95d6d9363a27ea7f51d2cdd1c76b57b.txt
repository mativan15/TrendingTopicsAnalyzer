In a new book, 'The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,' Susan B. Glasser, former editor of Foreign Policy and Politico and now staff writer at The New Yorker, catalogs the 45th president's turbulent time in office in vivid and sharp detail with her co-author and husband, Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times. Glasser, who writes a weekly column on politics, has been covering Washington and U.S. presidents since the George H.W. Bush presidency following her graduation from Harvard College in 1990.
