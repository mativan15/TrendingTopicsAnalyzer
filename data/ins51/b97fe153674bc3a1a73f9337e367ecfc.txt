A hub for neighborhood activities and a space for other businesses are among concepts from Milwaukee-area commercial real estate experts for Harley-Davidson Inc.'s historic Milwaukee headquarters after the company embarks on what CEO Jochen Zeitz calls 'repurposing' the facility for the remote-work era.

Observers predict the Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer is likely to retain its headquarters on the near west side due to the company's deep ties with the city where it was founded in 1903.
