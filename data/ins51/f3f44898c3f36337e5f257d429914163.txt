High street mortgage lenders are still raising interest rates despite an emergency intervention by the Government to reassure markets. 
TSB, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest all increased the price of fixed-rate deals today, with the latter raising its rates by up to 0.75 percentage points. 
New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt abandoned almost all of his predecessor's tax cuts yesterday in a bid to calm bond markets. 
The effect was immediate and forecasts for further Bank Rate rises — which are ultimately passed onto mortgage borrowers — fell in the hours after the U-turn.
