The foreign secretary has said "mistakes happen" after the government performed a number of U-turns this week - but insisted replacing Liz Truss as prime minister will not calm the markets.James Cleverly said the government does "not aim to make mistakes" but "in life, in politics, in business, mistakes do happen".
He told Sky News' Kay Burley at Breakfast programme: "What you've got to do is recognise when they've happened to have the humility to make changes."The prime minister and the chancellor have learnt lessons from what happened previously.
