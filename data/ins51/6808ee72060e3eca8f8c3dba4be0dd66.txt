Jun. 5—NORWICH — From now on, the phrase "getting exercise in Mohegan Park" can mean more than going for a walk, a bike ride or a summertime swim.

Norwich resident Stephen Tillman, a frequent walker in Mohegan Park Center, was surprised last Wednesday to find some shiny recent changes to his normal route. He went home to tell his wife, Celeste, and bring her down to see the seven new outdoor exercise stations in the park center, stretching from the beach parking lot to the arbor walkway.

"He came home and said, 'I gotta show you something,'" Celeste Tillman said.
