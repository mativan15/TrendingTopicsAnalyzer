MADISON, Ill. (AP) — Kyle Larson is willing to drive just about anything with four wheels and an engine, and his ability to jump between NASCAR's highest level and small-town late model races on dirt should come in handy this weekend.You see, Larson showed up to World Wide Technology Raceway on Friday for the first practice before the Cup Series makes its much-anticipated debut there Sunday having never taken a lap there — not in a race, a tire test or even in a simulator.But given everything he drives — stock cars, sprints, midgets — he sees more new tracks than just about anyone.
