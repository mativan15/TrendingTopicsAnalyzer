The nation's only manufacturer of children's coffins received 19 urgent orders in the aftermath of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

'When we had Sandy Hook, that was another crazy day,' Mike Mims, CEO of Cherokee Caskets of Georgia, told The Daily Beast. 'So we're tired. We're tired of doing these things.'

The Cherokee factory in Griffin, Georgia, ran full tilt for 20 straight hours from Wednesday into Thursday. One difference between the two school massacres was that the 20 coffins after Sandy Hook in 2012 went to individual funeral directors in Connecticut.
