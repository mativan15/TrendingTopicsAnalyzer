It's becoming clear that David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) is having money worries on Emmerdale. The village shop that bears his name isn't doing as well as he would like and money is getting tight. 
He can't bring himself to confide in partner Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) about the problem, either, as he's hoping they'll be getting married soon and weddings cost money, and he's too proud to admit he's struggling.
In upcoming episodes he raises the difficult subject with his father Pollard (Chris Chittell).
