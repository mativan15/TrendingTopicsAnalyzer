Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia's invasion.In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin's troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank's governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%.It takes borrowing costs to their highest level since September 2015 – when Ukraine's economy was reeling from Russia's annexation of Crimea – and the highest in Europe.
