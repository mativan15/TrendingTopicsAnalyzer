Susanna Reid has revealed she's got ‘Halloween anxiety'.
The Good Morning Britain presenter revealed spooky season isn't exactly her favourite time of year, telling co-star Richard Madeley that it's ‘gone bonkers'.
‘Am I the only one, but don't you find that Halloween – it's a tradition that we've inherited in the extent that it's celebrated in America. I get the Halloween thing, but it's gone bonkers,' she said.
