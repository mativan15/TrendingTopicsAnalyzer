The Government should listen to Doddie Weir and fulfil its funding promise on motor neurone disease research by making the money easier to access, a Conservative MP has said.Rugby union star Weir played a key role in a campaign for more funding for motor neurone disease (MND) research which led to Boris Johnson's government committing £50 million last November.The former Scotland and British and Irish Lions lock revealed in June 2017 that he was suffering from the disease, which causes the brain and nerves to progressively degenerate.
