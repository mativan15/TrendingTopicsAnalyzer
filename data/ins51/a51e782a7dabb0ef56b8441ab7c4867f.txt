The Vikings could make history on Sunday.

They have lost to hanging Chads, meaning Chads barely hanging onto their jobs.

They have lost to a variety pack of Kyles.

They have earned L's against the W's, Weinke and Walsh, from St. Paul.

They have lost to random Joshes, a J.P., a Jim, a John, multiple Jeffs and a Joey.

They have lost to Kansas City's non-Chiefs.

They have lost to a McCown. Or was it a McNown?

They have lost to a McMahon not named Jim.

They have lost to quarterbacks they had cast off, and quarterbacks they would later sign, to their regret.
