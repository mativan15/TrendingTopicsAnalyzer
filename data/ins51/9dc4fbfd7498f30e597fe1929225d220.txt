Some years back, soon after the artist often known as India's Picasso, Maqbool Fida Husain, or M F Husain passed away, a number of fakes claiming to be original works of the celebrated artist flooded the art market, with collectors at a loss on how to verify them. Eventually, of course, a solution was found and today, it's generally accepted in the art fraternity – collectors and artists both – that only artworks certified by Husain's daughter Raisa will be deemed as Husain's original works. Provenance, or the record of ownership from the artist to the eventual buyer or collector, is absolutely critical for the sale and purchase of physical artworks and till now, the only option was a physical paper trail.
