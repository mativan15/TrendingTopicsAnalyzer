Millions of people around the world (and at least one JPost tech reporter) have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. While the condition definitely has its benefits (is it a coincidence that several top-ranking entrepreneurs have been diagnosed with the condition?), it may still prove challenging to the people whose lives it affects, including the parents of ADHD children.

Like a hyper-fixated Moses descending from Sinai with two ritalin tablets in hand, hi-tech entrepreneur and fellow ADHD-haver Ziv Elul co-founded the startup Periapt, a med-tech company that is developing an AI-based platform to support and streamline the treatment of children diagnosed with the condition.
