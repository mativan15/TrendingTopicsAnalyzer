A European sidewalk staple could soon become a luxury, as the iconic French baguette contends with soaring electricity and flour prices.

'Consumers can afford to pay more for now, but prices will keep rising,' Julien Bourgeois, whose family runs a central France flour mill, told The New York Times.

Since Russian invaded Ukraine, Bourgeois said the price of wheat purchased by his family has risen more than 30 percent while their electricity bill has tripled, according to the Times.

To offset higher costs in the future, Bourgeois has urged the 1,000 bakeries that buy his company's flour to mark up their baguettes by 10 cents, the newspaper reported.
