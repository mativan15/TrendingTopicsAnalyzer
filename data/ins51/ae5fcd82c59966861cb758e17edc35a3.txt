Dunno about you, but in this house, it's sneezin' season. My cat is at maximum shedding level and is leaving cotton-ball-like tufts of fur on every available surface; the foliage is rapidly changing (although sadly, in Los Angeles, minus the gorgeous sunset-y colors that East Coasters get) and leaving all kinds of woozy particles in the air; and my allergies are partying like it's 1999 and they're at Prince's New Year's Eve party. I wake up in the middle of the night to find that my nose feels like it's been stuffed with cursed beans by an ornery bridge troll.
