Monybany Dau says he likes driving for Uber — but may stop doing it if gas prices don't fall. (Submitted by Monybany Dau)In a 10-hour day, Uber driver Monybany Dau can typically make about $150. The problem is, these days a full tank of gas costs him about $120."There's no saving at all, nothing," said Dau, who lives in Red Deer and drives in both Calgary and Edmonton. Dau likes the gig itself: he loves to drive and to meet new people. But if the price of gas doesn't fall soon, he isn't sure he'll keep doing it.
