For the first time since 2019, Montrealers are gearing up for a summer of festivals with very few COVID-19 restrictions in effect, but there are concerns from festival organizers and business owners that labour shortages could cut into the fun.The Montreal International Jazz Festival, MURAL Fest, and the Grand Prix are just some of next month's attractions, but the city's downtown business association said there are rumblings the city might become a victim of its own success. "We've all heard about the shortage of labour and it's a real threat for events in Montreal, for venues, really all businesses," said Glenn Castanheira, their executive director.
