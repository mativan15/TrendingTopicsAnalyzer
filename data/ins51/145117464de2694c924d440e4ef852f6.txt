The Las Vegas Raiders have been much more reliant on their backfield the past couple of games.

When the Las Vegas Raiders added Davante Adams to form a trio with receiving threats Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow, it seemed this offense was going to heavily favor its passing game this season.

That was the case in Weeks 1, 2 and 3, but Raiders offensive coordinator Mick Lombardi's group has stayed on the ground much more often in the past couple games.

"I think consistency and practice is a big part of it," Lombardi said in his Tuesday press conference.
