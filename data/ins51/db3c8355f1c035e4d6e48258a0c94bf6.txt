The AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran on Saturday criticised the State government's move to provide only 10% bonus-cum-ex gratia payment to sections of the government employees and the staff of its public sector undertakings. In a series of tweets, he called it unacceptable and said when the government had funds to raise a memorial for former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, featuring a pen-shaped giant structure off the Marina beach, how it could be fair to cut down the payment of Deepavali bonus which was entitled to the duty-conscious employees.
