Things went so great for the New England Patriots in Sunday's road meeting with the Cleveland Browns that most forgot about the brief sideline blow-up between wideout DeVante Parker and receivers coach Troy Brown.

The two had to be separated after tempers flared during a heated discussion. Whatever the issue both men had was obviously addressed considering Parker had himself quite the game, leading the team with four receptions for 64 yards.

When asked about the argument after the game, Parker refused to go into the exact details, but he did pour a bucket of ice water on any attempt to make the situation bigger than what it was.
