— Carolina Panthers (@Panthers) October 17, 2022 Anderson, who spent the first four years of his NFL career with the Jets, signed with the Panthers as a free agent in 2020 as one of the first new faces of the Matt Rhule era.
Rhule was fired last week after a 1-4 start and, after a lengthy time of wanting out of Carolina and the team having been shopping him, Anderson followed suit Monday.
