The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has pledged to go it alone and pay for the raising of the Warragamba Dam out of the state budget, if the federal government refuses to split the cost of the controversial plan.But Perrottet was unable to confirm if key reports required before the $1.6bn proposal can move ahead would be finished ahead of the March 2023 state election.The proposal to raise the dam wall has been widely criticised by environmentalists and traditional owners. It is expected to feature heavily in the upcoming state election, particularly in Sydney's western suburbs which have been affected by floods throughout 2022.
