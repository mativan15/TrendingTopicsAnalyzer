HOUSTON -- Luis Severino had no issues shifting from party to game mode after the Yankees' ALDS celebration late on Tuesday night. That was in part due to the quality of the clubhouse bubbly.
'The champagne was terrible,' Severino said with a smile, from the Minute Maid Park media conference room on Wednesday. 'So I think that helped a little bit.'
Jokes aside, Severino is ready and eager to take the ball in Game 2 of the Yankees' AL Championship Series matchup against the Astros on Thursday, looking to even the series before it shifts to Yankee Stadium.
