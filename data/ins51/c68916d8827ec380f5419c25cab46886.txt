CNN —

Zion Williamson did not disappoint in his NBA return after 17 months out, as the forward powered to 25 points and nine rebounds in the New Orleans Pelicans' season-opening 130-108 victory over the Brooklyn Nets.

The 2019 draft first pick had not made an appearance since May 4, 2021, after breaking his foot, but was the star of the show as the Pelicans laid down a marker for their season.

Williamson went 11-of-22 from the field and added four steals and three assists in a 30-minute performance full of his trademark aggression mixed with grace.
