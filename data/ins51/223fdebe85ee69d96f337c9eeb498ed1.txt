It's a low of 3 C in Ottawa as I write this column. Sweater weather to be sure, but nothing compared with what's predicted to be a bone-chilling winter. If you think you're shivering now, just wait until the shock of your next heating bill sets in.

Enbridge Gas Inc., which serves approximately 75 per cent of Ontario residents,adjusts its prices every three months, and on Oct. 1, a new rate increase kicked in after the Ontario Energy Board approved a hike of five to 10 per cent. That comes on top of a rate hike in July of between 18 to 23 per cent.
