At a quick glance, there are a lot of similarities between Texas Roadhouse and most of the other casual, mid-priced steakhouse chains you'll find spread across America. They all have similar Old West-themed decorations adorning the walls, calorie-bomb appetizers like the huge fried onion, loud music, and special bread.

What you won't see at Texas Roadhouse is the same prices when it comes to steaks, however. Texas Roadhouse has consistently lower pricing on its steak than its primary competitors like Outback Steakhouse and Black Angus.
