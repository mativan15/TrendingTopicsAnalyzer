Recruiters at major companies are offering to hire Tesla employees who want to keep working remotely.

On Tuesday, Elon Musk reportedly told Tesla employees they must return to the office or resign.

Remote working opportunities have become a key benefit amid the great resignation.

Tesla workers might not have to return to the office after all — if they're willing to jump ship.

On Thursday, several tech recruiters put out calls to Elon Musk's employees who might be looking to dodge his return-to-work edict.
