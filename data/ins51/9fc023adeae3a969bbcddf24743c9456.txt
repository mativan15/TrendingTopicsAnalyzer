OTTAWA—Google clashed with stakeholders and MPs over its list of concerns with the federal government's online news bill, facing criticism over why its existing deals with news publishers remain shrouded in secrecy.

A Google Canada representative appeared Tuesday before the House of Commons heritage committee, which is studying a Liberal bill that would make tech giants strike deals with media outlets for posting news content on platforms like Facebook and Google.

'This is a history-making opportunity for Canada to craft world-class legislation that is clear and principled on who it benefits,' said Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy and government relations.
