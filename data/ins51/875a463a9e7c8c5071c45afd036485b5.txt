A councillor is changing tack on his bid for the chairperson's job at Environment Southland proposing there should be two co-chairs. Robert Guyton had announced a bid for chairmanship but is now saying it should be shared between a farmer and a non-farmer. However, Nicol Horrell, who has held the chairmanship for the past two terms, said having two people chairing the council wasn't legal. Last week Guyton announced he was challenging Nicol Horell for the position, saying it shouldn't be ‘'stacked by farmers'' because the majority of Southlanders lived in towns or cities.
