The Yankees again turn to Cole in an attempt to keep their season going while the Guardians are hoping to capitalize on their familiarity with the right-hander Sunday night in Game 4 of the American League Division Series in Cleveland. Cleveland is seeking its sixth trip to the AL Championship Series, first since 2016, and third ALDS win over the Yankees (1997, 2007).
