NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Lately, hindering inflation, recession risk and global logistics crisis has been all the rage in chatter. Nearly $10 Billion of estimated losses have been caused by supply chain disruption. Yet, the outlook for freight companies and insurers to get themselves out of their current trough remains bleak.
In a markedly different tone, Otonomi's CEO Yann Barbarroux has strong ideas about the future of the logistics tech sector. With his Co-founder and CTO Jeremy Sutton, he founded Otonomi in 2020, a Brooklyn-based tech-enabled insurance startup focusing on freight insurance.
