If you have made it to Season 4 of 'Westworld,' you're familiar with executive producers Lisa Joy and Johnathan Nolan's unique brand of non-linear storytelling. Mind-bending sci-fi, immersive technology, philosophy of the human condition and lots of robots. Their latest project, 'The Peripheral,' based on the award-winning novel by William Gibson, follows a similar meandering journey. However, instead of AI gaining sentience and attempting to code themselves into humanity, 'The Peripheral' follows a young human woman in a small town trying to navigate an uncertain world by peering through the eyes of a doppelgänger droid into the future.
