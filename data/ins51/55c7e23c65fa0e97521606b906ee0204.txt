Genetic medical testing specialist Invitae (NVTA -15.17%) didn't pass the investment test for one researcher late on Thursday. The following day its stock took a more than 15% hit because of this estimation. 
So what
After market hours on Thursday, financial services company Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Invitae stock. That wasn't necessarily beneficial for the biotech, as analyst David Westenberg rated the stock an underweight (i.e., sell) at a price target of $2.50 per share. Even after that 15% price dive, Invitae still trades at a rich level for Westenberg, at just over $3.
