Jane Stanford's death was one of the most sensational of the 20th century — and now, more than 100 years later, a new book offers enough proof to call it murder.
Stanford, beloved by her community, survived the deaths of her husband and son while keeping her family's namesake university afloat with her own money. She seemed like the unlikeliest of murder victims when she died in Hawaii, spasming and vomiting, poisoned by strychnine.
Who would want to kill a generous old lady?
Plenty of people, according to a new book by veteran historian Richard White.
