AzmanJaka/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis Alcon Inc. (NYSE:ALC) recently published Q1 FY22 results which came in better than expected. The company maintains a double-digit revenue growth rate and is well on track to achieve its full-year guidance. Both segments - Surgical and Vision Care - posted solid growth and are well-positioned to increase shareholders' value over the next quarters. Despite the positive results, I have lowered my fair value estimate from $76 to $59 per share. The main reason behind this adjustment is an increase in ALC's discount rate from ~6% to ~7%, in line with the company's updated WACC.
