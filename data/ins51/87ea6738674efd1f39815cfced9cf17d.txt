Team Fortress 2 has been besieged by bots and hackers for a couple of years, with Valve only now speaking out after fan outrage.
Valve's now 15-year old multiplayer first person shooter still sees tens of thousands of people play it every day (so it's bigger than Battlefield 2042!) and yet it only ever seems to be in the news when something goes wrong.
The game features two teams competing in different scenarios with a wild cast of characters, but the fun has been ruined for a while now and Valve's priorities have skewed away from trying to fix it.
