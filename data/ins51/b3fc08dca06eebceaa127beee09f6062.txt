Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson has blamed Manchester City star Jack Grealish for the Reds' issues in getting star forward Mohamed Salah to sign a new Anfield deal. The Egyptian forward won the Premier League 's golden boot award for the third time in his career this season with 23 goals, an accolade he shared with Tottenham Hotspur's Son Heung-Min. Salah's contract expires at the end of the 2022/23 season and while Liverpool have been in talks with the former Chelsea and Roma forward over extending his say, no progress has been made.
