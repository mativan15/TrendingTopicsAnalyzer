Activist investor Starboard Value LP has a sizable stake in Splunk Inc. and plans to push the software maker to take action to boost its stock price, according to people familiar with the matter.  Starboard's stake is just under 5%, the people said. The hedge fund often targets software companies that could benefit from operational and margin improvements or be attractive takeover targets.   Starboard founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smith is appearing at an activist-investing conference, the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit, Tuesday, and is expected to detail the fund's thesis then, the people said.
