Michael Vi Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a software company offering services related to data and analytics. In the past the company has focused on the defense and intelligence sectors, but is now trying to expand its commercial business. Palantir's business model is service heavy and involves high-touch customer relationships, which raises questions about the company's long-term margins and ability to effectively penetrate smaller customers. Given these uncertainties, and current customer concentration, Palantir's stock is still relatively expensive.
