Credo Beauty, the sustainably focused cosmetics company founded in 2014, is making a new play for growth.

The San Francisco company announced Monday it is buying Follain, a Boston-based rival, on undisclosed terms. It is Credo's first acquisition and comes less than a year after the company tapped a new CEO.

Both companies share a mission to produce and sell 'clean' personal beauty products, meaning they are natural and organic, do not involve animal testing and do not contain what the company calls a list of "dirty" ingredients.
