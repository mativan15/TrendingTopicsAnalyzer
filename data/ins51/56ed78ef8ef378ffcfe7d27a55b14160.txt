I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to driving off-road, I have almost no idea what I'm doing. On pavement, I'm solid. Above average even. But put me face to face with scary ruts and big boulders and I regress into a shaky 16-year-old with a learner's permit. I'm learning. Slowly. But at this point, I'm basically winging it. So trust me when I say that Ford's new electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, makes venturing off the beaten path remarkably easy and fun. During a recent off-pavement jaunt at a Ford media event, the truck's helpful tech and ample power more than offset my mediocrity and made me feel like an off-roading pro.
