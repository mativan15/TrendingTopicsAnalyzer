Kanye West is reportedly living out of fancy hotel rooms and "blowing through money like it's water" - sparking fears he could fall into financial ruin. The rapper, 45, has been embroiled in a number of controversies recently, prompting claims that his ex-wife and the mother of his four children, Kim Kardashian, is refusing contact with him. Earlier this month, Kanye had his Twitter and Instagram accounts restricted following an anti-Semitic tweet. Just weeks earlier, he had shocked fans at his surprise Yeezy show in Paris after wearing a White Lives Matter shirt.
