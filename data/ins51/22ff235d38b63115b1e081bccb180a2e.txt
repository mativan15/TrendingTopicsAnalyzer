TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Newly released documents show that top staffers for Gov. Ron DeSantis — including his chief of staff — were directly involved in the state's program to send migrants from Texas to Martha's Vineyard.

In the two weeks leading up to the Sept. 14 transport of almost 50 Venezuelan migrants to the island, DeSantis' chief of staff, James Uthmeier, sent text messages and had phone calls with Larry Keefe, a former Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney who is now DeSantis' hand-picked public safety czar.
