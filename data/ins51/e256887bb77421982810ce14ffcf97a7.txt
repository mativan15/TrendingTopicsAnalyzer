Peltz will become a non-executive director in July after his Trian investment vehicle built up a 1.5% stake, Unilever said Tuesday, four months after reports originally surfaced that he was buying into the group. When he takes up the role, Peltz will have had a hand in running three out of the world's four biggest consumer goods companies, including Procter & Gamble and Pepsico .
