The U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol launched in spring 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A digital platform, it provides farmers with a way to measure, improve, and showcase their environmental footprint, and retailers and brands a more effective way to source sustainable cotton.

Given that it kicked off as a virus spread rampantly around the world and upended society, one might think that it would have struggled. But these days, the Trust Protocol is bustling — and it's just bagged a major new member.
