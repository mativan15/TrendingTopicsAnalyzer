A tontine is a shared annuity where a group of investors pools money and receives regular dividends from the investment. What sets tontines apart is that as participating investors die, their share of the returns is split among the surviving investors. Tontines have been around for hundreds of years; in their early days, they were used to finance wars. However, they have been used for a variety of other purposes, including as retirement investments and as a means to finance new buildings.
