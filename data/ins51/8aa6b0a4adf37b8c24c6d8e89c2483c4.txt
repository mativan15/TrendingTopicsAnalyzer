I am in my 70s, in frail health, and have been advised to close my superannuation fund – worth close to $1 million – to avoid a 17 per cent 'death tax' on the taxable part of my fund balance. I don't understand why this tax is payable, and why I have a taxable portion. I understood super in retirement was entirely tax-free.Once a person reaches age 60, all withdrawals from their super are tax-free and, provided their entire fund is in pension mode, as yours is, there is no tax on the earnings of the fund either.
