The Commanders are turning to Taylor Heinicke as their starting quarterback for the third straight season.

Heinicke started a playoff loss during the 2020 season after Alex Smith was injured and he started 15 games last year after taking over when Ryan Fitzpatick went down for the season in Week One. Carson Wentz is the ailing starter this time and Heinicke said on Wednesday that he feels better prepared for the job than he did during his previous elevations to the starting role.
