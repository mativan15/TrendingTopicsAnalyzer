To the editor: I am just as pained as anyone else by the recording of ex-L.A. City Councilwoman Nury Martinez and Councilmen Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León making hateful and racist statements. I am more pained for our family, as we are very proud of the legacy that Edward R. Roybal made in paving the way for Latinos and other people of color to earn a seat at the table.

In 1949, Roybal, my mother's first cousin, ran for a second time for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. He was able to mobilize volunteers through the efforts of the Community Service Organization, which he co-founded in 1947.
