Published: 16:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 16:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 The Montreal Canadiens look to remain perfect at Bell Centre on Thursday when they host the Arizona Coyotes. The Canadiens opened the season with a 4-3 victory versus the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs before stumbling in their next two road contests. Montreal regained its footing with a 3-2 overtime win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Monday to begin its four-game homestand. "It's huge for us," said Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki, who has scored a goal in back-to-back games.
