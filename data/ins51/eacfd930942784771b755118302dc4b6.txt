The two men made their pitches separately but that didn't stop them from trading jabs about who would be more fiscally responsible steward of state finances. Independent Party candidate Rob Hotaling was not invited to address the group.

Stefanowski, who addressed the room first, attributed his success to being a product of Connecticut public schools. 'I get criticized, you know, this rich white guy from Madison is running for governor. I'm not embarrassed about that. I'm actually proud of that," he said.
