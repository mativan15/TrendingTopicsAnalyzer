One of the most enjoyable South Korean action movies in recent years, 2017's 'The Outlaws' was a deft mix of brutal gang-warfare thrills and Keystone Cops comedics. It provided an ideal vehicle for Ma Dong-seok aka Don Lee ('Train to Busan' and 'Eternals') as the police investigator whose hit-first-ask-permission-later methods regularly got the job done while infuriating his superiors.

That burly protagonist and his sidekicks are back in 'The Roundup,' which despite a different directorial (newbie Lee Sang-yong replacing the prior edition's Kang Yoon-seong) and writing crew, maintains the original's strengths.
