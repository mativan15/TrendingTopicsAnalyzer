We're switching away from Wall Street's tug of war to focus on cryptocurrencies, and a call from the president of macroeconomic research firm Lamoureux & Co., Yves Lamoureux, who has made some prescient predictions on crypto (not to mention equities). He said the so-called winter for bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.23% is over for now, with a forecast for the No. 1 cryptocurrency to reach $100,000 by later 2023, in a run higher that could last up to 2025. 'I'm not giving a major buy signal, I'm just saying, yes, you can start to buy a little bit,' Lamoureux told MarketWatch in a recent interview.
