Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down as chief operating officer of Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. Sandberg joined Facebook in 2008 as number two to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, then only 23 years old.
Under Sandberg's leadership, Facebook grew into a force in marketing and advertising so dominant that is has drawn the attention of the Federal Trade Commission for alleged anticompetitive behavior.  Along with Zuckerberg, Sandberg was the other public face of Facebook, entering the public consciousness for her role in various controversies, including Russia's attempts to meddle in the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the genocide in Myanmar and the recently leaked 'Facebook Files.
