Distillers, brewers and pubs have said the Government's decision to scrap plans to freeze alcohol duty is a 'huge blow' amid pressure from soaring costs and softer consumer sentiment.New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed on Monday that the Government will reverse a raft of tax cuts promised by predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng in the mini-budget last month.This included a commitment to freezing alcohol duty, which was due to come into force in February 2023.The cost of doing business is completely out of control for pubs and brewers and the failure to act today to reduce pressures on businesses will hit them extremely hardIt is understood that plans to increase the duty in line with retail price index (RPI) inflation will save the Government around £600 million a year.
