The new chancellor has torn up Liz Truss' tax measures and announced a shock U-turn on energy bill support.
Jeremy Hunt unveiled part of his plan to stabilise Britain's finances in a last-minute emergency statement this morning.
He said help with energy bills for all households will only last until April, rather than the two years previously promised.
A review to look at a ‘new approach' to target support at those worst off will take place after that.
He also confirmed he is ditching many of the measures in the mini-budget, including the planned cut to income tax.
