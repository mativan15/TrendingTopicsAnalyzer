By Tony M. CentenoOctober 18, 2022GloRilla and her producer HitKidd are currently at odds over the rights to their hit song "FNF (Let's Go)." On Sunday night, October 16, HitKidd hit up his Twitter timeline to talk about the possible court battle that may ensue over the rights to the popular track. The Memphis producer said Yo Gotti's label CMG, who signed Glo earlier this year, wants to own the song so they can put it on the rising rapper's upcoming EP Anyways Life's Great. After he alleged that she and CMG were conducting business behind his back, GloRilla claimed that she's barely making anything off the song outside of performances.
