HOUSTON -- Living by the long ball isn't necessarily the Astros' formula by design, but it has nonetheless been one of the biggest reasons in why they remain undefeated in these playoffs.
Alex Bregman continued the trend with a three-run blast that proved decisive in Houston's 3-2 win in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series vs. the Yankees on Thursday at Minute Maid Park, which gave the Astros a 2-0 series lead.
It also underscored the state of the Astros' offense, which has now scored 16 of its 20 runs this postseason via their 10 homers.
