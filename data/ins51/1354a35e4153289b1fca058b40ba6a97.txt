Teachers in some government primary schools in Lucknow and Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday struggled to conduct the first quarterly NIPUN Assessment Test (NAT) through 'Saral App' using OMR sheet as in many schools the app was not working properly.'In our school, the Saral App was not working at all due probably due to some technical snag. We could not scan the OMR sheet at school hours. Once the server got restored, we were able to scan OMR sheet in the evening,' said a primary school teacher of Lucknow requesting anonymity.
