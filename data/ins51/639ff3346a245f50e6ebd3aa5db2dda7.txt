Sterling edged higher on Monday following British Prime Minister Liz Truss's partial reversal of her government's economic plan, while the yen was pinned near a 32-year low as markets awaited signs of intervention from Japanese authorities. The pound gained 0.6% to $1.1245 in early Asia trade, after Truss said on Friday that Britain's corporation tax will rise to 25% from April next year instead of keeping it at 19% as part of her government's initial "mini-budget". The news came hours after she sacked former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng, with Jeremy Hunt replacing him.
