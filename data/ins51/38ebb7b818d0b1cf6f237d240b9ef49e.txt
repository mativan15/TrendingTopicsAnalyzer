Victoria's energy network will return to public hands under a re-elected Andrews government, which would revive the State Electricity Commission and build renewable energy infrastructure to replace ageing coal-fired power plants.

Premier Daniel Andrews and Environment and Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio announced on Thursday that Labor would also accelerate its target to cut emissions up to 80 per cent by 2035 and net zero by 2045 – five years earlier than planned.

Premier Daniel Andrews says he will return the electricity network to public ownership.
