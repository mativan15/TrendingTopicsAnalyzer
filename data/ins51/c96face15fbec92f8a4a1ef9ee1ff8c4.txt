Some growth stocks that have been pummeled in this year's sell-off could be poised for a comeback, according to Credit Suisse. Stocks have been under pressure this year as investors face uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's rate hikes and surging inflation. The sell-off has been especially hard on tech and growth companies, which rely on cheap money to grow their operations. As of Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sits nearly 25% off its highs, while the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have fallen 13.
