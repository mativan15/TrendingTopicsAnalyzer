Lands' End said that first quarter 2022 sales fell 5.5 percent and blamed 'unprecedented inflation in food and fuel', according to CEO Jerome Griffith. 'The customer was looking for comfortable, casual clothes a year ago since he was working at home.' That is true and created a spike in demand. However, that has now eased up and the current inflationary pressures have just reinforced the shift in consumer shopping patterns. The litany of high inventory and low sales complaints, brought on by not understanding the shift in consumer preferences is by now well documented.
