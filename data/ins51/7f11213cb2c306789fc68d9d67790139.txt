By Yi Wei Wong Malaysian glove maker Top Glove Corp. Bhd.'s shares slipped to a multiyear low on Thursday as analysts cast a downbeat look on the sector. Shares of the world's largest glove maker fell as much as 8.8% to 1.25 Malaysian ringgit, their lowest intraday level in more than four years, according to FactSet. The stock is now down more than 50% this year. Imran Yusof, head of research at MIDF Research, said the selloff could be partly due to several management changes announced by Top Glove late Wednesday, including plans to install a company veteran as managing director, but noted that other factors were likely also at play.
