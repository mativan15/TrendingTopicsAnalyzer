R. Kelly's former business manager is seeking $850,000 in legal fees after being found not guilty on charges he helped cover up years of Kelly's sexual abuse of minors at the disgraced singer's federal trial in Chicago. Even though Kelly was found guilty of six of 13 counts in the Chicago trial, Derrel McDavid was acquitted on all four charges he faced: One count of conspiracy to receive child pornography, two counts of receiving child pornography, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.
