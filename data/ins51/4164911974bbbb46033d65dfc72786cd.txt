The Karnataka cabinet on Thursday decided to promulgate an ordinance increasing the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) reservation in the state. The state Cabinet had earlier on Saturday decided to issue an executive order increasing reservations for the SC/ST communities, however, following Thursday's meeting the decision was changed to promulgate an ordinance. The Cabinet on October 8 accorded its formal approval to increase the SC/ST quota. Talking about the change in the decision to promulgate an ordinance instead of an executive order, state law minister J C Madhuswamy said: 'We had earlier felt that executive decision would be enough, but later realised that if it is questioned in a court of law, it may lead to issues, so we have decided to bring in an ordinance.
