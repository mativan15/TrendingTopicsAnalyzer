Potter, who left Brighton to take over at Chelsea last month, oversaw a 2-1 win against United in Erik ten Hag's first league game at the helm back in August. United have bounced back impressively since that loss to occupy fifth place in the table with 19 points from 10 games, just a point behind Chelsea who they meet at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
