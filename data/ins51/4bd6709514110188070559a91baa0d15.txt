The Congress on Thursday hit out at the Narendra Modi government over the 'free fall' of the rupee and accused it of being in constant election mode instead of focusing on economic issues.'The rupee again reached a record low of ₹83 against the dollar, noting that it can prove to be 'very dangerous' for India's economy. Finance Minister said that the rupee is not weakening, the dollar is getting stronger. Mere statements will not work, the central government will have to take concrete steps soon,' tweeted the Congress president-elect Mallikarjun Kharge.
