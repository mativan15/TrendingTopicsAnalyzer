A Kansas City man has pleaded guilty for his role in a large-scale methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy that once spanned between St. Louis and Kansas City and was linked to two murders in 2018, federal prosecutors said Friday.

Gerald L. Ginnings, 42, entered the guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays in the Western District of Missouri, admitting to participating in a conspiracy to distribute drugs and launder money. Ginnings also admitted to two federal gun crimes.

Prosecutors say Ginnings was responsible for distributing at least five kilos of meth and used the money he earned for personal and living expenses.
