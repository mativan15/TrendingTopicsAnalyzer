The number of kids waiting to be operated on at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children has doubled since the start of the pandemic. Roughly 5,600 children, most of whom are under 10 years old, are current waiting for their turn to get into an operating room at SickKids. Back in March 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 3,800 children were in the queue for surgery. A spokesperson for SickKids was unable to speak with CP24 today, however they did confirm the above numbers. They also said that 61 per cent of scheduled surgeries at SickKids are now falling outside the recommended clinical window amid the backlog.
