Maharashtra Minister Chandrakant Patil on Saturday said not a single MLA is unhappy and the state government is taking decisions that will benefit people.
Speaking to reporters here, Patil said the Eknath Shinde-Devendra Fadnavis government had completed 100 days and no legislator was unhappy.
The minister of higher and technical education was the chief guest at ‘Mukt Sanvad' programme conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune University.
'From day one, NCP leaders Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil and Congress' Nana Patole had claimed that this government will fail, but that has not happened.
