Housebuilder Bellway blamed the government's now-demolished mini-Budget for a potentially shrinking housing market as it revealed a drop off in private reservations today, alongside record annual revenue.Jason Honeyman, chief executive, told The Standard that the housing market is 'in the eye of the storm until things settle down politically'. He blamed the slowdown in the market from late September on the government's ill-fated tax and spending plans 'pretty much 100%'.'I need stability like any business needs stability, so we hope that they sort themselves out soon, so people can get on with their jobs and their lives … Help for the first-time buyer with deposits, that's probably a good thing to keep the market moving, otherwise we are going to see it shrink.
