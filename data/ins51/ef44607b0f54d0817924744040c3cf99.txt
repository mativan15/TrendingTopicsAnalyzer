The Green Bay Packers will attempt to avoid the first regular-season losing streak of the Matt LaFleur era when the New York Jets arrive at Lambeau Field for a noon kickoff on Sunday.

The Jets have won three of four games; the Packers are coming off a stunning loss in London.

Here's how the staff at Packers Wire believes the Week 6 showdown against the Jets will go down:

Zach Kruse (2-3): Packers 24, Jets 21

A physically demanding week after the trip to London and some tough matchups within the game figure to make this a difficult, 60-minute battle for the Packers, even at home and coming off a loss.
