Yesterday, Tiana Watts-Porter, Technical Recruiter at Microsoft, put a rescue call out on LinkedIn inviting Tesla employees to escape from the chains of the desks and factory floor at Tesla.
In a now-deleted post that mentioned Tesla employees directly, she declared: 
'Here at Microsoft and our affiliates LinkedIn and GitHub we are offering ALL THE OPTIONS!!! You can do things your way, and be yourself here at Microsoft! '

And if that includes working in your pajamas at home, that's just fine and dandy.
