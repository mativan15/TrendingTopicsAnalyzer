While the focus in Dallas this week has been whether or not starting quarterback Dak Prescott will make his return, the real answer to getting back in the win column this coming Sunday against the Lions may rest on the shoulders- or more accurately, the legs- of the tandem threat lined up behind him.

The Cowboys' run game has been effective so far this season, to the tune of 118.8 yards per outing. Ezekiel Elliott's 386 rushing yards places him 15th in the league overall, while Tony Pollard is averaging 5.
