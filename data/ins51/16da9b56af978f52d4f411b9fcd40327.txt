Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green isn't lacking in confidence as he enters his second NBA season.

The dynamic scorer addressed the media on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's season opener in Atlanta. As Green kicks off his sophomore campaign, he has one clear objective in mind.

"All-Star," Green said Tuesday when asked if he has a goal for the 2022-23 season. "You know, obviously as a team we want to win more games than last year. Be better as a unit, try to finish strong and start strong."
