The first half of the college football season has been defined by coaching changes, downtrodden programs finding success and several traditional powers with lofty preseason expectations hitting the skids.

Scott Frost, Herm Edwards and Geoff Collins didn't make it out of September with their jobs.

No. 14 Syracuse, No. 18 Illinois, No. 25 Tulane and Kansas are a combined 23-4.

Notre Dame, Texas A&M, Miami and Wisconsin, all ranked in the AP Top 25 when the season started, are a combined 12-13.

A college football season doesn't seem to officially start these days until Alabama loses, and Tennessee took care of that on the seventh weekend of the 14-week march to College Football Playoff selection Sunday.
