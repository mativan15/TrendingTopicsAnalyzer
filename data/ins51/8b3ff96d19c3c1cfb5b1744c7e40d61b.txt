Jun. 1—As parents continue to struggle with a nationwide formula shortage, state officials report no significant decrease in electronic WIC vouchers, indicating that while there may be weeks more of multiple-store searches, formula is available.

With only two main manufacturers of infant formula — Mead Johnson who makes Enfamil and Abbott who makes Similac — District Medical Officer for the Alabama Department of Health Wes Stubblefield says that the shortage began when the closure of Abbott's Sturgis, Michigan factory interrupted the already strained supply chain.
