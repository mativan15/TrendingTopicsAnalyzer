A spotlight shone down on me, the audience chanted my name and the woman who had been plucked out of the audience suddenly pulled down my pants and exposed me. 
In that moment, my world changed forever as my stripping career began. 
However, not one person in that chanting strip club audience knew my secret – I was actually homeless and living on a beach.
Prior to my sudden entrance into male stripping 18 years ago, I had the world at my feet. 
I was working as a firefighter – which I loved – and had a great upbringing.
