Beaten-down US stocks are likely to tumble again before the current sell-off ends, Robert Herjavec warned in a recent Fox Business interview."We think there's still about 20% to 30% of bottom to come," the "Shark Tank" investor said. The higher end of his estimate would put the benchmark S&P 500 index at about 2,900, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index at 8,500 points — their lowest levels since the pandemic tanked markets in the spring of 2020."There's a lot of FUD in the market," Herjavec explained, using an acronym for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
