General elections in the Chini and Pangi tehsils of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday will herald the era of democracy in this mountain-locked conglomeration of hills and hamlets. Hitherto unheard of in this region elections will be a unique experience to a population of 10 lakhs -roughly 50 per cent are voters of the 21 hill States which constitute the 10,000 square-mile State.This will be more so to the 26,000 voters of the Chini and Pangi tehsils who go to the polls ahead of others. Because cut away from the outside world for most part of the year, they are more backward politically as in other respects than those in the rest of the State.
