The first ecosystem model that covers the complete food web of the western Baltic Sea predicts how marine life in the region would react to different fisheries scenarios and additional human-induced stressors. The model simulations reveal that ecosystem-based fisheries management would restore stocks of commercially relevant fish species and the endangered harbour porpoise population. Marine life would become more resilient, and options for additional carbon sequestration would open up, a team of marine scientists led by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (Germany) explains in a study now published in Frontiers in Marine Science.
