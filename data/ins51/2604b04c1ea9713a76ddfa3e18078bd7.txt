The National Rifle Association's board of directors voted Monday to re-elect longtime CEO Wayne LaPierre, signaling that the gun rights group isn't changing direction despite a rise in mass shootings and its own internal turmoil. LaPierre has been in charge of the NRA's day-to-day operations since 1991 and has shaped its no-compromise approach to lobbying against gun control, even after New York's attorney general accused him of using the group as his 'personal piggy bank.' The NRA said in a statement that the vote was 'almost unanimous,' as a rival candidate, former Republican congressman Allen West, received support from only one board member.
