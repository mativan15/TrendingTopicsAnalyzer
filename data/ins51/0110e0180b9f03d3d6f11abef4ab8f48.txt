Dozens of businesses in West Windsor impacted by the Ambassador Bridge Blockade have now received relief funding totalling nearly $505,000. The blockade, which took place in early February, 2022, was a protest of federal COVID-19 measures at the foot of the Ambassador Bridge. The week-long demonstration closed nearby roads including Huron Church Road from the bridge to E.C. Row Expressway. It also dealt a blow to many nearby businesses in and around the Huron Church Road Corridor. Not long after, Fed Dev Ontario announced the $2.
