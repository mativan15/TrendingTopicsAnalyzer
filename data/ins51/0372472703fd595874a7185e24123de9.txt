Many qualified workers are failed by the current model of work in the United States, where jobs are either part-time or full-time. Working 40 set hours a week is difficult for people like caregivers, but part-time jobs don't have the same benefits or career-advancing potential. Handoff, one of the startups in TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 200, wants to make a concept called job sharing, in which two people split the responsibilities and pay of a full-time position but get the same benefits, more widespread.
