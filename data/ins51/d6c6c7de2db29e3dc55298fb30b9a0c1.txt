Tampa Bay has struggled a third of the way through 2022 but there's still plenty of time for the team to turn it around.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have gotten off to a sluggish start. The team is just 3-3 through six games and the struggles have had some members of the fanbase calling for a new play-caller. With that being said, as poor as the offense has performed, the defense hasn't been much better over the past three weeks.

Simply put, the Buccaneers aren't in a rhythm on either side of the ball right now.
