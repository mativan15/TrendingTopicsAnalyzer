Sylvester Zottola — a 71-year-old man accused of having ties to the Mafia — was repeatedly shot and killed while waiting for his cup of coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru.

The murder was planned by one of his sons, Anthony Zottola, Sr., 44, who is accused of hiring a group of men to carry out the killing of his father and brother, according to federal prosecutors in New York City. Ultimately, the brother, Salvatore Zottola, survived getting shot in the head months before his father's death in a series of attacks on the pair.
