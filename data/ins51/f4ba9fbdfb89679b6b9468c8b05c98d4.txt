The hurricane-damaged Sanibel Causeway has reopened, slightly ahead of schedule after temporary repairs. But there are restrictions on who can travel across the road.

If you'want to visit the hurricane-battered island, the causeway isn't open to you yet. Road access is meant for residents, business people, contractors and emergency personnel — not sightseers.

Here's what to know, according to the Sanibel re-entry plan.

▪ Emergency re-entry on Monday and Tuesday of each week is reserved for essential response personnel only.
