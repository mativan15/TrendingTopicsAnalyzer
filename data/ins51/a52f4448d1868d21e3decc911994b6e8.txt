Oct. 21—SOMERSET, Pa. — With one of the prosecution's main witnesses not appearing in court despite a court order, the prosecution rested Thursday in the trial for three men accused in a 2017 double homicide.

The defendants' attorneys followed the prosecution with motions for acquittal.

Somerset County Judge Scott Bittner denied all of those motions except in the case of one defendant, Deandre Callander, for whom acquittal was partially granted.

The trial started Monday with defendants Samson Washington, Marekus Benson and Callander facing two felony counts each of criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, aggravated assault and homicide stemming from the March 2017 deaths of James Smith, of Portage, and Damian Staniszewski, of Duncansville.
