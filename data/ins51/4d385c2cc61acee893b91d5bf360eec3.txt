Liz Truss tried a ‘mission impossible' with her mini-Budget and has been left leaving No10 as the shortest-serving UK prime minister in history, political commentators have said.  
Withering assessments of her 44 days in office have followed her resignation speech outside Downing Street today, which came after she tried to cling on to her increasingly untenable position. 
One commentator likened the former Conservative party leader's time in charge to a ‘mission impossible where the stunt went wrong' amid the chaotic end to her premiership.
