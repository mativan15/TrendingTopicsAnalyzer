The UK's advertising watchdog has banned a series of HSBC's advertisements for being misleading about its green credentials by not mentioning the bank's financing of fossil fuel projects and links to deforestation.The ruling sets a precedent for the financial sector, marking the first time the regulator has barred ads by a bank on greenwashing grounds.The Advertising Standards Authority said on Wednesday that HSBC could no longer run the series that promoted the lender's planting of trees and its plans to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
