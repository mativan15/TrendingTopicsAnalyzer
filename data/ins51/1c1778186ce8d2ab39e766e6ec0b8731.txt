The first look at Succession season 4 has confirmed an all-out war will unfold with Brian Cox's Logan Roy at the forefront.
HBO has shared an explosive nine-second teaser in which the founder and CEO of the media conglomerate Waystar Royco declares he will take down his rivals.
The dramatic scene comes after the brutal season three finale twist, which saw Logan prevent his children, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kiernan Culkin), Conor (Alan Ruck), and Shiv (Sarah Snook), from taking control of the business.
