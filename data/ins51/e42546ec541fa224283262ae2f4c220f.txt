Auburn Football takes their bye week during week eight, which comes at a great time.

The Tigers are 3-4 heading into the second half of the season, and will need a strong revamp to their offense in order to finish with a winning record.

Auburn currently ranks No. 9 in the SEC in total offense, gaining 377.7 yards per contest. Running the football has been their strongest suit, as they post 170 yards on the ground each week, which is eighth-best in the conference.

When it comes to advance stats, Auburn is one of College Football's lowest rated teams.
