Mauricio Pochettino is the front-runner to replace Steven Gerrard after Aston Villa sacked him as manager after just 11 games into the Premier League season.The former Tottenham and PSG manager is the leading candidate according to the bookmakers after Villa's dismal 3-0 defeat to Fulham was enough to see Villa act with the club dragged into a relegation battle and sitting 17th in the table.Gerrard mustered just one win in nine Premier League games, leaving Villa's travelling supporters to turn on him with chants including: 'You're getting sacked in the morning' and 'You'll never work again'.
