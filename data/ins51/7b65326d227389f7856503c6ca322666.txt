The College Station, Texas, native was offered by the Badgers on April 8th and plans to take his official visit at Wisconsin on June 10th. Flood gave his prediction with medium confidence and a six rating.
Tisdell currently holds offers from several other power-five schools including Baylor, Texas Tech and Vanderbilt, but has no other Crystal Ball Predictions.
