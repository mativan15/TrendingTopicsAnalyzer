We all have excuses that keep us from acting. One of my "favorites" is letting an important task keep me from doing other things. "I'll get started on that project... after I do the webinar tomorrow," I'll think. Or, "I'll get started on that chapter... after I deliver the keynote Friday night." I have the time. I have the means. But I still allow knowing I have something big to do in the near future stand in the way of doing other things.It's not a reason; it's just a precondition disguised as an excuse.
