The opportunity in the digital advertising industry is enormous. Some estimates put the amount of digital ad spending by 2024 at $627 billion. This will get split across multiple publishing platforms, but there are advertising technology (adtech) companies that will facilitate nearly all of these transactions. 
Sell-side adtech players help publishers fill available ad inventory, so these sell-side companies could capture the vast opportunity ahead. PubMatic (PUBM 6.36%) and Magnite (MGNI 10.69%) are the two top dogs on the sell side, but which one looks better positioned to benefit the most over the next five years?
