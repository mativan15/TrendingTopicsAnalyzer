Oct. 17—After spending 44 years in the newspaper business, I've never seen a reporter like Elaine Fitzgerald, the lead character in "Alaska Daily," a new series airing Thursdays on ABC and starring two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank in the lead role. Reporters such as she don't exist in the real world.

Her character is more suited to "Law & Order," playing a detective, rather than in a series focused on a newspaper. Swank's role is more superhero than reporter.

Swank's character is smarter than everyone and has more connections than anyone.
