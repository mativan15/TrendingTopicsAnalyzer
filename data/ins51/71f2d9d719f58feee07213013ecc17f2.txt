Early last year Aaron Batilo, a Denver-area software engineer, discovered Colorado employers would be required to include pay ranges for job openings due to a new equal pay law. Though there were other laws in effect at the time that required companies to disclose salary ranges after a candidate had applied or interviewed for a job, or upon request, Colorado was the first state to enact a law asking for such information upfront.

The shift was likely to pose a challenge for businesses that have grown accustomed to setting salaries in an ad hoc manner over the years, and Batilo joked with friends that companies would start excluding job applicants from the state to avoid the headache of sharing salary information.
