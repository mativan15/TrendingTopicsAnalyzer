It might be impossible to find a couple who smile and laugh as much as Tolu and Yemi Ogunmefun do and it might just be what keeps the spark alive. 
From the minute they arrived at Metro.co.uk's studio – Yemi with a cheerful pep in her step and Tolu with an easy, laidback stride – their chemistry with each other and warm vibe towards others was infectious. 
Their obvious love for each other feels so fresh that you'd be forgiven for thinking they are in the throes of a new relationship.
