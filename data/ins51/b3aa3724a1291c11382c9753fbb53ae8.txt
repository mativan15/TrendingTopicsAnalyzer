United Nations — The U.N. Security Council met in an urgent session on Monday to deal with the gang violence that has enveloped Haiti. The Caribbean nation has been dealing with what the U.N. called "catastrophic" hunger, as access to water and gas have been cut off by Haitian gang leader Jimmy "Barbeque" Cherizier and a growing cholera outbreak continues.

Two resolutions are being proposed by the U.S. and Mexico: one to enact an arms embargo and that would impose financial costs to gang leaders; the second, to create a non-U.
