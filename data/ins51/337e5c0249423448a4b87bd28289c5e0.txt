Oct. 18—When the state playoffs start Nov. 4, five of the games could be played in Morgan County.

Austin, Hartselle, Priceville and West Morgan have first-round home games secured. Falkville could make it five with a win this Friday over Tharptown.

Decatur will be on the road for the first round at Fort Payne.

The other three teams from Morgan County still have playoff hopes. Brewer simply needs a win at home Friday against West Point to join the party.

There are narrow paths to the playoffs for both Danville and Decatur Heritage with both teams needing help for it to happen.
