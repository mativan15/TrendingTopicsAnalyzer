Tomo, a startup focused on providing mortgages to people buying homes, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 44 people, or almost a third of its roughly 150 employees.The news comes amid a wave of layoffs at traditional lenders like Wells Fargo and more tech-enabled venture-backed startups like Better as interest rates have risen and volumes have slowed. Last week the drumbeat of job cuts continued at the lending arm of the brokerage Keller Williams, a company that also counts mostly on its purchase-mortgage business.
