Camila Cabello tried using a dating app once — and didn't last very long.
 
In a new interview set to air on Tuesday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the "Bam Bam" singer-songwriter opened up about taking the common, modern route in an attempt to find her next romance before receiving a message that led her to delete the service.
