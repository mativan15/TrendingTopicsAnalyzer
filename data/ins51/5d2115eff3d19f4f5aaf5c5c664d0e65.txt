Martin Lewis has expressed his confusion over being included on the line-up for Sunday's Jubilee Pageant as he prepared to board one of the ‘national treasure' buses.
Martin aka the Money Saving Expert has previously been voted as the most trustworthy man in Britain, having handed out financial advice for years. 
He's a regular on This Morning, and has also been seen presenting on Good Morning Britain alongside Susanna Reid earlier this year. 
But the latest event he's been asked to take part him has left him slightly baffled, sharing his thoughts with followers on social media.
