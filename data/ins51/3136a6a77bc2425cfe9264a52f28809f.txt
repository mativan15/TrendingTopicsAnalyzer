Fleming caught four passes for a career-high 81 yards and one touchdown in the win at Michigan State.

Ohio State junior wide receiver Julian Fleming came to Columbus as one of the top-rated prospects in the class of 2020, but his career hasn't exactly gone as planned due mostly to a shoulder injury that's plagued him since the eighth grade.

Now fully healthy, Fleming has caught 15 passes for 222 yards and five touchdowns in the Buckeyes' last four games, including four receptions for a career-high 81 yards and one touchdown in the 49-20 win over Michigan State on Oct.
