Google users will be able to choose if they want to see more or less ads based on specific categories and decide what personal data is used to target ads to them, the tech giant announced Thursday.

The new control settings are part of Google's 'My Ad Center,' which will roll out globally to users starting this week.

With the new settings, users will be able to filter ads based on topics, such as 'beauty and personal care' or 'hybrid alternative vehicles.' Users will be able to choose if they want to see fewer or more of those ads across Google search and YouTube.
