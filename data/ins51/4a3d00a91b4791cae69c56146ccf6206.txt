NEW DELHI: The Global Hunger Index 2022 ranked India at 107 out of 121 countries with a score of 29.1. In Asia, Afghanistan with a rank of 109 is the only country behind India while Pakistan (99), Bangladesh (84), Nepal (81) and Sri Lanka (64) have all fared better than India. In 2021, India was ranked 101 out of 116 countries on the GHI and was placed at 94 in 2020. The government rejected the findings, saying the index suffers from serious methodological issues and is an "erroneous measure" of hunger.
