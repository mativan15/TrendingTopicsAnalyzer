After a hotter-than-expected U.S. price report last Thursday, the broader crypto market shed nearly $8.08 billion in value, reports data from Coingecko.

Several tokens were hit harder than others amid the chaos.

Gaming-related cryptocurrencies including Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), and Apecoin (APE) have posted substantial losses of at least 8% over the past week.

AXS, the token powering the popular NFT-based game Axie Infinity, has dropped more than 13% over the past week, per data from Coingecko.
