Kevin Spacey Mega Kevin Spacey, facing charges of assault in the UK, has received the support of the producers of Peter Five Eight, the film intended to mark his comeback after five years off screen.
The actor's return to work has been overshadowed by the UK police confirming they have charged Spacey with four charges of sexual assault on three men in the UK between 2005 and 2013, plus a fifth offence of causing a man to 'engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.'
Producers VMI Worldwide have continued their efforts to sell the film at Cannes Film Festival and have issued a statement, defending their leading man: 'While it's unfortunate that increased negative press is timed with Kevin returning to work, it's also to be expected.
