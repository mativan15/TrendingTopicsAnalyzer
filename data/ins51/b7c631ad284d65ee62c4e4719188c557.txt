Harry Styles‘ 'Music for a Sushi Restaurant' is the soundtrack for a new ad for Apple's AirPods with Spatial Audio that dropped on Thursday (June 2). The playful spot cued to the jazzy opening track from Styles' new album, Harry's House, is a bit of a throwback to some of the classic 2003 Apple 'Silhouettes' ads of yore, featuring pink, red and blue dancers grooving to the bass-slapping tune along with Styles scatting along as his color-blocked body cycles through a variety of eye-popping hues.

Styles requested that Apple donate his artist fee for appearing in the commercial to the International Rescue Committee (IRC).
