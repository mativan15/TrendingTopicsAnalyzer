Newly released photos show the tattoos of escaped Texas inmate Gonzalo Lopez, who has been on the lam for nearly three weeks after stabbing a prison bus driver and making his getaway into the desert. The reward for information leading to the capture of 46-year-old Lopez, an affiliate of the Mexican Mafia who was serving back-to-back life sentences for murder and attempted murder, is currently sitting at $50,000. The U.S. Marshals Service released several photos last week showing Lopez's various tattoos, including one reading "Aztlan" across his lower back and another with "Gonzo" on his stomach.
