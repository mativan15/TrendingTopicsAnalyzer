Amid the confrontation between Punjab Raj Bhawan and AAP government over appointment of the vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, the PAU Alumni Association headed by veteran food economist Dr Sardara Singh Johl, also the former PAU V-C, in a statement issued Thursday said that UGC rules were not applicable on the agricultural varsity and that both sides should solve the issue amicably.
Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit in a letter to CM Bhagwant Mann had said that appointment of Dr Satbir Singh Gosal as PAU V-C was 'illegal' as it was not done 'as per UGC norms' and approval of the Chancellor (Governor is the Chancellor of PAU) was not taken.
