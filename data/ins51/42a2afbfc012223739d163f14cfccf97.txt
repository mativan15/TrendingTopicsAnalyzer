Novavax (NVAX) is awaiting the FDA's decision on its COVID-19 vaccine booster, and whether or not the agency will accept the original formula rather than a new variant-specific formula.However, the company is expecting the FDA to green-light the booster as an option even for those who received other vaccines for their primary or previous booster doses. That's according to chief commercial officer John Trizzino.While Novamax already received booster approval in other countries, the U.S. remains a slow market for the company.
