Prayagraj (UP): The Allahabad High Court has directed the central and state governments to file counter-affidavits on a petition seeking the release of a man booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) for violent protests here in June over derogatory remarks on Prophet Mohammad. The bench comprising Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice Surendra Singh was hearing on Friday the counsels of Javed Mohammad, who was booked on June 11 over the previous day's protest and whose house was subsequently razed by the authorities.
