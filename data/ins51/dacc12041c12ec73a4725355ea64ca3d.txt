Tory MPs are speaking out against Liz Truss's latest U-turn abandoning her commitment to increase state pensions in line with inflation, with a former work and pensions secretary among those denouncing the move.

Stephen Crabb said it wasn't 'the time to consider abandoning the triple lock, especially after such clear promises were made following the last temporary pause [in 2021]'.

Earlier, Downing Street revealed that Ms Truss was no longer committed to increasing state pensions in line with inflation as her new chancellor seeks to cut government spending in a departure from the prime minister's failed growth strategy.
