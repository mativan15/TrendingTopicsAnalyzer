After a series of mysteries, the gripping episode 8 reveals Sauron's identity, and it was also suggested that The Stranger might be a familiar wizard. Also, The Rings of Power's episode gives a teasing clue of whether there will be episode 9. Discussions are happening for the same. If yes, what it may have? But, wait? Is it really happening?

No! Season 1 of The Rings of Power won't include episode 9. This is because the first season of the show only has eight episodes. The Rings of Power debuted on September 2 with a two-episode launch and has since broadcast every Friday until the eighth and final chapter debuted on October 14.
