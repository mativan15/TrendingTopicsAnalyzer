An old video of comedian and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah is now going viral amid the unprecedented economic and political crisis in the UK. In the video that originally aired in Sep 2019, Trevor Noah speaks about Brexit and suggests that India or one of the old colonies of the British should manage the crisis in UK. Netizens trended the old clip and mocked the UK government on the current turmoil. This as Liz Truss' woes snowballed after UK Home Secretary and Indian-origin minister Suella Braverman resigned from her post citing UK government's mishandling of the current situation.
