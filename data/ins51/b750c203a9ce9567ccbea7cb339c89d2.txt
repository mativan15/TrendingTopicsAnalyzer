Facelifts, new models and variant introductions over the last few months are helping Japanese car makers see a smart resurgence in India sales. The higher product activity has resulted in a year-on-year market share gain exceeding 5% for Japanese OEMs in September 2022. In August and July, this gain was 2% and 3%, respectively. The primary driver has been Maruti Suzuki, which improved its market share by 7.8% in September. This gain though came at the expense of Korean, European, American and Chinese makers.
