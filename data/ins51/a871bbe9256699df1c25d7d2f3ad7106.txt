The Senators will try to continue their ascent on Saturday when they host the Arizona Coyotes. Ottawa is coming off back-to-back home wins against the Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals, two teams that traditionally finish near the top of the conference. The Senators skated to a 7-5 victory over the Bruins on Tuesday and a 5-2 triumph over the Capitals on Thursday.
