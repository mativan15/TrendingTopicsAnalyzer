Shares in U.K. banks fell sharply on Wednesday following reports the government was considering a further tax on the sector. Lloyds LLOY, -4.48% dropped 3.4%, NatWest NWG, -2.79% shed 2%, and Barclays BARC, -2.36% lost 1% after the Financial Times said new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt might target the financial sector's profits to help plug a £40 billion ($45 billion) hole in the government's finances. Hunt is due to deliver a Budget on October 31, attempting to heal the damage done to confidence in Britain's fiscal position after his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's badly received ‘mini-Budget' containing £45 billion of debt-funded tax cuts.
