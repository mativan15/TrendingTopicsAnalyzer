Mobile, Alabama, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ViralUp is the FIRST Share-To-Earn and Watch-To-Earn WEB3 Mobile Application that combines DeFi and NFTs into Crypto SocialVerse.

The ViralUp project was born as a natural evolution of the already existing and operational Share2Earn project, which for more than two years has been providing services for the management and development of social media for over 200 companies and over 500 social media influencers.

The main advantage that the new project offers is represented by the new business model that, thanks to the use of the Blockchain technology and of the $VIRAL Token, will allow to create a real and functional SocialVerse in which the users will be rewarded with $VIRAL for their activity.
