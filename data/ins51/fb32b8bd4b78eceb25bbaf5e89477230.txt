A 2020 Wedding Wire survey shows the average engagement lasts about 15 months, which gives most couples ample time to revel in the planning process and enjoy their engagement. And there's certainly no shortage of meaningful ways to congratulate your favorite couple on their special moment, whether that's with a practical item they can use as a duo, a personalized gift that commemorates their love or a planning tool to catapult them into the wedding planning festivities.
