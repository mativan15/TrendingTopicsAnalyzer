Tony Paul had a hard time putting words together when speaking about his late wife Susan. Paul was one of hundreds in four locations in Southwestern Ontario walking to raise money for Alzheimer's Society Southwest, which helped him through his journey before Susan passed away less than two years ago. 'It lasted about 10 years,' says Paul. 'She was very young, 67, when she passed away. So it was gradual at first and then took a real down spike near the end for the last couple of years.' Paul and his team raised $12,000 as part of the $150,000 the society was hoping to raise by the end of the annual walk.
