"APM Reports," the award-winning program, has been shut down. Minnesota Public Radio executives informed employees of the decision Thursday through email and a Zoom call. The St. Paul-based "Reports" specialized in long-form, investigative journalism. Its signature podcast, "In the Dark," won a pair of Peabody Awards — one for its in-depth look at the kidnapping and murder of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling and the other for the investigation of the case of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man who was tried six times for the same crime.
