After months of steep inflation, some taxpayers could save on their taxes next year.

The Internal Revenue Service announced tax inflation adjustments for 2023 in an Oct. 18 news release. More than 60 provisions were revised, including standard deductions and all seven tax brackets.

In September, inflation came in hot, with prices clocking an 8.2% increase over 12 months. The new IRS provisions are an attempt at moderating the pressure of rising prices. The agency each year makes similar adjustments to reflect changes in the cost of living, but CBS News reports that the adjustments announced this year are 'more significant' than usual.
