Sweden's conservative leader Ulf Kristersson won a vote on Monday to become the next prime minister, setting the stage for his nationalist-backed coalition to govern Nordic region's largest economy as it heads towards a recession.   The parliamentary ballot confirmed backing for Kristersson by four parties, including the Sweden Democrats. Now the country's second-largest party, the anti-immigrant force will not be part of Kristersson's centre-right government, but supports him in exchange for seeing its policies on crime and migration implemented.
