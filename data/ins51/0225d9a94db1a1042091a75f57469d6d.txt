While Netflix isn't growing as quickly it was a couple years ago, the world's most popular TV network is back on a positive trajectory. More customers are signing up than earlier in the year, the company said Tuesday. That's good news for investors in Netflix and its peers who suffered steep stock-market losses earlier in the year.'Thank God we're done with shrinking quarters,' co-founder and Chairman Reed Hastings said during a webcast interview with analyst Doug Anmuth.Shares of Netflix were up about 13 percent before the open of New York exchanges on Wednesday.
