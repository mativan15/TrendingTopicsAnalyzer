Readers reveal the non-multiplayer games they've completed the most, from Into The Breach to Final Fantasy 7.
The subject for this week's Hot Topic was suggested by reader Chevy Malibu (PSN ID), and while technically you could nominate a multiplayer game, we were more interested in games you come back to every few years to play through again.
To our surprise (and approval) XCOM 2 was by far the most popular pick, in fact we've seldom known a Hot Topic to be so dominated by a single game. Especially as many of the other choices were also turn-based strategies.
