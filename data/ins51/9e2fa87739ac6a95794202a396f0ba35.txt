Heavy nighttime rainfall here caused flooding on Thursday, causing people to relive the nightmare they had recently due to showers. Normal life was disrupted, and many parts of the city were flooded, officials said, as a compound wall of the Metro Rail collapsed and cars parked nearby were buried beneath mounds of rubble. The busy Shivajinagar area closely resembles a raging river, with cars and bikes being carried away and residents struggling to save their personal items. Water also entered houses in the nearby Ramnagara district, forcing residents to flee to safer areas.
