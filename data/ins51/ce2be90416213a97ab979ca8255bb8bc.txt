On May 14, India banned the export of wheat except where 'letters of credit' have been issued or where counties have put in requests for supply of wheat 'to meet their food security needs'. Despite the ban, there are strong indications that the country might still face a wheat crisis this year that is likely to span both production and distribution.When it comes to production, wheat output by definition equals the product of the area under wheat cultivation and the yield of wheat. The initial government estimate of wheat production for the ongoing Rabi season was 111.
