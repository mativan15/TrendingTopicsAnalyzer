OAKLAND — Last June, when San Francisco voters overwhelmingly recalled then-District Attorney Chesa Boudin, many justice reform activists had a swift rebuttal to those who interpreted it as a sign that Californians were souring on the progressive prosecutors that have won DA seats across the state.
Look across the San Francisco Bay, they said, where Contra Costa voters handily re-elected Diana Becton, a progressive leaning DA who defeated a more conservative underling, and a plurality of Alameda County voters chose longtime civil rights attorney Pamela Price, who fell seven points short of the majority needed to win outright, but finished 16 points ahead of her best-performing opponent, longtime prosecutor Terry Wiley.
