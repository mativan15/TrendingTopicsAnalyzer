PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Charlie Morton took a shot off his pitching elbow that was eerily reminiscent of the comebacker that broke the Atlanta postseason ace's right leg in last year's World Series.

Much like last October, Morton tried to push ahead in his Game 4 start for Atlanta. Unlike last October when he threw 16 pitches on a busted leg -- and earned a World Series ring for his effort -- Morton is headed home with a dinged-up right elbow and a long offseason ahead.

Atlanta won't repeat as champs this year.
