Just days after the United States hit China with sweeping new tech export controls, Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Sunday called for self-reliance and the need to win a battle over 'key core technologies.'

In his nearly two-hour address at the Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi emphasized the importance of technological innovation, but made strong indications that the state, not private industry, would guide key initiatives. Making only oblique references to broader tech clashes with the United States, he called for China to cultivate talent and fund basic scientific research as it seeks to increase its global competitiveness.
