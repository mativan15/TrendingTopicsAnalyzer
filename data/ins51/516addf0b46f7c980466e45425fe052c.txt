Since the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, abortion clinics in North Carolina have seen an influx of patients from neighboring states that have more restrictive laws.

To alleviate some of increased demand on the state's 14 clinics, abortion rights groups are asking a panel of judges to lift a restriction under state law that prevents physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and nurse practitioners from providing medication abortions.

Such abortions use the medications mifepristone and misoprostol to end pregnancies in the first trimester, typically up until 10 weeks.
