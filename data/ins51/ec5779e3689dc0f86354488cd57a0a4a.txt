The confiscation of Russian foreign assets would be 'a very difficult step' as it is not a political decision and requires judicial justification, European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said on Monday.Earlier this month, several senior EU officials proposed seizing Russian foreign exchange reserves, which had been frozen in response to Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell suggested the funds should be used to cover the cost of rebuilding Ukraine once the conflict is over.
