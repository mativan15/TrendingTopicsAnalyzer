Hedge funds are growing increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for global equities, even though markets have already sold off sharply since the start of 2022. Top-performing managers including Lansdowne Partners' Peter Davies and BlackRock's Alister Hibbert have become more bearish on the prospects for parts of the market or on stocks overall, with high-growth technology shares a particular area of concern.'Life is going to be much more difficult for investors,' wrote Crispin Odey, founder of London-based Odey Asset Management, in a note to clients seen by the Financial Times.
