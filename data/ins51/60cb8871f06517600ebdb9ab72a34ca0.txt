Published: 08:15 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:15 EDT, 20 October 2022 Kermit Davis insists his Mississippi team is feeling "zero" pressure going into this season. But the heat may be on the Rebels´ fifth-year coach if they don´t show signs of improvement after missing the NCAA Tournament for the third straight season. Led by guards Daeshun Ruffin and Matthew Murrell, Ole Miss is trying to improve on a 13-19 record that included only four Southeastern Conference wins. The Rebels lost their last five games, but went through an offseason roster overhaul that has Davis optimistic.
