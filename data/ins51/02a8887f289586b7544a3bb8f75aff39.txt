WhatsApp recently began testing maximum group sizes of up to 1,024 people.
And to help manage that, WhatsApp is trialling a new feature that automatically mutes very large groups when you join them.
The feature was spotted by the sleuths at WABetaInfo, who unearthed the details in the WhatsApp beta trial app.
