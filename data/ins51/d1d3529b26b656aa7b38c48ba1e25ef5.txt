The Atlanta Falcons (3-3) will head to Cincinnati in Week 6 for a matchup against the 3-3 Bengals. After staying relatively healthy for the first five games, the Falcons lost some key players during Sunday's 28-14 win over the 49ers, including both starting cornerbacks A.J. Terrell and Casey Hayward.
Hayward has since been placed on the injured reserve list, but Terrell practiced on Wednesday and appears to be on track to play this weekend. Linebacker Mykal Walker also returned to practice after sitting out in Week 6.
