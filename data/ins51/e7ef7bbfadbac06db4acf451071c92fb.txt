By Australian Associated Press Published: 17:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 17:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 Health Minister Mark Butler vows claims of billions of dollars being rorted each year from the Medicare system are being taken seriously. Mr Butler said an investigation would be carried out following reports from the ABC and Nine newspapers that $8 billion was being rorted from the system. The media reports alleged some practitioners were ripping off Medicare and charging for services that weren't delivered, with some doctors reportedly billing dead people and falsifying medical records.
