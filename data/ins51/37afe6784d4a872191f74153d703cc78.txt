THE Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) welcomes the nomination of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Gov. Benjamin Diokno as Secretary of the Department of Finance and seasoned BSP Monetary Board Member Felipe Medalla as the new governor of the central bank.



'Diokno and Medalla are notable economists who have the scholastic distinction and extensive experience that transcend different administrations, making them the best candidates for these roles,' said BAP president Antonio Moncupa Jr.



BAP said their experiences as economic managers in past administrations are valuable assets as the Philippines makes its way towards economic and post-pandemic recovery.
