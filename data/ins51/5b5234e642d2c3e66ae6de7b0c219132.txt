KING Charles has made more than £50,000 in less than a month since inheriting the late Queen's stable of horses.
But still the new monarch, 73, is reportedly determined to sell 12 of his mother's most beloved runners.

The King - whose wife Queen Consort Camilla was at Ascot last Saturday - is due to auction 12 thoroughbreds at Newmarket's exclusive Tattersalls sales later this month.
One of those includes Just Fine, the Sir Michael Stoute-trained four-year-old who earlier this month became the King's first winner since taking over the multi-million pound racing empire.
