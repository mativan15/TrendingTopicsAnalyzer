AICC Spokesperson and senior Congress leader from Karnataka Brijesh Kalappa on Wednesday resigned from the party membership. "Even at the worst of times for the party in the aftermath of 2014 and 2019 debacles, I have never felt enervated and lacking in energy and enthusiasm. But, in the recent past I have been finding myself lacking in passion, while my own performance has been listless and perfunctory," he stated. He further said: "It is under these circumstances that I am left with little option but to resign from the primary membership of the Indian National Congress and to end an association that began in 1997.
