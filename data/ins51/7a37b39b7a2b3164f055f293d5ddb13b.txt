Star Wars series Andor reached the halfway point on Wednesday, when episode 6 hit Disney Plus. Cassian (Diego Luna) continued his journey to becoming the Rebel Alliance hero we meet in Rogue One, having seemingly earned the trust of his new rebel buddies as they gear up for a heist on an Imperial garrison, where they're gonna steal a huge pile of money. 
Unless it all goes horribly wrong and they're slaughtered. The only one guaranteed to survive is Cassian.On galactic capital Coruscant, the rebellion against the Empire is being orchestrated by Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) and recruiter Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgård).
