Three housing projects are being considered for fast-tracked consent, with the Government estimating it could create almost 900 new homes. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke about the fast-tracking of the projects at the weekly post-Cabinet press conference on Monday. It included a project to redevelop a site in Lake Hayes, Queenstown for 748 new homes - which would come with a park-and-ride facility and possibly a new school. The other two projects were an apartment building project in Kohimarama, Auckland, potentially up seven-storeys high and a subdivision in north Auckland for 85 homes.
