Mayor Eric Adams: Good morning. Good morning. We're really happy to be joined here today by Kevin Kim, commissioner of the Department of Small Business Services, and Preston Niblack, commissioner of Department of Finance, two important commissioners in our agencies to deal with the economic stability of our city. I'm also really happy to be here with Councilwoman Julie Menin, who's always just coming up with great ideas of how to move our city forward in the right direction. I'm really excited about this bill, these two bills we are announcing today.
