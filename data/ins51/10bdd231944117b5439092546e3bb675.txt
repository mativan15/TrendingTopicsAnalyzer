For the first time in more than a month, Terron Armstead was back on the Dolphins' practice field Thursday.

And while he stopped short of saying he definitely will play Sunday against Pittsburgh, his ability to participate in some drills was a very good sign, five weeks after he sustained a toe injury in the opener against New England.

'Still dealing with it for sure,' said Armstead, who played 3 1/2 games with the injury, then left eight snaps into the fifth game (against the Jets) and sat out the Dolphins' sixth game last Sunday against the Vikings.
