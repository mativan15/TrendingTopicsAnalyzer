Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Tuesday said his government will take a call on the latest demand for increase in reservation for Vokkaligas within the framework of law and court judgments. The CM's statement came in response to queries from reporters on demands raised by Swami Nirmalananda, the IIT-educated head of the powerful Adichunchanagiri Mutt in Karnataka. Bommai said he has already clarified the government's position on demands from various caste groups in the assembly.

Many communities, the CM said, had been aspiring for a higher reservation and there was nothing wrong about it.
