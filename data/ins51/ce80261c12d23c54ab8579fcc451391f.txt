On Oct. 16, 2022, rumors began to spread online that first lady Jill Biden had been booed while attending a Philadelphia Eagles NFL home game. While Biden was born in New Jersey, she grew up an Eagles fan while living in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. The Eagles went on to beat the Dallas Cowboys on that same evening by a score of 26-17. According to a widely shared video that featured doctored audio, the crowd at Lincoln Financial Field joined in unison to chant 'Fuck Joe Biden.' However, again, the audio had been replaced and misled viewers.
