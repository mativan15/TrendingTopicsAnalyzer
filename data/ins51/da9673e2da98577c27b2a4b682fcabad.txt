On Tuesday at Big 12 media days, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark reiterated that Oklahoma and Texas would remain in the conference for the next two years before making the jump to the SEC in the fall of 2025 after the current grant of rights agreement expires.
According to Yormark, Oklahoma and Texas have committed to Yormark that they'll be present for the 2023 season when the Big 12 welcomes in new members BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF. The new 14-team conference won't have divisions. Instead, the two teams with the best record will meet for the Big 12 championship game.
