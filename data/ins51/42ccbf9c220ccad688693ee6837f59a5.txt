It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Investors in MaxLinear, Inc. (NASDAQ:MXL) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 41%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 23%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 33% higher than it was three years ago. Furthermore, it's down 24% in about a quarter.
