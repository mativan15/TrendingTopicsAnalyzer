We're definitely into long term investing, but some companies are simply bad investments over any time frame. It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. For example, we sympathize with anyone who was caught holding Global Ports Holding Plc (LON:GPH) during the five years that saw its share price drop a whopping 87%. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 27% over the last twelve months. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 26% in the last three months.
