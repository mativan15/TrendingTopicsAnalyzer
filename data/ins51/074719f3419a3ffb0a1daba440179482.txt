Most independent voters say the 2020 election wasn't stolen, but some are still open to casting a ballot for a candidate who says it was, a new poll shows.

In a New York Times/Siena poll released Tuesday, 37% of independent voters said they were 'somewhat' or 'very' open to backing an election denier while 60% said they were 'not too' or 'not at all' open to it.
