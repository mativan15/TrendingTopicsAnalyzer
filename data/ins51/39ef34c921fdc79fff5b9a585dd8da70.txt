The Texas defense has made dramatic improvement statistically this season. The Longhorns are surrendering just 347.4 yards and 18.3 points per game. Albeit, it has come against lesser offensive competition.

Save for the Alabama offense, Texas hasn't been challenged like they are about to be moving forward. Texas Tech and Oklahoma were without their starting quarterback. Iowa State and West Virginia aren't the most dynamic offensive teams. UTSA and ULM were simply overmatched.

Saturday marks the beginning of an offensive gauntlet for the Longhorns.
