When it comes to upgrading your tech, there's no shame in buying refurbished. Refurbished gadgets may have a few cosmetic marks here and there, but they've been thoroughly inspected to ensure that they're functioning like new, so you still end up with a great buy. And now that we live in a time where it's hard to stretch a dollar, buying refurbished is the smartest option for electronics, not to mention that it's better for the planet.
