Pity the fools who still believe that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will prove to be trusty hedges against inflation.Sadly, those people are still out there, clinging to vain hope, despite all evidence to the contrary. Various digital currencies have been spiralling downward as inflation rates in many countries hit highs not seen in decades.That divergence ought to dispel the delusion, peddled by many crypto apostles, that investing in these highly speculative assets will protect, and possibly enhance, the purchasing power of ordinary people.
