The Cleveland Browns have made a few big investments this offseason, especially on the offensive side of the ball. While Denzel Ward (extension) and Jadeveon Clowney (one-year deal to return) have signed deals on the defensive side of the ball, the offense is where the money has been spent.
Amari Cooper was acquired in a trade with three years, $60 million remaining on his contract. Deshaun Watson was also acquired in a trade and then given a huge new five-year deal. Then, last week, the Browns signed David Njoku to a big four-year agreement.
