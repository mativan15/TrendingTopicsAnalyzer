BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Southern University is getting $7.6 million to reduce erosion in a 45-foot-deep (13.7-meter-deep) ravine through the Baton Rouge campus that threatens to drop university buildings into the Mississippi River, officials announced Wednesday.'This is more than funding for a drainage project. This is a move that will protect and shore up this historically Black university for the next generation,' U.S. Rep. Troy Carter said in a news release. The money 'will do more than put a band-aid on this problem, it will be a long-term solution to protect Southern University — and this beautiful community space — from tumbling down the bluff,' Carter said.
