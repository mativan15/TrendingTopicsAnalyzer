Shares of some of the world's biggest technology companies languished on Friday after several days of positive gains for the market. Semiconductor specialist Nvidia (NVDA -4.39%) was down as much as 5.5%, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL -3.88%) was off by as much as 4.5%, and e-commerce kingpin Amazon (AMZN -2.35%) slipped as much as 3.5%.
While each of the stocks recovered slightly, as of 2:44 p.m. ET, the stocks were down 4%, 3.6%, and 2.2%, respectively.
New warnings about the possibility of a recession sent a wide swath of stocks lower today, but there was also company-specific news for each of the technology stalwarts.
