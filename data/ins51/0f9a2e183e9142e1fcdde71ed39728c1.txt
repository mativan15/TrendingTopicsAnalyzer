Michael Bublé has said it will be ‘extra special' to celebrate his 20 years in music with his British fans.
The chart-topping Canadian singer has announced his first UK nationwide arena tour in more than four years, shortly after saying he's been thinking of quitting music to be a full-time dad.
Two decades after the release of his self-titled debut album, the Higher Tour will begin at London's O2 Arena on Saturday March 26, 2023.
The 47-year-old Grammy-winner will then visit Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Newcastle and Nottingham, before closing the tour at Birmingham's Resorts World Arena.
