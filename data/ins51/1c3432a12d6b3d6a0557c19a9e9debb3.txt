Three persons were arrested Thursday night for threatening and extorting money from a person who had loaned an amount of money to one of the accused. An Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) of the Panchkula police was also among those who were arrested but he has managed to escape from police custody and a fresh FIR has been lodged against him.
While two of the arrested accused were identified as Anil Bhalla of Sector 2 and Anil Khillan of Sector 10, the ASI was identified as Gurmej Singh. The police said that the role of two more policemen — head constables Rajbir Singh and Naresh Kumar — is under the scanner.
