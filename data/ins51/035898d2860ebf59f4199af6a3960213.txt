Levine/Zuma Press Cosmetics maker Revlon Inc. has started talks with its lenders on potentially delaying the maturity of debt due next year to try to steer the business clear of bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the matter. KKR & Co., Octagon Credit Investors LLC and other lenders holding some of the $885 million loan that comes due next year are in restructuring negotiations with the company, aiming for a deal that pushes out the due date, the people familiar with the matter said.
