Sophomore forward Matthew Knies scored 21 seconds into overtime to give the top-ranked Gophers men's hockey team a 3-2 victory over No. 7 North Dakota on Friday night at 3M Arena at Mariucci in a nonconference game.

After pulling its goalie, Minnesota (4-1) tied it at 2-2 on Mason Nevers' goal with 1:24 left in the third period.

Until then, it looked as if junior forward Riese Gaber's power-play goal with 36 seconds left in the second, which put UND ahead 2-1, would be the game-winner.

The Fighting Hawks (2-2-1) scored the first goal of the game on Jake Schmaltz's tip-in at 4:23 of the opening period.
