(Alex Mirchuk/Patch)MIDDLETOWN, NJ — It was just announced this week that the Middletown school district received a half-a-million grant from the federal Department of Justice.The money will be used to install special security doors at various points throughout the district. The doors can only be accessed by key cards, which only certain school officials will have access to, said school board president Frank Capone. All 16 schools in the district will be getting these doors, said Capone. Where the doors will be installed will be strategically selected by the Middletown school district's director of security and school administration (superintendent Mary Ellen Walker and others).
