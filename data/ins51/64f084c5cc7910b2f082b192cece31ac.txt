If Proposition 121, asking Colorado voters to reduce the state's income-tax rate, seems familiar, well, it should.

Two years ago, its authors — Independence Institute President Jon Caldara and Republican state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg of Sterling, successfully passed Proposition 116, lowering the income-tax rate for businesses and individuals from 4.63% to 4.55%. And now the same duo wants to lower that threshold permanently to 4.4%.

Once again, the issue is making strange bedfellows. Gov. Jared Polis said during a Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce forum last week that he supports this effort from the free-market think-tank, which has clashed with the Democratic governor often.
