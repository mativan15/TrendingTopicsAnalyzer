Scientists have discovered through a new study what eventually persuaded people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 after previously saying they were "hesitant" to get jabbed.The research from the University of Kansas found that "conversion messages" were one of the most effective tools in convincing people to get vaccinated. This was in contrast to "one-sided" messages of advocacy. Conversion messages consisted of people describing someone who had been vaccine-hesitant and then changed their mind.
