Published: 10:50 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 10:51 EDT, 3 June 2022 Over-confidence could be the enemy of good health, a new study has found — because adults with too much self-belief are less likely to visit doctors even when they are feeling unwell.Researchers at the University of Vienna, Austria, found that people aged 50 and over who were too confident about their health visited the doctor two times less a year on average than those who were not.They warned this could lead to serious diseases such as cancer only being diagnosed in the late stages — when the patient is harder to treat.
