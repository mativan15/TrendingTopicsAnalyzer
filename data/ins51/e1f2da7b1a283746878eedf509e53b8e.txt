The findings of a nationwide survey by the Centre for Developing Societies (CSDS) show that there are not many takers for the principle that people should be free to express their views against the government or ideas that are deemed 'offensive' on social media platforms.
These were part of a media consumption behaviour survey, which also found that even though television is the main source of news for most, newspapers and the public broadcaster Doordarshan enjoy far more trust among the people than private news channels.
