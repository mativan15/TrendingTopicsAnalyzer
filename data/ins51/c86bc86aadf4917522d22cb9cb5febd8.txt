And that is exactly what they are doing.U.S. futures market data shows speculators are holding their biggest net-long euro position in 12 weeks, and that May marked funds' second-most positive month-on-month change in positioning in nearly two years.The latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission report shows that funds increased their net-long euro holdings by around $2 billion in the last week, accounting for two-thirds of a $3 billion fall in the broader long-dollar position against G10 currencies.
