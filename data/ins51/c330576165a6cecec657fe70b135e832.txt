Your Thursday Night Football viewing experience has changed. Amazon Prime – the streaming service arm of the Jeff Bezos' retailing behemoth – is streaming Thursday night NFL games through December.

Although fans in local markets will be able to watch over the air on T.V. – in tonight's case Washington, D.C. and Chicago – out of market fans will need an Amazon Prime Video subscription ($8.99 per month alone and is included in the overall Amazon Prime price of $14.99 per month or $139 for the year) and a streaming device configured to watch on their T.
