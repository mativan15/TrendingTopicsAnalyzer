Policygenius, an insurtech that raised $125 million in a Series E round less than three months ago, has reportedly laid off 25% of its staff.
The number of employees affected is not confirmed but is believed to be around 170, according to multiple sources.
One employee posted on LinkedIn today that he was among the 25% of staff that were let go.
In a statement provided via email, Jennifer Fitzgerald, CEO and co-founder of Policygenius, did not confirm that number, saying:
As with many companies, the sudden and dramatic shift in the economy has forced us to adapt our strategy.
