WASHINGTON — If Republicans win control of the U.S. House of Representatives next month, they could hold the government's credit hostage to force spending cuts ― including to programs like Social Security and Medicare.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other lawmakers said this month they'll use the federal government's 'debt ceiling' to try to pry policy concessions from Democrats.

'You can't just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt,' McCarthy told Punchbowl News in an interview published Tuesday.
