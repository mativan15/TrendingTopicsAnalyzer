The Irvine man's claims were numerous: He was a Navy SEAL, owned McDonald's franchises, ran a chain of gyms, and was a successful businessman and investor, he said.

Ze'Shawn Stanley Campbell's stories were bound by one common thread: He needed money from those who heard them.

The 35-year-old pleaded guilty Monday to one count each of wire fraud and money laundering in a romance scam that ran from April 2014 to April 2020, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Central District of California.
