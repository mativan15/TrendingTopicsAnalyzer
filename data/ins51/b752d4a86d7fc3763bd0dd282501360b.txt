Two protesters have been removed from the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and placed under arrest.

Video shows the moment one of the men was brought down by police at the Dartford Crossing.

The supporters of Just Stop Oil scaled the bridge's masts in the early hours of Monday, disrupting traffic on the M25.

They said they had been taking action against new government oil and gas licences.
