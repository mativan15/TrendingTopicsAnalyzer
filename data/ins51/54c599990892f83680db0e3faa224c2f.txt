Mumbai, Indian airlines industry will continue to be sick unless there are policies in place to ensure that the operators have at least 4-6 months of cash kept in reserves for continuity of operations, according to global consultancy and aviation firm CAPA. CAPA said it estimates the domestic airline industry could post losses to the tune of USD 1.4-1.7 billion or more losses this fiscal. The two listed airlines, IndiGo and SpiceJet, have already reported losses of Rs 1,064.30 crore and Rs 789 crore, respectively, in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal.
