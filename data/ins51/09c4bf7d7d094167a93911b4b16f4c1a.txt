Liverpool have opened an investigation into claims that coins were hurled at the Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola during his side's 1-0 defeat at Anfield.It came as Liverpool condemned what they described as 'vile' chants from the visiting supporters, while graffiti referring to the Hillsborough disaster was also daubed on toilet doors in the away concourse.Guardiola had become embroiled with the home crowd after Phil Foden had a goal disallowed for a foul on Fabinho by Erling Haaland and it was then that the objects were allegedly thrown.
