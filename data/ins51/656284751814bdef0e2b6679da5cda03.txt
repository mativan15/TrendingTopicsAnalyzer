For Debbie Mohan, who is fighting both cancer and the threat of eviction, her choice for city councillor comes down to who will fight for renters at city hall.

She's not alone in York South—Weston, a ward that includes the Weston and Mount Dennis neighbourhoods and is home to more tenants than homeowners.

'I'll vote for (Chiara) Padovani — the tenant one,' says Mohan, who is among residents fighting what they call an attempted 'renoviction' by an apartment block owner that says it needs tenants out only while the building is being renovated.
