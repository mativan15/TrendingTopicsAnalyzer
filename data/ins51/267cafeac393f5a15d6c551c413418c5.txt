Investing.com-- Asian stock markets rose on Tuesday after a slew of strong corporate earnings spurred an overnight recovery on Wall Street, although mixed economic signals and concerns over a U.S. semiconductor blockade hurt Chinese stocks.

China's bluechip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index fell 0.1%, while the Shanghai Composite index traded flat. Concerns over the Chinese economy continued to weigh on the stock market, after President Xi Jinping signaled the country has no intention of scaling back its strict zero-COVID policy.
