When architect Puran Kumar got started on renovating his firm, Studio PKA's studio space, he realised the need for a critical response to the inherited space, and the 'idea of unearthing and discovering, rather than a set mandatory approach'. Located on the second floor of a 100-year-old Victorian era building in Mumbai, The Loft, is an example of how architecture today is more responsive, and less by-the-book. 'An honest reflection of the context and a pragmatic functional design was adopted. This was done not only to respect, retain and celebrate the spirit of the place but also respond to the myriad experiences it could possibly offer,' says Puran, of his project completed earlier this year, which has been shortlisted under the Workplace (Small) Category at the upcoming World Architecture Festival 2022 in Lisbon.
