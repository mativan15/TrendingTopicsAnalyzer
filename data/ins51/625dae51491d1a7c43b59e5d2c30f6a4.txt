Naperville Central pitcher Jack Skidmore didn't taking anything for granted Thursday.The senior right-hander has heard all the clichés about the state playoffs — how the stakes get raised exponentially. But he wasn't totally swayed by that type of thinking.He just knows better.'I had this mindset that it was not just another game,' said Skidmore, who has committed to Lincoln Trail College. 'You have to go out there and compete.'Just like the other team, I went into the game with the realization that this could be the last game I play in high school.
