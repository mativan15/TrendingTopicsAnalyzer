The Indian economy is a "bright star" in an otherwise gloomy situation globally, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said Monday. Addressing a CII event on renewable energy, he also said that efforts should be made to maintain the entire supply chain of this sector in India and not allow a situation like the pharma sector where "our northern neighbour almost took away the entire industry". The minister said that the Covid-19 pandemic has "taught us that we have to be self-sufficient in the sources of renewable energy".
