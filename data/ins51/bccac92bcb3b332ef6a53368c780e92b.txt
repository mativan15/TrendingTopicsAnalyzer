They always knew they would end up there. Tuesday night, Nestor Cortes, Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge punched that ticket back to Houston. Cortes pitched brilliantly on short rest and Stanton and Judge homered to power the Bombers to a 5-1 win over the Guardians to clinch the American League Division Series at Yankee Stadium. They needed all five games — played over eight days because of rain — to earn their berth into their third American League Championship Series in the last six year.

Like the previous two, the Yankees will face the Astros.
