MILLIONS of us are frantically hunting bunting for Platinum Jubilee street parties being held all over the country during next week's four-day Bank Holiday.

We teamed up with Iceland and The Food Warehouse to give away five prizes of £2,000 so the winners could buy everything they need for their royal knees-up, including food, booze, table settings and, of course, bunting.
