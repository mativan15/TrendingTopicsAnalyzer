As the plane begins its descent into Amritsar on a cloudless day, the first thing you notice is how close the mountains are to the city, shadowed by the Himachal and Kashmir ranges to its North-East. As the plane dips further the lush green fields around the city gladden your eyes, and then the heart skips a beat with the divine image of the Golden Temple around which the town came about.
Amritsar, in fact, was a city of many gardens, and during the days of the Khalsa Sarkar early 19th century, the sardars of the Misls had many garden estates that caressed its circumference.
