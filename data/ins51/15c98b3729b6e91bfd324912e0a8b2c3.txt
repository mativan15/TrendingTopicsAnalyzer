At Leighton Buzzard on Sunday, a choirgirl with plaits, in surplice and cassock, was carefully turned upside down by two bigger girls, her head resting on a comfortable cushion, and held there while a short speech was made, quoting the 17th-century will of Edward Wilkes.
Really, the ceremony should have been on Monday, one of the Rogation days. Those are the three days before Ascension day, which is 40 days after Easter, so always a Thursday. As people aren't free during the week to take part in the traditional parish walks that marked Rogationtide, the curious customs are enacted on the Sunday instead.
