By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:16 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 01:46 EDT, 19 October 2022 NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet has defended the blocking of a United Nations delegation from visiting inmates in the state's prisons. Greens MP Jenny Leong raised the matter in state parliament on Wednesday, questioning why NSW was the only Australian jurisdiction to prevent the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture delegation from assessing jail conditions. She asked the premier during Question Time on Wednesday: "What exactly are you hiding and what don't you want them to see?" Mr Perrottet defended his government's decision, saying the NSW prison system "is the strongest in the country".
