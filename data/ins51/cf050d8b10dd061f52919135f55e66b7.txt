Caroline Abrahams, Age UK's charity director, said the rate of inflation "only strengthens the case for reinstating the triple lock" and warned Ms Truss that breaking the promise would be "devastating for the millions of older people who rely on the state pension".
She said: "Knowing their state pension would keep pace with rising prices because of the triple lock has given precious hope to many older people at a time of great anxiety. For the Government to take that away from them now would be a hammer blow, as well as a flagrant breach of trust.
