(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks resumed their decline as President Xi Jinping offered little sign of a shift away from Covid Zero in his key speech, disappointing investors who had been hoping for some loosening of restrictions to shore up the market.The benchmark CSI 300 Index slid as much as 0.9% early Monday, after anticipations ahead of the twice-a-decade Party Congress contributed to a jump on Friday. A gauge of Chinese equities listed in Hong Kong also traded lower.  China stock traders have been looking to the leadership gathering for fresh market impetus after suffering losses that have been among the worst in the world.
