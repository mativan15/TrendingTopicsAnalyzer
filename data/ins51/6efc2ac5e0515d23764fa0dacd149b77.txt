Labour-led Slough Borough Council bought the large array of indoor plants for its £41million Observatory House headquarters when it moved in 2019. It spent £28,000 on them but they are now "dying" because of a £760m borrowing debt which forced them to terminate a contract for watering them, council leader James Swindlehurst said.Mr Swindlehurst said he has been watering the plants himself.In an email seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), a council officer confirmed a one-off payment on the plants from a local business when members moved into the building.
