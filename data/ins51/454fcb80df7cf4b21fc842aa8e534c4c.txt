Published: 16:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 16:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 No. 16 Penn State will aim to regain its footing after being run over in its most recent outing when it hosts Big Ten rival Minnesota on Saturday night in State College, Pa. The Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-1) tumbled six spots in The Associated Press Top 25 poll after surrendering 418 yards rushing in a 41-17 setback to then-No. 5 Michigan last Saturday. Penn State will bid to tie up loose ends this Saturday during its annual "White Out" game.
