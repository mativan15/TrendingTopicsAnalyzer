A couple in England made a profitable find during home renovations when they uncovered a treasure trove of coins beneath their kitchen floor. The owners of an 18th-century home in a small village near Hull were relaying their kitchen floor when they found 264 rare gold coins inside a pot. Turns out the renovation more than paid for itself, with the coins selling for £754,000 (NZ$1,519,000) at an auction in London. Spink & Son were astounded by the sale price, with auctioneer and coin specialist Gregory Edmund saying the find represented "120 years of English history hidden in a pot the same size as a soda can".
