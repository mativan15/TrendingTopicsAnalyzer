Antonio Conte will meet Tottenham's managing director Fabio Paratici for talks in Turin on Friday, amid increasing confidence the head coach will remain in charge next season.Conte has repeatedly refused to guarantee he will remain in post next season, despite having a year still to run on his contract, but the club is believe he is committed to the project.The 52-year-old has been on holiday with his family in Italy since Spurs clinched a return to the Champions League against Norwich on Sunday and Paratici has flown out to Turin to meet him in the city where the pair worked together at Juventus.
