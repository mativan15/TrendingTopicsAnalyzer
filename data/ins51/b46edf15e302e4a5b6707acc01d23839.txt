Applications slid for a fourth straight month, pressured by rising costs of borrowing money to buy a home. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.94% for the week from 6.81%, also dampening refinancing activity. Meanwhile, housing starts declined more than previously estimated in September. The gauge of new home construction fell 8.1% from the prior month to a rate of 1.
