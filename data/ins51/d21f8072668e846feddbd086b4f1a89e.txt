Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to former US President Donald Trump, has been sentenced to four months in prison for refusing to cooperate with lawmakers investigating last year's attack on the US Capitol.
United States District Judge Carl Nichols imposed the sentence on Friday and also ordered Bannon to pay a fine of $6,500.
Earlier this week, US prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Bannon to six months in prison, while Bannon's lawyers had sought probation, after the 68-year-old in July was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress.
