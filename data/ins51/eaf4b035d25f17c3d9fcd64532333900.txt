EDMONTON - Eric Comrie stood on his head in the Buffalo net, making 46 saves, as the Buffalo Sabres fought their way past the Edmonton Oilers for a 4-2 NHL victory on Tuesday.

Rasmus Dahlin, Tage Thompson, Alex Tuch and J.J. Peterka scored for the Sabres (2-1-0).

Darnell Nurse and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins responded for the Oilers (1-2-0) who have trailed by at least two goals in each of their three games this season.

The Sabres started the scoring four minutes into the opening period on a four-on-three advantage as Dahlin picked the corner on a wrist shot off the draw that beat Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner, getting his first start of the season.
