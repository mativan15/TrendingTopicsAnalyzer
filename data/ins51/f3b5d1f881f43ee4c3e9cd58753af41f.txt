A bye week is just what Ohio State needed. Time to heal some bumps and bruises and get the team back to full strength. Most notably, the Buckeyes are hoping to get Jaxon Smith-Njigba and TreVeyon Henderson back on the field full-time. But even without them, does Ohio State need to be full strength to take care of the Hawkeyes?
The answer is no. OSU hasn't missed a beat even missing some of their best talent through the first six games. On the offensive side of the ball, this will be the best defense that Ohio State has seen thus far.
