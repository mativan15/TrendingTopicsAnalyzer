The government is being urged to back a Covid-19 drug that campaigners say could enable a return to normal life for people who are still shielding.Evusheld, made by AstraZeneca, has been licensed in the UK since March but it is not being procured for the NHS.The six-monthly injection contains two antibodies designed to offer protection against coronavirus infection and severe disease.Patient groups, charities and doctors say that it offers hope to about 500,000 immunocompromised people in the UK who remain at higher risk from the virus because their weakened immune systems make them less likely to respond well to vaccines.
