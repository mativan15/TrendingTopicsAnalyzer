As a second-year student at Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine and member of the MSUCOM Islamic Medical Student Association, Syed Rizvi thought others might be interested in 'participating' in Ramadan – the holy month of fasting, introspection and prayer for Muslims. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, and after sunset they share meals with family and friends.




 
The student organization hoped getting others involved would also be the impetus of a fundraiser that would provide a water well to a village in Pakistan.
