Liverpool fans made a frantic scramble by air, train, coach….and speedboat to get to Paris and join the party ahead of Saturday night's Champions League final.
Supporters making their way to the French capital after their easyJet flights were cancelled hired a motorised dinghy to get across the English channel before making their way to the Stade de France by land. 
Those who had already made it to Paris for Saturday night's clash against Real Madrid were partying in queues to reach the official fan zone in the Cours de Vincennes area, while red flares were set off at the Eiffel Tower.
