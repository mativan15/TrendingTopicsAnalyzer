Scott Olson I endorse Flutter Entertainment plc (OTCPK:PDYPY) as a buy. This contradicts the hold rating that Seeking Alpha's Quant rating platform has for PDYPY. I think the 1-year price return of -37.26% justifies going long this stock. PDYPY is a good bounce-back investment. It currently trades below $63, way below the 52-week high of $101.08. Seeking Alpha JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) recently said Flutter Entertainment's stock could rise by 30.71% from its current price. This endorsement could add additional fuel to the stock's +26.
