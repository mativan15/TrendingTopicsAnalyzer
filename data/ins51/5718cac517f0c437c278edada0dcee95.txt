A man spent £3,500 making hundreds of Liz Truss dog toys, only to be left stunned when the Prime Minister resigned after lasting just 44 days in the job. On Thursday, Ms Truss announced on the steps of 10 Downing Street that she was stepping down from her position following a chaotic six weeks in charge. David Farquharson came up with an idea to make Boris Johnson dog toys but changed his mind when the Conservative Party leader announced his resignation in early July.Mr Farquharson, originally from Somerset but now living in London for seven years, paid close attention to the subsequent Tory leadership race and after realising Ms Truss was the hot favourite to win, decided to "get ahead of the curve" and turn his attentions to her instead.
