PHILADELPHIA, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qlik ® today announces that SodaStream, the world's leading sparkling water-maker brand, is accelerating its digital transformation with Qlik's cloud analytics, a crucial next step in its goal of inspiring a revolution in environmentally friendly drinks consumption.SodaStream initially operated as a business-to-business enterprise, selling to third-party retailers that would then market its products in their own stores. The company has long factored environmental concerns into designing its closed-loop model, which saw consumers return used cylinders to retailers for cleaning and reuse at the product's end of life.
