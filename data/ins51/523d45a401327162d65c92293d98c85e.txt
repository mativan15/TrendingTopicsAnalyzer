Tesco's chairman has swung his weight behind Labour's growth plans as he claimed there is 'only one team on the field' in British politics following weeks of political and economic turmoil.
John Allan said Labour has put forward 'plausible' and 'attractive' proposals to boost growth as he urged ministers to end years of economic underperformance.
Mr Allan warned shoppers are facing a hit to house prices from soaring mortgage costs, adding that the pound's plunge is 'really causing problems'.
The comments will be seen as a sign that relations between the Tories and big business are souring after weeks of market chaos caused by the radical economic policies of the mini-Budget.
