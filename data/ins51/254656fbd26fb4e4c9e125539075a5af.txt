The Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs are making a habit of making breathtaking endings to games. This time, the Buffalo Bills took the 24-20 with a big closing minutes stand by the Bills.

The Bills offense had to work through some challenges that the Chiefs threw at them throughout the game. Kansas City Defensive Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo blitzed extensively throughout the game, putting Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen under duress often in the first half. Bills Offensively Coordinator Ken Dorsey adjusted play calls, getting the ball out of Allen's hands quicker and creating more pre-snap motion to hold the Chiefs from putting so much on Allen.
