Oprah Winfrey hosted a virtual campaign event for Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Tuesday night.Titled "A Thriving Life!", the event featured a pre-recorded split-screen conversation between the two as they discussed the candidate's plans for the state ahead of her rematch with incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Winfrey, 66, also campaigned for Abrams during her first run against Kemp in 2018, which she narrowly lost. Abrams, 49, never officially conceded the election, which she claimed was "stolen" from her due to alleged discriminatory election practices and voter suppression.
