Maksim Safaniuk/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Investment Thesis The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a core holding for many defensive and dividend investors. It's also priced at a premium against the consumer staples sector, given its robust margins and prominent brand. However, we think consumer staples are now one of the most expensive sectors in the S&P 500 with a PEG ratio of 2.5x (as we shared in a recent Walmart (WMT) article). Notably, we have been bullish on KO over the past seven months.
