(RTTNews) - Following the pullback seen in the previous session, stocks are likely to move back to the upside in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 203 points. The markets may once again benefit from recent upward momentum, which has helped the major averages recover after tumbling to their lowest levels in over a year. Positive sentiment may also be generated in reaction to news that Shanghai has formally ended its two-month citywide lockdown.
