Nelson Carlo owned several manufacturing businesses in the steel industry, including Carlo Steel Co., and was a forceful advocate for minority-owned contractors in the construction industry.

'Nelson was a history-maker for Latinos and very specifically for Puerto Ricans, but for all Hispanics, for joining Latinos and African Americans together to increase our participation in all sectors of society in Chicago and Illinois and the Midwest,' said Charlie Serrano, a Chicago businessman who champions trade with Puerto Rico.
