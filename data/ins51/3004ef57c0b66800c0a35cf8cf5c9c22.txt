Kohl's Corp. has announced a plan to invest in smaller store formats ahead of many lease expirations on its existing stores, which could drive dozens of store closures, according to credit rating business DBRS Morningstar.Morningstar has identified 10 stores where leases will expire before year end 2023, and says the highest concentration of lease rollover in the next decade will be in 2024 when 23 leases will expire. Add to this a 5.2% comparable sales decline in the first quarter and Kohl's could shutter some locations.
