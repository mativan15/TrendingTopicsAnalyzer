SeaWorld Orlando is opening a new attraction, ‘Pipeline: The Surf Coaster' in spring 2023.

Why this matters: New theme park attractions can bring in new and returning guests into the park and Orlando. Visitation helps provide revenue to hotels, retail, restaurants and more.

This is the seventh coaster to come to the park, and the first to introduce moving seats to feel ‘wave jumping' motions and a surfing launch, according to the press release.

'SeaWorld Orlando will be the only place in the world to ride a roller coaster like this and we welcome everyone looking for the chance to experience it,' Kyle Miller, SeaWorld Orlando's park president said via press release.
