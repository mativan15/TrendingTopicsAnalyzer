(Bloomberg) -- London's luxury emporiums were up in arms after new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt scrapped his predecessor's decision to let foreign visitors claim back value-added tax.'This short-sighted move is based on inaccurate and incomplete projections,' said Paul Barnes, head of the Association of International Retail, calling the U-turn a 'hammer blow to UK tourism and the British high street.'Hunt unveiled a series of fiscally tightening measures on Monday after previous plans from Prime Minister Liz Truss and her former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng relied on higher public borrowing and sent markets into a tailspin.
