CNN —

Drugmaker Pfizer said Friday that as government contracts come to an end, possibly by early next year, its Covid-19 vaccine will be sold for $110 to $130 per dose.

This price model comes down to increased distribution costs as well as an expected shift from multidose vials to single-dose ones.

This is the 'commercial list price,' but the company says it does not anticipate that most people will have to pay out of pocket. It also pointed to its patient assistance program, which helps people without insurance get vaccines.
