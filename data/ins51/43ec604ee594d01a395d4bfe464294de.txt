STORY: With inflation a top worry for voters just weeks before the midterm elections, U.S. President Joe Biden announced Wednesday (October 19) a plan to sell an additional 15 million barrels of crude oil from America's strategic reserve -- and said more would be released if it was needed -- all in an effort to dampen high gasoline prices.

It comes two weeks after OPEC rankled Biden by siding with Russia and agreeing to a production cut... that raised fears of a new spike in prices at U.S. pumps.
