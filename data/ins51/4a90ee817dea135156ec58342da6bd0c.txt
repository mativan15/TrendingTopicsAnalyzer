Investing.com-- Most Asian currencies moved little on Tuesday as the dollar steadied from overnight losses, while the New Zealand dollar surged after higher-than-expected inflation data pushed up expectations of more interest rate hikes.

The New Zealand dollar jumped 0.6% to the greenback after data showed the country's inflation rate blew past expectations in the third quarter.

The reading reinforced expectations that the New Zealand central bank will keep hiking interest rates sharply to quell inflation, which is expected to boost the NZD.
