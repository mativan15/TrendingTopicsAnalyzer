Pere Aragonès was in Brussels this week to meet with EU commissioners, a first for a member of the Catalan government in several years.

The relations between Catalonia and the European Commission deteriorated as the Catalan government fought for independence.

"We had come from a time of a certain freeze (in relations), I think also as a result of the attitude, also on the part of the Spanish government," Aragonès told Euronews.

"In any case, we have worked from the outset to generate spaces of trust with the EU institutions to be able to show that Catalonia is here to participate in the solutions to European challenges.
