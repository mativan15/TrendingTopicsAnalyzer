The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced to employees on Thursday that it had decided to rescind a number of job offers that had already been accepted, blaming the decision on broader economic struggles, as well as a downturn in the cryptocurrency markets.'While we did not make this decision lightly, it is the prudent one given market conditions,' 'Chief People Officer' L.J Brock said in a note to staff, which the company also shared publicly. Brock said in his note that those affected would be notified by email that they no longer had a job offer in place at the company.
