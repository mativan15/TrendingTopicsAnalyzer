It's an idea we've heard throughout this election campaign — if you build more homes, housing will become more affordable in the GTA.But there are dissenting opinions on how many homes we need and questions about whether flooding the market with more supply would actually bring the price of renting or owning within reach of more people.It's an attractive idea but it's an illusion, says Luisa Sotomayor, associate professor at York University's Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change.'It's always politically effective to oversimplify a message and this is what's happening here,' Sotomayor said.
