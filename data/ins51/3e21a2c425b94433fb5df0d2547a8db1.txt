By Chris Wack Starry Group Holdings Inc. said Thursday that it is implementing cost-cutting measures to conserve capital and improve its runway as it explores all strategic options. The company said these measures include a 50% reduction of its workforce and a freeze on hiring and non-essential expenditures. Starry Group also said it would focus on penetrating its deployed network and deployed buildings where it has already invested capital and would withdraw from participation in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund program.
