Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate for questioning in a money laundering case next week. Soon after the May 31 summon was issued, his party, the National Conference, reacted sharply, and slammed the BJP, saying that it was a price the opposition paid.
