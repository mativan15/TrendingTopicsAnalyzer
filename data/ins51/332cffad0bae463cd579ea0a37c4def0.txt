"Absolutely nothing". That's what Tauranga electrician Tom Casey knew about olives before purchasing a four-hectare grove in Marlborough with his wife Bernie last November. The lifestyle property in Ward, about 40km south of Blenheim, came with 400 olive trees, an existing olive oil business called Flaxbourne, and 140 hazelnut trees. Originally from the UK, Tom said he just fancied a change after running his own electrical business in Tauranga for the past 15 years. "We decided that if we were going to make a move south then the first thing to look into was selling the electrical business,' he said.
