PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The plastics industry says there is a way to help solve the crisis of plastic waste plaguing the planet's oceans, beaches and lands— recycle it, chemically.

Chemical recycling typically uses heat or chemical solvents to break down plastics into liquid and gas to produce an oil-like mixture or basic chemicals. Industry leaders say that mixture can be made back into plastic pellets to make new products.

"What we are trying to do is really create a circular economy for plastics because we think it is the most viable option for keeping plastic out of the environment," said Joshua Baca, vice president of the plastics division at the American Chemistry Council, the industry trade association for American chemical companies.
