From Eating Media Lunch to The Casketeers and One Lane Bridge, producer, journalist and southern man Phil Smith has been telling the stories of New Zealanders for more than 20 years. Southerners are the border collies of the world, Phil Smith believes. They are inherently friendly, and everyone wants to help. Smith has the credentials to pass judgment. He was born in Invercargill and brought up on Southland farms along with more than 50-odd cousins across two huge families. He also credits the province for his love of storytelling – from the eagerness of farmers to hear stories from the outside world to a general nosiness from shopkeepers to relatives.
