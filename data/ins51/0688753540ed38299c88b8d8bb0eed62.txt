Two of the most iconic food products that are staples in U.S. homes will look very different in the next few months due to some new packaging. A circular Heinz Ketchup bottle with recyclable cap is to be rolled out globally, starting in Europe, by the end of 2022; and a fiber-based microwavable cup for Kraft Mac and Cheese, sans the plastic label through direct-print technology, will also debut by year end.

Those were among the innovations at Kraft Heinz Co. as the company moves toward its goal of using 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable packaging by 2025.
