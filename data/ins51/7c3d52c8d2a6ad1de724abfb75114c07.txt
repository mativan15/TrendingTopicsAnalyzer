An official investigation is underway as to the cause of the fire, though local leaders said arson was considered likely. Residents were able to escape without injury, but the building is badly damaged. Police in the northern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania  said on Thursday that they were investigating whether there was a political motivation behind the fire at a shelter for Ukrainian refugees near the town of Wismar that had broken out the night before. The case was initially being handled by the police department of Rostock, a city northeast of Wismar, but they said later that it had been handed over to state security services to determine the circumstances behind the suspected case of arson.
