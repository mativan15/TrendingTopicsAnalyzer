A team of researchers led by political scientists at Stanford University and the University of Michigan was recently awarded $14 million from the National Science Foundation to collect data on voting, political participation, and public opinion during the 2024 presidential election cycle.

The team oversees the work of American National Election Studies. Since 1948, ANES, originally known as Michigan Election Studies, has conducted in-depth surveys of voting-age Americans before and after presidential elections.
