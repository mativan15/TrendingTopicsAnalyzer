A California panel is recommending a slew of changes as it studies how Black residents should be compensated for the lasting scars of slavery and segregation.

An interim report is telling lawmakers in Sacramento they should consider how to pay descendants of enslaved people.

The panel is also recommending programs to get Black people registered to vote and keep them on the voter rolls, programs to repay Black land and business owners for value lost in racial terror, programs to get students free tuition and programs to house vulnerable populations.
