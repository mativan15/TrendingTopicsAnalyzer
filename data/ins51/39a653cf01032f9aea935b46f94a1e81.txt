The Tobin Center for the Performing Arts has named Brian Moore as its new vice president of programming.

His hiring culminates a national search that attracted nearly 200 candidates.

Tobin Center Board Chair Alice Viroslav said Moore's 'enthusiasm and wide-ranging experience in the performing arts' separated him from the pack.

Moore, who brings more than 20 years of live entertainment industry experience to San Antonio after most recently serving as senior talent buyer for The Bowery Presents in Philadelphia, will oversee programming for the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts and Tobin Entertainment, the company's offsite booking and promotion division.
