Governor Greg Abbott today highlighted the State of Texas' comprehensive efforts to combat President Biden's growing national fentanyl crisis at a press conference following a roundtable discussion with state and local law enforcement in Waco. The Governor launched his statewide 'One Pill Kills' campaign yesterday to raise awareness of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl plaguing Texas and the United States, thanks to President Biden's open border policies. The Governor was joined at the DPS Waco Regional Laboratory by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Director Steve McCraw and McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara, as well as Senator Brian Birdwell, Representative Doc Anderson, DPS Chief of the Crime Laboratory Division Brady Mills, Captain Cody Blossman of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office, Assistant Waco Police Chief Frank Gentsch, and DPS Forensic Scientist Lindsay Hatfield.
