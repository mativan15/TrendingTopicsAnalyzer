Nicola Sturgeon outlined her Government's proposals for the economy in a post-independence Scotland on Monday, including some detail about the border between Scotland and England. While border arrangements will be subject to negotiations between the two nations, Scotland re-joining the EU – one of the Scottish Government's key objectives – would complicate border crossings.
