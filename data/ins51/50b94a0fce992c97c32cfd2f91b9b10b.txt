Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (NYSE:BVH) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method.
