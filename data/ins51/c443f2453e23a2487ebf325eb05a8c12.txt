Are Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ready to hit Netflix queues?
 
The Duchess of Sussex, 41, spoke about her and her husband's deal with the streaming giant in her Variety Power of Women cover, which was released Wednesday. In the accompanying interview, Meghan spoke about what audiences can expect in the upcoming docuseries from Oscar-nominated director Liz Garbus.
 
"It's nice to be able to trust someone with our story — a seasoned director whose work I've long admired — even if it means it may not be the way we would have told it," Meghan said.
