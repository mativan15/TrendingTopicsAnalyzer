TORONTO - North American stock markets gave back some of the previous day's gains after a slowing but still hot U.S. jobs report reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with aggressive interest rate hikes.Hopes that the central bank would take a pause in raising rates were stoked Thursday by weaker ADP private payroll numbers. But Friday's non-farm employment numbers were stronger than expected with 390,000 jobs created in May and the April number increased.'I think people are trying to talk themselves into a play, but the bottom line is that inflation is still high, the central banks have to be more aggressive,' said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management.
