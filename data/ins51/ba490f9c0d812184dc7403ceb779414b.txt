Nordroden/iStock via Getty ImagesThe Q1 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index has ended, and one of the first companies to report was New Gold (NYSE:NGD). Overall, the company had a mediocre quarter, but this was largely expected, with fewer tonnes mined at New Afton and a focus on stripping in the Ontario winter at Rainy River. This decline in sales volume led to softer margins in the period. However, while a slow start, New Gold's future remains bright with much lower costs as it heads underground at RR.
