The Rio Intl. Film Festival wrapped Monday amid political tension and with a strong local competition that awarded Marcelo Gomes' 'Paloma' the top film prize. It is based on the true story of a poor trans woman who struggled to marry her partner in a religious ceremony. Following compact editions over the past three years, Rio Fest – traditionally Latin America's main film fest – regained part of its original size and importance, as it premiered locally about 120 features selected from the top international film fests, resumed outdoor screenings and featured a hybrid market.
