Food podcaster Hugh Smithson-Wright (of ‘Hugh's Joy of Food') picks his favourite places around Vauxhall.   1. Royal Vauxhall Tavern ‘A legendary LGBTQ+ venue. It's home to nights as eclectic as Duckie – I've been going for 20 years – BeefMince, Bar Wotever and Solve-Along-a Murder-She Wrote. The RVT has fended off several greedy developers, and became the first venue to be listed sui generis, aka in a class by itself, by Historic England for its significance to queer history in the UK.' 372 Kennington Lane, SE11 5HY.
