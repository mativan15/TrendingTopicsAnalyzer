Israel's central bank is taking a plunge into more speculative corners of markets to generate greater returns on its $200 billion foreign-exchange reserves, according to Governor Amir Yaron.

After adding the Chinese yuan alongside three other currencies starting this year, the Bank of Israel is now 'looking at a more diversified set of instruments' including equities and high-yield corporate bonds, Yaron said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
