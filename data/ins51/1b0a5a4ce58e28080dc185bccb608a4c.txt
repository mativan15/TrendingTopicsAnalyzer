BTS' latest announcement regarding their military service is reminiscent of their hit track, Mic Drop. It echoes the final moments of each performance where Suga drops the mic, and then walks off the stage, while the lights fade to black. The fans hoot and chant, knowing they will come back for more. It's almost the same sentiment, going by the reactions on social media. The wait, however, will be longer this time.
For over a year, there has been the constant frenzied discussion regarding the mandatory military service, and the boys endlessly waiting for the government to make the final decision.
