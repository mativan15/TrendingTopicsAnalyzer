I follow John Irving's lead as he picks a path through the rocks and moss of this small Canadian Shield island. We are heading to his 'writing shed' which lies near the main cottage that's been in his wife Janet's family for years, and where they've spent this almost-post-COVID summer. The story is that Janet's grandfather won the island in a poker game, although Janet says it's a bit more complicated than that, as these things are. But it's a good story, with its roots in the truth.The writer from New Hampshire who became famous for his big American novels — 'The World According to Garp,' 'Cider House Rules,' 'A Prayer for Owen Meany,' among 15 in all — has a desk that sits in front of a window overlooking Georgian Bay.
