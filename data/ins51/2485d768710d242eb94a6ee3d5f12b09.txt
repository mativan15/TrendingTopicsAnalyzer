Doug Mastriano, the pro-Trump MAGA candidate for Pennsylvania governor, has a campaign ad out now that uses stock footage previously used for Kremlin propaganda.

Mastriano's ad, which is currently the header image on his campaign's Facebook page, features an image of two young girls running through a field with the words: 'For their future there is hope' superimposed on top.

'On day one, no more boys in the girls' bathrooms or locker rooms, no more pronoun games in the classroom, no more gender transitioning of minors without parental consent, and no more pornography in public school libraries,' Mastriano wrote in a post accompanying the ad earlier this week.
