It's Friday again, and the typical downtown office is a ghost town. Again.

On most Fridays these days, only about one-fourth — one-fourth! — of Chicago office workers show up at their workplaces, according to Kastle Systems, a company that measures ID card swipes. In contrast, about twice as many office workers show up in-person on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Even on Mondays, offices are much busier than on Fridays.

The Friday problem is bad news for the city center. Downtown office vacancies remain stubbornly high.
