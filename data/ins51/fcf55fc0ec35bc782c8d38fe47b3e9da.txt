Kevin Spacey was charged with four counts of sexual assault against three men in the UK on Thursday (26 May). Now, producers of his latest project, Peter Five Eight, have responded to defend the Usual Suspects actor against the charges.'While it's unfortunate that increased negative press is timed with Kevin returning to work, it's also to be expected. There are those who wish for him not to act, but they are outnumbered by fans worldwide who await an artist they have enjoyed for decades returning to the screen,' said a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter from the producers of the mystery thriller.
