The opening of the first two licensed cannabis infusers in Illinois shows that having startup money and making business connections are crucial to overcome some of the obstacles facing the industry.

Infusers buy cannabis oil from growers, and infuse it into edibles, lotions and other products. Both Contract Canna and Krown LLC self-financed their startups, and formed partnerships with established companies, while many of their competitors are still on the sidelines, trying to get investments or loans.
