For more than 20 years, our business, City Flooring and Design, had one of the best neighbors in our community, state Rep. Thomas West. His hands-on approach to governing while he was a Canton City Council member extended to the Statehouse in Columbus, where he lived and worked to make our community great.

West is the best solution for families, businesses and our community. He has proven to be a compassionate legislator who has a sincere concern for the community he serves. He is not a career politician; he is a dedicated defender of all the families in his community.
