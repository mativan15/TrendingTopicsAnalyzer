Master Sri Akarshana, better known as the Yogi with a Lamborghini, is an entrepreneur turned educational motivator who has reached 35 million people through his social media channels and live performances.

Born Eric Ho in the UK, the Dubai resident credits his father for helping him develop his entrepreneurial skills.

'My dad was an entrepreneur, so he had multiple restaurants, so I grew up learning about taking bank loans, then setting up a business and cash flow,' he told Euronews.

He became a millionaire at the tender age of 25 years old after getting into steel and rubber recycling.
