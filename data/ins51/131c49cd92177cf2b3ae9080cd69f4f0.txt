AIMIM chief and Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday commented on the Bilkis Bano case amid the fresh row triggered by the Gujarat government's submission in the Supreme Court that the order for the release of the 11 convicts came from the Union home ministry. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Defence Expo 2022 in Gujarat on Wednesday and said that the country has come a long way from releasing pigeons to releasing cheetahs, Owaisi added 'rapists' to the list.
