Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi said experiencing the war in Ukraine means he has nothing to fear in football after a frustrating goalless draw with lowly Nottingham Forest prompted a smattering of boos.

Albion controlled the contest at the Amex Stadium and struck the crossbar through Leandro Trossard but remain without a win since the Italian replaced Graham Potter four games ago.

Pascal Gross was denied a late winner by a superb stop from Forest goalkeeper Dean Henderson, before some of the Seagulls' frustrated fans jeered the stalemate at the full-time whistle.
