A 13-year-old boy accused of killing his 6-year-old cousin by using blunt force trauma to her head at her River Oaks home in August is scheduled to go to trial next month at a Tarrant County juvenile court, according to court records.

The trial for the boy is scheduled for July 11, but court officials said that could change.

Authorities have not identified the boy because he is a juvenile.

He is currently younger than 14, which requires any hearing he's in to be closed, court officials said based on Texas Family Code, unless the interest of the child or the public is better served for it to be open.
