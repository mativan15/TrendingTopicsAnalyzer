If I wasn't clear, warmth is a crucial — if not the most important — factor when it comes to committing to a sweater. Luckily, this Qualfort knit delivers. The cotton material is heavier than I expected (a bonus for me). I also love how the lantern sleeves reach past my wrists to my knuckles — it adds to the oversize look and feels good on my hands. And if you're a fan of waffle designs, you'll love the texture of this sweater. It feels soft and works as a more exciting layer to add on top of solid-colored tops or dresses.
