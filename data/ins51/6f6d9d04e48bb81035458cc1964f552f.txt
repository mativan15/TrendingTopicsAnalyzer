But across three games it was a worrying afternoon, given this is occurring when respect towards referees is at an all-time low – especially in grassroots football. And despite denials that the grassroots game is influenced by what happens, the behaviour in the Premier League, in particular, from managers as well as players does exactly that.
While Klopp was reacting the way he did, there were no games being played in Merseyside Youth Football League, which has more than 150 teams. Instead an entire round of matches was called off because of 'multiple incidents of inappropriate and threatening behaviour'.
