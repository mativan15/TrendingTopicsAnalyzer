Chris Steele, 37, from Dorset, who runs his own insurance business, said he also faced increasing care costs for his two children. He said: 'This £400 helps for sure, but it's not enough. If inflation keeps going the way it is, people like us will need a lot more support later.' Households earning £60,000 face a monthly income shortfall of £172 as price rises have caused average spending to overtake their after-tax income, according to analysts NimbleFins.
Middle and high earners are also increasingly turning to debt while they await financial support.
