Its been nearly 5.5 years since demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 banknotes took place in November 2016. But how far have we come since that big move of demonetization? Have the fake notes disappeared from the banking system? Perhaps not, as per the findings from RBI's annual report 2022. Compared to the previous financial year 2020-21, there was an increase of 16.4%, 16.5%, 11.7 %, 101.9% and 54.6% in the counterfeit notes detected in the denominations of Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 200, Rs 500 (new design) and Rs 2000, respectively, RBI's annual report has stated.
