A charming video that first made its rounds in 2018 has recently resurfaced and has once again gone viral on Reddit and Twitter as it shows a small bird chasing after its meal while expecting it to appear in its mouth."Birds are fed by their parents in their infancy," read the tweet that accompanied the video, which was viewed more than 30 million times. "When the time comes to feed themselves, there can be some confusion when the food does not go into their mouth by itself."The same text and video were published on the Reddit forum "Interesting As F**k," where it amassed more than 100,000 votes.
