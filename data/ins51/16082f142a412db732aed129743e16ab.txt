"Kudlow" host Larry Kudlow offered his biggest critique of Biden's inflation agenda during his appearance on "Varney & Co." Tuesday, arguing the president's plan will not work if the administration doesn't freeze domestic spending. LARRY KUDLOW: It's not an inflation fighting plan, although I'll give some credit if he [President Biden] leaves the Fed alone. The Fed's got a lot of tough work to do. That's fine. He takes a cheap shot at Trump, of course, as he always does. Trump objected to Fed tightening in 2018 for rate hikes when the inflation rate was less than 2%.
