Rahul Gandhi Bellary rally: Marking 1,000 kilometres of walking on Saturday, the 38th day of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi will enter Ballari town in Karnataka and hold a rally there. The town has a deep association for the Congress due to Sonia Gandhi's win from the constituency in a high-stakes battle against late BJP leader Sushma Swaraj in 1999.
The Congress still commands some influence in Ballari and expects the rally to have an impression on the entire region, covering nearly 30 Assembly seats.
