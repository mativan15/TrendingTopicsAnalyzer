Buffalo Business First has been hosting the annual 40 Under 40 Awards since 1992. That's 1,240 young professionals honored over the years.

Now it's time to learn more about the 2022 class. Each Friday leading up to the Nov. 10 awards luncheon, we will introduce you to 10 of this year's honorees in random order.

All of them are younger than age 40, of course, and successful in their professions and involved in their communities.

This year's winners will be celebrated at a luncheon Nov. 10 at the Buffalo Niagara Convention Center sponsored by Cornerstone Community Federal Credit Union and University at Buffalo School of Management.
