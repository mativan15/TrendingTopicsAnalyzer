Stores in Paris must switch off outdoor lighting at night from December
Paris climate activists have found a new way to get across their message against energy waste in the City of Light -- switching off store signs and advertising screens that are kept on all night even though the government has urged people to cut back electricity use.At 9:00 pm on a recent evening, around 20 Extinction Rebellion members gathered for a tactical briefing before spreading out on another night-time raid.If the police spot them "we absolutely don't run", says "Joad," a 32-year-old veteran of the movement, detailing out the legal risks and advice for those who might be arrested.
