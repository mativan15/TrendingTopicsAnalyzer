Sporting Lisbon boss Ruben Amorim has refused to be drawn on the Aston Villa job.The 37-year-old is a contender to replace Steven Gerrard after he was sacked following Thursday's wretched 3-0 defeat at Fulham.Amorim guided Sporting to their first Portuguese league title in 19 years last season and is one of Europe's hottest managerial properties.Villa, out of the Premier League relegation zone on goal difference, would have to pay a huge sum to take him from the Jose Alvalade Stadium but Amorim has remained tight-lipped.
