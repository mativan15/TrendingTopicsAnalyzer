On upscale Hovevei Zion Street in Talbiyeh, where many of the homeowners are native English speakers, there is a large sign affixed to one of the electricity poles, informing local residents of projects that have been approved by the Jerusalem District Planning and Building Committee. The text is signed by committee chairwoman Shira Talmi, who is a town planner by profession.

The sign, which has been put up by law, invites anyone who objects to the approved projects to submit their objections to the committee by a certain date, which is now long gone.
