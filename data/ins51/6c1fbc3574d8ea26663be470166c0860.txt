If you want access to as many weights as you'd find at the gym, NordicTrack Select-A-Weight adjustable dumbbells are a great solution. They offer eight different weight settings on a single dumbbell, including the inner dial options, and they allow you to completely detach the plates and use them separately for exercise. SpecsType: ManualWeight range: 5–50 pounds (each dumbbell)Dimensions/size: 22.25 x 19.75 x 18.75 inchesWarranty: 90-dayPrice: $499Some of the plastic parts on the model don't feel particularly high-end, which is a shame as these dumbbells are a little pricey.
