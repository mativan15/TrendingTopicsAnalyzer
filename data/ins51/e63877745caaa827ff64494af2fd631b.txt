The Good Brigade/DigitalVision via Getty Images Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) is an online platform that offers homeowners a way to sell their home fast and easily. The company was founded in 2014, 10 years after the number one real estate portal in the USA, Zillow (Z) (ZG). Since that point, the business has grown at a rapid pace with revenue popping by 254% year over year. Despite the progress, the rising interest rate environment has compressed the valuation of growth stocks. In addition, the recent forecasts of a decline in the housing market have further butchered the stock price.
