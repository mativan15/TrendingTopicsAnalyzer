NEW YORK (AP) — The trial of two former 21st Century Fox Inc. executives and a sports marketing company on charges related to a U.S government investigation of corruption in soccer was postponed again, this time to Jan. 12.

U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn announced the new schedule Wednesday. The trial was to have started May 23 but Chen said last month that she was putting it off until Jan. 3. The government disclosed additional discovery documents, and the schedules of Chen and lawyers involved in the case prevented an earlier date.
