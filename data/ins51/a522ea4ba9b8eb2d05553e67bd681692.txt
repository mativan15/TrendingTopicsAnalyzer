A $10 million restoration of New Zealand's biggest timber house is ramping up and the building could reopen to the public in two years. Christchurch's McLean's Mansion was damaged in the 2011 earthquakes and was threatened with demolition, before a trust was formed to purchase the building and safeguard its future. However, trustees have struggled to raise the money needed for the restoration and last year the project was under threat of being mothballed when Auckland-based art philanthropist and former rich lister Sir James Wallace stepped in.
