 The single patient (n-of-1) trial can be used to resolve therapeutic uncertainty for the individual patient. Treatment alternatives are systematically tested against each other, generating patient-specific data used to inform an individualized treatment plan. We hypothesize that clinical decisions informed by n-of-1 trials improve patient outcomes compared to usual care. Our objective was to provide an overview of the clinical trial evidence on the effect of n-of-1 trials on clinical outcomes.
