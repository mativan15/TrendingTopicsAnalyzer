Making more Londoners pay to drive around the capital has made Transport for London (TfL) almost £100 million, it has been revealed.
TfL expanded its ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) last October, when it was made 18 times larger than it was when it was first introduced in April 2019.
Just under a year later, TfL has raked in £93.6 million of additional revenue from drivers, research by insurance company RAC shows.
Between the start of November 2021 and the end of June 2022, an average of 1.9 million journeys were made into the zone every month, resulting in £112.
