Desperate holidaymakers are struggling to get water at airports amid long queues for food and drink.
Passengers at Stansted complained that queues for water were longer than those for security, as they criticised the airport for not having enough refill stations. Others were faced with empty shelves at food and drink outlets swamped with customers.
Airline insiders said that travellers should avoid queuing for food if they can help it and buy their meals on the plane instead.
It comes as some holidaymakers were left waiting for up to six hours inside airports, because of a string of flight delays and cancellations.
