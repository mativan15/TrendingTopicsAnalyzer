The Denver Broncos made two practice squad moves on Saturday.
First, the Broncos signed second-year tight end Dalton Keene, who was selected by the New England Patriots in the third round of the 2020 NFL draft out of Virginia Tech.

Keene (6-4, 251 pounds) wasn't able to live up to his high draft status with the Patriots, playing in just six games as a rookie before missing the entire 2021 season with a knee injury.
After failing to make New England's 53-man roster this summer, Keene spent time on the practice squad of the Philadelphia Eagles.
