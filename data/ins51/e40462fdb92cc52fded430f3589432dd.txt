Weronika Fafinska (pictured center, with her parents), 23, was diagnosed with a grade 2 diffuse astrocytoma brain tumor in February 2014 when she was just 14. She had most of the tumor removed during surgery in February 2014 - but when she came round she didn't even recognize her parents, Robert and Kate Bomba, who were sitting at her bedside.
