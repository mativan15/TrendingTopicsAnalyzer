Investors can't seem to get enough of Warren Buffett and his investing strategy. After all, the Oracle of Omaha is one of the most affluent investors of all time, as evident by the success of his multinational holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). If you take a look at Berkshire's investment portfolio, you'll notice that roughly 40% of its value is in just one stock, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).
