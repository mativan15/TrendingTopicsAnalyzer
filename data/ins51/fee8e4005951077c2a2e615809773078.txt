As Putin's war rages in Ukraine for over three months, a Ukraine-based blockchain company is calling on investors. Executives at Everstake claim crypto is the most efficient way to support the country in this time of need, as it is free from red tape barriers, compared with fiat donations. To date, Aid for Ukraine, a project promoting crypto donations for the purpose of supporting the country, has raised over $60 million on crypto (including 471.4 BTC, 9567.4 ETH, 435631.5 DOT, 1919905 USDT}.But the organisation claims that it is not enough, since over $45million is already been spent by the government on first aid kits, ration packs, bulletproof vests, and other items.
