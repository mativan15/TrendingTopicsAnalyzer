John Hinckley, who shot US President Ronald Reagan in 1981, is "no longer a danger to himself or others" and will be freed from all restrictions this month.

The ruling caps Hinckley's four-decade journey through the legal and mental health systems.

US District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in September said he would free Hinckley from all remaining restrictions on June 15 as long as Hinckley continued to do well living in the community in Virginia as he has for years.

At a hearing on Wednesday in Washington which Hinckley did not attend, Friedman noted Hinckley has continued to do well, and the judge made no changes to his plans for full freedom from court oversight.
