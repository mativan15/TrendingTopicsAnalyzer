Published: 18:02 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 18:11 EDT, 19 October 2022 Tory MP Sir Charles Walker was 'livid' tonight as he lashed out at the 'inexcusable' behaviour surrounding the 'chaotic' fracking vote in the House of Commons, warning that his party could shed 200 seats at the next general election 'unless we get our act together.' In an extraordinary outburst on BBC News, the backbencher said he had not seen 'anything like it' after he and his fellow Conservative MPs were initially told they would lose the whip if they voted down Liz Truss' fracking bill, in what was essentially rebranded as a confidence vote in the prime minister as she clings onto power.
