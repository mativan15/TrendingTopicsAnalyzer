Drew Angerer/Getty Images News Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard believes a U.S. central bank digital currency could eventually "coexist with and be complementary to stablecoins and commercial bank money by providing a safe central bank liability in the digital financial ecosystem, much like cash currently coexists with commercial bank money," she told the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, according to her prepared testimony. Note a CBDC is a digital form of a fiat currency issued and backed by a central bank, making it a digital liability of a central bank.
