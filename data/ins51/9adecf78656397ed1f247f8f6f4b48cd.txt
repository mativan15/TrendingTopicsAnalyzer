The gap in GCSE grades between disadvantaged pupils and their peers is the widest in a decade after this summer's results in England, with school leaders warning that spending cuts will make matters worse.The figures published by the Department for Education showed disadvantaged pupils – mainly those eligible for free school meals – had GCSE results on average half a grade lower than children from better-off backgrounds, the widest gap since 2011-12. The gap for children with special education needs was an even wider, averaging three-quarters of a grade lower.
