'Here there is no life, Dalton.' A tired exhale followed.

That is the WhatsApp voice note that Edis, a 56-year-old Venezuelan manicurist, sent me last Wednesday after the U.S. announced its brand-new immigration policy to handle Venezuelan migration.

In recent months, the U.S. southern border has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of migrants crossing into the country. For the first time ever, the number of 'irregular' crossings topped 2 million in 2021. Many of these migrants are Venezuelans who flee both the political dictatorship and extraordinary economic crisis that has left people like Edis with no path forward.
