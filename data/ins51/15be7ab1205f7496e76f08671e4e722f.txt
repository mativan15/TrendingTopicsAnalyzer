Loose Women fans were left in a dizzy on Wednesday as Coleen Nolan debuted a surprise new hair look on the ITV daytime show. The 57-year-old showed off the new look to fellow panellists Jane Moore, Brenda Edwards and Janet Street-Porter. The TV presenter said she took inspiration for the high ponytail look from Dame Helen Mirren, who similarly showed off a sleek up-do on the red carpet at Cannes over the weekend. The British national treasure served up a phenomenal, XXL butt-skimming, platinum blonde lock of hair in a half up do which Coleen similarly sported.
