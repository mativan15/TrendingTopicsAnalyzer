kmatija SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), previously known as just another penny stock out of the Canadian cannabis sector, took full advantage of the meme-stock craze to transform its balance sheet and create real shareholder value. The company continues to put capital to work and still retains a large net cash position. While its origin story might be a bit unorthodox, SNDL is gradually becoming a worthy peer to the more well-known names. I expect that trend to only accelerate if and when the company IPOs its investment fund SunStream.
