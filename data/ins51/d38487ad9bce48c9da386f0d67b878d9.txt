Arista Networks aims to eliminate every last ounce of excess latency from your network. And in pursuit of this goal, the company tapped an all-star cast of Broadcom, Intel, and AMD Xilinx silicon to power its latest switches.
Suffice to say, these aren't your standard L3 switches, and you certainly aren't going to find them in your average datacenter or network closet. The latest entries to Arista's 7130-series pack a CPU, FPGA, and switch ASIC into a single appliance that's designed to accelerate latency-sensitive applications.
