With battery prices on the rise but demand for electric vehicles showing no signs of slowing, analysts at Goldman Sachs have named their top stock to play this trend. Goldman Sachs has raised its global average battery pack price forecast by 8% to 26% into 2025, with the bank expecting battery prices to peak in 2023. It noted that while technology and chemistry improvement have led to a decline in battery prices, around 40% of the cost deflation has been offset by higher commodity prices. Despite higher battery prices, Goldman said demand for EVs remains strong, supported by the recent strength in oil prices.
