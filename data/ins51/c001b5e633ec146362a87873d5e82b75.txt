The Democrat in charge of the Senate Banking Committee is not happy with Wells Fargo's CEO, Charles Scharf. In a letter Tuesday, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, demanded that Scharf "once and for all address Wells Fargo's governance, risk management, and hiring practices — weaknesses that have plagued the bank for almost a decade." Brown listed recent misbehavior by the bank, including a report by the New York Times that Wells Fargo had conducted sham interviews of Black and female candidates and cited claims that it had avoided refinancing Black homeowners' mortgages while interest rates were low.
