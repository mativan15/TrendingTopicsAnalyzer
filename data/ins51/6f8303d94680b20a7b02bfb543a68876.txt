Following Queen Elizabeth II's passing on September 8, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly 'complained' about being 'snubbed and abused' by the Royal Family during the activities surrounding her funeral. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had already arrived in the UK when the Queen passed away. Still, they joined the royal family in grief and made several public appearances with other distinguished members of the Royal Family.

According to columnist Richard Johnson, the couple's pals in London made the charges.
