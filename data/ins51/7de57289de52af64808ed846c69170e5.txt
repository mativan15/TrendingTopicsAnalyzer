HOBOKEN, NJ — A lot's at stake in this year's Hoboken school board election. More than 3,000 students attend the local public schools.We asked some serious questions, some offbeat, but it's important for readers to notice whether the candidates rephrased the question and purposely declined to answer. Do they have vague ideas, or thoughts and plans? Running for three seats on the board this Nov. 8 are:The "Leadership That Listens" slate, consisting of incumbent Alejandro (Alex) De La Torre Jr. along with Leslie Norwood and Antonio Graña; "Kids First" consisting of Pavel Sokolov, Donna Magen, and Cindy Wiegand, and Independent John Madigan (a former board member) and Independent Patricia Waiters (a former candidate).
