Hi Quartz members,Sheryl Sandberg is leaving Meta after 14 years as the second-most-powerful executive at the world's largest social-media company. Her departure is a big shakeup for the firm, but those following Sandberg's career may also say it's been a long time coming.Both Meta and Sandberg were dogged by controversy in the years following the 2016 US presidential election, with Sandberg in particular facing blowback over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the spread of misinformation.In the wake of these controversies, the balance of power within Meta reportedly shifted, as Zuckerberg assumed some duties he'd previously let Sandberg handle.
