A group of former executives from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has created a $100 million venture fund, the team told TechCrunch on Thursday.
Old Fashion Research (OFR) – whose name is derived from the classic cocktail – was founded in late 2021 by managing partners Ling Zhang, who was previously the vice president of M&A and investments at Binance, and Wayne Fu, former head of corporate development at the crypto exchange.
The fund will be focused on the metaverse and bringing greater crypto adoption to emerging markets like Latin America and Africa, Zhang said to TechCrunch.
