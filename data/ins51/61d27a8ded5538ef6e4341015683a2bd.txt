Manny Pacquiao may not have been able to attend the press conference of his upcoming exhibition fight, but he still managed to make a unique appearance through incredible hologram technology. Boxing icon Pacquiao was promoting his bout against South Korean Youtuber DK Yoo, with the pair due to go to battle for charity in Seoul in December. The cutting edge technology allowed Pacquiao to respond naturally to his opponent as they faced off, despite not being in the same room. DK Yoo, who boasts over 600,000 Youtube subscribers, was involved in the unusual virtual staredown with the 'PacMan' in Thursday's press conference in Los Angeles.
