SINGAPORE — While some may dismiss Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a fad, serious money can be made for those who sell in this trendy cryptocurrency space.

Ask Chanel Lee, who sold out her collection of 7,600 bread cartoons NFTs called Tasty Toastys at 0.02 Eth or S$87 each in February. Her next goal is to build a global lifestyle brand based on these cartoons over the next decade.

"I already wanted to make it a brand and licensing business. The design was intentionally kept simple — I want it to be the next 'Hello Kitty'," Lee said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Singapore.
