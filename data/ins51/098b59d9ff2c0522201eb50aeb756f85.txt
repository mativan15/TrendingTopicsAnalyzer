Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher says he's ready to move on from his squabble with Alabama's Nick Saban.

The college football offseason got much more interesting a few weeks ago when Saban alleged that A&M 'bought every player on their team' via NIL deals, prompting a fiery retort from Fisher. Fisher went scorched earth on his former boss, calling him a 'narcissist' and saying Saban's comments were 'despicable' in a quickly-arranged news conference the next day.

Saban didn't back down from the overall sentiment of his comments, which were critical of the current NIL environment as a whole, but he did apologize for singling out A&M and a few other schools.
