If the approaching election were a normal election, about authentic choices relating to real issues, the current agreement between Israel and Lebanon, concerning the maritime border between the two states, would certainly be playing a major role in how people would vote.

But that is not what the election is about. For the Center/Left camp, it is once again about 'yes Bibi or no Bibi,' for the Right/religious camp it is about getting rid 'of this awful, dangerous government,' and for the Arab parties, it is about trying to fight indifference in the Arab sector.
