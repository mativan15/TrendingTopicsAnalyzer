Published: 06:59 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 07:10 EDT, 19 October 2022 Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has said it is 'not acceptable' to stop children getting to school or commuters getting to work during rail strikes. She told MPs that the Government will introduce legislation on minimum service levels during industrial action so passengers can 'continue to get about'. Ms Trevelyan made the comments hours after the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) announced that its members at Network Rail will stage fresh strikes in a bitter row over pay, jobs and conditions.
