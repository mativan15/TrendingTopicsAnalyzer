The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is in the process of sending requests to several countries seeking information under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) about those involved in the online sexual abuse of minors and circulation of child pornographic material via social media platforms. The requests comprise more than 100 references. The CBI probe in about two dozen cases registered last November has resulted in the identification of more than 80 Indian accused persons, 16 of whom have been arrested and nine chargesheets filed so far.
