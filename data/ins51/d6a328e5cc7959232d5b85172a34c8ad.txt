Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) is urging the federal government to identify steps it is taking to secure the aviation industry from cyberattacks.

In a letter addressed to the Department of Transportation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Rosen asked the agencies to provide her with information regarding the recent cyberattacks that hit a dozen websites of major U.S. airports last week.

Killnet, a Russian-speaking hacking group, claimed responsibility for the attacks which targeted 14 airports, including the Atlanta and Los Angeles international airports.
