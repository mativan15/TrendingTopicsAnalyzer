The Dartford Crossing remains blocked by Just Stop Oil protesters for the second day in a row.The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, which links Kent and Essex, was closed on Monday after it was scaled by two climbers from the group.The environmental activist group has demanded that the Government 'halts all new oil and gas licences and consents' and said the climbers will remain on top of the bridge until they are 'brought down'.National Highways said it has no estimation of when the bridge will reopen and that there are about six miles of congestion on either side of the crossing.
