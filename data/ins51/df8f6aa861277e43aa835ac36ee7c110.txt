President Biden was ridiculed on social media Monday for spelling out the word 'dot' in a website URL he read off a teleprompter during a speech, with one wag comparing him to Ron Burgundy.
The 79-year-old president was trying to let the public know where they could report fraud in his controversial student loan forgiveness program when he mangled the address of the special Federal Trade Commission webpage.
'If you get any questionable calls, please tell us by going to report fraud … report fraud, D-O-T, F-T-C, dot gov,' Biden said, attempting to direct the public to reportfraud.
