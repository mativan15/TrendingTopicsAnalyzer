ST. LOUIS (AP) — Relatives confronted the man who fatally shot a former star of the St. Louis-based reality TV show 'Welcome to Sweetie Pie's' when he was sentenced to 32 years in prison.

'How can you sleep?' Kalyn Griggs asked Travell Anthony Hill as the 31-year-old was sentenced Thursday on two murder-for-hire charges in the the March 2016 death of Griggs' brother, Andre Montgomery. 'Was the $5,000 worth it?'

Hill admitted in June, through his plea, to conspiring with Montgomery's uncle, James 'Tim' Norman, who was the sole beneficiary of an insurance policy worth up to $450,000 against his 21-year-old nephew's life.
