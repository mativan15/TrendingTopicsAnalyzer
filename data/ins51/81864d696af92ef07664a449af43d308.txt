The Irish figured to get an ace like performance from starter John Michael Bertrand, but the rain would have none of that. Notre Dame's star pitcher went just one inning before a lengthy rain delay and Link Jarrett decided to have his bullpen take it the rest of the way.
Jarrett's move was genius, as relievers Liam Simon and Alex Rao shut down the Texas Tech bats. They combined for 15 strike-outs and the Irish had just enough offense for a 'comfortable' lead throughout the contest. It was a David LaManna two-RBI double in the bottom of the first, prior to the rain delay, that gave the Irish the cushion.
