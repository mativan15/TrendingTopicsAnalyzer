In the future, Anita Boyle hopes to see empty beds at the women's shelter at Natoaganeg First Nation. She said empty beds would signify that there was enough awareness in the community around intimate partner violence that there would be very little of it. Boyle is the executive director for Nignen, a shelter that is scheduled to be completed by fall 2023 and serve 15 Mi'kmaw and Wolastoqiyik communities. Nignen means "our home." "The security and the privacy and the confidentiality that will be part of our centre's policies and procedures would be a strong indicator that our place, our haven, our home is a safe haven and that women will be protected there," said Boyle, who is from Metepenagiag First Nation.
