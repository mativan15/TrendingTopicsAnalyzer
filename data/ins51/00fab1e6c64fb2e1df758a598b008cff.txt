More than 15 consumer groups from 18 European countries have taken their stand against loot boxes by backing a Norweigan report pushing for a ban on ‘deceptive design' in video game loot boxes. The Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC) published a report entitled 'Insert Coin: How the Gaming Industry Exploits Consumers Using Loot Boxes'. The report, backed by the aforementioned consumer groups, covers many topics such as a ban on deceptive design in video games, extra protections for minors, and transactional transparency.
