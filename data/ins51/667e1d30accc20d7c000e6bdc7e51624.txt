Justin Sullivan Headlines on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) third quarter earnings ranged from positive to enthusiastic and for the life of me I can't figure out why. Their comparisons to Q3 2021 were negative by the most important measures. Their net income was down Y/Y from $7.7 billion to $7.1 billion. Their per share earnings fell from $.85 to $.81 (a "beat" against estimates of $.78). Their return on total assets, an extremely important measure of bank performance, fell from .99% to .90%. Staying close to 1% return on total assets is an important measure for banks.
