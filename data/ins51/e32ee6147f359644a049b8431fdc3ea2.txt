Javier Olivan will be the new chief operating officer (COO) at Meta (formerly Facebook). The announcement was confirmed after Sheryl Sandberg announced she was stepping down as the COO after 14 years at the top role. 'I want to thank Sheryl for everything she's done for Meta and for the billions of people around the world who use our products,' Olivan wrote on Facebook after the announcement post by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Sandberg was the second-in-command after Zuckerberg. She was responsible for driving changes in Facebook and its apps such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.
