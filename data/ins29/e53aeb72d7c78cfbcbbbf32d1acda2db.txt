The founder of women's business network Business Chicks has defended herself against accusations of greed after a fiery post appeared on the company's social media channels lamenting widespread redundancies at the business.

An Instagram post on the group's official account alleged all thirteen of its staff were made redundant on Wednesday, one day after hosting members at an ‘open day' for the group's new coworking space where staff say they were told to sell $10,000 ‘platinum' memberships to customers.
