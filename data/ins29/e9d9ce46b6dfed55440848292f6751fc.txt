The Cincinnati Bengals are back at it near Paul Brown Stadium this summer as the prep for next season begins in earnest.
Chief among those players in attendance early this week was quarterback Joe Burrow.
Burrow being Burrow, his actions managed to turn a few heads — he was one of the notables who elected to run sprints after practice.
The recipient of major praise from Colin Cowherd recently, never mind the very revealing podcast appearance, Burrow would appear to be back to all business and nothing else as the calendar gets set to turn to June.
