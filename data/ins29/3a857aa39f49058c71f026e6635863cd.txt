An online advert using Ministry of Health branding and a photo of former National Party MP Paula Bennett is a scam, the ministry warns. The social media ad for a weight loss product was not an official Manatū Hauora – Ministry of Health advertisement, and the logo was used without consent. The advert featured a photo of a smiling Bennett, a teaspoon of powder, and the promise that 'One serving is enough, and you will lose 11kg' appearing to be endorsed by Bennett. The ministry's logo featured prominently in the photo.
