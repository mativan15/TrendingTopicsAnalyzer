BMW unveiled the third-generation X1 SUV earlier this week, which features better styling, a nicer interior and a major tech update. But the bigger news in Europe is the debut of the iX1, a fully electric version of the redesigned crossover.Like with the i4 Gran Coupe and China-only i3, the iX1 looks pretty much the same as its gas-powered sibling. It has blue accents on the bumpers and side skirts, and the large grille is blocked off and has an i badge and more blue stripes. Wheels up to 20 inches in size are available, and the iX1 is offered with the same xLine and M Sport appearance packages as the X1.
