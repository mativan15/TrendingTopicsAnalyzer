Arizona-based home builder Taylor Morrison Inc. has been spreading the seeds for new neighborhoods across Pflugerville, and the developments are now bearing fruit.

Taylor Morrison (NYSE: TMHC) announced earlier this month that sales were open for its under-construction Lisso and Upper East End neighborhoods. The company is developing, designing and building the developments, which total nearly 700 homes, Taylor Morrison Central Division President April Whitaker said.

'Pflugerville has long been an attractive market to us and we are thrilled to be opening two new communities in this part of Austin,' Whitaker stated in the announcement.
