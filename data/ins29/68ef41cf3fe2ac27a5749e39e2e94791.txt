The retired NYPD cop who was punched in the head in an apparent 'knockout game' attack in Brooklyn blasted state bail 'disreform' Wednesday as he urged officials to prosecute criminals, send them to jail – and don't let them out onto the streets.
Harvey Kraft, 66, said he chased the punk who clocked him because he didn't want to give him a 'free pass' as he railed against policies making the streets less safe.
'One thing I can say to Gov. Hochul and the [district attorneys] are when someone gets arrested, prosecute them and send them to jail and don't let them out on the street the next day, so someone else can be a victim,' said Kraft, who responded to 9/11 and retired in 2002.
