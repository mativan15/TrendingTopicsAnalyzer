The stock market is on a "rollercoaster to nowhere," according to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's chief investment officer Lisa Shalett.Shalett pointed to recent volatile swings in the market, when stocks initially plunged after September's inflation report came in above-expectations, and then soared this week on upbeat earnings reports, fueling a three-day rally ahead of more third-quarter results and November's Federal Reserve policy decision. Positive earnings from tech giants like Netflix have continued to give stocks a boost – but that's more reflective of the "extraordinary" impatience of investors, Shalett said, which is preventing the market from fully capitulating.
