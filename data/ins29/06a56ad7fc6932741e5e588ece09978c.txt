Known for his impeccable acting skills, veteran actor Govind Namdev recently opened up about his struggling days in the industry. During an interaction with a publication, the actor shared that after the release of 'Shola Aur Shabnam', he was only offered the role of an inspector. The actor added that he did not want to get typecast so he rejected 2-3 offers, but this backfired as people within the industry stopped offering films and started calling him an ‘egoist.' The 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2' actor also revealed that during those days he was under immense pressure as he shifted with his family to Mumbai and survived by borrowing money from his friends and doing small gigs.
