When I served in the Kansas Senate, reforming the Kansas Public Employee Retirement System and reducing its massive unfunded liability were two of my biggest priorities.

It was the right thing for taxpayers who pay the bills and the roughly 315,000 teachers, state employees, and other public servants who count on KPERS for their retirement. Every dollar saved for KPERS provided one more dollar for retirees and one less paid by taxpayers.

As chair of the Senate KPERS Committee, I sparred for years with the committee's ranking Democrat.
