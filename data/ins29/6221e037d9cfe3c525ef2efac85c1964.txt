Greedy Williams is ready to go for the Browns.

Williams has been activated from injured reserve after missing the first five games of the season with a hamstring injury. He'll play tomorrow against the Patriots.

Last year Williams played 16 games, with eight starts.

The Browns also elevated cornerback Herb Miller and wide receiver Chester Rogers from the practice squad.
