When is the year's biggest big-screen comedy also its most successful horror movie? When that film is Three Men and a Baby, the unlikely '80s blockbuster directed by Leonard Nimoy and starring an Avengers-style team-up of three of the decade's most eligible leading men: Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg. Premiering in theaters on Nov. 25, 1987, the PG-rated family picture grossed nearly $170 million at the domestic box office, making it that year's top earner over such era-defining adult hits as Fatal Attraction and Good Morning, Vietnam.
