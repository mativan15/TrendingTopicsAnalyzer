He ventures out into the Amazon to end his own life far from home where nobody can find him or know whether he's still alive or not. Before he has the chance to execute his plan, however, he meets American scientist Samantha Zwicker and agrees to help her by becoming a surrogate parent to a young, orphaned ocelot.
