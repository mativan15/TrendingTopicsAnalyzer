Ukrainians have seen Russian forces destroy their homes, their hospitals and increasingly, their infrastructure. Strikes on Tuesday left many of them in the dark. And some fear, without heat, their struggles could become a matter of life or death. As Russians deploy more drones to target electricity and heating facilities, the strikes have caused blackouts across the country. Ukrainian officials say the attacks have destroyed almost one-third of their power stations. Families are having to make do without basic services.
