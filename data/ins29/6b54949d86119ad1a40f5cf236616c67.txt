Brighton ace Sonay Kartal was pleased to maintain focus in an opening round match at the Surbiton Trophy as she battled past fellow Brit Lily Miyazaki after a rain delay, writes Oli Dickson Jefford in Surbiton.

Kartal, who benefits from the LTA's NTC Access programme for players ranked 100-200 in singles and 31-100 in doubles, providing cost-free access to courts on all three surfaces, coaching, trainers and the LTA's tournament bonus scheme, beat Miyazaki 6-3 6-4 in her opening match in a high-quality match at the ITF W100 event.
