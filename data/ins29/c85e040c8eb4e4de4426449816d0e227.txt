Russia today attacked critical infrastructure installations in three areas of Ukraine -- Kyiv, Dnipro, and Sumy. The attack resulted in hundreds of villages and towns across the three targeted regions being without power. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal confirmed the deaths of seven people so far. Readers may recall that last Monday, October 10, Russia fired missiles at rush hour in Kyiv, killing 19 people, according to reports. Residents of Kyiv heard the low buzzing sound of Kamikaze drones all over the city at 6.
