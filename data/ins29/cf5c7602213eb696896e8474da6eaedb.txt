[Photo/Agencies] Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a bellwether stock for consumer sentiment in China, has reported first-quarter results that beat revenue expectations, but the slowest growth rate since its 2014 IPO on the New York Stock Exchange might still cloud business prospects, experts said. Alibaba, which is also listed in Hong Kong, saw its shares surge 12 percent in Hong Kong on Friday after the e-commerce giant said its revenue rose by a better-than-expected 9 percent for the quarter ended March.
