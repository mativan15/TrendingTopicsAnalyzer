I﻿an Westbrook, Beesotted, externalTogetherness.That has been one of the key mantras of Brentford manager Thomas Frank, who celebrated four years in charge at the weekend.And it was crucial to how his team bounced back from the 5-1 defeat at Newcastle to beat an impressive Brighton side 2-0 on Friday.On the eve of the game, the Bees posted a video message from Frank asking all fans to bring their red-and-white scarves to wave before kick-off when the teams came out to Hey Jude.It worked. Thousands did as asked and it cranked up the atmosphere under the floodlights, which inspired the players.
