Loose Women's Linda Robson has addressed any rumours about a feud with This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, after she was spotted looking less than impressed when they scored their National Television Awards win.
Both ITV daytime shows had been in the running for the same award, nominated in the Daytime category alongside The Chase and The Repair Shop.
But, the gong went to Holly and Phil – despite intense backlash the pair have faced over recent weeks amid accusations they ‘skipped' the queue to see the Queen's coffin lying in state.
