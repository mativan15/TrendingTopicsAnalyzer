Little Simz has capped off an impressive year after scooping the 2022 Mercury Prize for her fourth album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert.
The British rapper and singer, real name Simbiatu Ajikawo, hails from Islington in north London, and grew up with her parents on a council estate.
She started her performance career at St Mary's Youth Club in Upper Street, also previously attended by pop stars Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke.
Simz knew from the time she was a young teenager that she wanted to perform, and was determined to carve out a career in rap, remarking in a 2020 interview with Notion: ‘I'm not going to lie and say there haven't been some tough moments, but I always knew I'd get to this place.
