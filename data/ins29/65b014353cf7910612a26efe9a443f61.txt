SEOUL — In South Korea, Kakao is ubiquitous. Nearly everyone, from schoolchildren to the elderly, uses the Korean tech company's apps for messaging, taxis, navigation and payments. It's Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Uber, Google Maps and Venmo wrapped into one.So when a fire at the building where the company's servers are run broke out this weekend, disabling its apps, people joked that the country would shut down.But the outage forced a serious reckoning over security and monopoly concerns in Korea, where a handful of giant conglomerates hold dominance over the country's economy.
