The corporate boardrooms of the nation's largest companies have fewer men – and fewer white men – than they did just two years ago.

New data shows that companies in the S&P 500 shuffled their slate of corporate directors after the murder of George Floyd, adding more African Americans and more women of color to the line-up.

In raw numbers, Hispanic and Black women saw some of the biggest gains, though they still trail their participation in the workforce, according to a USA TODAY analysis of information compiled by data firm DiversIQ.
