Warning: spoilers ahead for House of the Dragon episode 9.
In the aftermath of the death of King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine), King's Landing is in a chaotic state in House of the Dragon episode 9.
While some still support the late king's former wish for Princess Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) to ascend the Iron Throne, others – led by Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) – want the king's second-born child and eldest son Prince Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) to take the crown instead.
