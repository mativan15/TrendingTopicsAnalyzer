Domestic airlines will fly 21,941 flights per week this winter, 1.55% less than last year's 22,287 weekly flights, despite this being touted as the most profitable quarter since airlines resumed services after the pandemic lockdown in 2020. This is primarily because airlines haven't been able to increase capacity amid a severe clog in supply chain, especially with aircraft engine makers like Pratt and Whitney and CFM International that supply for the popular narrow body aircraft Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 jets failing to keep pace with demand.
