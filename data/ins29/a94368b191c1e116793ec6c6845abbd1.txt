ANALYSIS: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is sending her ministers to Auckland as the new mayor, Wayne Brown, takes aim at the Government's biggest infrastructure projects. Ardern met with Brown at Auckland Council HQ on Thursday. Officially, it all went well. Brown, who's made a habit of issuing strongly worded emails during his first two weeks in office, instead issued a kindly worded statement saying their 40-minute meeting was 'friendly and constructive'. Ardern was in Auckland to meet with the new mayor and the new chamber of commerce boss, who happens to be former Opposition leader Simon Bridges.
