The recent 31% drop in MJ Hudson Group plc's (LON:MJH) stock could come as a blow to insiders who purchased UK£1.0m worth of stock at an average buy price of UK£0.32 over the past 12 months. Insiders purchase with the hope of seeing their investments increase in value over time. However, due to recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth UK£530k, which is not great.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
