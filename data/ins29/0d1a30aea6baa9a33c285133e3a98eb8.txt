The risk of education reforms going overbudget and behind schedule has been stamped with 'red alert' warnings, declassified minutes suggest.The Scottish government published education reform board minutes dating back ten months on Thursday night, hours after Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. They reveal infighting among board members and mounting risks to the programme, including several marked 'red'.The minutes confirm that senior officials from education and exams agencies — both to be scrapped and replaced by the summer of 2024 to build trust in a system that 'needs to evolve and improve' — are spearheading the proposed reforms.
