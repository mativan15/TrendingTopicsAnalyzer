The US Department of Justice brought its first-ever charges on the insider trading of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on June 1. It could signal that the government is ready to treat NFTs like traditional financial products.The most popular forum to trade NFTs is called OpenSea, essentially the eBay of NFTs. OpenSea, a peer-to-peer trading platform and auction site, dominates the NFT space with 65% market share, according to data compiled by The Block. Many of the highest-value NFTs collections, like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, which sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency, can be found on OpenSea.
