The US will send truck-mounted high-tech rocket systems to Ukraine as the country continues to defend itself against Russia's invasion.Ukraine's leaders have been asking for the weapons which they say could be critical to their success in the war against Russia, now in its fourth month.US president Joe Biden had said on Monday that his administration would not be sending Ukraine weapons which could strike into Russia.But in an editorial published in the New York Times on Tuesday, he confirmed the US will 'provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine'.
