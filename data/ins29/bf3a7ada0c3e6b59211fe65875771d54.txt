Although the technology sector has suffered in recent months, it has benefited from phenomenal growth over the last decade. Consequently, plenty of stocks that once traded at low nominal prices now fetch hundreds or thousands of dollars per share.
Both Alphabet and Amazon plan to execute 20-for-1 stock splits this summer to address this issue. However, high nominal prices continue to hamper enterprises such as ASML Holding (ASML -1.22%), Booking Holdings (BKNG -0.99%), and MercadoLibre (MELI -3.15%), and their share prices could reduce interest from small investors if the companies don't execute stock splits soon.
