The Dodgers won 111 games during the regular season — fourth-most all-time — to easily finish with baseball's best record. Yet they're on the brink of being eliminated from the playoffs, with the Padres up 2-1 in the best-of-five National League Division Series matchup after San Diego held on for 2-1 victory Friday night thanks in part to a Trent Grisham home run.
Grisham has been a terror in the postseason, with three dingers in six games so far, the most of any player in the playoffs.
He was also more than a little excited after the Padres held on for the victory at Petco Park that has their division rivals reeling, dropping an f-bomb in his live postgame interview with FOX's Tom Verducci.
