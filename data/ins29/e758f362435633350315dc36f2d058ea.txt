A Southern California doctor was sentenced to prison on Friday for trying to smuggle hydroxychloroquine into the US and hawk it as a 'miracle cure' COVID-19 treatment, officials said.
Physician Jennings Ryan Staley, 44, admitted to working with a Chinese supplier to illegally import a barrel he believed to contain 26 pounds of the anti-malarial drug mislabeled as 'yam extract,' according to court documents.
Staley admitted he wanted to sell hydroxychloroquine powder in capsules as part of his phony business plan.
