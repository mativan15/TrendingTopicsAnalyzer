(RTTNews) - European stocks closed notably higher on Monday, reacting to new British finance minister Jereme Hunt's decision to scrap most of the policies announced in Prime Minister Liz Truss's budget on September 23. UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt said income tax cuts the government had planned would be shelved indefinitely, and he reversed plans to slash dividend tax rates and scrap alcohol duties. The measures announced by Hunt reverse more of Prime Minister Liz Truss's growth program, which prompted a selloff in UK assets after it was unveiled by her then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.
