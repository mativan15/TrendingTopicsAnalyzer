VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 27, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Azucar Minerals Ltd. ("Azucar" or the "Company") (TSX-V: AMZ; OTCQB: AXDDF) is pleased to announce that it has completed drilling the first hole into the large lithocap target discussed in its press release of April 6, 2022. The first hole initially passed through typical clay dominant lithocap alteration into phyllic alteration, then continued to propylitic alteration and at depth intense biotitic potassic alteration. Some high temperature zones of pyrophyllite and diaspore alteration were intersected confirming the in-situ interpretation for the lithocap, derived from deep porphyry fluids.
