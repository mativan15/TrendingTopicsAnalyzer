The Indian government on Saturday sharply criticised the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022 that ranked the country 107 among 121 nations, saying that the annual report was 'biased and disconnected from ground reality'. With a score of 29.1 -- a value denoting a serious level of hunger -- India ranks behind neighbours Sri Lanka (64), Nepal (81), Bangladesh (84) and Pakistan (99) on GHI 2022, a peer-reviewed report published by global non-profits Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The index catalogues five levels of hunger: low, moderate, serious, alarming and extremely alarming.
