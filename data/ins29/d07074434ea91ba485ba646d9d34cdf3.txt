Toto Wolff has said Mercedes could drop one of their customer engine teams in the future due to the low profit margins in providing their power units.

Mercedes currently supply Aston Martin, Williams and McLaren with power units, which makes their engines the most used among the grid ahead of Ferrari, whose power units are deployed by three teams.

Wolff revealed Mercedes are not making 'substantial amounts' of money from providing three teams with engines due to the cap the FIA have in place for the amount they can charge engine customers.
