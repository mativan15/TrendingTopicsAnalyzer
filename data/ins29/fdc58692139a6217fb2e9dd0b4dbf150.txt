PARIS — A man of perpetual motion, President Emmanuel Macron of France finds himself in an uneasy state of drift. Five months into his second and final five-year term, he wants to forge his legacy, but seems unsure which way to move. He promised 'a new era' when re-elected in April, but new limits on his power and cascading crises have nudged the transformative off the agenda.

Mr. Macron, whose every instinct is to play offense, has been pushed into a defensive crouch. His government, at enormous cost, has capped gas and electricity price increases that would otherwise hit 120 percent by next year.
