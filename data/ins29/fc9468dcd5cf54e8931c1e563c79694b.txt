Published: 11:05 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 11:05 EDT, 20 October 2022 Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan has denied the suggestion that there was ever any pressure put on the coaching staff to pick Cristiano Ronaldo last season.Phelan worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick in 2021-22 before departing in the summer, while Ronaldo returned to the club last August. Despite turning 37 during the season, Ronaldo still started 27 league matches last term, but it has been a different story this time around with the Portuguese starting just two of United's opening 10 top flight games under Erik Ten Hag.
