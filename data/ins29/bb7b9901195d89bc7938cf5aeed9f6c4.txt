Motsi Mabuse has revealed her mother found it ‘very stressful' when both she and her sister Oti were on Strictly Come Dancing.
The 41-year-old has been on the judging panel of the BBC's juggernaut series since 2019, while Oti was a professional dancer on the show from 2015 until 2021.
Oti made the ‘difficult decision' not to return to Strictly after a six-year stint during which she won the Glitterball Trophy twice in a row with Kelvin Fletcher and Bill Bailey.
During the recording of Friday's The Graham Norton Show, Motsi, who appeared alongside Stormzy, Geena Davis and Stephen Graham, opened up about Oti's exit to the Eurovision commentator.
