The Punjab government Friday approved to restore the old pension scheme for its employees and decided to give six per cent dearness allowance (DA) to employees and pensioners, with effect from October 1 this year, with Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann terming the decisions as a Diwali gift.
'A historic decision has been taken. Your government is going to restore the old pension scheme, the Cabinet has given in-principle approval to this decision. We stand by our employees. What we promised, we delivered,' Mann said.
