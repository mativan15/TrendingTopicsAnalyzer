It's easy to create a sumptuous spa in a sprawling Maldivian resort, or to build a huge swimming pool in a hideaway overlooking miles of rolling Tuscan hills. Trickier if the site is a luxury hotel in the heart of Mayfair, where space to expand is non-existent and everything is Grade II listed. Nevertheless, London's top luxury hotels are locked in an arms race to offer ever more lavish spas, exercise studios and thalassotherapy centres. The Spa at Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park boasts top Swiss anti-ageing cosmeceutical treatments.
