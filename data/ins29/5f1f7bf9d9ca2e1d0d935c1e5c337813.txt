EvgeniyShkolenko/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Granite Construction's (NYSE:GVA) revenue should benefit from the U.S. government's ~$1.2 Trillion Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA). The company's margin should also improve as it completes its old risk portfolio and transition toward low-risk best value projects. The company's new strategic plan should help it get back on the growth path. The company's earnings growth prospects look good and the valuation is attractive. Hence, I believe it is a good buy.
