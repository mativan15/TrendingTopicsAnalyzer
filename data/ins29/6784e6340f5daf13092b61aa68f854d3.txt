By Jeffrey T. Lewis SÃO PAULO--Natura & Co. Holding SA's shares rose about 16% after the cosmetics retailer said its board approved a plan to study a spinning off or holding an initial public share offering for one of its brands. Natura shares rose to 15.07 reais, the equivalent of $2.86, but are down 49% from the end of last year through Monday's close. Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa stocks index was up 1.3% in mid-morning trading. The company said Monday evening that it would carry out a comparative study for either an IPO of its Aesop luxury beauty brand, or a spinoff of the unit followed by an IPO.
