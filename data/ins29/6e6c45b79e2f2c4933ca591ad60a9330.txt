The 'Dark Triad' is the name given by psychologists to three distinct but related personality traits — those of Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. People with narcissism tend to be proud, grandiose and lacking in empathy, while Machiavellianism is characterised by the manipulation and exploitation of others, a cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest. Psychopathic personalities, finally, can be impulsive, remorseless, selfish and exhibit enduring antisocial behaviour.
