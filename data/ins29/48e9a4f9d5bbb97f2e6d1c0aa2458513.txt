Jun. 4—School buildings and classrooms are being built for the "lockdown" generation.

That term comes from an essay written by students after the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 14 students and three staff members.

The Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed 21 lives on May 24, and the 26 other school shootings this year alone, are grim reminders that gun violence has become the new normal for students today in America — and for those who design and build schools.
