In a weird turn of events, a routine eviction search has left three police officers charged with theft. According to KETK, a landlord in Tyler, Texas, contacted authorities to assist in evicting a resident. Constable Curtis Harris and his two deputies, LaQuenda Banks and Derrick Holman, arrived at the property.

The search should've been the first step in turning over the keys, but thanks to a mistake on behalf of Chief Deputy Banks, we see the officers weren't on the right side of the law that day.
