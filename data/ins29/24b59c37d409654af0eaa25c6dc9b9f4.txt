Abbott Laboratories announced on Friday the recall of some ready-to-feed baby formula liquid products for infants and children, including the brands Similac and Pedialyte Electrolyte Solution, due to bottle deficiency, according to their website.

"These products are being recalled because a small percentage of bottles (less than 1%) in the recalled lots have bottle caps that may not have sealed completely, which could result in spoilage," the company said in a statement, noting that the consumption of the spoiled products may result in the consumers experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
