The Chicago Bears are sitting at 2-4 through the first six games of the 2022 NFL season, where it's been an ugly start to the Ryan Poles/Matt Eberflus era. But that was to be expected.

While there are still 11 games to be played, it's hard not to look ahead to the 2023 offseason. That includes the NFL draft, where Chicago is expected to have a top-10 draft pick.

If the season were to end right now, the Bears would hold the 11th overall pick in the 2023 NFL draft. Chicago's loss to the Commanders puts them just outside the top 10 with Washington right behind at 12th overall.
