Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce is set to make an announcement on Thursday afternoon as the days leading up to a potential education workers strike dwindle and new standardized test results reveal many students are failing math. The bargaining committee for Ontario education workers said the 'parties are too far apart' on Wednesday, signalling an impasse at the bargaining table with only two days of negotiations left and two weeks to go until the union is in a position to legally take job action.
