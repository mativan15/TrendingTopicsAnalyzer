Six months post the booster vaccination with ABNCoV2, the neutralization antibody titers against Wuhan and the Omicron variant remained high and at levels associated with a greater than 90% efficacy.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark, October 17, 2022 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today the results of a six-month follow-up analysis from a Phase 2 clinical trial of ABNCoV2, a VLP-based, non-adjuvanted COVID-19 booster vaccine candidate.

Previously reported results from the trial showed, that vaccination with 100ug ABNCoV2 in 103 seropositive subjects was able to demonstrate a strong boosting effect, increasing the existing levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against both the Wuhan variant and variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron) to levels reported to be highly efficacious (>90%) against SARS-CoV-21.
