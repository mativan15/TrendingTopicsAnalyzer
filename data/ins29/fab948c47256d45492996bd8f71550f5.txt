The Denver Broncos have sputtered their way to a 2-4 and Melvin Gordon hinted at being unhappy he isn't getting the chance to help turn things around. 
The Denver running back recently liked a number of tweets that highlighted his lack of involvement in Monday night's 19-16 road loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

One such tweet stated, 'Melvin Gordon needs to request a trade tomorrow! The utter disrespect!' Another said, '#Broncos coaching staff seems about done with Melvin Gordon.' 
Gordon, 29, was not utilized much in the loss while newly added tailback Latavius Murray tallied 16 touches as opposed to Gordon's three.
