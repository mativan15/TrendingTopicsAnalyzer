A group of Amazon employees on Wednesday disrupted a Pride Month event at the company's headquarters in Seattle, protesting the company's continued sale of books they say are anti-trans. Approximately 30 employees participated in the protest, interrupting Amazon's annual raising of the pride flag by laying on the ground wrapped in trans flags, according to an employee who attended the event. The participants are members of No Hate at Amazon, which is demanding Amazon stop producing and selling books the group says are harmful to trans youth.
