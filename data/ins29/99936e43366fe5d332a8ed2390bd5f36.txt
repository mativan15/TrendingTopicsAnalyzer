Nasdaq 100 futures slipped as investors came out of a tumultuous day with bond yields rising and wide-ranging corporate earnings.

Futures for the tech-heavy index were down 0.6%, while futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 34 points or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures were flat.

The indexes saw a second consecutive day of slides during regular trading, with the Dow shedding 90.22 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down 0.8% and and 0.6%, respectively.

It was a day that started on better footing for the Dow, which hit nearly 400 points at session highs, but rising Treasury yields slashed threw cold water on stocks.
