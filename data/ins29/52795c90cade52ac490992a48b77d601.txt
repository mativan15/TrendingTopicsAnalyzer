In an interview from Motley Fool Live, recorded on May 18, Fool.com advisor Tim Beyers and Arista Networks (ANET -0.60%) CEO Jayshree Ullal discuss some of the company's other customer sectors that are driving revenue outside of the impressive cloud business that Arista has built over the years. Tim Beyers: Let's talk a little bit about the cloud titans. You've done a really good job diversifying revenue outside of the cloud titans. If I read the filings right, Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%), was it over 20%? It's now down to 15% of revenue last I looked, that is now under 10%.
