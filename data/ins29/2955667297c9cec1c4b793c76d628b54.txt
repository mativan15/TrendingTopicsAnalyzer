Volunteer staff and customers of a charity shop are feeling let down and vulnerable after a burglary on the weekend. The Arohanui Hospice Shop on Fergusson St in Feilding was broken into early Sunday morning. Thieves stole a lock box, getting away with not only store takings and donations, but money the volunteers had put aside for a Christmas Party. Shop manager Christine Ironside said a nearby cafe owner noticed the smashed front window on Sunday morning and heard the burglar alarm.
