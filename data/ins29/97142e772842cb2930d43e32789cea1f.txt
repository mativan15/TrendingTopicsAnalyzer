The drop in US stocks on Wednesday may be evidence that a rally earlier in the week was a sign of what Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett warns is 'a very impatient market.'

Investors 'just want to be done' with 2022's declines, says Shalett, who is the chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Asset Management. But the effects of tighter monetary policy and a slowing economy still haven't been fully felt, making broad-based advances in stock indexes a 'head fake.'
