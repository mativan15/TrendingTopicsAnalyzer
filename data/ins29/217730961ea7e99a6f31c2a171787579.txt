The restoration of Stormont is 'vital' while negotiations continue to resolve the impasse over the Northern Ireland protocol, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Mr Martin met the North's five main political parties in Belfast on Monday and described discussions as useful and open.With 11 days until the October 28th deadline for the powersharing Executive to resume to avoid a fresh election, party leaders also said the talks were constructive.There has been no functioning government in the North since May's Assembly poll as the DUP has boycotted its formation until its concerns about the protocol are dealt with.
