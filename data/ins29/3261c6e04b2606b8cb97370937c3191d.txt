Options traders are ready for a big move in Snap Inc.'s stock SNAP, -0.65% on the day after the social media company reports third-quarter results, but it's actually less than the average post-earnings move. Snap is slated to report earnings after Thursday's closing bell. An options strategy known as a straddle, which is a pure volatility play that includes buying bullish (call) and bearish (puts) with the same at-the-month strikes, with expiry Friday, is currently priced for a one-day post earnings move of about 19.
