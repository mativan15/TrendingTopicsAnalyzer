Could this be the week that Rutgers football breaks its streak of Big Ten losses at home?

Rutgers has lost 22 straight Big Ten games at home. It is a surprising stat given that the Scarlet Knights have won five Big Ten games over the past two years, all on the road. On Saturday, they host Indiana in a game that the Scarlet Knights hope will break this cycle of conference home losses.

Before their bye week, Rutgers nearly broke through and notched that conference home win, losing 14-13 to Nebraska.
