Mary Magdalene has something to get off her chest.
The 25-year-old model was asked to leave her plane to Dallas, Texas due to her 22-pound boobs.
The Toronto native donned leggings and a sports bra for her $5,000 Tuesday flight and was able to get through security and board the plane.
The cabin crew threw her off the aircraft for wearing her headphones and not listening to instructions from the flight attendants.
However, she believed that her departure had something to do with her appearance.
Magdalene took to social media to express her frustration, noting: 'I was kicked off the flight for how I look.
