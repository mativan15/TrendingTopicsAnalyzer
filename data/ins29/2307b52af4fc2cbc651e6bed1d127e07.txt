INGLEWOOD, Calif. — Carolina Panthers wide receiver Robbie Anderson headed to the showers early during Sunday's 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Anderson got into a verbal altercation with Panthers wide receiver coach Joe Dailey early in the game and the two had to be restrained. After the verbal spat, Anderson appeared disengaged with the team.  In the second half, a visibly frustrated Anderson was excused from the game by Panthers interim head coach Steve Wilks. He had no catches at the time of his early exit.
