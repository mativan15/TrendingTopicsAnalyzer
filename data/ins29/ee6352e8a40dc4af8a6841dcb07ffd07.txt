Rishi Sunak is reported to be 'examining the best ways to target those who are suffering most'AARON CHOWN/PAThe government seems to be paralysed by disagreement over how to deal with the cost-of-living crisis (News, last week). Rishi Sunak is reported to be 'examining the best ways to target those who are suffering most'. It's seldom I find myself agreeing with Iain Duncan Smith, but there is a system explicitly designed to help the poorest: benefits.Any other solution to the crisis (reducing VAT, subsidies to heating bills, two-year MoTs and so on) will spend more of the taxpayer's money for less benefit to those who need it.
