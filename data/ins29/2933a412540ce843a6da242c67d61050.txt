A Deputy Superintendent of Police and three constables charged by an inquiry commission with unprovoked firing against the anti-Sterlite protesters in 2018 in Thoothukudi, were placed under suspension by Tamil Nadu Director General of Police (DGP) C Sylendra Babu on Friday.
The Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission of Inquiry, which probed the Thoothukudi police firing that claimed 13 lives, faulted the police for indulging in excess and recommended appropriate action against the police officials and others.
