The Philadelphia 76ers will convert Michael Foster Jr. to a Two-Way contract. To create the space for Foster, the Sixers will waive Charlie Brown Jr. from his Two-Way deal. Foster went undrafted at the 2022 NBA Draft after spending last season with the G League Ignite. With the Ignite, 6-foot-8 forward averaged 15.6 points, 9.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocks over 28 G League games. Brown saw limited action in 19 NBA games with Philadelphia last season.
