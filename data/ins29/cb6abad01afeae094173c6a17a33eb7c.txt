Ted Cruz's campaign paid him $555,000 to cover old personal loans to his Senate committee.

It comes after Cruz successfully challenged a law that capped the amount candidates could repay themselves.

Ethics advocates and some Supreme Court justices warned that the decision could lead to corruption.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas received $555,000 from his campaign account two months ago, according to new documents filed with the Federal Election Commission.
