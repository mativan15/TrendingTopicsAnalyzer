Illinois recently received good economic news that residents and elected officials should recognize.

According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Illinois now produces $1 trillion in annualized economic activity. Illinois is just the fifth U.S. state to reach the $1 trillion mark, following California in 1997, New York and Texas in 2005, and Florida in 2017.

This historic accomplishment is a testament to the competitiveness of Illinois' businesses and the productivity of our workers.
