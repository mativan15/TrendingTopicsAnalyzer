NEW DELHI: The United States Naval Observatory, the official residence of Vice-President Kamala Harris , hosted its very first Diwali celebration with members of the Indian-American community including Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists on Friday evening. The Festival of Lights, held by Harris , symbolises a massive leap forward in political recognition and appreciation for South Asians and their heritage, according to Indian American Impact, an organisation that elevates the voices of the Indian-Americans to ensure that every level of the US government represents the community.
