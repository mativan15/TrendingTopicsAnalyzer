An anganwadi at Kalluvathukkal, Kottarakara, was closed by the Food Safety department on Saturday following a case of suspected food poisoning.'Two students had developed symptoms of food poisoning and were hospitalised on Friday. We have inspected the anganwadi and the rice stored there was found to be infested. The people in charge had used the same rice to cook food and it was served to the children. The samples of all items used for cooking were collected and the stock was seized,' said an official.
