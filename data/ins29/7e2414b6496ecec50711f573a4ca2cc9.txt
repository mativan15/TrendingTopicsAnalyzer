Antonio Conte has said his Tottenham side are still missing the experience and street-smarts to manage high-pressure matches, and reiterated that it will take time to turn the club into challengers.Spurs went down 2-0 at Manchester United in a one-sided game on Wednesday, leaving a frustrated Conte claiming they always struggle in games when 'the level is high'.Speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of Newcastle, the head coach insisted he was happy with the 'commitment' of his players at Old Trafford but said they lack the game-management of many of their Premier League rivals.
