Jessica Oberoi, 13, cannot remember when her eyesight started getting blurry. All she knows is that she had to squint to see the whiteboard at school. It wasn't until last fall when her eighth-grade class in Bloomington, Ind., got vision screenings that Jessica's extreme nearsightedness and amblyopia, or lazy eye, were discovered.

She has been going through intense treatment since then, and her optometrist, Katie Connolly, said Jessica has made great improvements — but her lazy eye, which causes depth perception problems, may never go away.
