Published: 21:45 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 21:45 EDT, 31 May 2022 Erika Jayne appeared to suggest that the 'victims' of her ex husband Tom Girardi's alleged embezzlement scheme could be lying about not receiving their settlement funds.In a preview for Wednesday's episode of the Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, the 50-year-old reality star reflected on her ongoing legal woes and speculated about the validity of the alleged victims' claims.Last year, Girardi was accused of misappropriating settlement funds intended for the families of victims of the fatal crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018.
