The race to be the next leader of the Conservative Party is under way with three candidates likely to be in the running to get nominated - Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt and Boris Johnson.

Supporters of Mr Johnson are backing the former prime minister to make an extraordinary political comeback following the dramatic resignation of Liz Truss on Thursday.

Just six weeks after he left No10 for the final time, forced out by his own MPs, allies are urging him to run again for a second shot at the Tory crown.
