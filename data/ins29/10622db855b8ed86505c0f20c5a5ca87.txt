While 80% of domestic consumers have benefited from the Aam Aadmi Party government's free power scheme, the freebie has financially crippled the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). According to the fresh PSPCL data, after implementation of free power to domestic consumers (upto 300 units per month), the state finance department letter dated July 5, calculated the subsidy cost (this includes free power to agriculture sector, industry and domestic consumers) for nine months as 12, 485 crore.
