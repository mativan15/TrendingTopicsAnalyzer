GeForce NOW expands touch control support to 13 more games this GFN Thursday. That means it's easier than ever to take PC gaming on the go using mobile devices and tablets. The new 'Mobile Touch Controls' row in the GeForce NOW app is the easiest way for members to find which games put the action right at their fingertips.
For a new way to play, members can soon experience these enhanced mobile games and more streaming on the newly announced Razer Edge 5G handheld gaming device.
And since GFN Thursday means more games every week, get ready for eight new titles in the GeForce NOW library, including A Plague Tale: Requiem.
