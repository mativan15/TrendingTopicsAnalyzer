Boarding1Now As I write this sentence, Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) trades nearly 4% lower on its Q3 earnings day. This is not to say that the results of the quarter were bad, far from it. The airline beat consensus revenue and EPS by $10 million and 14 cents, respectively. After a long COVID-19 winter, summer sales vigorously topped pre-pandemic levels. The problem is that, following a series of earnings stunners by the likes of Delta (DAL) and United (UAL), the bar had been set high for Alaska Air.
