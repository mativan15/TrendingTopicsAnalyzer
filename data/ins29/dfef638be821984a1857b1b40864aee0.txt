After holding meetings of Chhath Puja Samitis at his residence on Saturday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari sought that the 'festival be allowed on the river banks'. Tiwari said the festival is about river bank cleaning and nothing harmful is immersed in the water.
'What we pour in the river is milk, cow milk or Gangajal. If cow milk is put in water, it decreases the percentage of impurities in it,' said Tiwari. He said that the reason the Chhath festival is not allowed on the river bank is to hide the condition of the river from the people.
