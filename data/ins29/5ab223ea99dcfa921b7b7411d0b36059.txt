Rep. Tom O'Halleran, an endangered Democrat fighting for his political life in a red-tinted slice of Arizona, is finally getting some help from his party.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee went on air this week with a broadcast spot attacking O'Halleran's GOP opponent, Eli Crane, as too radical. It will run until Oct. 24 in the Phoenix market and is backed by a $680,000 buy, according to AdImpact, a media tracking firm.

The 30-second ad uses footage of the Jan. 6 attacks and warns that Crane, a former Navy SEAL, supports banning abortion and promotes conspiracy theories espoused by white supremacists.
