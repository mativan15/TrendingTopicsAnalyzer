Meta Platforms Inc on Wednesday compared searches by EU antitrust regulators to a fishing super trawler as watchdogs investigate the owner of Facebook's data and online marketplace.Meta says it has already handed over more than a million documents to the European Commission since its first request in 2019 regarding its Facebook Marketplace, social networking and online classified ads.The company has, however, questioned the necessity and proportionality of the data requests and the reasons provided by the watchdog.
