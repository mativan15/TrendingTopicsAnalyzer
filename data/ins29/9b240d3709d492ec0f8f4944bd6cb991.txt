Chelsea Watego and her team called it the bunker — a cramped workspace directly opposite the toilets at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Up to eight members of staff would squeeze into two rooms, rat traps at their feet. A long bench running along the length of the wall provided desk space, and the printer was often jammed. Poorly insulated, the rooms that the university had assigned to them in 2018 were cold in winter and hot in summer.Watego, an Indigenous-health researcher and Munanjahli and South Sea Islander woman, had just won a prestigious grant for early-career researchers from one of the country's major research-funding agencies, the Australian Research Council (ARC), and she would soon become an associate professor.
