If you want to know who really controls Genenta Science S.p.A. (NASDAQ:GNTA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

Genenta Science is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$137m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
