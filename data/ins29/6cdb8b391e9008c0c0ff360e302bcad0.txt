Less than a week before its scheduled date, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) have decided to withdraw a formal vote on unionization for Apple Store employees at Atlanta's Cumberland Mall location. As first reported by Bloomberg, the union — which has recently invested heavily in organizing tech workers — opted to hold back as a result of what it called "Apple's repeated violations of the National Labor Relations Act." 
The withdrawal follows weeks of escalating tensions between Apple and its retail staff.
