In an unprecedented order, the High Court of Karnataka has fixed a time frame of 60 days and 90 days, respectively, for completion of investigation in petty offences and the serious/heinous offences by the police and other investigating agencies in the State.However, the High Court said that the trial courts could extend the period on request made by the police by assigning reasons for extension of time for completing the investigation.The High Court issued the direction while laying down elaborative guidelines for speedy investigation after taking serious note of non-completion of investigation by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in a case filed against Belagavi South MLA Abhaykumar Patil in 2012 for allegedly possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.
