Look, I've been avoiding talking about Elon Musk's meddling in international affairs largely because I am not expert enough in international affairs to say much of anything. But now we've got Fiona Hill, formerly an advisor to Donald Trump who gave testimony at his first impeachment hearing, out here suggesting that Musk is 'transmitting a message for Putin.'This shit's weird, dude, even for me. Musk set off an international shitposting incident by tweeting a peace proposal for the war in Ukraine.
