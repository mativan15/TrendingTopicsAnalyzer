This will be the live musical event of the year.

It's a tale as old as time that's finally coming to TV: Disney's Beauty and the Beast is getting a live-action musical later this year.

Riding off of the success of The Little Mermaid Live!, the live-action/animation hybrid production is said to already be in the works by two industry titans.

Veteran director Hamish Hamilton (from The Disney Family Singalong, Academy of Television Arts and Sciences) will join forces with Jon M. Chu (from Step Up, Justin Beiber's Believe, Crazy Rich Asians, and more) as executive producer for the special, titled Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration, which marks three decades since the fairytale received an Academy Award Best Picture nomination.
