The Baltimore Ravens will take on the New York Giants in Week 6 in a game that has the potential to be one of the games of the week. Some Baltimore players who were not able to play in last Sunday's matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals will also not be playing in Week 6.
On the Ravens final injury report on the week on Friday, the team announced that wide receiver Rashod Bateman (foot), guard Ben Cleveland (foot) and outside linebacker Justin Houston (groin) would not suit up in Week 6. All three players also missed last Sunday's game due to injuries.
