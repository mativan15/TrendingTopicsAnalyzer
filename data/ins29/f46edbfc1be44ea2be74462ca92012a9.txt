A new poll by a left-leaning group indicates Colorado Democrats have comfortable leads in several statewide races heading into Election Day, as the party looks to buck historical midterm voting trends.
The poll, conducted as a joint project by Democratic groups ProgressNow Colorado and Global Strategy Group, shows sizable advantages for Sen. Michael Bennet, Gov. Jared Polis and their down-ticket allies. It also indicates that support for Democrats in the statehouse remains strong, even as Republicans target a push to retake control of the Senate in an election cycle that is often punishing for the party in the White House.
