Stuff reporter Shilpy Arora takes a stroll along a popular pathway to uncover hidden wild foods that are tempting foragers and have the potential to tackle food insecurity. It is 12pm on a Sunday and forager Helen Lehndorf has collected a basket of food within a 20-minute walk along the Manawatū River. The greens would have cost her about $25 at any supermarket in Palmerston North, but the bunch of nasturtium leaves, bright yellow Indian cress blossoms, mustard leaves, fennel seeds and chamomile flowers are all free and enough to cook a meal.
