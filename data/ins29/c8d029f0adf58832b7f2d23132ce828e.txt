Injuries may not be a good excuse for an NFL team losing a game, but the 49ers sustained enough of them that they managed to stay in the top 10 of the USA TODAY NFL power rankings after a 28-14 loss to the Falcons.
San Francisco entered Week 6 ranked No. 6, but their loss dropped them to No. 9. Their injury woes, which they'd overcome to find a 3-2 record after five games, eventually caught up to them in Atlanta. Via USA TODAY's Nate Davis:
