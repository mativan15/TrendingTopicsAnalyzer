The Portland Trail Blazers begin play Oct. 19 with several question marks. Can All-Everything guard Damian Lillard really return to form after an injury to his core ruined his 2021-222 season? Will Anfernee Simons, after signing a massive new contract, continue to get really, really good?

The team's question marks come before a season in which they, on paper anyway, look to be just OK in a year when it's fine to be terrible (watch as the Rockets, Magic, Thunder, Jazz and Spurs will all win between 15 and 20 games).
