On the fourth anniversary of legalization, Canada's cannabis producers are proclaiming a state of emergency and calling on the federal government for relief before, they say, many of their businesses are forced to go under.

At an Ottawa press conference Monday, members of the Cannabis Council of Canada — headlined by CEO and former Ontario health minister George Smitherman — producers and processors outlined the problems they're facing as the market continues to falter.

'It's no exaggeration to say that, unfortunately, all businesses of any size in the production and processing side of the cannabis industry today are systemically absent income,' said Dan Sutton, the CEO of BC's Tantalus Labs.
