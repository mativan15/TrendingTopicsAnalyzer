Scott Olson/Getty Images News Elevator Pitch I downgrade my rating for The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) from a Buy to a Hold. I reviewed BA's Q4 2021 financial results in an earlier article published on February 4, 2022, and highlighted both its below-expectations earnings and positive free cash flow. For the purpose of the current article, my focus is evaluating Boeing's medium-term or five-year outlook in view of recent corporate developments. In five years' time, Boeing should be able to deliver top line and operating profit as high as they were in 2018 before its 737 MAX was grounded.
