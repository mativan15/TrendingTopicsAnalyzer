Spencer Platt/Getty Images Global stocks edged higher Friday, headed for their first weekly win in two months as investor jitters over the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening calmed somewhat. Equities were still riding the boost from upbeat retailers' financial reports on Thursday, which sent US stock markets soaring. Strong earnings results from Dollar Tree, Dollar General, and Macy's eased fears of a pullback in consumer spending.Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.25%, while those on the Dow Jones were about flat.
