A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's lawsuit that was aimed at blocking a New York civil investigation into his business practices. 
US District Judge Brenda Sannes' ruling on Friday means that New York Attorney General Letitia James' three-year probe can continue. 
In her 43-page ruling, Sannes said she came to her decision based on case law that in most circumstances bars federal judges from interfering with probes at the state level.
‘In a big victory, a federal court has dismissed Donald Trump's baseless lawsuit to stop my office's investigation into his and the Trump Organization's financial dealings,' tweeted James.
