Former world number one Simona Halep has said she will ‘fight for the truth' after testing positive for a banned substanec and being provisionally suspended from tennis.
The former French Open and Wimbledon champion tested positive for roxadustat at the US Open in August, then had her B sample analysed, which confirmed the finding.
Roxadustat can be used to treat anaemia, stimulating the production of red blood cells, while it is also used to treat kidney issues.
Halep says she is stunned by the positive test and has vowed to fight for the truth of the matter as she insists she is innocent.
