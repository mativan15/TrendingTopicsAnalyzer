(AP) — A Paterson police sergeant accused of leading a group of city officers who illegally stopped and searched numerous people and vehicles and stole thousands of dollars from them has been convicted of falsifying a police report. Michael Cheff was also found guilty Thursday of conspiring to deprive an individual of civil rights, according to federal prosecutors. He now faces up to 30 years in prison. Prosecutors said Cheff led a group of five officers who illegally stopped and searched people in the city on a routine basis and stole money from them.
