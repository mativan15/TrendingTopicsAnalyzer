JoJo Siwa has clapped back at a basher who didn't want her as a judge on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance."The netizen created a buzz Monday after tweeting, "Dammit. I saw the headline 'Judge Leaves #sytycd' and got all excited. Yes! @itsjojosiwa was out! But, nope. It was Matthew Morrison. Dammit! I thought he brought the broadway perspective to the show. Maybe not an expert on dance, but on showmanship. Still won't watch."JoJo retweeted the said post in response, captioning it with, "literally why tweet this?"The "Boomerang" singer, who won second place in last year's finale of "Dancing With The Stars," then came up with a follow-up tweet listing a few of her accomplishments to prove the basher wrong.
