Gwengoat/E+ via Getty Images Introduction It has been almost two years since I discussed Berkshire Hills Bancorp (NYSE:BHLB). Back in August 2020, the Massachusetts bank saw its share price slide from in excess of $32 during the pre-COVID era to just under $10. As the bank didn't cut its dividend at the time, its yield had increased to almost 10% and this 'too good to be true' yield acted as another red flag to some investors. However, I argued the impact of the Q2 2020 loss was caused by an impairment charge on the goodwill on the balance sheet and the underlying earnings profile still appeared to be (more or less) intact.
