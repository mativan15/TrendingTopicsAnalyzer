The Federal Government will fast-track a project to power Victoria and NSW with renewable energy produced in Tasmania. The Marinus Link project will lay two undersea transmission cables from Tasmania to Victoria with funding from the government's Rewiring the Nation plan. The Victoria-NSW interconnector will then ensure energy can flow to NSW.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese emphasised the importance of progressing renewable energy targets as the threat of climate change is felt first-hand on the flood-ravaged east coast.
