United States President Joe Biden said in a guest essay published in The New York Times on Tuesday (May 31) evening that in addition to the 'significant amount of weaponry and ammunition' already provided to Ukraine, 'I've decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine'.
The Biden administration subsequently said it would send Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a critical weapon that the Ukrainian leadership has repeatedly asked for.
