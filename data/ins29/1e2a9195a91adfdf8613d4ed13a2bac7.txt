AgenciesThe virus may have been transmitted for months or years undetected though investigations are ongoing and there are clear no answers yeThe monkeypox virus may be spreading 'undetected', said the World Health Organisation even as the global confirmed cases rise to more than 550 from 30 countries that are not endemic to the virus. While, so far, most cases have been reported among men who have sex with men presenting with symptoms at sexual health clinics, "the sudden appearance of monkeypox in many countries at the same time suggests there may have been undetected transmission for some time," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a statement.
