Kanye West, who in 2018 legally changed his name to Ye, is one of the most successful musicians in recent history, and his long career has seen him accrue a vast number of awards, accolades and chart-topping songs and albums.

He is so successful that the rap icon has been estimated by some to be the single wealthiest musician on the planet, with Forbes estimating in 2022, that he has a net worth of $2 billion in 2022.

Despite his success, however, West has become an increasingly controversial figure in recent years due to his outspoken views and incendiary remarks.
