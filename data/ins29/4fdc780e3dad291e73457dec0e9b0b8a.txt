TikTok pushed back on a report that ByteDance, its Chinese parent, planned to use the app to track the physical locations of at least two U.S. citizens. On Thursday, Forbes reported that ByteDance's Internal Audit and Risk Control department, which investigates possible misconduct by employees, in at least two cases planned to 'collect TikTok data about the location of a U.S. citizen who had never had an employment relationship with the company.' Forbes cited internal company 'materials' it reviewed for the report; the publication said it was not disclosing 'the nature and purpose of the planned surveillance referenced in the materials in order to protect sources.
