Love Is Blind season three has come back with a bang, with the first batch of episodes containing proposals, budding romances, rejections and some possibly fake tears.
The iconic Netflix series follows a new cast of singletons as they head into the infamous pods in the hope of building a connection with a stranger, without ever seeing their physical appearance.
By the end, some decide they've met their soulmate – and pop the question before knowing what they look like – and we see them attempting to grow their budding romances before walking down the altar.
