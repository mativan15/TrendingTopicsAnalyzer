Published: 10:20 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 10:28 EDT, 21 October 2022 Liz Truss' earning power when she leaves No 10 is far worse than her rich predecessors because her 44 days as Prime Minister is viewed in Britain and around the world as a 'gigantic car crash' of her own making, one of the UK's leading brand experts told MailOnline today.The outgoing Tory leader is already a byword for 'failure' not helped by her 'lacking personality' and being a 'poor communicator' with reality TV, toe-curling adverts or being a panto villain may be her best options to make cash, PR guru Mark Borkowski has said.
