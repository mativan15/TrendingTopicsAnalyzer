James Cleverly was asked 'what's the point of Liz Truss' as he clashed with Kay Burley over the government's many U-turns.

The Sky News presenter listed the humiliating climbdowns the prime minister has been forced in her first six weeks in the job.

They include ditching plans to abolish the 45p rate of tax paid by the highest earners, watering down the cap on energy prices and being forced to abandon the freeze on corporation tax.
