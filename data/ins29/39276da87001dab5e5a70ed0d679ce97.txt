An old news clip of Eric Trump has resurfaced in which he said the Secret Service is 'saving a fortune' as it has been revealed Donald Trump repeatedly charged 'exorbitant rates' to the agents.The son of the former president and executive vice president of Trump Organisation was speaking at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit on 10 October 2019 when he claimed agents stayed at Trump properties for free and they only charged the cost of housekeeping.'If my father travels, they [Secret Service agents] stay at our properties free — meaning, like cost for housekeeping,' he said at that time.
