New Delhi: Indian benchmark index Nifty50 has dropped about 6% from its recent peak amid rising market volatility, but the rout among select stocks has been more painful for investors. According to the data from Ace Equity, as many as three dozen stocks need to post over 100% returns from their current levels. These 36 stocks need to rally 100-426% to regain their 52-week highs from the last close. The list of beleaguered counters include players from various sectors including new-age internet companies, NBFCs, IT, healthcare, petrochem, energy, auto and auto ancillaries, media, consumer durables, telecom and others.
