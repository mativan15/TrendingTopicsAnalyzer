When it comes to one of the greatest living legends in rap music, the mighty Snoop Dogg knows exactly how to wear his crown. 
As one of the most celebrated musicians alive and one of the richest rappers on the planet with a net worth of $150M, he has found a place in pop culture that few others have ever been able to command. With a mix of talent, brilliance, humor and vision, he has been able to remain unique even as new artists have risen in time. 
With sold-out shows, product lines of his own and of course performing on some of the world's greatest stages, Snoop Dogg, 50, is a force to be reckoned with.
