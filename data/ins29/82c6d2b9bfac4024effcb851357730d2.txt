A shocking attack on a pro-democracy protester who was dragged inside the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten, allegedly by consular staff, was a manifestation of China's increasingly aggressive foreign policy, according to analysts.On Sunday, the day the Chinese Communist party's 20th congress opened in Beijing, a small group of Hong Kong protesters demonstrated outside the consulate. Images from the attack circulating on social media show a grey-haired man holding one protester by his hair just inside the consulate gates, as other men attack him.
