TechPay Coin, one of the fastest blockchains in the industry, with a record of more than 300,000 transactions per second, is soon to be listed on the leading cryptocurrency exchange with more than $1.3 billion of reported volume: MEXC Global. The two-month-old cryptocurrency, TechPay Coin, has made its name by printing green candles on the chart while the crypto market is in the grey area. The cryptocurrency's impressive price performance on secondary markets has pushed its market capitalization to nearly $12 million since the listing.
