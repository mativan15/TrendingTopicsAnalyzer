Is the desecration of a painting worse than the wilful destruction of the planet? This is the question that climate activists said they hoped to spark Friday by throwing soup on one of the most famous paintings in the world — Vincent Van Gogh's "Sunflowers." Although the painting was protected by a layer of glass, social media was flooded with anger over the symbolic action. But behind the soup and the photos is a deadly story of increasing climate instability and government negligence, according to activists; one that they're hoping people will get just as enraged over.
