A double-decker bus, belonging to the Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSTRC), is now a classroom and a place for recreation for students of the Government Lower Primary School here.
The two-tier classroom has been created out of one of two decrepit low-floor buses out of hundreds meant to be scrapped by the State-run transport body. The bus was donated to the school located within the campus of the Government Teachers Training Institute (TTI) at Manacaud.
The classroom on wheels has a TV, air-conditioner, chairs with multi-coloured tables, benches, and shelves for books, but the steering wheel and the driver's seat have been retained so that children can play as if they were driving the bus.
