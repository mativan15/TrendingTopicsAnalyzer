Monday night's clash between the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers will help tell the tale of how second place in the West was won. If you're looking for props, young pilgrim, I'll accommodate you. Here are three player props on BetMGM that I like in tonight's game:

Melvin Gordon over 14.5 receiving yards (-110)

Gordon's fumbling issues put him in Nathaniel Hackett's doghouse. Javonte Williams' season-ending injury got him out. The former Chargers running back played a season-high 56% of offensive snaps last week, which led to a season high in touches (18) and receiving yards (49).
