PierreOlivierClementMantion/iStock Editorial via Getty Images During the last twelve months, I have published two articles about Accenture (NYSE:ACN) - one bullish in June 2021 (with the stock price increasing more than 45% in the following months) and one not so bullish article in December 2021 (with the stock price declining almost 30% in the following months). Data by YCharts With Accenture declining steep in the first few months of fiscal 2022, it makes sense to take a closer look at Accenture to answer the question if the stock might be a good investment again.
