The unofficial Legend of Zelda Wiki announced that it was publicly splitting from its old host, Fandom, and going independent. The website cites 'corporate consolidation' as the driving factor behind the decision.

Zeldapedia, and other game wikis, exist as a resource for players of those games. The wikis often compile video game lore, secrets, and more in an easily searchable database, and popular game wikis in particular can receive hundreds of thousands of views a day.

The Zelda Wiki opened up in 2005, and until 2017, was an independent website.
