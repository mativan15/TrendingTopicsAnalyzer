Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta has seen a few Federal Reserve interest rate cycles as CEO of the hotelier for the last 15 years.

The long-time leader is staying hopeful the latest one — focused on aggressive rate hikes to stomp out 40-year high inflation — will lead to a decent landing for the once-too-hot U.S. economy.

"My own view is that there is a reasonably good chance that we will get a reasonable [economic] landing, which is sort of a soft-to-bumpy landing with the economy," Nassetta said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit on Monday.
