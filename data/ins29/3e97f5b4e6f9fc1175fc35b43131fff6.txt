Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa on Sunday said that 'arrest of former industry minister & BJP leader Sunder Sham Arora was fine but Bhagwant Mann government should also now arrest his cabinet colleague Fauja Singh Sarari embroiled in a corruption & extortion case'.
Bajwa said, 'The arrest of Arora by the Punjab Vigilance Bureau in a corruption case was okay but what about Fauja Singh Sarari whose audio clip has already gone viral in which he was categorically heard fixing a deal to extort money from Punjab officials.
