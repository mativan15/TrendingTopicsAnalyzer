Sherry FitzGerald, Ireland's largest estate agent, plans to re-enter the commercial property sector and expand its mortgage broker business with a view to becoming the biggest player in the market.Chief executive Steven McKenna told The Irish Times that the company wants to re-enter the commercial property space, having sold its business to Cushman & Wakefield in 2018, at a time when it represented about 40 per cent of its annual revenue.'We are actively developing that strategy at the moment,' Mr McKenna said.
