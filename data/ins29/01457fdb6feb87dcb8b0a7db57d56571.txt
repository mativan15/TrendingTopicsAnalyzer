 A new Microsoft study (opens in new tab) has found the majority of workers are "stuck in pre-pandemic office spaces' rendering them almost impossible to collaborate in properly.The company's research found 83% of British workers were working in the same environment as they were before the pandemic, with employers resisting change despite adopting some hybrid working policies.The results highlight some of the key benefits of heading into the office, according to the participants, which include being able to socialize with colleagues and strengthen relationships, however almost three quarters say that they are just 'doing emails' when they head to the physical workplace.
