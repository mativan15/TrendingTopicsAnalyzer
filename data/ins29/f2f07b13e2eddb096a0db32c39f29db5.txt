Oct. 20—All Human Bean locations in the Permian Basin today will donate 100 percent of sales to Medical Center Health System as part of their Coffee for a Cure event.

The money raised will go directly to help support breast cancer health at MCH through the Breast Cancer Navigation Program.

Customers can contribute by visiting any Human Bean location in Odessa and Midland.

The Human Bean has donated more than $16,000 to breast cancer health efforts since 2018.
