A new report from Datadog has found that serverless computing could be entering the mainstream with over half of all organizations using serverless on one of the three major clouds – Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

The company found in a 2020 report that while some customers were using Lambda, Amazon's function as a service (FaaS), the other clouds lagged behind. This year's report showed that Datadog users were using serverless tech across all three clouds, with Amazon leading the way with over 70% and Microsoft and Google each over 50%, showing that it has caught on in a big way across all of the major cloud platforms.
