SAN JOSE – The Sharks couldn't overcome their offensive woes in their first home game of the season.
Sebastian Aho redirected a shot from Brett Pesce past James Reimer with 1:58 left in the third period to break a tie and help hand the Sharks a 2-1 loss in front of a sellout crowd of 17,562 at SAP Center on Saturday.
The Sharks managed only a first-period goal from Evgeny Svechnikov and now only have four goals in their first three games as they fell to 0-3-0 this season.
The Sharks were outshot 25-11 in the first two periods as goalie James Reimer finished with 33 saves.
