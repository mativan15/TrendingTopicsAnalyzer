Google's first Pixel smartwatch is finally here after years of waiting, integrating the company's Fitbit health-tracking tech and hoping to take on Samsung and the dominant Apple Watch.The Pixel Watch costs £339 ($350/A$549) and, while designed as a companion for the company's smartphones, it will work with most Android phones with access to the Google Play Store but not with Apple's iPhone. It runs Google's Wear OS software based on Android but is heavily integrated with Fitbit – the fitness tracker firm Google bought in 2019 – potentially making it the best of both worlds.
