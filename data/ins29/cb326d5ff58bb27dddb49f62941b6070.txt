Beau Lark/iStock via Getty Images Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON) this week raised its estimates of business jet deliveries, saying the global pandemic spurred a wave of first-time users and buyers of private planes. The company increased its forecast by 15% from last year's report, now estimating as many as 8,500 new business jet deliveries worth $274 billion from 2023 to 2032. It also forecast usage this year will rise 9%. "Demand for new business jets is as high as we've seen it since 2015, and we expect high levels of demand and expenditures for new aircraft for several more years," Heath Patrick, president of Honeywell Aerospace, Americas aftermarket, said in a statement.
