GPs are being asked to prioritise the diabetes medication Ozempic for people with the condition, after TikTok users began touting it as a weight loss treatment.The Therapeutic Goods Administration earlier this month issued a joint statement with several medical bodies confirming a shortage of the injectable semaglutide medication, manufactured by Dutch pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, due to 'unexpected increase in consumer demand'.'The increased demand is due to extensive prescribing for obesity management, for which Ozempic is not indicated.
