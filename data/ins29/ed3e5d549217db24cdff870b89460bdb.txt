A new entity that will take over the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in the Russian Far East has been officially set up. Russian state media TASS reported that the company was registered on Friday. Its head office is located in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. The move comes after the Russian government issued a decree to that end. A subsidiary of state-run Rosneft was assigned to become the new entity. Foreign participants in the Sakhalin-1 project must notify the Russian government within one month if they agree to retain their stakes in the project.
