Rishi Sunak has become the first to receive 100 public endorsements from Tory MPs - enough to meet the threshold for nominations in the Conservative leadership race.The winner of the contest will replace Liz Truss as Britain's prime minister and become the country's third leader this year.
Party rules for the leadership contest mean all hopefuls need the backing of at least 100 Tory MPs by Monday afternoon to stay in the race.This means the maximum number of people able to stand is three.If three candidates get 100 backers, there will be a vote by MPs, with the winning two put forward to the party membership.
