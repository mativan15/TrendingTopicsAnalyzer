TOKYO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Sweden-based private equity firm EQT has a near-record number of Japanese deals in the pipeline despite market turbulence, executives said, helped by the country's relatively stable financing environment and a flow of corporate shake-ups.

EQT's robust deal-making activity in Japan puts the world's third-biggest economy in the private equity limelight at a time when higher borrowing costs have suppressed buyouts in the United States and Europe after a record 2021.
