A litany of high-profile bills hang in the balance as state lawmakers tackle the final scheduled day of the 2022 session Thursday.
The Democratic supermajorities in the state Senate and Assembly are slated to approve a two-year extension of mayoral control, an expansion of abortion rights and additional gun control measures.
