November could be a hectic month for launches to the moon. Yes, that's "launches," plural. If there were any skepticism on whether the world has entered a new space race, the dueling lunar-bound liftoffs coming next month could be the smoking gun. After NASA waived-off two launch attempts in late August and early September — followed by a delay courtesy of Hurricane Ian — the U.S. space agency will try again to send up its first Artemis mission on Nov. 14, with backup dates of Nov. 16 and 19.That period overlaps with that of another mission lesser-known in the United States, but also slated to leave from its soil.
