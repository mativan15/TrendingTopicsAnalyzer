While bitcoin's price is stuck lately, there is one good thing to come from it for investors betting on crypto to become a legitimate asset class: It's less of a wild ride. After hovering in the $19,000 level for more than a month, bitcoin's volatility is now lower than that of both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, according to Kaiko. The data provider said Friday that the cryptocurrency's 20-day rolling volatility has now fallen below that of the stock indexes for the first time since 2020. On Monday it had fallen enough just to match the Nasdaq's volatility.
