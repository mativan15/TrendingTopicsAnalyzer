 The Criminal Lawyers' Association says it's set to meet with the Ontario government next week in an effort to seek increased funding for the province's legal aid program.
Association president Daniel Brown says insufficient legal aid funding has led to many accused being unrepresented in Ontario courts, which in turn leads to inefficiency in the justice system and places an extra burden on the courts.The association called on the government in a letter last month to negotiate a robust funding model for the legal aid program that keeps pace with the cost of living.
