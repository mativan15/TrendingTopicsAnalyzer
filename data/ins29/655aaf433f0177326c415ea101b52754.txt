SAN DIEGO -- The Padres and Phillies both entered the National League Championship Series coming off emotional wins against division rivals in the previous round. But it was Philadelphia that was able to build on that momentum, delivering the first punch with a 2-0 win over San Diego in Game 1 at Petco Park on Tuesday night. 
All-Star right-hander Zack Wheeler stole the show, striking out eight and allowing one hit over seven scoreless innings in the win. Co-ace Aaron Nola is primed to take the ball for the Phillies in Game 2 on Wednesday.
