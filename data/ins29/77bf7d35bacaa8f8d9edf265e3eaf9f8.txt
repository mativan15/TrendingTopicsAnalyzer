Google is doing away with Android Auto for Phone Screens app that works via an in-app pop-up message, the Verge reported. This feature is used by people who do not have cars with latest Android Auto versions that run on the infotainment screen as the app offers an in-car interface of Android that is safer to use while mounting the phone on a car dashboard.
