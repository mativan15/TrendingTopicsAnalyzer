A safety rating scale for social media sites could stop children viewing harmful content and prevent online arguments leading to violence, a study says.Criminal justice experts believe Ofcom, the communications regulator, could devise a system based on, for example, tech companies that prioritise age verification, remove anonymous accounts and respond to police requests to delete harmful content.Researchers said a rating system would enable parents and carers to decide whether their child should access a particular social network.
