Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham was suspended by Major League Baseball for three games on Saturday after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson because of a dispute about their fantasy football league.While the Giants warmed up in the outfield before Friday's series opener, the 34-year-old Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated.Pham said Saturday there was some 'sketchy' stuff going on with the fantasy league, and Pederson also made 'disrespectful' comments about Pham‘s former team, the San Diego Padres.
