Navi Mumbai: The Kalamboli police have booked eight people, including a police constable working in the headquarters and staffers and owner of a petrol pump for cheating the police department of around ₹6.83 lakh by forging and submitting fake petrol bills and usurping the money. 'The inquiry was started around a month and a half ago after one of the staff found discrepancies in the bills,' said Abhijit Shivthare, deputy commissioner of police. He found one of the digits of a vehicle number submitted to be wrong and eventually did a reverse investigation and found that the bill was fake.
