In 2013, Davinci Jeremie, a software developer and crypto content creator, made a short YouTube video begging his viewers to buy at least $1 of bitcoin. He predicted it would become a leading currency that would be self-regulated.At the time of filming the video, which now has 3.8 million views, he recalled that bitcoin was trading between $100 to $200. Despite the crypto's volatility , if an investor had taken his advice, they would have seen gains of over 15,750% to date. As a software developer, he understood that bitcoin's proof-of-work concept meant that no one can change the blockchain or roll back a transaction, including governments.
