Broadband connections and 4G coverage is now returning to the islands

Damage to two subsea links which seriously disrupted communications to Shetland was likely caused by fishing vessels, the cable operator has said.

A break in the cable connecting Shetland to the mainland led police to declare a major incident on Thursday.

Faeroese Telecom said most services had returned, but the cable would not be repaired fully until next week.

It follows a fault last week on the subsea cable connecting Shetland and the Faroe Islands.
