LONDON, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- 'Singles Day' may not have the high profile of Black Friday or Cyber Monday.  But it looks set to become the biggest online shopping day of the year.  nShift, the global leader in parcel delivery management software, is calling on retailers to be ready by providing a competitive customer experience.
Singles Day began in 1993 and celebrates people who are not in a romantic relationship.
