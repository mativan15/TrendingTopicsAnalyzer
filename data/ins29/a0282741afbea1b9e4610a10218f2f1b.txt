Tom Brady wasn't making any new fans in Pittsburgh on Sunday after he not only lost to the Steelers, but was also caught on video in a heated exchange with his own teammates just seconds before the Buccaneers caught some relief at halftime.Brady arrived in town the day before after attending the surprise wedding of his friend and former boss, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, in New York City on Friday without his wife, Gisele Bündchen.Tom and Gisele have been married for 13 years and have two children together, but reports have surfaced in the last few months that the couple grew apart, primarily after he decided to come out of retirement only 40 days following his decision to leave the league in February.
