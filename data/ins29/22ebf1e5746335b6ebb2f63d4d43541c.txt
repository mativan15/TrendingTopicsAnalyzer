It started with the No Club, a group of women gathering together to support each other so they might more frequently turn down workplace requests for what they would call crappy tasks. But over time they realized what was crappy work for them was often very important for the organization and the leaders making the assignment. They began to define those tasks as unpromotable work, because it was not honoured by advancing their career even if they won brownie points for accepting them. Next, given the club's four members were academics, was to investigate the nature of these tasks and in particular the gender divide in assigning and accepting them.
