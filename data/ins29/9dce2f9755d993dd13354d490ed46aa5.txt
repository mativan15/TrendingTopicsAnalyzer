Our criminal justice system is failing rape victims.
At present in the UK, only 1.3% of recorded rape cases result in a suspect being charged.
For years, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been called upon by campaigners and rape charities to improve both rape conviction and charge rates, as well as to overhaul a system in which victims of sexual violence often feel like they are the ones being treated as suspects.
You might not be aware, but at present, a victim of sexual assault can have their medical records, therapy notes and even school records requested as evidence by prosecutors and used as part of an investigation into the alleged crime.
