If you were paying close enough attention to Mets general manager Billy Eppler last week when he addressed the media, you might have noticed how he referred to Jacob deGrom: as a future member of the Hall of Fame.

Twice Eppler said the two-time NL Cy Young Award winner is a future hall-of-famer. It was an interesting comment given deGrom is not widely considered a first-ballot pitcher, at least not yet. His career 41.1 bWAR is well below that of his teammate Max Scherzer (70.7) and he is not among the top five active leaders.
