Green Thumb Industries announced on Wednesday that it has signed an agreement to bring its RISE chain of marijuana dispensaries to Circle K locations in Florida. Under the plan, Green Thumb will open about 10 RISE Express medical marijuana dispensaries adjacent to Circle K convenience stores in 2023 as part of a 'test and learn phase of the rollout' to expand its medical cannabis retail footprint in Florida. 'The opening of RISE Express stores at Circle K locations is a game-changer. Convenience is a strong channel in retail, and people want more access to cannabis,' Green Thumb founder, chairman and CEO Ben Kovler said in a statement from the company.
