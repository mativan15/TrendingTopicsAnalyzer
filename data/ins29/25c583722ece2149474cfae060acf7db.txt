Since 2006, Goldman Sachs has invested nearly $7 billion in India of proprietary as well as client capital that it manages, and continues to see opportunities, given the growth prospects, said its top executive. "A great tech ecosystem coupled with innovation has developed here in India and that is also an important part of our business. So, the role of India will only grow bigger," said David Solomon, chair and chief executive of the Wall Street bank, in an exclusive hour-long conversation with ET, during his maiden trip to India since taking over the top job in 2018.
