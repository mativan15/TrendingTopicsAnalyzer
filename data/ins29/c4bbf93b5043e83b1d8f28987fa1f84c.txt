Leon Neal/Getty Images News Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is extending its hiring pause for both new and backfill positions "for the foreseeable future," the cryptocurrency exchange's Chief People Officer L.J Brock wrote in a blog post Thursday. The initial hiring freeze among other cost-cutting measures was disclosed two weeks ago. Brock pointed to the ongoing crypto bear market, adding that "it's become evident that we need to take more stringent measures to slow our headcount growth." "Adapting quickly and acting now will help us to successfully navigate this macro environment and emerge even stronger, enabling further healthy growth and innovation," Brock explained.
