The Maharashtra government has restored the general consent for the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe cases in the state. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government had withdrawn the general consent two years ago. Chief minister Eknath Shinde on Friday cleared the Maharashtra home department's move to allow CBI to investigate cases in the state. The decision was finalised in August following which the state home department headed by deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sent a proposal to allow CBI to investigate cases in the state again.
