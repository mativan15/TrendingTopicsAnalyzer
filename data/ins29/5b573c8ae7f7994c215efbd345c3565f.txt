Iran is readying to supply Russia with surface-to-surface ballistic missiles and suicide drones for use in Ukraine."Iran's widening radius of drone proliferation continues to prove that bad actors in the Middle East do not stay quarantined," Foundation for Defense of Democracies Senior Fellow Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital.Taleblu's comments come after a Washington Post report Sunday revealed that Western security officials believe intelligence indicates Russia will purchase Iranian-made Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar short-range missiles with the first shipment expected soon, after the deal was finalized last month.
