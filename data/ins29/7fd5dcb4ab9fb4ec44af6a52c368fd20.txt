Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday warned conservatives against veering too far toward 'unprincipled populism,' delivering a speech with several veiled swipes at former President Trump's fixation on the 2020 election and grip on the party.

'Conservatism is bigger than any one moment, any one election, any one person. It's about ideas,' Pence said in remarks at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.

Pence, who is seen as laying the groundwork for a potential 2024 presidential bid, laid out the fork in the road facing the conservative movement.
