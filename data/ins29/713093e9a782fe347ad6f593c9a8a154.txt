By Paulo Trevisani Brazilian officials are auctioning a 25-year bond in an effort to raise at least $500 million to pay creditors of fallen entrepreneur Eike Batista. The bond, issued by London-based miner Anglo American PLC, was part of a payment for an iron-ore operation in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, said Ricardo Lacerda, chief executive of Brazilian investment bank BR Partners Banco de Investimento SA. A judge at the first business court in the state capital of Belo Horizonte who handles the bankruptcy process ordered the auction and hired BR Partners to manage the auction.
