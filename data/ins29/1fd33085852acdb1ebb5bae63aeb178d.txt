The Government has spoken with the Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland, Gerasko Larysa, to explain the severe difficulties being experienced with efforts to accommodate Ukrainian refugees coming here, Simon Coveney has revealed.'We have spoken to the Ukrainian ambassador here to ask her to send the message that Ireland is under pressure from an accommodation point of view and when we have done that with her before, it has had a positive response in terms of reducing the numbers in the short term,' the Minister for Foreign Affairs said.
