The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Amerigo Resources Ltd. (TSE:ARG) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 34%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 6.2%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 29% over three years. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 15% in the last three months.
