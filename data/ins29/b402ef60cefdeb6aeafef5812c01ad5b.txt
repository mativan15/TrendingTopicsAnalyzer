Patrick Mahomes lost for the first time in his career as an underdog in a "24-20 game" that didn't feature quite as much offense as fantasy managers hoped (Josh Allen/Mahomes matchups entered averaging 60.0 points per game). Still, Stefon Diggs was the WR2 and Allen was the QB3 this week (while hurdling hopeless defenders).

Allen led Buffalo on a casual 96-yard, 73-second TD drive at the end of the first half, which of course was countered by Harrison Butker nailing a 62-yard field goal against the wind.
