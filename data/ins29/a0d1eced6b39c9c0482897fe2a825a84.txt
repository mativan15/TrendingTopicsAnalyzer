 This new exhibition is the first of its kind to examine the interplay between money, power and dissent over the last 250 years – with a key strand of the show exploring the role of the individual in protesting for rights and representation.
From the radicals of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, like Thomas Spence and the Suffragettes, to current artists and activists, such as Aida Wilde and Hilary Powell, the works on display show how money has been used to promote social and economic equality or satirise those in power.
