The Los Angeles Lakers' final preseason game of 2022 was Friday evening versus the Sacramento Kings, and it was supposed to be a dress rehearsal for their regular season opener on Tuesday against the Golden State Warriors.
Many were expecting regular season-type rotations and minutes, not to mention more cohesion and execution on both ends of the floor.
Instead, it was a comedy of errors, almost from start to finish, as Los Angeles got routed 133-86.
The Lakers were competitive for much of the first quarter.
