Funding from the federal government has enabled Saskatoon's Finance Committee to recomment over $10 million in additional upgrades to the Harry Bailey Aquatic Centre. The estimated project cost is $13.4 million, with the $10 million in funding from the Government of Canada's Green and Inclusive Community Building program. The City already approved $3.5 million from its Civic Buildings Comprehensive Maintenance Reserve for the project. The federal injection of $10 million enables the city to expand the work being done on the building, according to the finance committee.
