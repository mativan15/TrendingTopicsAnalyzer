The Supreme Villa' group of holiday properties is a typical Asif Rozani enterprise. The entrepreneur has always uniquely accomplished his goals. He thinks out of the box and acts on it. At the young age of 16, he got his shot at the family business but made a complete U-turn and created a high-end health and fitness enterprise by the time he was 21. And he has never looked back since then. He established a successful real estate business next. His out-of-the-box thinking helped him seize the next big opportunity in the hospitality industry.
