Even as a section within the Vizhinjam Samara Samithi is of the opinion that the protests must be ceased in the backdrop of the Kerala government accepting six out of the seven demands of the protesters, there is a growing mystery in the unwillingness of protesters to stop the agitation, said General Education Minister V. Sivankutty on Monday.Stating that stalling the Vizhinjam port construction is 'an extraordinarily unrealistic demand', the Minister said the latest turn of events suggests that a group of people within the samithi are playing politics.
