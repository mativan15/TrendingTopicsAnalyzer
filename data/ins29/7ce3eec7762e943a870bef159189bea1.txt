South Africa's Gold Fields Limited GFI-N is paying a rich premium to buy Yamana Gold Inc. YRI-T in a USS6.7-billion all-share transaction that will see another of Canada's mid-tier mining companies swallowed up by bigger prey.In a deal announced on Tuesday, Yamana shareholders are set to receive 0.6 of a Gold Fields share, which equates to a premium of 31 per cent over its closing market value on Monday.Yamana's board has backed the deal, and a shareholder vote will be held later in the year, with at least two thirds of votes cast needed for it to close.
