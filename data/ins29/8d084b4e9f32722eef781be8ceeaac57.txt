SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. – Stephanie Meadow finished third in her professional debut at the 2014 U.S. Women's Open on Pinehurst No. 2. She earned $285,102 for her efforts, a massive sum for a recent college graduate.
'I had a rough time in '16 and '17,' said Meadow of the years immediately following her father Robert's death. 'That money carried me through that.'
The U.S. Women's Open purse has long had a life-changing impact, not just for winners, but for many like Meadow, who cash the biggest checks of their careers.
