Twitter's potential future owner Elon Musk apparently thought for a moment that it would be a grand idea to fuse the blue bird app with his pal Kanye West's potential new social media platform Parler. So, in typical Musk form, he tweeted out a Dragon Ball Z meme featuring him and West, who is legally known as Ye. Then, after giving it some serious thought or perhaps receiving a call from his lawyers, he deleted it with no explanation.Musk tweeted out the meme on Monday after news broke that Ye had entered into an agreement 'in principle' with Parler parent company Parlement Technologies to buy the right-wing social media app for an undisclosed amount.
