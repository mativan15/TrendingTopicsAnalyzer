As a child, he was fondly called ‘Milky' due to his peaches-and-cream complexion. Duttaranwali village still remembers Lawrence Bishnoi, the gangster whose name is being mentioned in the Sidhu Moosewala killing, as a fair complexioned, well-behaved child who had a flair for making friends.
Fond of western names, his parents Lavinder Bishnoi and mother Sunita Bishnoi christened their first-born Lawrence. R.D Bishnoi, a classmate of Lavinder, says the Bishnois are a well-heeled, landed family. 'They are an affluent family, their forefathers had hundreds of acres, even now Lavinder has nearly 100 acres in Duttaranwali village which they give on annual lease as they themselves cannot do farming.
