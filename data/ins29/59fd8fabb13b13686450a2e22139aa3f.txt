Danny Masterson's first rape accuser spent a long day on the witness stand on Thursday, as Masterson's defense lawyer sought to expose inconsistencies in her accounts.

The woman, who prefers to be referred to as Jane Doe #1, told her story in often emotional terms earlier in the week, alleging that Masterson raped her at his home in April 2003. Masterson, the former star of 'That '70s Show,' is facing three charges of forcible rape that could send him to prison for 45 years to life.

On Thursday, defense attorney Philip Cohen asked her about differences between her initial statements to the police in 2004 and later interviews after the case was revived in 2016.
