Oct 18 (Reuters) - Austria raised 1 billion euros on Tuesday from the sale of the first ever green T-bill, a move aimed at attracting shorter-term investors to buy environmentally-friendly assets.

The bill, which matures on 23 February 2023, priced for a yield of 1.25%. Demand relative to the amount on offer, the bid-to-cover ratio, was 2.69 times.

So far, the vast majority of governments and companies selling green debt, which funds environmentally-friendly expenditure, have sold bonds, which have time horizons of several years.
