Raymond James analyst Buck Horne lowered ratings on all of the home-builder stocks he covers, as he believes the recent 'relentless' climb in mortgage rates has ensured a housing recession. 'Interest rate volatility isn't just slowing the for-sale market,' Horne wrote in a note to clients. 'We are seeing a broad spectrum reduction in housing demand, including multifamily and SFR [single-family residence]. Net new household formations seem to have come to a standstill.' Horne double downgraded PulteGroup Inc.
