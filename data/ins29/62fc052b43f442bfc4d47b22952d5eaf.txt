MONTGOMERY, Texas (PRWEB) October 20, 2022 Jonathan Cook, a Vietnam veteran and father of two who enjoyed a long and successful career in business serving as president of divisions of five companies in the US and Australia and now enjoys his retirement in Texas with his wife of over fifty years, has completed his new book 'The Republic': a gripping and potent work that keeps the pages turning until its dramatic conclusion. A world-famous black civil rights attorney has uncovered a sinister plot to undermine and overthrow the US government and replace the existing republic with a Socialist/Marxist-style government.
