MILAN (Reuters) - There is no evidence that Silvio Berlusconi bribed witnesses in the infamous 'bunga bunga' sex trial, one of his defence lawyers said on Monday, calling for the former Italian prime minister to be acquitted in a new trial linked to the case.

An appeal court cleared Berlusconi in 2014 of soliciting sex from a minor and abuse of power. But the billionaire conservative politician was put in the dock again after being accused of paying witnesses to help clear him.

"There is no evidence, not even indirectly, of a bribery agreement" between Berlusconi and the women who testified for him, lawyer Federico Cecconi told judges in Milan.
