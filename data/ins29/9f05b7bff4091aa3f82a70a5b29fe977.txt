Celebrities have reacted in shock, outrage and cheers as Liz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister after just six weeks. 
The PM delivered a speech outside Downing Street on Thursday afternoon to announce that she was stepping down from the role after a disastrous short term, which has included crashing the economy and the departure of both her Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary.
