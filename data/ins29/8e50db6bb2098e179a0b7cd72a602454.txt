Aries kids are fun and high-spirited. They're full of life and therefore, they need things through which they can channel their energy. Depending on their age, give them something that keeps them moving and active through the day. For instance a bicycle, tricycle, a walker or a bat and a ball. Taurean children are introverted. They love keeping to themselves and are also very sensitive. Best to gift them a book to read or some online games to play. In both cases, make sure their eyes are protected and do not strain.
