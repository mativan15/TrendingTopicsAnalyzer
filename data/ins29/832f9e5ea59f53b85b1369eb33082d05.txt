The City of Regina executive committee has weighed in on how much they think Regina residents should pay for garbage collection services as the new green compost bin is introduced in Regina.
During Wednesday's meeting, the executive committee voted unanimously in favour to approve an option which would see that green, blue and brown bin collections all become paid for by user fees rather than through property taxes.'All of these options are going to cost us more money,' said Ward 8 Coun. Shanon Zachidniak.
