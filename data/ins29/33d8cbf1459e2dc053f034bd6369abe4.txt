It was a joyous start, down-in-the-dungeon middle and finally up again first half of the regular season for the University of Miami football program and new head coach Mario Cristobal.

But the Hurricanes still have a knack for making fans' hearts pound in the process, even in a game like Saturday's 20-14 victory over Virginia Tech. The Hokies scored 14 unanswered second-half points and kept Miami off the scoreboard after the Canes took their 20-0 lead into the final quarter.
