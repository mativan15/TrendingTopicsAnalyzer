Two days after a leaked audio recording jolted Los Angeles, angry and pained citizens packed the City Council chamber.

They chanted, jeered, cursed and vowed to prevent the Tuesday morning meeting from taking place as long as the three council members heard on the racist recording remained in office.

As council leaders struggled to regain control of the room, a figure in a brightly embroidered blouse stood out among the sea of dark suits.

Eunisses Hernandez, a 32-year-old activist who ousted two-term Councilmember Gil Cedillo in the June primary, is not scheduled to take over his seat until December.
