COLUMBUS — The County Commissioners Association of Ohio (CCAO) is thanking members of the Ohio General Assembly for their support of House Bill 377, which enacts Gov. Mike DeWine's proposal for investing in Appalachia and provides funding for the Aug. 2 primary election.

'Ohio's Appalachian counties are deeply grateful for state lawmakers' support and are excited about the possibilities these funds will unlock,' Tuscarawas County Commissioner and CCAO Second Vice President Chris Abbuhl said in a press release.
