Aruna Budda Reddy is a well-known name in the Indian gymnastics field, as she came into the limelight by winning a single medal at the Gymnastics World Cup. She was the first Indian athlete to win the title. Once again, Aruna Buddha Reddy came to the headline due to her accusation against India's Sports Authority (SAI) coach. On Thursday, the gymnast alleged that the accused coach took her videography without her consent during her physical fitness test, which was held at the IGI stadium in the month of March this year.
