Alison Hammond and her co-star Craig Doyle, who stepped in for Dermot O'Leary on Friday's This Morning were intrigued by a guest, called Katie Hardwick, who makes a living selling dead mice. Katie became a full-time taxidermist and reportedly makes £100,000 a year from her stuffed mice ornaments. However, her business left ITV viewers horrified, with some branding it "disrespectful". The East Sussex mother, who used to be an exotic dancer, often attaches her stuffed mice to stripper poles, tiny yoga mats and even small circus hoops.
