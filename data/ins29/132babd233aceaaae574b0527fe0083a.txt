With the midterm elections on the horizon, Americans will soon cast their ballots to elect members of Congress.

Members of the U.S. House of Representatives are elected for two-year terms, meaning all 435 seats are up for grabs in this year's midterms. The 2022 midterm elections will be held on November 8, 2022 and there are plenty of House races to keep an eye on.
