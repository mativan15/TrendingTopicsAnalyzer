The online admission process for the Ambedkar University's undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the College of Art (CoA) has begun, the varsity announced. It comes amid an ongoing tussle over the affiliation of CoA between Delhi University and Delhi government, who funds the Ambedkar University. The admission process began on Friday. The last date for applying online is June 30, the university said in a notification. Admissions to the College of Art could not be held during the last academic session due to the affiliation issue.
