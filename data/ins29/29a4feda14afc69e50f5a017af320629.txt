Published: 04:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 04:16 EDT, 17 October 2022 Maurizio Sarri has warned Lazio they may need to find a new coach because his style is not suited to the current state of the club's pitch at the Stadio Olimpico.The former Chelsea boss was seething following the 0-0 draw with Udinese and after the game condemned the playing turf at the  ground, which has been used for both Lazio and Roma's Serie A and Europa League games this season. Sarri told DAZN that he had to abolish his tactics for the game in the warm-up after seeing the state of the turf, and told the club that they'll need to find a different coach if they continue to want to play on the pitch in its current state.
