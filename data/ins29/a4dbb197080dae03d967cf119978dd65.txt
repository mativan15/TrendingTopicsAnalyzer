Apple has announced a series of updates to its iPad range, as well as launching a new version of the Apple TV set-top box.
The tech giant revealed a redesigned version of its most basic iPad alongside an update to the top-of-the-range iPad Pro.
There was no snazzy virtual event like there was for the iPhone 14 Pro. Instead, Apple quietly updated its online store and sent out a flurry of press releases.
The new entry-level iPad model has seen the home button removed, the front-facing camera moved to the longer side of the device and the Lightning port changed to the more widely used USB-C connection.
