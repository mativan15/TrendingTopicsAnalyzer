The history of the betting line between Clemson and Florida State has been challenging to understand.

What once began as Tigers -7.5 on Sunday quickly fell to -3.5 by Monday afternoon. By Saturday morning, it had pushed back up to FSU +4.5, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

It's pretty clear that professional bettors love the Seminoles while public backers can't resist a more favorable line for the fourth-ranked Tigers. After all, Clemson has dominated this series as of late, winning and covering the spread in the previous four meetings.
