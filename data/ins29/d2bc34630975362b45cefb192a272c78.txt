Retailers face paying an extra £3bn next year in business rates, piling further pressure on the high street as costs soar and shoppers cut back on spending.
Business rates, which are a tax on company properties, are due to rise in line with inflation, which hit 10.1pc in September.
It means the overall business rates bill for companies across England is projected to jump by £2.7bn to £30bn from April, when the tax rises, according to property experts Altus Group.
According to the British Retail Consortium, retailers alone are set for an £800m tax hit next year as a result.
