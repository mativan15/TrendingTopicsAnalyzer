By Stephen Nakrosis Fitch Ratings on Thursday said it lowered its outlook on Peru to negative from stable, and affirmed Peru's Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating at 'BBB.' "A deterioration in political stability and government effectiveness has increased downside risks to Peru's ratings," Fitch said. The agency said high turnover in the cabinet as well as a pair of failed impeachment attempts "have sustained political tumult." Several corruption investigations involving directly the president or close affiliates, along with frequent rotation of ministerial positions, have undermined government effectiveness, according to Fitch.
