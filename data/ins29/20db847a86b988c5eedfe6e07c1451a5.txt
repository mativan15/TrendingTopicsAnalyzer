Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has opened up about how farming is ‘incredibly hard' amid the cost-of-living crisis.
The 24-year-old farming contractor shot to fame last year after the release of the hit Prime Video farming show, which follows Jeremy Clarkson as he attempts to run an Oxfordshire farm.
Speaking about the pressures on farming given the current cost-of-living crisis in Britain, Cooper said: ‘I think farmers are going to, either way, get through this and I hope they do it together, but it's an incredibly hard industry that we're in with everything going up in price.
