KleptoCapture is targeting a man who is reportedly among enablers working outside Russia.

Evgeniy Kochman, CEO of Imperial Yachts, has overseen the flow of billions linked to oligarchs.

Kochman's firms are under scrutiny as documents show a connection to Russians, The NYT reports.

US task force KleptoCapture has turned its attention to a man who is at the center of an "oligarch-industrial complex," The New York Times reported.
