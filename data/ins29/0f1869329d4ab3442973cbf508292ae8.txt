Following a year of uneven perimeter shooting for Michigan basketball, the Wolverines will enter the 2022-23 campaign needing to replace their leading 3-point threat.

Small forward Caleb Houstan, who paced U-M with 60 made 3s as a freshman, has decided to end his collegiate career and remain in the NBA draft, the Free Press has confirmed. His decision coincides with the June 1 withdrawal deadline for players who maintained their eligibility during the pre-draft process.

It was reported Wednesday that another Michigan freshman, Moussa Diabate, will also stay in the NBA draft.
