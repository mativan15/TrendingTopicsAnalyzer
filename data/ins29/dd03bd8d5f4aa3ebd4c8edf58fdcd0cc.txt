Despite his popularity within the Conservative Party, Ben Wallace declined to join the mass exodus that led to Boris Johnson's defenestration in July or to run in the ensuing leadership contest eventually won by Liz Truss.Instead, the defence secretary, 52, shrugged off the encouragement of his peers, insisting he was quite happy where he was.He did back the winner, however, for which he was rewarded by being allowed to keep his job, in which he has won acclaim for his robust support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion on 24 February.
