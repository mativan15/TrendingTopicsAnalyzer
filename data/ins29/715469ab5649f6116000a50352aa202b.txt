A Charlottetown woman is appealing to the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission after the Parkdale Sherwood Lions Club moved to evict her from the home she was renting in order to expand its parking lot. Lindsay Cameron's rental home of seven years was one of two buildings that are slated for demolition, even though she believes it is structurally sound, and she has provincial documents calling it "still livable" to support that view. She recently secured a new pet-friendly rental, but is still appealing her case at IRAC because she wants the Lions Club action to be part of public record.
