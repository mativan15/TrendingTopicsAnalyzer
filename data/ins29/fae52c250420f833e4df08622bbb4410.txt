Oct. 16—FORT WORTH, Texas — Spencer Sanders made a bold prediction after his Oklahoma State squad come up short, 43-40, in the second overtime period against No. 13-ranked TCU.

"We'll meet up in Arlington," the Cowboy quarterback said, making reference to the Big 12 Conference championship game played at AT&T Stadium in December.

The definitive statement came after a day of mystique surrounding the Oklahoma State team.

Four hours prior to game time, reports surfaced that Sanders had been dealing with a shoulder injury, but was expected to play.
