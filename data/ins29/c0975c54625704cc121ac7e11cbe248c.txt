While Punjab is waging an all-out war against drugs, it faces a Herculean task in curbing substance abuse by women, who have often been overlooked in the discourse. Against this backdrop, a recent video showing a young, inebriated woman by a roadside bench in Kapurthala has caught the glare of public eye. The married 22-year-old, addicted to heroin, had been undergoing treatment at the State's only government-run women's de-addiction centre in Kapurthala. In the video, which went viral on social media, the young woman is heard saying she gets her chitta (heroin) from the nearby Mehtabgarh village, where drug peddlers can frequently be found roaming about.
