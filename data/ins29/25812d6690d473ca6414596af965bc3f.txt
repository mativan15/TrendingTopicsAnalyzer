Worcester Warriors' former owners have been disqualified from being directors of a company less than three weeks after plunging the club into administration.
Colin Goldring and Jason Whittingham were also fined for failing to file accounts for Worcester Sport Limited to the Registrar of Companies at Companies House in Cardiff.
The pair failed to show up for a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court last week, with their disqualification imposed in their absence.
Goldring and Whittingham failed to deliver a copy of Worcester Sport Ltd's accounts for the financial year ending 28 February 2021, which had been due on November 30 last year.
