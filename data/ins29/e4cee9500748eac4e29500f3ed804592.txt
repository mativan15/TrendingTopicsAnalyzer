The Biden Administration is funding overseas drag shows with U.S. taxpayer dollars as part of a global cultural outreach program, a recent financial disclosure has revealed.

The State Department awarded a nearly $21,000 grant to Ecuador's Abraham Lincoln North American Cultural Center to host 12 drag theater performances designed to 'promote diversity and inclusion,' according to an agency filing.

The $20,600 award is part of a program designed to 'support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the United States and citizens of the rest of the world,' according to the State Department filing.
