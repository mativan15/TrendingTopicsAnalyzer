Harrison Bader has pushed his way into the top of the Yankees' lineup. With four home runs in six playoff games, the 'defensive' center fielder has made his bat a big part of the Yankees offense and Thursday night, for Game 2, the Bronxville native was leading off against the Astros.

'Lefty going obviously Framber...and yeah, just get another righty,' Aaron Boone said. 'And obviously he's playing really well and just gets us a little deeper in the middle of the order.'

It's the 22nd time in his career that Bader has hit leadoff.
