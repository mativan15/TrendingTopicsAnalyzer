Malaysian palm oil futures jumped nearly 5% on Tuesday, hitting their highest in nearly seven weeks, helped by a continuous decline in the ringgit and concerns over global edible oil supply. The benchmark palm oil contract for January delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 183 ringgit, or 4.7%, to 4,070 ringgit ($863.94) a tonne by the midday break. The contract was also up for a third consecutive session and touched its highest since Sept. 1.

 A weaker ringgit added with fears of floods hitting production in Malaysia are keeping prices elevated, said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at Selangor-based brokerage Pelindung Bestari.
