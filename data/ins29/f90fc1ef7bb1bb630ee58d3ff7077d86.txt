Goldman Sachs is planning to reorganize its biggest businesses into three divisions as part of a major overhaul at the company.

The Wall Street firm will combine its investment-banking and trading businesses into one unit, and asset and wealth management will be merged into another, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. Marcus, Goldman's consumer-banking arm, will be part of the asset- and wealth-management unit.

A third unit will look over transaction banking and the bank's portfolio of financial-technology platforms.
