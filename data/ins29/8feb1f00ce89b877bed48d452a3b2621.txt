EA Sports launched its latest hockey video game, NHL 23, on Friday. In North Bay, the city partnered with a Mississauga e-sports gaming company called We Got Game and North Bay Battalion hockey players for a video game tournament at Memorial Gardens on Saturday. It was a chance for young gamers to pick up a controller and show what ‘they've got.' Focusing hard on the screen, hands frantically pushing buttons, was 10-year-old Hayden Comamnda crushing his opponent Jason from We Got Game; final score 7-2.
