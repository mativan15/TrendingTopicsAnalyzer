In his first leading feature role, Drew Ray Tanner ('Riverdale') will star in 'Boot Camp,' a film adaptation of the hugely popular Wattpad story by Gina Musa of the same name. The romantic comedy tells the body-empowerment story of notoriously unathletic Whitney Carmichael, played by Rachel Boudwin, who begins to fall for her off-limits personal trainer, Axel (Tanner), after signing up for an intense summer boot camp to reinvent herself. A deepening connection inspires her to let go of the others' expectations and, instead, find the strength to embrace her true self.
