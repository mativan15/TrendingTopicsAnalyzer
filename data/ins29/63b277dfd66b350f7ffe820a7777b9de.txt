The White House is in talks with billionaire Elon Musk about setting up SpaceX's satellite internet service in Iran, CNN reported Friday.
The news agency cited U.S. officials familiar with the talks who said the White House saw the internet service, called Starlink, as a potential way to allow Iranians to access the internet, circumventing government restrictions.
Iran's government severely curtailed internet access after protests erupted last month following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who was detained by the country's so-called morality police.
