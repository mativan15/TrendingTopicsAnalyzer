CAMDEN, N.J.–As James Harden heads into the 2022-23 season with the Philadelphia 76ers, he is ready for a fresh start. The Beard is ready to put the drama of the past behind him after tough endings in his previous two NBA spots.
Harden was traded by the Houston Rockets early in the 2020-21 season and then things went south quickly with the Brooklyn Nets in the 2021-22 season due to a lot of issues that he couldn't control.
Now, he is thankful for a fresh season with Philadelphia and he's looking to just play basketball and focus on the title opportunity the team has in front of them.
