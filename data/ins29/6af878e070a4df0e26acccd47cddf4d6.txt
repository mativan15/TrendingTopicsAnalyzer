A London flatshare isn't exactly the setting you'd associate with a typical rom-com. But somehow, the trailer for Paramount+'s The Flatshare makes a nightmarish living situation look... well, kinda romantic, tbh. Naturally, that doesn't exactly align with the painful reality of the hellscape that is London's rental scene.The six-part series is an adaptation of Beth O'Leary's 2019 bestselling novel of the same name. The series stars Jessica Brown Findlay (aka Lady Sybil from Downton Abbey) as Tiffany and Anthony Welsh as Leon — two flatmates who share a bed but haven't actually met.
