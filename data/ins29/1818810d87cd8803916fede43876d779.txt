Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares dipped on Friday as investment firm Piper Sandler downgraded the memory chip maker, citing its "oversized exposure" to consumer electronics. Analyst Harsh Kumar lowered his rating on Micron (MU) shares to underweight from neutral and slashed his per-share price target to $70 from $90, noting the company's exposure to mobile, PCs and "other consumer end-markets" are subject to weaker trends, while the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM market, of which the company gets 70% of its revenue from, has started to see price declines.
