Mikel Arteta has urged his Arsenal players to make short work of their Europa League group and earn some time off as they prepare to host PSV Eindhoven on Thursday.

Arsenal have won their opening three Group A fixtures and a victory over Ruud van Nistelrooy's Eredivisie outfit will see them qualify for the knockout stages and put them on the cusp of topping the group.

Winning the group is rewarded with a bye for the round of 32, something which could prove even more vital in a season where a winter World Cup has truncated the calendar.
