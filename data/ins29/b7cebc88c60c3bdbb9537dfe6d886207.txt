George Farmer, chief executive of Parler's parent company Parlement Technologies, said: 'This deal will change the world, and change the way the world thinks about free speech.
'Ye is making a groundbreaking move into the free speech media space and will never have to fear being removed from social media again. Once again, Ye proves that he is one step ahead of the legacy media narrative. Parlement will be honoured to help him achieve his goals.'
Mr West has been blocked from posting on Instagram and Twitter following a recent flurry of controversial posts.
