Tories must not return to ‘soap opera of Partygate' under Boris Johnson, warns Dominic RaabBoris Johnson's former deputy Dominic Raab has warned Conservative MPs that bringing the ex-PM back into No 10 would risk another episode of Partygate – which he likened to 'Groundhog Day' and a 'soap opera'.Claiming to believe that Mr Johnson can eventually 'make a return to frontline politics', Mr Raab said: 'I just can't see in practice how a new prime minister ... could give the country the attention, the focus, that it needs' while also giving testimony to the Commons privileges committee inquiry over Partygate.
