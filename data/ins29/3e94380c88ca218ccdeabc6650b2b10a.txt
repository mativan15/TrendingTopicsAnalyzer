The looming global food crisis that could result from skyrocketing food prices was enabled by a series of policy mistakes by Washington and Brussels in recent years, Maksim Oreshkin told RT.The conflict in Ukraine alone could not have caused the crisis on such a massive scale, Oreshkin, the economic adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Thursday.The international food price index calculated by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization shows that between April 2020 and April 2022, global food prices rose by more than 60%, or 60 index points.
