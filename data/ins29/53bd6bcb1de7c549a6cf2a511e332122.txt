Rep. Chris Jacobs is dropping his reelection bid after coming under fire from fellow Republicans for backing a ban on assault weapons.  The New York Republican said his newfound views on gun control would make a re-election bid difficult and divisive.  'The last thing we need is an incredibly negative, half-truth-filled media attack, funded by millions of dollars in special interest money coming into our community around this issue of guns and gun violence and gun control,' he said in announcing his withdrawal from the race.
