News Corp shares got a late Friday boost from plans to potentially rejoin Fox Corp under a new media company lead by Rupert Murdoch.

News Corp (NWSA) - Get News Corporation Report shares are set for an active session Monday following an update from billionaire Rupert Murdoch that suggested he could re-combine his print media division with Fox Corp (FOXA) - Get Fox Corporation Report nearly a decade after he chose to separate them.

Murdoch, 91, who along with his son Lachlan has effective control over Fox, said via a company statement that the two media group have formed ‘special committees' to 'thoroughly evaluate a potential combination', but said no deal could be assumed and provided no time frame for a decision.
