China's Supreme People's Court has issued an opinion calling for massive adoption of blockchain across China's judiciary, financial sector, and government, and for the technology to underpin intellectual property in the nation.
Published last week, the opinion reveals that the Court has already recorded 2.2 billion items on a judicial blockchain. The Court now suggests 32 more initiatives, most of which concern using blockchain to enhance efficiency of, and trust in, the nation's judiciary.
But the recommendations also go far wider, calling for the creation of 'an interoperation collaborative mechanism with blockchain platforms'.
