Carol Vorderman was glowing as she spoke about the ‘massive' reaction she's had from women after detailing her ‘freer' love life.
The Countdown legend has said she ‘wasn't looking for The One' and instead had ‘special friends' following two divorces.
The 61-year-old was previously married to Christopher Mather and to Patrick King, breaking up with him in 2000 after 10 years together.
Earlier this month on This Morning, Carol discussed her approach to romance after answering a caller's concerns about casual dating, saying it was a ‘nonsense taboo that should be broken.
