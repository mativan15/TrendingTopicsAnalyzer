BERLIN: Pure Battery Technologies (PBT) has secured at least 1 million euros ($1.1 million) from an EU-backed fund to expand a refinery in Germany, the Australian start-up said on Wednesday.PBT has patented a method to filter out the nickel and cobalt required to make battery cathodes which emits 70% less carbon dioxide than the standard method, according to a McKinsey study.PBT is in talks with chemicals giants including Umicore and BASF about incorporating the technology into their production processes and selling material to them to produce cathodes, PBT CEO Bjoern Zikarsky said in an interview with Reuters.
