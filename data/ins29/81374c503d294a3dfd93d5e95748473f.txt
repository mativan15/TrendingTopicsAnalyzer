A British man wanted in Denmark over a £1.3bn tax case has been arrested in Dubai and now faces extradition.The arrest of hedge fund trader Sanjay Shah, in one of Denmark's largest-ever fraud cases, comes after the country signed an agreement in March allowing for extradition there from the United Arab Emirates.
The 52-year-old has maintained his innocence in interviews with journalists while living in Dubai over recent years on the city-state's manmade Palm Jumeirah archipelago, but never appeared in Denmark to face the claims.
