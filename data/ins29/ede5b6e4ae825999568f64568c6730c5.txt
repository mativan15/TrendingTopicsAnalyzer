The Houston Astros have announced who will take the mound this weekend at Yankee Stadium.

Christian Javier will start Game 3 against the New York Yankees on Saturday, while Lance McCullers Jr. is slated to get the call Sunday in Game 4. Games 3 and 4 are set to begin at 4:07 and 6:07 p.m. CT, respectively, with TBS carrying the broadcast.

McCullers started Game 3 of the ALDS against the Seattle Mariners, allowing two hits with seven strikeouts in six shutout innings. However, Astros manager Dusty Baker stated Friday that McCullers "had a mishap" that played a part in his start getting pushed back to Game 4.
