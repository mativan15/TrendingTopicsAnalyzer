I've been shining it into the sky all night, but Batman still hasn't turned up. Don't tell me that — no — he's actually...Yes. Batman is dead, or at least he is in Gotham Knights. That means it's down to his gang of sidekids to apprehend the bad guys: Robin (aka Tim Drake), Nightwing (Dick Grayson, a former Robin), Red Hood (Jason Todd, another former Robin), and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon, daughter of former police commissioner Jim, who's also dead).
