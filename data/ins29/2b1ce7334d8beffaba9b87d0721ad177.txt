Donald Trump acknowledged in 2019 that letters he wrote to Kim Jong-un and later took with him upon leaving the White House were secret, according to recordings of an interview he gave to journalist Bob Woodward that call into question the credibility of one of Trump's main defenses in the investigation into his unauthorized retention of government files.In December of that year, Trump shared with Woodward the letters that Kim had written to him, saying, 'Nobody else has them, but I want you to treat them with respect … and don't say I gave them to you, OK?' according to recordings obtained by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday.
