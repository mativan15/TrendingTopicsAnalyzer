Now is a good time to shop for a high-end media streamer. Amazon is once again selling the latest Apple TV 4K at a record-low price of $150 for the 32GB model, or $29 off. However, the 64GB model is also on sale for $170 — an easy choice if you need extra storage for apps and games. We've seen Amazon sell the base model at this price on occasion, but rarely with a similar discount for its higher-end counterpart.
