Thomas Frank insisted he has 'unfinished business' at Brentford after being linked with the managerial vacancy at Sunday's opponents Aston Villa.Thursday's 3-0 loss to Fulham proved the final straw for Steven Gerrard, who was sacked by Villa before the team bus even left Craven Cottage, with his side languishing in 17th place with only nine points from 11 games.Frank was quickly named as a potential replacement but the 49-year-old Dane played down the link in his press conference on Friday.'I understand the bookmakers, I'm a good manager,' he said with a smile.
