The fairytale return would have seen Duhan van der Merwe scoring the first Edinburgh try. That didn't happen, but it was the Scotland and Lions winger's honour to collect the fourth, bring up the bonus point and put the result beyond doubt. Edgy Edinburgh had struggled to get into their stride against the wind in the early part of the game, but by the time Van der Merwe crashed through they were coasting and confident and bringing their three-game losing streak to an emphatic conclusion.Benetton, who had won three of their first four games this season, looked tidy for 20 minutes, but fell apart in the middle part of the game.
