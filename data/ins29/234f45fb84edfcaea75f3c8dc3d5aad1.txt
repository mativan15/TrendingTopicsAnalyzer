jetcityimage 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) has been experiencing business stagnation over the better part of the past decade or so, with revenues virtually unchanged from around $30 billion from 2012 through 2020. Their profit margins have also been decreasing due to general inflation and the costs of raw materials, higher SG&A expenses and other expenses. At the same time, they took on more long-term debt to make up for various expansion and diversification efforts, which in turn increased the amount of interest expense they pay each year.
