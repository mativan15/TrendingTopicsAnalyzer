Cobain and Love were married from 1992 until his death. Frances, who was just under two years old at the time, inherited 37 per cent of her late father's estate in December 2009.
In 2019, the visual artist told People magazine that she feels 'guilt' over inheriting the money, reportedly more than $95,000 (£85,000) a month, because she 'didn't earn it'.
'It's almost like this big, giant loan that I'll never get rid of,' she explained during an episode of the RuPaul: What's The Tee? Podcast.
'I have an almost foreign relationship to it or guilt because it feels like money from somebody that I've never met, let alone earned myself.
