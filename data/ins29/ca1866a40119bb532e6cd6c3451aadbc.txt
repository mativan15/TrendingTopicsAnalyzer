Opposition parties in Assam have demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into an alleged PPE-kit supply scam during the Covid-19 pandemic by companies linked to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's wife, Riniki Bhuyan Sarma.
On Thursday, the Congress, Raijor Dal and Assam Jatiya Parishad sought a probe by the central agency into the irregularities in pandemic supplies — including hand sanitisers and PPE kits — in 2020 when Sarma was the state's health minister.

The demands were based on two reports published by Delhi-based news website The Wire, in collaboration with Guwahati-based portal The Cross Current, which had alleged that emergency medical supply orders during the pandemic were given to firms owned by Bhuyan (Sarma's wife), and the family's 'close' business associates, without following a proper tender process.
