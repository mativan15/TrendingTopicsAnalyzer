Nagpur: During Diwali season last year, Maharashtra faced major power crisis leading to outages and power being purchased from open sources even at higher rates to plug the gap. This crisis happened due to low coal stocks at thermal power plants of state-run generation company — Mahagenco. This year, coal stock with Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) — the main source of supply to Mahagenco — is worse than 2021. So far, there is no crisis on power supply front. However, sources say, if the rains continue during the month, it may further reduce the supply of coal from WCL which is likely to affect the power plants.
