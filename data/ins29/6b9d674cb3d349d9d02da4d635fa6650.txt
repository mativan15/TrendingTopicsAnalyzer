Alberta's outgoing premier offered no regrets or apologies Tuesday as he stood for questions for the first time since announcing his resignation. Jason Kenney shocked many on May 18 when he quit as leader of the United Conservative Party after receiving a slight majority in his leadership review. Kenney later clarified that he intends to stay on until his successor is chosen. He was asked Tuesday if he would have done things differently, and immediately launched into an answer focused on COVID-19 fury.
