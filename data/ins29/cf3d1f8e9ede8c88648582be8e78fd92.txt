Elgin's Gail Borden Public Library District has a trick-or-treat bag full of spook-tacular events planned as the days tick down to Halloween.

On Friday night, the new Pirate Island exhibit will be the scene of a after-hours party featuring scary — but not too scary — activities set up around the centerpiece galleon ship, including pirate games, crafts, contests, giveaways and a chance to win a LEGO pirate ship.

It's scheduled for 6 to 8 p.m. at the main library at 270 N. Grove Ave. in downtown Elgin.
