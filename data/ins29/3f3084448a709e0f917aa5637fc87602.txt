Commanders dealing with laundry list of injuries entering Week 7 originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington

The Washington Commanders, once again, will be down multiple starters for Sunday's tilt against the Green Bay Packers, as injuries continue to pile up.

Tight end Logan Thomas (calf) and cornerback William Jackson III (back) were ruled out for Sunday's game after not practicing all week. Two depth players -- WR Dyami Brown and RB Jonathan Williams -- were both deemed out, too.
