Eva's sculpted figure was on full display in the asymmetric dress which was held up by a thin strap over one shoulder. The petite star elevated her height with a pair of sparkly black heels and accessorized with some silver earrings. Eva kept her hair off her face in a ponytail and sported smokey eye-makeup with a nude lip for the evening.
