Herschel Walker was called out on Friday for pulling out a "prop" police badge during his Georgia Senate Debate with Dem. Raphael Warnock.

The retired NFL player, 60, who won the Georgia Republican Senate primary in May, was responding to his opponent calling out several past instances in which Walker has lied about working in law enforcement.
