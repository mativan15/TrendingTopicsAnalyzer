American businesses are increasingly emphasizing transgender activism in Pride Month initiatives ranging from drag queen brunches to books that invite young children to question their biological sex. Pride Month, an annual commemoration of the 1968 Stonewall riots that the gay community organized in New York City's Greenwich Village, traditionally focused on gay marriage. But since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage 10 years ago, corporate America and liberal activists have gradually emphasized the right of children to transition from their birth sex into other gender identities.
