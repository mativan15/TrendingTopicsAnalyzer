Good afternoon, Chicago.

A recent motion by attorneys for R. Kelly's former business manager has lifted the curtain on secretive grand jury proceedings that led to the bombshell indictment. The transcripts were public for several hours Tuesday before prosecutors asked the court clerk to seal them.

While grand jury proceedings sometimes come out in open court in snippets of transcripts to buttress other testimony or impeach a witness on the stand, the filings in the R. Kelly case offered a rare glimpse of how prosecutors go about securing an indictment in a high-profile case.
