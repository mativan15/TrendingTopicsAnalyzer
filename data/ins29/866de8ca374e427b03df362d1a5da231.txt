New Delhi: BJP's election funds in 2020-21 was down from ₹3,623 crore to ₹752 crore. This is the first time since 2013-14 that BJP saw decrease in donations and also the first time since 2015-16 that its annual revenue fell below ₹1,000 crore. However, neither has the principal opposition party gained in the process as the funding decline is probably linked to the lockdown and pandemic, which hit the overall economy in 2020-21. The fall in revenue is most conspicuous in the contentious electoral bonds and stark in case of BJP.
