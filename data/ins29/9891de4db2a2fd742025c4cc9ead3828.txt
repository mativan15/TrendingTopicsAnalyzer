After crashing into the Andes mountains, the survivors of flight 571 of the Uruguayan Airforce might have starved to death, if they wouldn't resort to eating human flesh, recalls Ramon Sabella, 70. The fateful 16 survivors met to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crash on October 13 and recalled what they had to undergo to stay alive. 
A book by Piers Paul Read, 'The Story of Andes Survivors', was also made later into a Hollywood film in 1993. The flight was chartered to take the amateur rugby football team from Montevideo to Santiago in Chile.
