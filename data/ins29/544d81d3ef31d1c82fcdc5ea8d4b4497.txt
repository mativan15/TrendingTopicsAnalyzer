group firm Nxtdigital and Thaicom have signed a memorandum of understanding to form a strategic partnership to enter the broadband-over-satellite market and related services in India. The agreement envisages a partnership that includes deployment of broadband-over-satellite (BoS) systems on India-focused capacity. The BoS systems could be enhanced to provide additional capacity on a software-defined high throughput satellite, augmenting the existing IPSTAR-1 -- the first broadband satellite in the world which has been operational over India for the past several years.
