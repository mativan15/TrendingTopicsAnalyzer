NEW YORK (PRWEB) June 01, 2022 Women We Admire is pleased to announce The Top 50 Women Leaders of Utah for 2022. These individuals are honored for their dedication and efforts in industries including education, healthcare, technology, financial services and more. In this state, women were enfranchised 50 years before most American women and were the first women in America to vote under an equal suffrage law. This year's awardees follow in the footsteps of those Utah women who came before them, leading fields that are often largely male-dominated.
