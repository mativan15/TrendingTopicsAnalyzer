Shell's SHEL chief executive Ben van Beurden recently told a Dutch parliamentary panel examining natural gas production complications at the Groningen gas field that the London-based energy supermajor should have pulled out of the project much earlier, per a Reuters report.

Located in the Groningen province in the northeastern part of the Netherlands, the field was discovered in 1959 and run by Shell and ExxonMobil's XOM joint venture NAM. However, the field's output was cut back sharply more than a decade ago after the earthquakes in the area, which happened in the late 1980s, were officially linked to gas extraction from the supergiant gas field.
