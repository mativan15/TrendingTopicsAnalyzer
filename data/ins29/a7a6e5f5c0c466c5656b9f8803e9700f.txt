A Georgia judge denied bond Thursday evening for Atlanta rapper Young Thug, who's accused of conspiracy to violate Georgia's RICO Act and participation in a criminal street gang.

Fulton County Judge Ural Glanville handed down the ruling saying he has significant concerns about the entertainer, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, being a danger to the community, news outlets reported.
