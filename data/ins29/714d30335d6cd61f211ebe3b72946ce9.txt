Doodle helps small and large-sized enterprises create a smooth workflow. It makes it easy for you to schedule group and one-on-one appointments. You can set up meeting requests and customize them, allowing people to vote on the most convenient time to meet. Doodle further helps you with reminding invitees about scheduled meetings.
To make your work, e.g., board meetings and recruitment processes, easy, Doodle integrates calendars and conferencing tools that prevent conflicting calendars and allow you to have direct meetings with invitees.
