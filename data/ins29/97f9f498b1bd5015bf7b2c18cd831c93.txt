Winning a Heisman Trophy puts an athlete in a very, very exclusive club. Not only that, but it punches your ticket to the 'Heisman House' commercials, so there's that too.
Ohio State has a long history of Heisman Trophies won, tied for the most of any program with Notre Dame and Oklahoma with seven each. Sorry USC, Reggie Bush took the Trojans' total down to six after he was stripped of his.

This year the Buckeyes have another Heisman hopeful in quarterback C.J. Stroud. He was one of the frontrunners for the bronze statue in the preseason and nothing has happened to change that really aside from Tennessee's Hendon Hooker coming on strong.
