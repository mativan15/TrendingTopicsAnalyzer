With the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track Friday to snap the longest losing streak of weekly losses in nearly a century, data from a handful of sources show that investors around the world have been piling back into stocks, prompting the first net inflows into global equities in 10 weeks. Investors dumped $20.6 billion into global equity funds during the week of May 25, according to Bank of America's weekly 'Flow Show' report, which uses fund flows data from Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, along with the megabank's own data.
