By Kara ScannellCNN — Disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing nearly $300,000 from his former client, adult film actress Stormy Daniels.
District Judge Jesse Furman said Avenatti's conduct was "so brazen and egregious" adding he "took advantage of a vulnerable victim given her unorthodox career and somewhat unorthodox beliefs."
Avenatti was convicted in February of one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. He faced as much as 20 years on the wire fraud charge and a mandatory two-year sentence for aggravated identity theft.
