George Osborne, who campaigned to remain in the EU, sought to tie the current crisis engulfing Prime Minister Liz Truss to the Brexit referendum in 2016. He told Andrew Neil on Channel 4 that the country's position in the eyes of the "international community" has been sliding ever since Brexit. He claimed the governing Conservative Party was ignoring "the fundamental deterioration in the UK's economic position in the world".Speaking to Mr Neil, Mr Osborne said that politics "has been a mess" since the referendum and claimed the rest of the world was viewing the current crisis through the eyes of Brexit.
