Retailers are warning of fragile confidence among shoppers after figures revealed visitor numbers to UK high streets, shopping centres and retail parks last month remained 12.5% down on pre-pandemic levels.The shift to working from home and concerns about the cost of living continue to hold back trade, with visits to shopping centres down by more than a quarter on 2019 while high streets had 14% fewer visitors.Scotland, Wales, north-east England and London fared far worse than the east Midlands and north-west England, according to the latest British Retail Consortium (BRC) footfall monitor conducted in partnership with shopper monitoring operator Sensormatic Solutions.
