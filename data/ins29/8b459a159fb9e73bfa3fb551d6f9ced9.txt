anouchkaJust over three months ago, I wrote on Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), noting that while the weaker margins would contribute to much lower earnings in FY2022, the stock would become interesting below $16.30 per share near support. However, I did not expect the stock to release an even more disappointing report in Q2, with revenue down 5% year-over-year and quarterly earnings per share moving deeply into negative territory with a net loss of $0.30. Given this more challenging outlook, I have reversed my previous outlook, with a much lower share price needed to bake in an adequate margin of safety.
