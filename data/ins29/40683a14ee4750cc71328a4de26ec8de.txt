A new hire impacted by Coinbase's decision to rescind some job offers this week and freeze hiring said he was blindsided by the move.
'I was fired even before I started with the company,' the worker, whose identity was not revealed, told Business Insider.
Coinbase cited 'current market conditions and ongoing business prioritization efforts' in a companywide memo detailing its decision to pull some job offers. 
The announcement came just two weeks after the embattled cryptocurrency trading firm confirmed a slowdown in hiring during a steep downturn in the market.
