Kajol Tihile (24) from Murtizapur village in Akola district is the first from her family to work in Mumbai Metro and that too in the maintenance division, which is usually dominated by male workers.
Daughter of a farmer, Kajol takes pride in her job, which involves inspecting the rolling stock. Carrying a heavy backpack of tools, she goes below Metro rakes and inspects each part meticulously — work which is physically grueling.
'I'm now a certified professional to do this job,' said Kajol, who trained in a Metro car shed in Hyderabad for almost three months and thereafter was again trained by the Maha Mumbai Metro Rail Operations Corporations (MMMOCL).
