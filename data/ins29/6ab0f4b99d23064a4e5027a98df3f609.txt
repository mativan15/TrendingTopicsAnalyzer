Browns defensive end Myles Garrett aggravated a shoulder injury in last Sunday's loss to the Patriots and the injury kept him out of practice on Wednesday.

Garrett originally hurt the shoulder in a car accident late last month and missed Week Four as a result of the injury. He returned the next week and had two sacks last Sunday despite getting hurt again.

X-rays on Garrett's shoulder were negative, which provided hope that he'll play against the Ravens.
