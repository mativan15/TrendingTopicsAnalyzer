Liz Truss's government went 'too far, too fast' with its mini-Budget, the new chancellor said after he was drafted into the role to steady the markets.The prime minister yesterday sacked her now former Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng and reversed sweeping tax cuts after weeks of financial turmoil.In a statement released late on Saturday, chancellor Jeremy Hunt said his focus was 'on growth underpinned by stability.''The drive on growing the economy is right - it means more people can get good jobs, new businesses can thrive and we can secure world class public services.
