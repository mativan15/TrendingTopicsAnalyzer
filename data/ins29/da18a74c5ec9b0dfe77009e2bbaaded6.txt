ROME (Reuters) - Italy's President Sergio Mattarella has summoned rightist leader Giorgia Meloni for talks later on Friday - a move widely expected to lead to her being given a mandate to form a new government.

Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party won a Sept. 25 general election as part of a coalition including Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's League, is expected at the Quirinale palace at 1430 GMT, Mattarella's office said in a statement.
