LET'S have a moment's silence, please. Today we mourn the loss of two of Audi's greatest creations.
The Audi R8 supercar and the Audi TT sports car. Two absolute giggle machines.

Both will be killed off by the end of 2023. Why?
Because there is no business case for them anymore. Mixing petrol and air is dead. Horsepower is dead. 
The future is electric and kilowatts and plug sockets.
Thankfully, between now and then Audi will give us one last hardcore R8 GT.
