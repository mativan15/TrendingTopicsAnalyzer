KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Harrison Butker has struck again. The Kansas Chiefs kicker marked his return after missing four games with a franchise-record 62-yard field goal as the clock expired on the first half of the showdown against the Buffalo Bills.

Yet the booming kick at Arrowhead Stadium, which knotted the game at 10-10, had to be even more stunning to the Bills when considering the déjà vu elements of the circumstances. Butker's kick capped a three-play, 28-yard drive that took just 12 seconds.

Remember, Butker nailed a 49-yard field goal as the fourth-quarter clock expired that sent the AFC divisional playoff game to overtime last January – capping a drive that consumed all of 13 seconds.
