The New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals are off to 2-4 starts to the year and will look to begin the march back to .500 tonight in Arizona on Thursday Night Football. The Saints have yet to announce who will be behind center, the injured Jameis Winston or backup Andy Dalton, who has started the last three games. No matter who starts, they'll have Chris Olave back in the lineup; the impressive rookie receiver was out last week with an injury. For the Cardinals, quarterback Kyler Murray gets his favorite target back, DeAndre Hopkins, who was suspended the first six weeks of the season after a failed PED test.
