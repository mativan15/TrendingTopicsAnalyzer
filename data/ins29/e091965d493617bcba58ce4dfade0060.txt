Albert Sambi Lokonga has admitted life at Arsenal has been "difficult" and that he "almost snapped" last season after finding opportunities hard to come by.The Gunners have won nine of their first 10 games of the season to set the pace at the top of the Premier League table, but Lokonga is struggling to contribute with Mikel Arteta having settled on Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey as his first-choice midfield pairing.Lokonga has started just two league games this season, including Arsenal's only loss, but insists he is happy at the Gunners after accepting his role over the summer.
