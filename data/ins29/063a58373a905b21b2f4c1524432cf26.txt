Investors finally got the week they had hoped to see, producing a sizable rebound from last week's stock market lows. There's still plenty of uncertainty in the economy, but investors are starting to think that the Federal Reserve might not be as aggressive as feared in fighting inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 1.76%), S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.47%), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 3.33%) were all up substantially on the week, including big gains on Friday.
