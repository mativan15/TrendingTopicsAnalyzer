ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - Bids to buy the massive Romanesque cathedral that has loomed over downtown St. John's for over 150 years close today.The Basilica of St John the Baptist must be sold because the Roman Catholic archdiocese needs the money to pay survivors of physical and sexual abuse endured by boys at the former Mount Cashel Orphanage.Newfoundland English professor and historian Shane O'Dea says the idea of the church selling the basilica is 'absolutely inconceivable' and a disgrace, but he adds the disgrace is what predatory priests did to the boys at the orphanage.
