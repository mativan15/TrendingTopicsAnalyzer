tortoon/iStock via Getty Images Pacira BioSciences (NASDAQ:PCRX) has made decent progress over the last few years. Exparel has continued to grow despite the negative impact of the pandemic on surgery volumes and other near-term headwinds, and the company has acquired Flexion Therapeutics to get Zilretta and expand its presence in the chronic pain market. The valuation is not too demanding, and I believe Pacira has the potential to be a decent compounder in the next few years. Exparel continues to grow but at a slower pace Exparel sales continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
