Online fashion retailer Missguided has collapsed into administration after failing to secure a last-minute buyer.

The company, which rose in popularity after securing a partnership with reality TV show Love Island, called in administrators from Teneo Financial Advisory after it was issued with a winding-up petition from its suppliers.
