The University of Georgia has one quarterback on an NFL roster and that's 2009 No. 1 overall pick Matthew Stafford. That was until Tuesday when reports surfaced that former Bulldog starter Jake Fromm would be returning to the NFL as a member of the Washington Commander practice squad.

Fromm started for three years in Athens, leading Georgia as a true freshman to a Rose Bowl win and a national title game appearance. After declaring for the 2020 NFL Draft, Fromm was selected in the 5th round by the Buffalo Bills were he spent the first season as the COVID quarterback, being isolated from the remainder of the roster as a keepsake.
