Foreign Minister Penny Wong has apologised to the Jewish community for the way the federal government revealed its decision to no longer recognise West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying the timing of the announcement was 'deeply regrettable'.

The opposition urged Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to call his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid to apologise for the way the decision was handled.

In an opinion article for The Australian Jewish News, Wong said she understood there were 'few issues more central for many Jewish people than the status of Jerusalem'.
