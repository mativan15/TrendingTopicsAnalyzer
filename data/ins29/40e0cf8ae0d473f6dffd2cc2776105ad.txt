The new commander of Russian forces in Ukraine has said the situation in the Kherson region has become 'very difficult' as Ukrainian forces push ahead with an offensive to take back southern and eastern areas of the country, and that Moscow was preparing to evacuate civilians weeks after annexing the area.
Sergei Surovikin, a Russian air force general appointed on October 10 to lead the invasion, said the situation in Kherson was 'very difficult' for both civilians and Russian soldiers.
'The Russian army will above all ensure the safe evacuation of the population' of Kherson, Surovikin told state television Rossiya 24.
