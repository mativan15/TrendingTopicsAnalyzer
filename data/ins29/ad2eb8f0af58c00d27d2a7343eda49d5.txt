This is the kind of food that makes the whole household rejoice. Packed with flavour, they come together very quickly and are the kind of thing you can eat with your hands. Cook the quesadillas on the stovetop rather than under the grill if you like. If you have a griddle pan, the look of the charred stripes on top is fun. Use any kind of tortilla you like, and swap the beef out for chicken if that's more to your tastes (you can ditch the extra salt then, too).
