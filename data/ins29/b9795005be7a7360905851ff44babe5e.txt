Bhimal (Grewia oppositifolia) is the most important agroforestry tree species used for fodder, fuel and fiber in the Himalayan region. In the present study, G. oppositifolia-based traditional agroforestry systems were selected for the estimation of carbon stock and the production potential of barnyard millet (Echinochloa frumentacea) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana), with two elevational ranges, i.e., 1000–1400 and 1400–1800 m amsl, in Garhwal Himalaya, India. The results of the investigation showed a decline in the growth and yield attributes of both the millet crops under the G.
