Warning: spoilers ahead for episode 7 of Andor.
Last week's mission to rob an Imperial garrison might have (mostly) been a success… but Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) is far from in the clear, as enemies circle from all directions.
In episode 7 of Star Wars series Andor on Disney Plus, the aftermath of the Aldhani heist is reverberating around the galaxy, impacting the lives of people including Cassian's adoptive mother Maarva (Fiona Shaw), the mission's leader Vel (Faye Marsay), Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) and Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgard), who put Cassian up to the job in the first place.
