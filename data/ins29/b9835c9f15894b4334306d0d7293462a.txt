Despite more government supports being announced Wednesday for those who lost income after post-tropical storm Fiona, some businesses and workers on the Island say they're being overlooked.The 5th Wave Espresso & Tea Bar in Charlottetown just opened about eight months ago, and now co-owner Laura Noel said they're trying to figure out how to make up for losses suffered after Fiona because they don't qualify for the province's wage rebate programs — something she said is "discouraging.""The government support is lacking a little bit," said Noel.
