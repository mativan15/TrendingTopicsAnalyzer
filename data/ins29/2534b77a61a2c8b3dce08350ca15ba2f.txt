Jun. 4—People needing wheelchairs, walkers, canes or crutches can find good, used items through Muskogee's Spare Parts program.

"We're called Spare Parts because we take almost anything and reuse, recycle, rebuild," said Cindy McAdoo, who oversees the program.

Spare Parts began about 20 years ago as part of Muskogee Cooperative Ministries. McAdoo said she has been with it for about 10 years.

"The idea was that a lot of churches had a lot of equipment, like walkers or wheelchairs, we wanted to centralize all that stuff," she said.
