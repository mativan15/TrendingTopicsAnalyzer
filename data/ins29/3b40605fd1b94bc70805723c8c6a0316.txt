Every investor in Close the Loop Ltd (ASX:CLG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

Close the Loop is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of AU$160m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors.
