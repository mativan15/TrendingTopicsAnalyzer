Experts have warned that there is no real 'fat' for new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to cut as he seeks savings ahead of the fiscal plan later this month.The new Chancellor, who stepped into the role after Kwasi Kwarteng wa forced out on Friday after weeks of chaos following his mini-budget, has made little secret of the fact that taxes could rise and spending cuts may be called for to restore market confidence in the UK.But he steps into the role amid fresh warnings about a 'lost decade' for public services.
