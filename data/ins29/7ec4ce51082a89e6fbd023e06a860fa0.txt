A popular Venezuelan and Latin fusion food truck is expanding its footprint in Prospect, Kentucky.

Alchemy is moving into the space at 10640 Meeting St. in Norton Commons that was previously occupied by Mercato Italiano, which closed permanently in August.

Alchemy co-owner Nelson Michelangeli said he expects the new restaurant to be open by Nov. 16. The more than 3,200-square-foot property is owned by Meeting Street Investments LLC, according to Jefferson County Public Valuation Administrator records.
