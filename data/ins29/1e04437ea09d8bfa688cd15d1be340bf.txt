June 1 (Reuters) - Five Russian airlines have returned more than two dozen leased airplanes to foreign lessors, a document seen by Reuters showed, even though Moscow has passed a law allowing the seizure of hundreds of jets as part a response to Western sanctions.The sanctions barred Russia from receiving planes, parts and maintenance and aircraft leasing companies asked Moscow to return jets under lease, a move that threatened to halt air transportation across Russia.To protect domestic flights, Russia seized hundreds of planes owned by foreign leasing companies, putting them on the country's aircraft register.
