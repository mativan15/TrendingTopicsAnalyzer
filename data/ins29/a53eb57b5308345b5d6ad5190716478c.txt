Mounties on Vancouver Island are looking for a woman they believe is responsible for at least six armed robberies in recent weeks in Duncan, B.C. Five of the robberies were at gas stations and one was at an Indian restaurant. All of them involved a woman brandishing a knife and demanding cash. "We urge business owners and staff, especially of gas stations, to be vigilant and take extra precautions as the suspect remains at large," said RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Alex Bérubé in a statement Thursday. The first incident occurred on May 14, when a woman entered the Canco gas station brandishing a kitchen knife and demanding money and cigarettes.
