It's the first defeat for the Bruins in the Jim Montgomery era.

The Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators filled the highlight reel with 12 combined goals Tuesday night. But neither team will want to relive the plethora of defensive miscues and shaky goaltending in their respective film sessions.

Fresh off of a statement win over the Florida Panthers, the Bruins became suspect to lax defensive coverage against a young and improved Sens bunch.

Jeremy Swayman hardly looked sharp in one of the worst outings of his young career, stopping 19 of 25 shots in 40 minutes of work.
