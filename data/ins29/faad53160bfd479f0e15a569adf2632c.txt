Sacramento Kings head coach Mike Brown on Monday said that rookie Keegan Murray is still in the NBA's health and safety protocol ahead of the start of the regular season.

Murray missed the final two games of the preseason due to what the Kings called a non-COVID illness. He managed to practice with the team on Thursday but was eventually ruled out of playing in their finale on Friday after entering the protocol.

The team is evaluating Murray daily and will give him the time needed to recover. Brown would want him to participate in at least one practice before returning to game action, leaving his status for the season opener on Wednesday in question, via James Ham of ESPN 1320.
