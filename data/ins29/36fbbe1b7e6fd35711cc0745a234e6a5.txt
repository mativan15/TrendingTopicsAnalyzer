Following allegations against her co-star Bill Murray, American actor Keke Palmer has issued a statement regarding the cancellation of her film "Being Mortal". Searchlight Pictures put the movie's production on hold in April when Murray was charged with inappropriate behaviour. The movie, which marked Aziz Ansari's directing debut, is based on the 2014 book "Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End" by surgeon Atul Gawande. Along with Murray, Palmer, and Seth Rogen, Ansari was slated to co-star in the movie and write it as well.
