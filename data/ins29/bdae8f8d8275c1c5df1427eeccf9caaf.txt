(Bloomberg) -- With one daughter and another on the way, the Bentvelsens were in the market for a roomier set of wheels.Jerry, 34, grows cucumbers in Rotterdam and was familiar with China's largest electric-vehicle maker from the family business using its commercial trucks. Next week, he and his wife Jessica, 33, take delivery of a black BYD Tang, having been won over by a test drive in the seven-seat SUV that gets from zero to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 4.6 seconds.If there were any doubts left that the company known for landing a major investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has arrived on the world stage, the handover of keys to the Bentvelsens and BYD's other European customers during this week's Paris motor show put them to rest.
