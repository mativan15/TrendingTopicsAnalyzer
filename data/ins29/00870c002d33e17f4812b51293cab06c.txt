A Bellingham company looking to make a positive impact on the environment continues to grow after acquiring another firm.

Earlier this year Tidal Vision bought ViaeX Technologies Inc., a San Francisco Bay Area start-up that developed several technologies that help remove non-biodegradable and toxic materials. ViaeX's equipment was shipped to Tidal Vision's 52,000-square-foot facility in the Irongate Business Park, where it is currently being installed.

The new equipment will expand the company's laboratory area and Tidal Vision has hired three new lab employees to its workforce, which has around 40 people.
