The CBI's decision to quiz Sisodia follows the arrests of AAP's communication in-charge Vijay Nair and TRS founding member's son, Abhishek Boinpally. The Enforcement Directorate arrested another accused Sameer Mahendru in a related case. Last week, the CBI also questioned Amit Arora, director of Defence Colony-based Buddy Retail Private Limited and Gautam Mootha, managing director of Andhra Prabha publication and India Ahead news channel, in connection with the probe into the excise policy.
