Elon Musk says SpaceX will continue to financially support its Starlink terminals in Ukraine after all.

The SpaceX founder and high-profile tech entrepreneur sent a letter to the Pentagon in September asking the agency to take over funding for the satellite communication system, which the company donated to Ukraine earlier this year after Russia's invasion.

'The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,' Musk tweeted Saturday following a social-media backlash against his proposed halt to funding the service.
