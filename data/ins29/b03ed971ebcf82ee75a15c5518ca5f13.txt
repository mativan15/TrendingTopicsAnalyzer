Collider.com For a film seen as a classic, Universal's 1931 Dracula has a less than glowing critical reputation. Even among horror aficionados, the movie held up as the first true horror film in American cinema often gets a cold reception. A certain set of complaints has crystallized around it, typified in this review for Reel Views: all the mystery, terror, and value in Dracula is found in its opening third and the performance of Bela Lugosi. Once the action moves from Transylvania to London, the film becomes a stiff drawing room mystery.
