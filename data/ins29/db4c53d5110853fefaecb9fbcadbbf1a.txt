Russia's closest allies have doubled their imports of its oil since the war in Ukraine.Western nations have slashed their imports over concerns that oil sales were funding Vladimir Putin's invasion. In March, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said Britain would phase out oil imports from Russia by the end of the year.However, data compiled for The Sunday Times reveals the slack has been more than taken up by China, India and the UAE — countries with ties to Moscow.In May, China brought in 43 shipments of Russian oil, up from 36 in January — the last month before Russia invaded Ukraine.
