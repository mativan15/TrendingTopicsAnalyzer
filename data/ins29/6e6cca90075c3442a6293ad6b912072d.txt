Richard Williamson entered the Den in 2007 seeking £250,000 for eight percent of his company EDV. EDV is a video production service that turns home videos into biopics.Whilst in the Den, he told the Dragons that in the current year alone, EDV will have a £1.3million turnover with profitability of 11 percent after tax.He explained that he would use the investment given to move his office into something more equipped to handle all the editing needed, and for the IT set up.Peter Jones was not convinced with the pitch as he said he believed that the way technology is going, people can edit their own videos and create family memories themselves.
