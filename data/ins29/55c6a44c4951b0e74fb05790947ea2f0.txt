Glammed up in satin knickerbockers, sequins and platform boots, ABBA fans streamed into a concert hall in east London Friday for the opening night of "ABBA Voyage", the Swedish supergroup's digital avatar show.

Many had crossed continents and had bought tickets for multiple nights.

"I've been a fan since 1975," said one woman, Roxanne Dixon, who wore sparkly "A" and "B" earrings, a gold-trimmed white satin tunic and gold boots.

"I came from Australia just for this."

"We came all the way from America and it was worth it," said Caleb Graham, 33, from Florida, he and his partner wearing matching black ABBA T-shirts.
