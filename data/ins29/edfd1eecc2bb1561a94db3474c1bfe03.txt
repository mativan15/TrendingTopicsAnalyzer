Global digital payments giant, Visa, and East Africa's biggest telecom Safaricom, the operator of the M-Pesa mobile money product, have today launched a virtual card, enabling millions of M-Pesa users to make digital payments globally, and giving Visa extended reach across Africa.
The launch of the M-Pesa GlobalPay Visa virtual card follows a partnership between the two companies forged in 2020 to develop 'products that will support digital payments for M-Pesa customers.'
The virtual card will enable 30 million M-Pesa users to make cashless payments at Visa's global network of more than 100 million merchants spread across 200 countries.
