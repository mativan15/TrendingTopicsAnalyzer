As if Dodger fans didn't have enough to nauseate them during Saturday's playoff game against the San Diego Padres, the telecast featured an openly racist commercial blaming President Biden and other Democrats for illegal immigration.

Airing during the mid-fourth inning break of the game that eliminated the Dodgers from the post-season, the ad consisted of video images depicting a torrent of obviously Latino immigrants pouring over the border.

'This giant flood of illegal immigration is draining your paychecks, wrecking your schools, ruining your hospitals, threatening your family,' stated the overwrought narrator, over the obligatory ominous soundtrack.
