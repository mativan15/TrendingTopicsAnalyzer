In a crackdown on vehicles nearing the end of their shelf life, the Delhi government has deregistered more than 5.3 million vehicles between 2018 and 2022, of which a little over 5 million vehicles were delisted in 2022 alone, transport department officials said.Deregistration immobilises vehicles from a legal standpoint, and ensures that they cannot be lawfully used. 'Deregistered vehicles cannot be sold and the insurance of such vehicles cannot be purchased. Using such vehicles becomes illegal and they can be impounded,' said an official.
