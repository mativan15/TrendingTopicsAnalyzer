Information and Technology Minister Mano. Thangaraj on Friday said that the State would soon complete the task of digitisation of all records of the government.
Speaking to reporters after holding a review meeting on digitisation of records and files, he said that the State government embarked on the scheme in September 2022. Officials and staff members of various departments had been given training on handling the files in a digital format. In order to abolish paper-based files as much as possible, the designated officers had been working on digitalisation of all records.
