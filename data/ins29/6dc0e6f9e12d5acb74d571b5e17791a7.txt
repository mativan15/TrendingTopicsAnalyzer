Employees have found their voice and business leaders can't ignore them any more, said Bill George, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic CEO. The leadership guru says in his book 'True North: Emerging Leader Edition' that employees now want an organisation to allow them to have a fully-integrated life and it's not just about money any more. George talks to ET's Vinod Mahanta about the current thorny leadership issues: why leaders are responsible for the great resignation, why cult leaders like Zuckerberg are bad for business, lessons from the Rajat Gupta episode (they sat together on three boards, including Goldman Sachs) and leading during times of intersecting crises.
