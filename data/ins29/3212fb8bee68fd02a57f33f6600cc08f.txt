Tim Draper is a modern-day legend of Silicon Valley. He's a fourth-generation venture capitalist whose grandfather is credited with being one of America's first VC's. And, after decades on Sand Hill Road, Draper opened his own VC firm Draper Associates, down the road in San Mateo. A big fan of decentralizing everything, he recently set up Draper Decentralized, a platform for investors to network and access vetted deals.
