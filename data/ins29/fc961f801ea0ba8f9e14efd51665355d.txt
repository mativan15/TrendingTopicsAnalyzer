Republican lawmakers are gearing up to extend key parts of former President Trump's tax overhaul if they win control of Congress during the pivotal midterm elections. With inflation running near the highest level in 40 years, Democrats are widely expected to lose their razor-thin majority in the House and possibly the Senate too in November. Should the GOP regain control of both chambers of Congress, they have indicated that a top economic priority would be enshrining key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law.
