 Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI) on Friday said that its medicine Rolvedon was now commercial available.
Rolvedon (eflapegrastim-xnst) injection was approved in the U.S. in September to decrease the incidence of infection, manifested by febrile neutropenia, in adult patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs linked with febrile neutropenia.
Neutropenia occurs when the body has fewer neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.
