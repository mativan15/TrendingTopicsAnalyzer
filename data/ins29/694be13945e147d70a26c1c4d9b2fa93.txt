Asserting the significance of developing hill states and villages located on the border, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged all Indian tourists to set aside 5% of their travel budget to buy local products while visiting various places across the country. "This will give a big push to local products and will give immense satisfaction to you too," he said. Modi visited Uttarakhand on Friday to offer prayers at the Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines. During his visit, he laid the foundation stone for projects worth ₹3,400 crore that include ropeways from Gaurikund to Kedarnath and from Govindghat to Hemkund Sahib, the revered shrine of the Sikhs.
