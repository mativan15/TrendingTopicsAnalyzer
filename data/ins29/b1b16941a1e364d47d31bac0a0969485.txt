There are roughly 1,400 unicorns in the world — a term that, in this case, rather than referring to magical creatures, is used to describe private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion.

In the final quarter of 2022, however, the number of tech unicorns being created each quarter began trending downward after a pandemic period of rapid growth. High inflation and rising interest rates injected uncertainty into venture capital. Globally, only 37 new unicorns were formed in the most recent quarter, compared to 165 during the same period a year ago, according to data firm Crunchbase, which maintains a list of all the unicorns across the globe.
