By LOUIS BROMFIELDTHE publisher characterizes Pleasant Valley as 'an appealing and delightful account of this noted writer's happy experiences as an Ohio farmer.'It is an account of how an expatriated American, who had lived for many years in France, came back to the soil of his native Ohio to find in experimental farming the peace and security that he could not find in a world of depression, of social conflict, and of impending war. While there is a deal of writing here about farming, most of it nostalgic but some of more solid worth, the book is chiefly interesting as a reflection of the man Bromfield — of his social pessimism, his fears and forebodings in an industrial world, his retreat from being 'perpetually haunted by the terrible insecurity which a mechanized and industrial civilization imposes upon the individual.
