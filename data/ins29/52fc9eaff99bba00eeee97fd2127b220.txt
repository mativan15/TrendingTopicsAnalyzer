The European Union has agreed to block 90 per cent of Russian oil imports by 2023 - but only what's tankered by sea and not the product coming via pipelines.It's after protest from Hungary, which largely relies on Kremlin-backed land supply.Just over a quarter of the EU imported oil and 40 per cent of the bloc's gas is supplied by Russia, which is worth over £340 billion every year.Consumer groups are urging a crackdown on what's described as 'exploitative' and 'manipulative' loot boxes in video games.
