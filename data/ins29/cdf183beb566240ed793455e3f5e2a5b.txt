Since the introduction of a new top personal tax rate, Inland Revenue has recorded a boom in the number of lower-tax entities created by high earners, which could be used to reduce tax bills. The department (IR) warns efforts to dodge the new 39% tax by diverting income through companies (where they can be taxed at a maximum of 28%​) and trusts (which can be taxed at a maximum of 33%​) is likely to contribute to a $2.89 billion fall in revenues from high earners in the 2022 tax year. The department is likely to re-open consultation on law changes to cut off methods of using companies to dodge tax later this year, after submissions raised issues during an initial consultation that closed in late-April, and moves are intended to be taken to crack down on trusts next year.
