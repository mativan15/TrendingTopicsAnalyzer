Australia's policy towards Palestinian hopes for a capital in Jerusalem appeared to remain intact on Wednesday, a day after it reversed its recognition of western Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

'In December 2018, Australia acknowledged the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a future state with its capital in East Jerusalem,' the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website read after it announced that it was reversing its December 2018 policy change pertaining to Israel.
