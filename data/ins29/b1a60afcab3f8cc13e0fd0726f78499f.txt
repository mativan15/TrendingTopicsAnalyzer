A convicted murderer who has spent half a decade behind bars, many of them expressing contrition, moved one step closer to freedom on Monday when the state's Parole Board unanimously agreed to recommend reducing his convictions from first-degree murder to second-degree murder for the killing of two security guards during a botched robbery at a Dorchester store.The favorable 5-0 decision of the Advisory Board of Pardons, which the Parole Board serves as, could ultimately make Ramadan Shabazz, 72, eligible for parole after 51 years behind bars.
