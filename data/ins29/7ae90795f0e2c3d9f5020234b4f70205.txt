CINCINNATI — Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham was suspended by Major League Baseball for three games Saturday after he slapped San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson because of a dispute about their fantasy football league. The 34-year-old Pham also was fined. The suspension was made retroactive to Friday night, and he was to serve the final two games this weekend. While the Giants warmed up in the outfield before Friday's series opener, Pham confronted Pederson and smacked him in the face before the pair was separated.
