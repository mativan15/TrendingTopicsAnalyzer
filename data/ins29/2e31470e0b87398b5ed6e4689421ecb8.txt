Coolhaus, America's top women-led ice cream company. Gem Surprise Box, a STEM-focused gemstone and mineral subscription service. Okaya, a facial recognition mental health assessment tool for telehealth clinicians. These are just a few of the UCLA alumni-owned businesses picked for the inaugural 'Bruin Business 100' class. The business owners represent a diverse group of 100 businesses recognized not only for success, but for business models fostering positive social change. The Bruin Business 100 distinction, which will be awarded to a new class annually by the UCLA Alumni Association, is a new stewardship platform aiming to engage roughly 500,000 alumni around the world in uplifting and amplifying alumni-owned businesses.
