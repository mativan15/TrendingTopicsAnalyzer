After Elon Musk appeared ready to shut down Tesla's work-from-home policy this week, union organizers representing one of its major manufacturing plants have sounded a warning to the tech mogul.

'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,' wrote Musk in a leaked email shared by company shareholder Sam Nissim.

Though the email appears directed at the company's white-collar workers across the globe, IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union, opted to respond.
