Variety - Film News 'The Inspection' writer-director Elegance Bratton is living out a prayer.'I was in a homeless shelter on my way to joining the Marine Corps, give or take a few years. I didn't even necessarily understand exactly what I was praying for,' Bratton tells Variety, thinking back to 20 years ago.'I had gotten the job title Combat Camera, which was the first job title I ever had that sounded cool —most times it's like, I'm the shift supervisor at whatever — so I was just praying that this could mean something more,' he continues.
