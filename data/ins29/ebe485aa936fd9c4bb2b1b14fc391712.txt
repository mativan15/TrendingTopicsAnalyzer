The scale of the ambush of Liverpool and Real Madrid fans by local youths after the Champions League final in Paris is becoming increasingly and alarmingly apparent. 'After the game was worse,' said Chris Caulfield, a solicitor and a partner in an international law firm, who was attending his third Champions League final to watch Liverpool.Caulfield had tickets in the Liverpool end with his friend, Nicholas Cranfield, also a solicitor and general counsel for an international resort business. 'We headed quickly for the Metro on the final whistle only to be immediately taunted, jostled and grabbed at by large gangs of local youths on the route between the stadium and the Metro,' Caulfield said.
