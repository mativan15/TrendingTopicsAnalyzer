Hoping to save on any purchases during the month of June? It's a good time. The first weekend of the month, Walmart is hosting a brand new sale to promote its Walmart+ subscription service called Walmart+ Weekend. The sale, which runs June 2-5, is for Walmart+ members only, but you can try the Amazon Prime-like service for free for 30 days, and you'll still be able to access the retailer's exclusive deals.
