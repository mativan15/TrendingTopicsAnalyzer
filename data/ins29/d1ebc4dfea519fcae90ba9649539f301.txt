Holograms aren't just for dead celebrities anymore. In fact, it might not be long before you're attending a virtual work meeting with lifelike, 3D representations of your colleagues. That's the future Google is working toward: The company says it's expanding testing of its Project Starline, 3D video call booths where you can chat with holographic versions of your friends, family or coworkers. After testing the booths in its own offices over the past year, the company now intends to place them in the offices of some of its corporate partners, including Salesforce, WeWork, T-Mobile and Hackensack Meridian Health.
