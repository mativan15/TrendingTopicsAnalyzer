Paul English, the Boston serial entrepreneur best known for co-founding travel tech firm Kayak, is launching a new app out of its consumer-focused business ideas generation entity Boston Venture Studio.

Called "Deets," the app is meant to be a trusted source for restaurant recommendations — a place where users can get suggestions on the best eateries in specific places from their network of friends.

The app is launching on Thursday with its Apple Store version, and currently works for the restaurants in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline and Arlington.
