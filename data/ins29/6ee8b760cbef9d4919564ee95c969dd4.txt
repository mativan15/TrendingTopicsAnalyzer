Over the weekend, the Selling Sunset realtor, 35, and the HGTV star, 41 — who are currently expecting their first baby together, a boy — shared a joint Instagram post ahead of their wedding anniversary on Oct. 23.
 
"I can't believe it's almost been a year of being husband and wife 👰🏼‍♀️🤵🏻🤍 Crazy to think about all the things that can happen in a year," Heather wrote in her caption, alongside two photographs from the couple's special day.
