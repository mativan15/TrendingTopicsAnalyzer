I've barely been in Lucinda Chambers' Shepherd's Bush kitchen four minutes before she starts stripping in front of her shiny red Aga. Off come the chic, long bias-cut Zara dress and khaki anorak she's wearing (much cooler than a cropped cardie). On goes an A-line knitted dress with white piping and gold buttons from her new collaboration with Jigsaw. 
I want it all, now. 
Am I getting carried away? Probably. But that's because the former fashion director of British Vogue doesn't really do meh. Hers is conviction fashion.
