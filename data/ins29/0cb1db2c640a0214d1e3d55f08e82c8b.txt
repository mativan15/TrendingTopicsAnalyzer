Variety - TV News Exports of Italian TV series and non-theatrical movies have more than doubled over the past five years thanks in part to the rise of local originals commissioned by streamers, just as investments in production of local scripted content are also increasing.That is the key finding of a report unveiled at Rome's Mia market by Italy's producers association APA, which estimates the total value of Italy's TV exports in 2021 at roughly €100 million (97 million).
