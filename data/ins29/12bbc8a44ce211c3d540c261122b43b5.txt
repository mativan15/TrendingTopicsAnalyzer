French trade unions began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, asking for higher salaries amid decades-high inflation and posing President Emmanuel Macron one of his stiffest challenges since his reelection in May. Trade union leaders are hoping workers will be energised by the government's decision to force some of them to go back to work at petrol depots to try and get the fuel flowing again, a move some say put in jeopardy the right to strike.French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said more requisitions of staff could occur during the day, as drivers keep queuing in front of petrol stations.
