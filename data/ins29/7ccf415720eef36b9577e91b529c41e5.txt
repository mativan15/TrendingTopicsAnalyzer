Netflix added 2.4 million new subscribers in its most recent quarter, topping expectations that it would add 1 million. The addition was seen as a reassuring sign for investors and similar platforms that consumer interest in video streaming remains healthy.

The company had reported losing subscribers in the first two quarters of the year, the first subscriber losses in its history, though in the most recent quarter it reported a lower loss than what was originally forecast.

But the company said Tuesday that it continues to be profitable on an annual basis compared with its competitors, whose losses it estimated at "well over $10 billion.
