Equity benchmark indices began the trade on a positive note on Friday tracking gains in Axis Bank and a mixed trend in Asian markets.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned net buyers in the markets on Thursday after many days and this also added to the momentum.

From the Sensex pack, Axis Bank climbed nearly 6 per cent after the company on Thursday reported a 66.
