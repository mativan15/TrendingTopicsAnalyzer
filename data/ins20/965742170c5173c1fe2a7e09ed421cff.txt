The Bank of England is delaying the start of a major sale of government debt by one day to prevent a clash with the announcement of Jeremy Hunt's fiscal plan.
Officials have announced that they will begin offloading bonds bought through years of emergency quantitative easing (QE) on November 1.
The Bank previously said it would start this process on Oct 31 – when Mr Hunt, the new Chancellor, now intends to unveil his Government's plan to bring the deficit under control.
Threadneedle Street also said it will initially only sell short-dated Government debt of the kind not widely held by pension funds, in order to prevent a repeat of market turmoil that drove some retirement schemes to the brink in the wake of the mini-Budget.
