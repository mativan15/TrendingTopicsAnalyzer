Things were looking good to start the evening for the Sooners. Peyton Graham, Blake Robertson and John Spikerman were all on base in the first inning with no one out and the Gators were already tapping into their bullpen.
Then Carsten Finnvold took the mound.
The freshman retired the Sooners in order and shut down the Sooners' early chance to get a big lead. Oklahoma didn't get another hit until the sixth inning.
The Gators rode Finnvold's stellar relief outing to a 7-2 win to push the Gainesville Regional Final to a second game.
