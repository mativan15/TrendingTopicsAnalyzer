Former Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has expressed concern that the Saudi-backed breakaway could eventually "turn golf upside down" after Dustin Johnson's £119million shock signing.

Johnson, the former world No 1, stunned golf this week after Greg Norman handed him the huge signing-on paycheck for the first rebel event next week.

McGinley, a stalwart of the game and board member on the DP World Tour, said the addition of a player "in the prime of his career" was a major shock for the sport.
