An extension built onto the end of Sea Street in Saint John a decade ago has panoramic views of the Bay of Fundy. Lately, it has been one of the hottest residential development spots in the city.  Every available lot on the street in 2021 sold at prices above assessed value. In the past year, 11 new high-end homes have either been built there or are now under construction.Normally that would affect the value of nearby houses. But in a quirk that New Brunswick's assessment agency Service New Brunswick won't explain, seven ocean-view homes on Sea Street built or bought prior to the current development spree have gone untouched by any assessment changes in the last three years.
