Tesco has raised the price of its meal deal as food costs soar.The sandwich, snack and drink deal will jump to more than £3 for the first time in 10 years to £3.40 for Tesco Clubcard members, and from £3.50 to £3.90 for people who do not have one.Food prices are rising at their fastest rate in 42 years, squeezing household budgets and driving grocery inflation to 14.6% in the 12 months to September.Tesco said its meal deal still represented "great value".The supermarket said more than 70% of its customers currently use a Clubcard, which is a free card that gives customers discounts.
