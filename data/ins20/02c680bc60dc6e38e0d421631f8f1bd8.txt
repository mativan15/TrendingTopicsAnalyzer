 ATLANTA (May 27, 2022) - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a grant funding opportunity for non-profit organizations, tribes, and state and local governments within EPA Regions 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 to advance innovative, cost-effective, and replicable source reduction approaches that save energy and water, reduce pollution, and improve human health and the environment. Source reduction, also known as pollution prevention (P2) means preventing pollution at the source rather than managing waste after it is produced.
