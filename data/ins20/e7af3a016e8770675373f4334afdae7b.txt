The Physics Training and Talent Search 2022 will be held from July 1 to 21 virtually. This year, the School of Arts and Sciences, Ahmedabad University, is hosting the event. All participants will receive a certificate on completing the course and a select few will have an opportunity to intern at leading institutions across the country, the organisers said. There are two levels — one for undergraduates and another for postgraduate students. In the Level 1, there are 50 seats for students who have completed or are completing B.
