— 𝗙𝗢𝗟𝗟𝗢𝗪 @𝗙𝗧𝗕𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗱𝟳 (@FTBeard7) October 18, 2022 Denver Broncos defender Baron Browning played as an inside linebacker out of necessity last year because the team had multiple injuries at the position.
This spring, the Broncos moved the second-year defender back to his more natural outside linebacker position, and that was clearly the right decision.
Browning got limited playing time through the team's first four games behind starters Bradley Chubb and Randy Gregory.
