With Daniel LippmanDISCORD HIRES FIRST LOBBYISTS: The popular online text, video and voice chat app Discord has hired its first federal lobbyists. Monument Advocacy's Stewart Verdery, Ashley Hoy, Andrew Howell, Joseph Hoefer and Jeff Gary will lobby on privacy and content moderation issues for the platform, which initially found a huge base among gamers but exploded in popularity during the pandemic.— The platform, which says it has hundreds of millions of users, last year said it had raised $500 million in its latest round of funding, and CNBC reported that the company was valued at $15 billion.
