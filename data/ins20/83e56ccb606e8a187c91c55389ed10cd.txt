To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private equity firms with 28% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

As a result, private equity firms collectively scored the highest last week as the company hit US$2.3b market cap following a 6.4% gain in the stock.
