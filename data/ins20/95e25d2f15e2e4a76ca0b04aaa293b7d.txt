There were just 13 candidates for the 12 positions, but Taranaki's smallest council has scored five new faces for a bold, diverse new look. The newbies at the Stratford District Council following this month's election include a te reo and kapahaka teacher, a farmer, a baker, a youth worker, and a real estate agent. Youth worker Ellen Hall was elected to the urban ward and is one of five women now on the council. 'I want my children to grow up in a world where they see the diversity of their community reflected at the decision-making table,' she said.
