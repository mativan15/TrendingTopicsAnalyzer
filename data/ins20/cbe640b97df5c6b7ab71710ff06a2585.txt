Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Friday suggested measures, like ending the practice of the Union government legislating on State subjects, to strengthen cooperative federalism. He was delivering the 15th V. Sankar Aiyar Memorial Lecture on ‘The Future of Cooperative Federalism', organised by the Southern India Regional Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. He said the Centre should also stop mandating 'one size fits all schemes' for the States. To drive home his point, he cited the example of the National Food Security Act.
