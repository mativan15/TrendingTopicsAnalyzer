Officials withing the Biden administration are discussing whether some of Elon Musk's business ventures should be subjected to national security reviews, including his bid for Twitter and his Starlink network of satellites, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. 
US officials are uncomfortable with Musk's suggestion that he will stop supplying the Starlink satellite service to war-torn Ukraine — an endeavor that he says has cost him $80 million, the news outlet reported. A series of tweets with an increasingly Russia-friendly position in the ongoing war with Ukraine has also raised concerns, people described as familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.
