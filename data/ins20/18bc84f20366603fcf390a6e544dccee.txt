Vera Shestak/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Alpha Metallurgical Resources (NYSE:AMR) is a very simple thesis. With natural gas (NG1:COM) prices soaring beyond $8 mmbtu, the equation makes coal a cheaper energy alternative for steel companies. Furthermore, AMR has approximately 45% of its met coal uncommitted. Since AMR's met coal costs per ton at the high end are $107 and met coal is now approximately $400 per ton, altogether I estimate that AMR could see approximately $2.7 billion of free cash flow.
