On Oct. 16, 1993, there were three games featuring teams that were all 5-0 or better: No. 1 Florida State beat No. 15 Virginia, 40-14; No. 6 Nebraska beat Kansas State, 45-28; and No. 19 Auburn defeated No. 4 Florida, 38-35. It was the first time in college football history that six teams with such records played one another on the same day, according to ESPN's Chris Fallica.It took almost exactly 29 years, but we're finally getting a repeat of that happy combination of success and scheduling. On paper, Saturday's slate is a knockout, with Penn State-Michigan, Alabama-Tennessee and Oklahoma State-TCU all matchups of teams that are 5-0 or better, plus three other ranked-vs.
