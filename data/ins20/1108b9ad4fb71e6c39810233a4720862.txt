Only two teams are left standing in the American League: The Houston Astros and New York Yankees are set to square off in the ALCS for the third time in six years, with the winner earning a trip to the World Series. Game 1 is scheduled for Wednesday night at Minute Maid Park with a 6:37 p.m. CT first pitch.

Houston is coming off an ALDS sweep of the Seattle Mariners, clinching with a historic 18-inning marathon over the weekend. They'll be playing on four days rest, while New York advanced to the ALCS with a Game 5 win over the Cleveland Guardians Tuesday night.
