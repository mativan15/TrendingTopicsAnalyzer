Kerala's first ‘Brain Gain' scholar Venugopal Nair has mooted the wide use of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) to boost the State's rabies control programme. The United Kingdom-based virologist has advocated the oral mode of vaccination at a time when the rabies-endemic State is grappling with a stray dog menace and has embarked on a massive vaccination drive. Prof. Nair, head of the Viral Oncogenesis group at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, was among three non-resident Keralite scholars who were chosen to engage with institutions in the State in their respective areas of expertise in the pilot phase of the ‘Brain Gain' project that was launched by the Kerala State Higher Education Council.
