Sunshine Seeds/iStock via Getty Images Sibanye-Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) -4.2% in Wednesday's trading after RBC Capital cut shares to Sector Perform from Outperform with a $13 price target, slashed from $25, as weak auto demand clouds the outlook for platinum group metals. While Sibanye-Stillwater (SBSW) "remains an attractive investment in the medium term, operational uncertainties, weaker PGM markets and the impact of cost inflation leave the outlook more balanced in the short term," RBC's Tyler Broda writes.
