Kanye West plans to acquire Parler, a social media app popular among conservatives, the network's parent company announced Monday.

The move by the rapper, legally known as Ye, to grab up the app comes after he was banned from Twitter and Instagram after antisemitic posts on those platforms.

'In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,' Ye said in a statement announcing the agreement.

Parler has pitched itself as an alternative to Twitter, describing itself as a 'premier free speech app' with limited content moderation, geared toward conservatives.
