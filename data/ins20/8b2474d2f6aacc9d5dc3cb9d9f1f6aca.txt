By Placement agent Campbell Lutyens is betting on the growth of private-equity firms and their balance sheets by setting up a dedicated team to advise firms on their management-company and financing options. As more private-equity managers increase their fund sizes, assets under management and investment strategies, they face challenges managing succession planning, talent and even firm balance sheets, according to Campbell Lutyens Partner Thomas Liaudet, who leads the firm's new general partner capital advisory team out of London.
