hh5800 Last year, I published a detailed bearish outlook for the semiconductor sector, regarding the ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), in "SOXX: The Global Semiconductor Shortage Is Not A Buying Opportunity." While the ETF rose initially after that article was published, it is now down by around 28%, following a staggering 43% decline this year.

Chief reasons for my view included overestimating the 5G or IoT growth potential, and the negative impact higher chip prices would have on consumer demand.
