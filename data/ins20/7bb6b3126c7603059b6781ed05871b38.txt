yuelan/iStock Editorial via Getty Images ABB (NYSE:ABB) edged higher on Thursday to erase a premarket slide after the industrial automation company missed earnings estimates. The stock rose 0.6% by 10:40 a.m. ET, after falling as much as 1.1% before the start of regular trading in U.S. markets. The company's Q3 EPS of $0.19 was $0.03 lower than the Wall Street consensus estimate, while a 5.4% gain in revenue to $7.4 billion was $20 million less than the average estimate. The strength of the U.S. dollar after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates pressured the company's results.
