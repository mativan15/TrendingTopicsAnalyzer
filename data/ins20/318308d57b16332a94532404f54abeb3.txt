Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images Entertainment Boston Beer Company (NYSE:SAM) lost a bull on Wednesday as Evercore downgraded the stock to In-Line from Outperform ahead of its Q3 earnings report. The rationale for the downgrade was three-pronged. The firm indicated that estimates heading into the brewer's Q3 earnings on Thursday are too high, promoting an expectation that an earnings miss is in store. Further, the firm's analysts advised that competition in the ready to drink and seltzer spaces are likely to squeeze revenues in coming quarters.
