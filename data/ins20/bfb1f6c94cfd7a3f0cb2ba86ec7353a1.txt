It's already been a big year for Paycor HCM, but the news keeps coming.

On Friday, the Norwood-based payroll and human capital management firm announced its acquisition of Talenya, its second deal since going public in July 2021. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Located outside of Manhattan, Talenya uses artificial intelligence to help companies fill jobs faster and more cheaply. Its technology will be integrated into Paycor's existing offerings in early 2023, the release states.

According to the release, Paycor aims for Talenya's technology to not only help its clients speed up the hiring process amid a talent crunch but also scout out more diverse candidates for their openings.
