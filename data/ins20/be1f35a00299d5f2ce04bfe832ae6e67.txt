£19 billion — that's what the Bank of England has spent on gilts in the past fortnight to help pension funds rocked by market volatility since Kwasi Kwarteng's mini budget. Andrew Bailey was addressing the managers of these funds when he vowed to end the emergency intervention last week, warning: 'You've got three days left.'But the governor could just as well have been speaking to the government. His confirmation that the Bank's support scheme would end on Friday sent renewed distress through markets and added to the pressure on Kwarteng and Liz Truss for another U-turn on their £43 billion of remaining tax cuts.
