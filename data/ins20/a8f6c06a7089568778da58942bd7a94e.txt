DERBY hero Richard Kingscote admits he might not get to ride Desert Crown again.
The runaway Epsom winner is trained by Sir Michael Stoute who employs Ryan Moore as his number one jockey.

Kingscote is a freelance rider and gets second pick on Stoute's horses when Moore is needed by his other gaffer Aidan O'Brien who has first dibs on Moore.
Desert Crown's next race is yet to be decided, but if O'Brien is without a runner in the race then Moore would be first in line to jump on board.
