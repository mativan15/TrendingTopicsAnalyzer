The Outlaws with Greg played by Stephen Merchant

It appears that whatever comedian Stephen Merchant touches very quickly turns to gold.

After co-creating hit series including Extras and The Office, The Outlaws is the latest project to catapult his 6ft 7in frame back on to our screens. The show became the BBC's most-watched comedy of 2021 - receiving a Bafta nomination in the process - and Merchant, 47, is now poised to release the second highly-anticipated series.

Set in his home town of Bristol, the Bafta and Emmy award-winning creator returns as both co-writer and star this time around.
