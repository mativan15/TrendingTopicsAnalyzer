grinvalds/iStock via Getty Images Company Snapshot Q1-22 Presentation HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a tech company whose roots lie in the field of marketing automation; these days, its offering is broader in scope, as it provides a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform encompassing not just marketing tools, but also sales, service, operations, and content management tools for mid-market (employee size of 2-2000) B2B companies across the globe. The company monetizes its services via subscription contracts (contract length of typically less than a year) which account for a lion's share of its revenue (~97%); the rest of the topline comes from other professional services such as onboarding, training and consultancy work.
