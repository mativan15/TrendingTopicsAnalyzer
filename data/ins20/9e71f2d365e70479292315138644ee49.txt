Scott Drew wants the NCAA tournament to be bigger.

Baylor's head coach, speaking Wednesday at Big 12 media days in Kansas City, is all for expansion of the tournament — an idea that has recently grown significantly in popularity.

So instead of just a minor expansion, Drew wants to go all out. He wants another full round of games, which would bring the field to a whopping 128 teams.

"I would like to see it go to 128 [teams]," Drew said, via ESPN .
