Bilkis Bano has said she wants her attackers to understand the severity of their crime

The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the premature release of 11 men who were convicted for the gang-rape of a pregnant Muslim woman and murder of 14 members of her family, including her three-year-old daughter, according to a court document.

The convicts were part of a Hindu mob that attacked Bilkis Bano and her family during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat.
