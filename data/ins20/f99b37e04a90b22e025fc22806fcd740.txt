The Centre has warned users against a malicious festival-themed campaign targeting Indian customers in the form of suspicious links to Diwali gifts and prizes. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, a nodal agency under the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY), has said that fake messages are in circulation on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and Instagram etc that are falsely claiming to have a festive offer luring users into gift links and prizes.
