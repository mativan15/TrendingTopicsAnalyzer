New Delhi: Two-wheeler major Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) on Tuesday said that a clear and stable policy roadmap would be critical for the implementation of the alternative fuel roadmap in the country. The Japanese two-wheeler major said that while the company remains aligned to the government vision, certain challenges related fuel supply and price need to be addressed. "To derive the many advantages of biofuels, it is important to have a clear, consistent, and stable policy. Policy enablers that can provide reasonable fuel cost and support for localisation would help in maintaining reasonable cost of ownership for successful flex fuel road map implementation in India," Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) President, CEO & MD Atsushi Ogata said here.
