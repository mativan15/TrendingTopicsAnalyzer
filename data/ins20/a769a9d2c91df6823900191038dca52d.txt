The Celestiq is aimed only at those who'd be willing to fish out at least $300,000 (approximately Rs 2.5 crore). General Motors was founded in 1908 and it took only years for the company to purchase 22 brands, including Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile, whilst also getting ye close to acquiring Ford's operations as well. Today, GM sells SUVs, trucks to luxury cars, and also electric ones. Since small cars have gotten the axe in recent years and GM has been about bigger is better, Cadillac holds great importance to the company.
