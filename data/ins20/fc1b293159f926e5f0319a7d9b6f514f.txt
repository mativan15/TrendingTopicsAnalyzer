Week 6 began with a stinker of a game between the Washington Commanders and Chicago Bears. The Commanders won 12-7 despite the Bears getting inside the five-yard line three times. They managed to get no points in those three trips.

With the Lions, Texans, Raiders and Titans on their bye week, there are only 13 games remaining on the Week 6 schedule.

That leaves 13 games to have some betting action on.

Below are my picks for the moneyline, the spread and the total for each game left on the schedule.
