A mum had no idea she was banned from driving because her ‘abusive ex was in charge of her post', a court heard.
Kirsty Alderson, 32, pleaded guilty to driving while banned and driving without insurance on May 19.
The court heard how the ex cancelled her insurance policy to fund his drug habit, and Alderson was fleeing him when she was caught by police.
A police officer was travelling along Acklam Road in Middlesbrough at 2am when he spotted Alderson in her Nissan Juke, prosecutor Lillian Hellevick said.
