Investors have been dropping growth stocks like hot potatoes for several months now. The economy continues its ride into volatility, and investors are looking for safer opportunities with value stocks.
If you have enough of a time horizon to wait out what has already dipped into bear market territory, you can use these dramatic price drops to buy excellent stocks at steep discounts. Two that I recommend are Airbnb (ABNB -1.38%) and Revolve Group (RVLV -1.35%).
Airbnb: down 32% over the past year
Airbnb was a stock market darling when it went public almost two years ago.
