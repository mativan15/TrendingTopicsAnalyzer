On Wednesday, I went along with my daughter to the Hakhel ceremony at the Western Wall. Personally, I thought it was a beautiful occasion, with tens of thousands of people from across the spectrum of Israeli society coming together to sort of reenacting an event that stopped 2,000 years ago. The one head-scratcher was the honoring of a certain convicted former chief rabbi, but I'll leave that for now.

The point of Hakhel was for everyone to come to the Temple at the end of the seventh year (shmita, sabbatical year) and hear the king read from parts of the Torah.
