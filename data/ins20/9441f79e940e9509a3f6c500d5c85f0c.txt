'If you think it's reasonably possible that nothing happened, you must acquit him.'Continuing his closing remarks from the day before, Whybrow said that Lehrmann's account to police of his world being 'rocked' by the allegation was a 'powerful, compelling and genuine statement'.McCallum told the jury there was no legal requirement for the evidence of a complainant in a sexual assault case to be corroborated, but that Higgins' account also had 'some corroboration' as the court had heard evidence that a security guard had entered the office and found Higgins naked on the couch during the early morning.
