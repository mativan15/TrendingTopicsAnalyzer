Love Island winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu is training hard ahead of her Dancing On Ice 2023 debut, having hit the rink on Wednesday morning for an intense lesson.
The reality star, who is among the celebrity line-up for the upcoming ITV series, was pictured concentrating hard as she got to grips on the ice in a pair of white skates.
She was guided around the rink by a professional skater, who held her frame and her hand while attempting to dance together.
Wrapped up warm in a white puffa jacket, black Nike leggings, and black gloves, Ekin-Su wasn't taking any risks of feeling the cold.
