Battered bitcoin (BTC) bulls eagerly await the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from the ongoing liquidity tightening and offer a lifeline to risk assets. However, the so-called Fed pivot in favor of easing may not bring immediate relief to the crypto market.

That's the message from the S&P 500's historical data, which shows Wall Street's equity index, a benchmark for risk assets worldwide, bottoms out several months after the Fed kicks off the easing cycle with an interest rate cut.

Bitcoin tends to move more or less with the sentiment on Wall Street.
