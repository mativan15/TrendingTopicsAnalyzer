A CDC committee will convene this week and likely vote Thursday to deliver permanent legal indemnity to Pfizer and Moderna, through the process of adding the drug companies' mRNA injections to the child and adolescent immunization schedules.By adding the shots to the childhood schedule, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will transfer liability for vaccine injuries to the federal government's National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), allowing for Pfizer and Moderna to finally bring an FDA approved shot to the market without opening itself up to lawsuits.
