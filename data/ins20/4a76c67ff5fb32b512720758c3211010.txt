CARVER, Minn. (WCCO) — Several strokes did not stop one man from finding his new passion. Brian Nustad, of Carver, has been growing his flag making business the last year and half, transforming his garage into a wood shop.
He discovered a passion for woodwork after losing his job and having a stroke within a couple months of each other.
Since then, he's created thousands of wooden American flags
'You get slivers all day long,' said Nustad, as he finishes up one of his flags.
The pine he uses, makes each flag unique by 'the beauty of the woodgrains and how they interact with each other,' said Nustad.
