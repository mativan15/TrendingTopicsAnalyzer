Health Canada issued a mass recall on Tuesday of Unilever hair products containing the cancer-causing chemical benzene. This time, the listed products were dry shampoos sold over the last two years by Unilever brands Bed Head TIGI, Dove and Tresemmé. But other hair and skin products have also been subject to recalls in recent years due to the presence of benzene. Most recently, Edgewell Personal Care Company issued a voluntary recall of its Banana Boat scalp and hair sunscreens containing benzene in July.
