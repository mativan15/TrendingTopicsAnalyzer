hapabapa Social-media stock stalwarts are slipping in the wake of Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) most disappointing revenue growth rate ever. Snap posted 6% sales growth as it wrestled with the well-documented ad-industry recession, its worst quarterly growth number and short of 6.4% expectations. The stock is now down 22.7% after hours. At least in 2022, when Snap sneezes, social media (similarly dependent on the overall ad ecosystem) catches a cold. Alphabet is down postmarket Thursday: (NASDAQ:GOOG) -2.5%, (GOOGL) -2.
