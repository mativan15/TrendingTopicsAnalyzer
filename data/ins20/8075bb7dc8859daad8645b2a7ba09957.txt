Oct. 21—BLUEFIELD — One crumbling house came down Thursday and there were about 99 left to go as the City of Bluefield started bringing down dilapidated structures and opening up possibilities for new housing and new economic development.

Local and state officials met at Hill Avenue, a street above the Bluefield State University campus, for a ribbon cutting ceremony marking the start of bringing down dilapidated structures across the city. After the ribbon was cut, an excavator was being used to tear down a two-story house.
