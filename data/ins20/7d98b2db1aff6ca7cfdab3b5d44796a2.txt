Now, everyone has the opportunity to own a digital piece of one of Rembrandt's most celebrated works, The Night Watch (1642). The painting has been divided into 8,000 pieces, which are available in the form of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) — a digital certificate of ownership.

Not only will the sale of NFTs be a milestone step in making Rembrandt ownership accessible for all, but owners will also be granted exclusive access to the new, and soon to be open, MetaRembrandt Museum — the only place in the world where all the paintings of Rembrandt van Rijn can be found remastered, digitally restored to their original state, and in high definition.
