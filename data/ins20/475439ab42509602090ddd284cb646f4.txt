Punjab Director General of Police V K Bhawra Sunday said the killing of famous singer Sidhu Moose Wala seems to be a fallout of an inter-gang rivalry and that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang was involved in it. He further said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) will be set up to investigate the Sunday evening killing. In a media statement, the state police chief said Moosewala's security cover was scaled down to free personnel for deployment during the Operation Bluestar anniversary next month. Two of the four Punjab police commandos deployed with Moosewala were withdrawn, he said.
