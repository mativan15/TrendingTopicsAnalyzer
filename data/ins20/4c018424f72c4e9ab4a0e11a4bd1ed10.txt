Ukrainian fighters are harnessing the silent speed of electric bikes to try to outwit Russian invaders as the ongoing war continues to ravage their country. 
Electric bikes — which have a top speed of 55 miles per hour and are fairly quiet — have become key support tools for reconnaissance missions, demining operations and medical deliveries in battling Russia, The Washington Post reported. 
The move is reminiscent of a World War II strategy from the conflict's Malayan campaign, during which Japanese troops used pedal-bikes to outmaneuver British forces in the 'Bicycle Blitzkrieg,' according to The Washington Post.
