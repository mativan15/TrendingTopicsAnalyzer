A record number of countries sided against Russia in the latest UN General Assembly vote – held last week on whether the takeover of four eastern Ukrainian regions was legitimate. However, despite the atrocities committed since the war began, 35 countries remain on the fence – China and India notably among them – suggesting the world isn't quite as unified against Russia as the West would like. Behind the rhetoric of international forums, many nations still rely on Russian exports of weapons and fuel, or consider their potential veto an asset worth keeping.
