Music composer Ismail Darbar and singer KK's Bollywood journey started almost around the same time. The duo got their big break in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 1999 film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and they later collaborated on Devdas (2002). A day after KK's demise, Darbar recalls his association with the late singer, who according to him, used to sing from his heart.
Ismail, who celebrates his birthday on June 1, says that he will never be able to cope with KK's death. He shared with indianexpress.com, 'I will never get over KK's death.
