The lawyers competing to replace L.A. City Atty. Mike Feuer are relative neophytes to the world of city politics, outsider candidates who have laid out vastly different visions for how they plan to lead the city.

Civil rights attorney Faisal Gill, who finished a few percentage points ahead of his opponent in the primary, has campaigned as a progressive reformer who would hold the Los Angeles Police Department accountable and impose a 100-day moratorium on filing charges on misdemeanor crimes, to allow time to study whether to permanently cease prosecuting certain offenses.
