The production version of the TVS Zeppelin R cruiser is likely to source its engine from the much popular Apache series of bikes. 
 








TVS Zeppelin concept in production form could be called the TVS Ronin.
 

Showcased at the 2018 Auto Expo as a concept, the TVS Zeppelin R cruiser is likely to see the light of day soon, claim reports. While originally the concept featured a high-tech mild-hybrid powertrain, the production version could in fact come with an Apache series-sourced engine which will help the company to save the input costs.
