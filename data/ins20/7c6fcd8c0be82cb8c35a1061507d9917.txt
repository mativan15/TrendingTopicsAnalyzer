Joe Rotondi is stepping down after a seven-year run as the executive director of the nonprofit community makerspace Forge Greensboro.

Under his leadership, the Forge doubled its budget and membership and created six new positions. Rotondi became the first executive director in 2015 for the downtown Greensboro makerspace, located in the building at 219 West Lewis Street.

Jennie Savage, the managing director, will take over as interim executive director. The Forge is currently seeking applications for a new executive director and aims to fill the position before the end of the year, according to Rotondi.
