Therese Coffey 'is pouring petrol on the fire of the shortage of NHS nurses', Labour warns, after the health secretary said nurses could choose to leave if they weren't happy with their pay.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said Ms Coffey's comments, in which she said nurses would not receive a further pay increase and the government had routes to recruit overseas nurses, risked driving out more nurses from the NHS.Ms Coffey's words come as the NHS faces unprecedented strike action this winter from nurses and hundreds of thousands of other healthcare workers.
