Tell Timai
Egypt, known for the pyramids and the sphinx, is the summer destination for three University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa students who are part of the Classics program in the College of Arts, Languages and Letters. They will spend five weeks in an ancient Egyptian city in the Nile Delta through July 31. The exotic journey is part of the UH Tell Timai Project, where students participate in archaeological activities at the Tell Timai site, which was a flourishing city from 500 B.C. to about 600 A.
