The provincial government is putting more money into a new approach to food production that's taking the industry by storm. A $20-million plant protein facility, which began its life as a brewery, is now open in the city of Lethbridge. Canadian agrifood company PIP International operates the business that processes pea crops and tests new methods of harvesting them. That company was awarded $1 million from the UCP government as part of its Emerging Opportunities program, to help create the facility.
