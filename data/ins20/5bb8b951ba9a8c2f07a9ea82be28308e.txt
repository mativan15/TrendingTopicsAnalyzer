AgenciesCredit Suisse is scheduled to release details of a much anticipated strategic review alongside third-quarter results on Oct. 27. Credit Suisse has agreed to pay $495 million to settle a case brought against it in the United States, the latest pay-out related to past blunders that have battered the Swiss bank's reputation. Credit Suisse said it would make the pay-out to settle claims brought by the New Jersey Attorney General related to the bank's residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) business before 2008.
