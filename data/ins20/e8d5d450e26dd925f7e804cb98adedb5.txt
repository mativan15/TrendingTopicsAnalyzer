Tesla shares retreated in after-hours trading - Reuters

Shares in Tesla, Elon Musk's electric car company and the source of most of his wealth, tumbled after the company reported sales which fell $640m (£570m) short of expectations.

The stock fell 7pc in late trading on Wednesday after the company blamed a strong dollar and challenges in delivering its cars to customers for the performance.

The California-based carmaker was expected to report sales of $22.09bn in the three months to the end of September.
