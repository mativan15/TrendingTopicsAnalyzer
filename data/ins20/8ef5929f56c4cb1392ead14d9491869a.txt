BEDMINSTER – About 8,000 people a day are expected to attend the professional LIV Golf tournament at Trump National Golf Club during the last week of July.

Announced in March, the LIV Golf Invitational Series, based in Saudi Arabia, has become a controversial alternative to the existing professional golf tours in the United States and Europe.

Backed by a $2 billion infusion to support its launch, LIV has been touting exorbitant purses totaling $255 million and guaranteed money to lure players to enter its events.
