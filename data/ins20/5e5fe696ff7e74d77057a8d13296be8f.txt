The wine capital of Australia may seem an unlikely place for a tea business, but Belinda Hellyer has found a way to bring the two worlds together. The certified tea blender and tea master has been taking parts of horticultural crops from farms that wouldn't usually be used and making tea with them."I think it gives producers more scope for using their ingredients, and reaching customers in new ways," she said.  All of Ms Hellyer's ingredients are organic.(Supplied: Belinda Hellyer)Aside from running her award-winning Adelaide business Brewed By Belinda, Ms Hellyer has been working with other organisations to create custom blends.
