Liz Truss is set to draw up a resignation honours list - despite only having been in the job for six weeks, the Telegraph can disclose.
Downing Street said on Friday that it was the convention that all outgoing Prime Ministers issue such lists.
It raises the possibility that key members of the Truss campaign could be given knighthoods or peerages, despite the former PM only having been at the top of politics for a matter of weeks.
Although no names have yet been discussed, Ms Truss could choose to reward senior donors who helped fund her successful leadership campaign, as well as aides who have been by her side throughout her parliamentary career.
