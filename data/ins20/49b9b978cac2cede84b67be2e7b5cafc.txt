(Bloomberg) -- Chile President Gabriel Boric pledged to push through reforms, recognizing that scant progress has been made in addressing social discontent as the nation braces for violence marking the anniversary of the 2019 social uprising.The government must end the 'drought' in legislative changes through greater dialogue, meeting the demands that sparked the worst violence in Chile since the 1973-1990 dictatorship, Boric said Tuesday from the presidential palace in Santiago. 'Today we have a new opportunity to build the bases of a more just and dignified society,' said the former student leader who took over the presidency in March of this year.
