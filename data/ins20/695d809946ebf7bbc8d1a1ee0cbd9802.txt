It might be one of the city's oldest skyscraper and shopping complex, situated in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD) and a prominent view from Namma Metro. But today, it is a story of neglect and few give this iconic building a second look. Traders who have set up shops inside the Public Utility Building hardly receive any new customers. Out of 85 shops in the complex, which occupies the first and second floors of the building, only 30 to 35 are now open for business.
