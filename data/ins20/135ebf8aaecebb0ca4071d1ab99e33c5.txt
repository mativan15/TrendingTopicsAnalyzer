When hunting for a holiday ­bargain, is cruising cheaper than other types of holidays? When you factor in the multiple ports, possible ports of call, food, drink (and sometimes alcohol) and the opportunity to sail from the UK (no flights to fork out for) the pendulum certainly swings in cruising's favour. The destinations you can visit on a 'budget' cruise may surprise you. In this search for cruises costing £100 or less per day, we found an itinerary that visits Canada, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, a transatlantic crossing on Cunard's Queen Victoria, a voyage from Alaska to Japan and a riverside mooring that puts you at the heart of Paris.
