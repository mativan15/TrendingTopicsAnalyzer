The discovery of a car with bags of concrete found buried in the backyard of a Silicon Valley home has led investigators to consider the site a possible crime scene.

On Thursday, landscapers had begun excavating the ground of a multimillion-dollar home in the affluent neighbourhood of Atherton, located just a short drive away from where many big tech companies were founded and some, such as Meta, are headquartered.

While digging in the backyard, landscapers recovered something that they couldn't immediately explain: a car.
