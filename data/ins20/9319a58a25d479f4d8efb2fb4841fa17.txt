Approximately 29 activists blocked the road in east London (Just Stop Oil)

Just Stop Oil activists have blocked traffic in east London in what is the fifteenth day of action in the capital.

Shortly after midday, approximately 29 protesters established a roadblock on Shoreditch High Street at the junction of Great Eastern Street, with some gluing themselves to the tarmac.

Anna Holland, 20, of Westgate Road in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Phoebe Plummer, 21, of Elms Road in Clapham have been charged with criminal damage after they threw tomato soup over the famous Vincent Van Gogh painting at the National Gallery on Friday.
