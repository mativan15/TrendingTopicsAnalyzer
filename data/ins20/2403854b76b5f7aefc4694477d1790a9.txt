The Washington Commanders expect quarterback Carson Wentz to miss between 4-6 weeks after fracturing a finger on this throwing hand in last week's win over the Chicago Bears.
Taylor Heinicke will take over as Washington's starting quarterback, while rookie Sam Howell is the backup. With the expectation that the Commanders may place Wentz on injured reserve, they added another quarterback to the practice squad Tuesday.
