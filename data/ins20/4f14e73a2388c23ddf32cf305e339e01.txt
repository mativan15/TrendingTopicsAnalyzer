Family life will be stressful as someone will depend on you, emotionally and their expectations from you will make you feel under constant pressure. Your day at work can be hectic but not productive. You will find yourself running like a headless chicken due to lack of clarity from people around. Rely on your partner in a better sense for the sake of quality in personal life.
