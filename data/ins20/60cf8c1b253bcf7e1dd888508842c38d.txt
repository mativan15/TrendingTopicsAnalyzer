onurdongel/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc (NYSE:HPP) deals in the real-estate business, which mainly includes office and studio properties. The company has recently announced the acquisition of Quixote Studios, which I believe can accelerate the company's growth, and this growth can further be sustainable by a solid tailwind in the content production industry. The company also has a high dividend payout rate, making it an attractive investment opportunity for risk-averse and retired investors.
