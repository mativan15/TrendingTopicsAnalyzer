Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the seven-day Covid-19 isolation requirement will be reconsidered this week, as Covid-19 cases rise 'like clockwork'. Ardern, speaking at a regular press conference on Monday afternoon, said the latest rise in Covid-19 cases was expected by modelling, and the incoming wave would not be as 'significant' as earlier ones in 2022. The latest figures, published on Monday, showed there were 14,311 Covid-19 cases in the past week, a rise from 11,205 the week prior. The seven-day rolling average of cases was at 2041, up from 1598.
