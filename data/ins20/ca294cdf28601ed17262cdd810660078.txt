Digital technology is not an end in achieving healthcare but an enabler in making it patient-centric and more accessible, experts have said. "Prospects that digital health can provide are limitless, provided there is proper implementation with coordination among all stakeholders," Chief Executive Officer of the National Health Authority R S Sharma said. Dr Sharma was among the speakers at the 2nd Digital Health Summit on Friday. The summit, organised by the think tank IHW Council and powered by Super Konnect, brought major stakeholders together for meaningful conversations around digital health ecosystem transformation.
