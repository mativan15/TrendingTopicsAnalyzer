By Reuters Published: 14:44 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 14:44 EDT, 19 October 2022 Green Bay Packers wide receiver Sammy Watkins returned to practice Wednesday after missing the past four games with a hamstring injury. The Packers designated Watkins for return from injured reserve, activating his 21-day practice window to be added to the 53-man roster. The team said Watkins would be limited on Wednesday. Watkins was injured in Week 2 and placed on injured reserve on Sept. 24. It's unclear if he'll play on Sunday when the Packers (3-3) visit the Washington Commanders (2-4).
