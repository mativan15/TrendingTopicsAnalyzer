A married couple in their 90s paid for the down payment on their caretaker's Tamarac house; a new A/C unit, windows and fence for the house; the ballroom for the caretaker's daughter's wedding reception; and the caretaker's credit card bills.

The couple didn't know they were being this generous with caretaker Sherri Lynn Smith. Smith was stealing $288,865 from them in a classic case of elder fraud.

Elder fraud isn't on the federal law books, so Smith pleaded guilty to bank fraud and fraud with identification documents in late May.
