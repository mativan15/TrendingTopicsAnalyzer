Love Island star Liberty Poole has spoken out after being ‘verbally abused' by a group of men in public.
The reality star rose to prominence after appearing in the 2021 series of the reality dating show, and went on to appear on last year's Dancing On Ice.
While on the popular ITV2 show, Liberty was often dressed to the nines and wearing makeup as she and the other cast members were paired up in the hopes of finding love.
