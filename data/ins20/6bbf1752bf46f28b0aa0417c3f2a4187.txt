I had a date with a great guy. He ordered two glasses of wine for $36. I expected him to at least offer to pay the tip. He didn't. Should I have spoken up?

I went on a date with a great guy last week. We both ordered salads and entrees at a famous restaurant in Los Angeles. It was an exciting venue to meet someone for the first time, and I kept my eyes peeled for boldfaced names. Believe me when I say restaurant dates have been replaced by awkward walks in the park and coffee dates at Starbucks SBUX, -0.53% in recent years, so it was nice to actually get dressed up and have something to look forward to.  But. Yes, there's a but. But he ordered two glasses of wine, which cost $18 each.
