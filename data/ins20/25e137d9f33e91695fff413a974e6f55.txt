BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union leaders on Friday weighed the future of their increasingly testy relations with China as President Xi Jinping was expected to be reappointed leader at the Communist Party congress taking place this week.

During more than three hours of talks in Brussels, the 27 leaders of the world's biggest trading bloc discussed ways to reduce their dependence on China for tech equipment and the raw minerals used to make items such as microchips, batteries and solar panels.

'The goal was to have a veritable strategic exchange' ahead of a meeting with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in December, European Council President Charles Michel said.
