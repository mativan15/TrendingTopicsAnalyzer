Iraqi firebrand leader Moqtada al-Sadr's movement announced its refusal to join a new government being formed by Prime Minister-designate Mohammad Shia al-Sudani.
Saturday's announcement came two days after lawmakers elected Abdul Latif Rashid as Iraq's new president, and he swiftly named al-Sudani as prime minister in a bid to end a year of political gridlock since the October 2021 elections.
'We stress our firm and clear refusal for any of our affiliates to participate … in this government formation,' Mohammed Saleh al-Iraqi, a close associate of al-Sadr, said on Twitter.
