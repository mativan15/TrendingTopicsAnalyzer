Published: 19:14 EDT, 5 June 2022 | Updated: 19:14 EDT, 5 June 2022 Incoming Greens MP Stephen Bates feels he 'owes it' to his boss of five-years at his retail job to finish up the week before starting in federal parliament as the member for Brisbane. The 29-year-old new member for Brisbane was in his element as he helped customers during one of his final shifts at Apple's Chermside store on Thursday. Mr Bates will quadruple his current income in his new role as a federal politician - which comes with a base salary of $211,000.
