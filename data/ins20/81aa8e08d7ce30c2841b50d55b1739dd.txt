Boris Johnson has been accused of failing in his "defining mission" to level up Britain after official data showed a growing economic gulf between London and much of the Red Wall. GDP in the capital surged by 2.3pc in the third quarter of 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driving overall UK output higher despite a 1.2pc slump in the North East.
Regional data published by the stats body also showed GDP falling in the West Midlands, East Midlands and East of England – all areas the Prime Minister has pledged to "level up" as part of his efforts to address regional inequality.
