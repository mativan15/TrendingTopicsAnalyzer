U.S. Treasury yields slipped on Friday morning, as fears over the Federal Reserve's plans to aggressively hike interest rates appeared to ease. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved lower by 3 basis points to 2.725%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 2.992%. Yields move inversely to prices and 1 basis point is equal to 0.01%. Treasury yields have mostly moved lower this week, as investors sought shelter from heavy selling in stock markets. Disappointing earnings from a number of technology stocks have fueled fears that a slowdown in economic growth could be starting to show through in company data.
