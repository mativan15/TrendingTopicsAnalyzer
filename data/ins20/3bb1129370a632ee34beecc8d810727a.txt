Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen were defeated by Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers in the fourth iteration of 'The Match.'
After being down two holes early, Mahomes battled back to give his team the lead by the eighth hole. Brady sunk a clutch putt on the tenth hole in order to tie things back up. They kept it competitive all the way down to the last hole, but Rodgers and Brady put themselves in a better position to win with everything tied up.
It didn't help that Allen just wasn't having his best day on the golf course.
