A nationwide credit repair service has been temporarily shut down by a judge after the Federal Trade Commission accused it of being a giant pyramid scheme that preyed on people whose finances had been left in disarray by the pandemic. The Michigan-based Financial Education Services offered to help people fix their bad credit, but instead pocketed hefty fees for services it never actually provided. It then roped many of its customers into a high-pressure sales scheme to bring in other victims, the FTC said.
