Dak Prescott is ready to return.

Prescott, the Cowboys quarterback who has missed the last five games, told reporters after the Cowboys' loss to the Eagles on Sunday night that he expects to play this week against the Lions.

'Yeah, for sure, that's my plan,' Prescott said. 'I'm preparing myself for the Lions, getting ready to play this week.'

Prescott took the field for pregame warmups Sunday night in Philadelphia and said his injured hand felt great as he threw the ball to teammates.
