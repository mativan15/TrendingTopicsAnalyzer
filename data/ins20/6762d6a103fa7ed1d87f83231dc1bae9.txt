There are 16,513 recognised madarsas, and 560 receive grants but there was no estimate of unrecognised madarsas. Around 7,500 unrecognized madarsas have been detected in UP through the contentious statewide survey being carried out which concluded on Thursday, chairman of the UP Madarsa Education Board, Iftikhar Ahmed Javed has said. Javed however said it is only by November 15 that a report of the survey will be made available by district magistrates to the administration which will throw up an exact figure of the unrecognised madarsas but the data will be used only as a means to provide better quality education to children studying in these madarsas and going forward, after the report is received, efforts will be made to link them to the UP Madarsa Board of Education.
