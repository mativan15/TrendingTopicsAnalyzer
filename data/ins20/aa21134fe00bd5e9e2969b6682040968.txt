As part of Microsoft's filings with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) regarding its acquisition of Activision, it's been revealed that the tech giant plans to open an Xbox mobile store.The filings, as spotted by The Verge, discuss this Xbox mobile store that was somewhat hinted at earlier this year. Xbox head Phil Spencer noted earlier this year that the main motivation behind the acquisition was actually the mobile and PC potential, so a dedicated mobile store front makes a lot of sense.
