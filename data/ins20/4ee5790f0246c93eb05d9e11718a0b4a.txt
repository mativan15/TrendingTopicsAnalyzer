The Department of Homeland Security announced plans Friday to restart limited border wall construction, closing a 'gap' in the barrier in Arizona that appears to have been left when President Biden stopped construction on his first day in office. Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also authorized new construction near Friendship Circle, a border park near the Pacific Ocean. It would replace the current fence, which the department said is eroding because of the water. And Mr. Mayorkas gave the OK to replace or complete train and vehicle gates in various locations along the U.
