Meta held a virtual meeting for its more than 70,000 employees on Thursday, and there was a special topic of discussion: the recently announced departure of Sheryl Sandberg, its longtime No. 2 executive.
'People asked me all day yesterday, ‘Why now? Why now?' Why now is because it's time to write the next chapter of my life,' Sandberg said at the meeting, which Recode obtained an exclusive recording of and has transcribed below.
