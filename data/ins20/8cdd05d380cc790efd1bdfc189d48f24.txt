As a general rule, it's wise to look to the southern hemisphere for summer-flowering bulbs. Another South African ­native that can be planted now for impressive impact indoors is blood lily (Scadoxus multiflorus). Amand describes them as 'a big ball of fiery ­orange red', and says they're just as beginner-friendly as amaryllis.
He warns that they can seem deceptively sleepy, saying: 'They're one of those things you put in a pot and it doesn't grow, then you'll come down one morning and the thing's in flower.
