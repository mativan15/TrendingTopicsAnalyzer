By Tori B. Powell May 28, 2022 / 1:53 PM / CBS News Despite the hardships she faced stemming from her commitment to social justice work throughout the height of the civil rights movement, activist Joan Trumpauer Mulholland, 80, says she wasn't afraid. Fifty-nine years ago, Mulholland, who is white, was one of those photographed staging a sit-in to protest segregation in the south, an act in which she said was inspired by a higher power. "I was just doing what the spirit said to do," Mulholland told CBS News' Elise Preston.
