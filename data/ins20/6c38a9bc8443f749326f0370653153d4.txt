A major new poll has predicted the complete annihilation of the Conservatives at the next general election – to the point where they wouldn't even be the opposition party.
If the poll played out at a real general election, the Labour Party would be set to gain an unprecedented 364-seat majority, leaving the current governing party with just 48 seats.
The Scottish National Party (SNP) would have 52 seats – making it the official opposition.
The data came from a ‘poll of polls' conducted over the weekend, which sampled 11,538 people.
