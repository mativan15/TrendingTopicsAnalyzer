The University of Alberta Hospital Brain Centre is getting a new neurosciences intensive care unit. The announcement was initially made as part of the 2022 budget, and the province expanded on it on Tuesday. The new ICU will be made possible because of a $98 million investment from the provincial government and the University Hospital Foundation. The money will fund construction of an up-to-date space that will replace the existing ICU, which is nearly 40 years old. The new facility will have double the capacity of the existing one.
