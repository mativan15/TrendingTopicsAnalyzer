Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday announced that researchers enrolled in the recently-launched CM Fellowship programme will get weightage in administrative services. Stating that ‘talented youth' will help Uttar Pradesh elevate its economy as he gifted tablet computers to 100 newly-enrolled scholars in the programme, the CM observed: 'The research scholars will help fast-track development of aspirational blocks. The 100 research fellows will be given preference in administrative services.' He asked the researchers to work in the blocks for the next two to three years.
