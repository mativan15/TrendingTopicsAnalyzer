John Boyega has opened up about the state of diversity in film and TV after the killing of George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.

In an interview with Deadline, the 30-year-old said there has been a 'steady growth' of representation, and he feels a responsibility in helping others to progress in the industry.

The Star Wars actor said: 'We don't want to leave this industry the same way we found it and we don't want to exist in this industry being anything other than ourselves.'

Boyega has previously shared his experiences of being targeted by racists after he was cast inStar Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015, with some urging a boycott of the record-breaking film and sending death threats to the actor.
