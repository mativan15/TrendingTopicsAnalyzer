Don Cherry has been dubbed many things by his critics over the years, however, one thing he certainly cannot be described as is short on opinions.

As such, it should surprise nobody that after an impassioned Twitter thread by Cherry's former co-worker Tara Slone, the longtime face of Hockey Night in Canada had to get his two cents in to respond.

Slone's tweets, shared last Saturday in the wake of Hockey Night in Canada's season debut, were critical of the longtime Coaches Corner host for his bigoted views and continued elevation as a leader in hockey and politics, according to the Twitter thread.
