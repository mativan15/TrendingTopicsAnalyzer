President Vladimir Putin warned the United States that Russia will retaliate by striking new targets if it sends long-range missiles to Ukraine. 
'If it now comes to rockets and they are supplied, we will draw conclusions from that and employ our weapons that we have in sufficient quantities to strike those facilities that we are not attacking so far,' Putin said in an interview aired on Russian television Sunday, state-run media reported. 
The Russian leader also said all the 'fuss' over missile systems being supplied to Ukraine are intended to prolong the war that entered its 102nd day on Sunday.
