Jun. 1—Registration for an annual summer reading program at Joplin Public Library opened Tuesday with a bit more excitement than usual.

"It was the reintroduction of guest presenters," said Christina Matekel-Gibson, head of the children's department. "We have not had them here for the last couple of summers, so it will be fun to bring them in."

The library opened registration for its "Oceans of Possibilities" summer reading program, which includes games, concerts and other special programs until the program ends July 24.
