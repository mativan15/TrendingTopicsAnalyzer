UK MP Iain Duncan Smith says the British government should expel Chinese diplomats if they were involved in an attack on a Hong Kong protester.

Bob Chan says he was beaten inside the compound of the Chinese consulate in Manchester.

Amateur footage of the protest appears to show a man on the ground inside the Chinese consulate being beaten.

"The government must say categorically, 'Anybody involved in those scenes is not welcome here'," said the former leader of the Conservative Party at a news conference.
