The European Banking Authority (EBA) today issued a call for expression of interest to join two Technical Expert Groups – on crypto assets service providers and anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (TEG-CASPs/AML), and on restrictive measures regimes (TEG-RMRs) – and a call for input on the Joint Guidelines to prevent the abuse of fund transfers for ML/TF purposes issued in 2017 by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). These will provide technical advice to the EBA on those aspects of the revised Regulation on information accompanying transfers of funds (TFR) that relate to the EBA's mandates.
