[Photo by Han Joo-hyung] South Korea's National Assembly on Sunday approved on a 62 trillion won ($49.5 billion) extra budget bill with an increase in Covid-19 relief funds for 3.71 million small merchants and freelance workers, which could be the last of its kind for this year. The second extra budget is larger than the government's initial proposal of 59.4 trillion won after the parliament agreed to expand relief funding for micro businesses such as taxi and bus drivers, as well as freelance workers.
