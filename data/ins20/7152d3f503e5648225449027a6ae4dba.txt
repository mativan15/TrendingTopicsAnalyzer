Baseball analyst Bob Costas made an amusing error of misidentifying Cleveland Guardians pitcher Shane Bieber as Justin Bieber. The commentator immediately acknowledged his error and stated that he would never allow such a thing to happen again. Costas said, 'I'm sure it wasn't the first time it had occurred to Bieber,' before clarifying that he was speaking of Shane. The goof-up was captured by Sportsnet, who shared the video clip on Twitter. The video showed Shane pitching the ball to New Yankees hitter Giancarlo Stanton.
