The Russian government's map of SCO members has mirrored India's position on J&K, Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. The map released by state-owned Sputnik news agency has shown Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Aksai Chin, as well as the entire Arunachal Pradesh, as part of India, notwithstanding views of fellow SCO members Pakistan and China. The map has boosted India's position on the J&K issue internationally and within SCO. It comes in the backdrop of the visit of the US ambassador to PoK. The ambassador had called it 'Azad Kashmir'.
