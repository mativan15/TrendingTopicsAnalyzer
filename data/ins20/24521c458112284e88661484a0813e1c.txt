In a world's first, the New York state legislature has passed the "right to repair" bill that will require manufacturers to make parts, tools, information, and software available to consumers and independent repair shops. The "Fair Repair Act" comes after federal pressure to enforce consumers' rights to repair and refurbish their purchased goods. For independent repair shops, this news is huge as they will finally be able to compete with manufacturers, resisting the repair market consolidation manufacturers have created by restricting access to parts and tools.
