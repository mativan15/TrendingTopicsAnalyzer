When Ed Brimer and his siblings decided to sell their architectural signage and graphics company, they found a buyer with an eye-catching business model.

Brentwood-based Engraphix Architectural Signage in April 2021 was acquired by Teamshares, a privately-held firm with an office in New York City that specializes in buying small family-owned firms in which the owner plans to retire.

The deal is an alternative to the traditional employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, transition in which employees acquire the company from the owner.
