Oct 17, 2022 6:03 PM

Cam Johnson, P.J. Washington and Grant Williams were unable to agree to extensions with their respective teams and will become restricted free agents next offseason. Johnson has emerged as the Phoenix Suns' starting power forward this season. Washington averaged 10.3 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 65 games (28 starts) last season with the Charlotte Hornets. Williams became a key part of the Boston Celtics' rotation and figures to have a bigger role with Robert Williams out.
