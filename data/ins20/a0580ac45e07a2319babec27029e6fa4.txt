A new aviation manufacturing company, Pinnacle Aerospace LLC, plans to invest $14.7 million in a new facility in Wellington.

According to Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the company also plans to hire 155 people over the next five years.

'We wanted to build our new company here because we knew there was a talented workforce already in place in this community,' said Scott Brown, president of Pinnacle Aerospace.

The company's plant in Wellington will build hard metal components for commercial aerospace, general aviation and the defense and space industries.
