BOGOTA (Reuters) - Potential production of cocaine in Colombia and the area sown with coca, the drug's base ingredient, rose last year to their highest levels in two decades of monitoring, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said on Thursday.

Possible output rose 14% to 1,400 metric tons and the area sown with coca shot up 43% to 204,000 hectares (500,000 acres), the UNODC said in an annual report.

Despite decades of anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia remains a top producer of cocaine and its government comes under constant pressure from major ally the United States to reduce output.
