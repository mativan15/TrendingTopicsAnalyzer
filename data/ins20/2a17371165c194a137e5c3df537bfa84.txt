The Yankees made fans wait out a rain delay of nearly three hours just to turn them all home when Game 5 of the ALDS against the Cleveland Guardians was postponed Monday night. The game is rescheduled for 4:07 p.m., Tuesday at Yankee Stadium with Nestor Cortes starting instead of Jameson Taillon.

Facing a do-or-die situation with the series tied at 2-2, both teams, the league and the broadcast network, TBS, pushed to complete the game Monday night, according to an anonymous source who was in the meetings.
