OTTAWA—Ottawa police laid more than 500 criminal charges linked with the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' occupation in the nation's capital last winter, including more than 30 for alleged assaults and possession of weapons, the Emergencies Act inquiry heard Thursday.

The numbers add to an increasingly complex picture of the dangers posed by the protest movement, with evidence of aggression and threats emerging next to comments from the Ontario Provincial Police's intelligence chief, who told the inquiry this week he saw no proof the demonstrators posed a 'specific' and 'credible' threat of violence.
