A New York jury on Thursday found Kevin Spacey not liable in a sexual assault and battery case brought forward by actor Anthony Rapp, according to the Associated Press. The lawsuit, filed in September 2020, alleged that Spacey placed Rapp on a bed and climbed on top of him in a sexual manner at a party held at Spacey's Manhattan residence in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. The actors met while on Broadway. Rapp shared the story in a BuzzFeed News interview from October 2017, the same month the New York Times and New Yorker published articles detailing years of assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
