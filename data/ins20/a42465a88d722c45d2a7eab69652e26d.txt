WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is holding a roundtable discussion with baby formula manufacturers Wednesday as the administration tries to ramp up production and imports amid a shortage of the products.

The participants will include top executives from Gerber, Perrigo Co., Reckitt, Bubs Australia and ByHeart, a White House official said. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy are also expected to join the meeting.

Biden plans to discuss the steps the administration is taking to increase production through the Defense Production Act and to import formula from abroad, and the executives are expected to provide updates on their efforts to increase the supply of formula in the United States, the official said.
