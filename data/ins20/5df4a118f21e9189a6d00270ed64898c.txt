Campaigning in Las Vegas, first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada teamed up with rank-and-file members of the state's powerful Culinary Union, which represents casino, hotel and restaurant workers in Sin City and Reno.

"It was wonderful to join hundreds of @Culinary226 workers at @MandalayBay this morning. I will always have their back," the senator tweeted on Tuesday.

Cortez Masto will need all the support she can get from the politically powerful Culinary Union as she faces a very challenging re-election against Republican nominee Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general – he succeeded Cortez Masto as the state's top prosecutor – who's the grandson of former senator and governor Paul Laxalt.
