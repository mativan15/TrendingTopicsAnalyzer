The Longhorns will continue their 2022 season on Saturday against the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Here is how to watch and listen.

The Texas Longhorns hit the road to continue Big 12 action when they face Oklahoma State at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater, Okla.

The Longhorns (5-2, 3-1 in Big 12) have bounced back nicely from their Big 12-opening loss to Texas Tech, having rattled off three straight victories over West Virginia, Oklahoma and Iowa State. That puts the Longhorns a tie for second place in the Big 12 entering the game.
