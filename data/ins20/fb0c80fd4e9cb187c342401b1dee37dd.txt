The Eliminators Car Club does various charitable work throughout the year and has raised nearly $32,000 for Ronald McDonald House Charities.

Dave Neuman and Dennis Mollenkopf discussed a plan in 1963 for the 'Eliminators Car Club.' The name refers to certain class winners in sanctioned drag racing such as Top Stock and Top Modified Class Eliminator. Dave Hancock said they added a few friends from the area to make plans, including John Kneiremen, Larry Stewart, Rick Kalb, Russ Raifsnyder, Dennis and Bob Mollencopf, Mike Schnabel, Ron Raybuck, Daryl Stephenson and Rick Smith.
