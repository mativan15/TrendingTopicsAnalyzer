(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong's stock exchange is poised to report a sixth consecutive quarterly profit decline, the longest slump in its history as a listed company, as market turmoil drags down trading and initial public offerings.Net income for the three months that ended in September at the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. is estimated to drop 31% to HK$2.23 billion ($284 million) from a year earlier, according to a survey of five analysts. Stock trading continued to be weighed down by global economic concerns and a crackdown on private enterprise in mainland China that has shaken investor confidence in the world's second-largest economy.
