The Canterbury Regional Council has quietly paused a loan scheme after a similar Auckland one resulted in a $10 million payout to ratepayers. Up until late 2021, Environment Canterbury, or ECan, was offering ratepayers a loan of up to $6000 for healthy homes improvements, such as installing insulation and heating, but aspects of the loan may be in breach of the law. Around $4m had been distributed between 1400 property owners in Canterbury since the scheme launched in 2018, according to ECan director of strategy and planning Katherine Trought.
