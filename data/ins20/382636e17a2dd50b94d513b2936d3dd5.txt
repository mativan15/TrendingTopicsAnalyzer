An FD, or fixed deposit, is one of the most popular investment options in India as it's risk-free and offers guaranteed returns. An FD is an investment instrument wherein you can deposit a lump sum amount into a bank or NBFC offering FD facilities, for a stipulated period of time at a fixed rate of return. Additionally, you may also choose between monthly, quarterly, yearly or lump sum interest payouts depending on your financial goals.When you open an FD account at a specified rate of return, the specified interest rate is guaranteed, irrespective of any changes that may occur due to market fluctuations.
