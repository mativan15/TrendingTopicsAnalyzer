From tiny waterside shacks with only fried fish on the menu to elegant fine-dining restaurants overlooking tranquil ports, the food in Barbados is reason enough to leave the beach and get out and explore.
Not surprisingly, considering Barbados' rich cultural history, Bajan food is a world of flavors, with European, African and even Indian influences all working their magic on the island's natural bounty. Seafood is the star of many of the most popular dishes, but Bajan cuisine is surprisingly diverse, and even repeat visitors will always find something new to try.
