The yen slumped to its lowest level in 32 years on Thursday despite determined efforts by Japanese authorities to prop up the currency in the face of the rampant dollar.
One dollar now buys 150 yen for the first time since 1990, up from 115 a year ago, after policymakers failed to stop an extended slide.
Last month the Japanese government spent as much as ¥2.8 trillion (£16.6bn) in support of the exchange rate, but it appears to have had little persistent effect at a time when the Bank of Japan is maintaining its ultra-loose monetary policy.
