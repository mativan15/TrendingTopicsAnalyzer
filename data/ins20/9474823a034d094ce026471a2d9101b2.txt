At long last, King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine) is dead. His widow, Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke), recounts his final words to the small council. "He told me he wished for Aegon to be king," she says. "It's the truth, out of his own lips."

We, of course, know that Viserys was speaking in a drug-induced haze, scraps of prophecy mixed with pleas to his daughter, Rhaenyra. It was Rhaenyra he thought he was speaking to, after all, and amidst that haze he was affirming his desire for her to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
