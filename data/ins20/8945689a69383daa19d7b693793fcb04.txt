By Xavier Fontdegloria Factory activity in the Philadelphia area contracted for a second consecutive month in October, reflecting manufacturers' increasing headwinds amid high inflation and slowing demand. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said Thursday that the index for current general activity of its Business Outlook Survey was minus 8.7 in October compared with minus 9.9 in September. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the index to come in at minus 5.0. Despite the slight increase, the indicator signals factory activity continued to shrink in October at broadly the same pace compared with September as the index was below zero.
