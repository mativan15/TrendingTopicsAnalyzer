GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers insists he's still having fun even as he plays through a thumb injury while trying to lead a slumping offense on a .500 team. 'This has been my love since I was 5 years old. I still love waking up every day knowing I'm coming into 1265 (Lombardi Avenue),' the four-time MVP said Wednesday as he referenced the address of Lambeau Field. Rodgers didn't practice for a second straight Wednesday because of an injured right thumb, but said afterward that it's feeling better.
