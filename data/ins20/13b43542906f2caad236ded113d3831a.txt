Police in Pembroke are investigating after a resident lost more than $50,000 in a romance scam. The victim entered into an online relationship and sent thousands of dollars over several months to a scammer in a foreign country, Upper Ottawa Valley OPP said in a news release. 'Romance Scams cause victims severe financial hardship and personal embarrassment, which, despite massive losses, often inhibits their decision to report the crime,' the news release said. Such scams often happen through singles websites, social media platforms and email, police said.
