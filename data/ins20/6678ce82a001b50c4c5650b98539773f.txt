The Delhi Police have registered a criminal case against the subsidiary of US-based $85-billion private equity firm Lone Star Funds, its American-born Irish billionaire founder John Grayken, and ten other officials on charges of criminal breach of trust, cheating, and criminal conspiracy. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police booked LSF 10 , a US-based subsidiary of Lone Star, and its officials based on a complaint by US-based Hamlin Trust that holds a 33% stake in RattanIndia Finance, a non-banking finance company jointly formed by Rajiv Rattan, former cofounder of Indiabulls Group, and LSF 10 Rose.
