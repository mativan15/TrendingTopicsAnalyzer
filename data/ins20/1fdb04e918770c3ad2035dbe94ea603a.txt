LISBON, Portugal, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A patent can be the most valuable tool to safeguard a proprietary technology. A startup may refrain from pitching to investors for fear that they'll be copied when they are not covered by a patent.

This is an exclusive right granted by a country allowing an inventor to exclude others from making, replicating, copying, using, or selling said invention during the term of a patent, even if it's still pending.
