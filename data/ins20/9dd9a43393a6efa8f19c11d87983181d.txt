Verizon has notified some prepaid customers that their accounts were compromised and their phone numbers potentially hijacked by crooks via SIM swaps.
We're told that fraudsters somehow got hold of the last four digits of those people's credit card numbers – perhaps by exploiting some part of Verizon's online services – and used that information to gain control of their accounts.
From there, the crooks could access the personal info in an account and perform a SIM swap. That effectively transfers the victim's phone number to another person's device, allowing that stranger to use the number and any one-time security codes sent to it to hijack the victim's other online accounts.
