As Christmas approaches, grocery stores start stocking up on holiday treats, and coffee shops replace their pumpkin spice lattes with Christmas specialities. Costa recently unveiled its Christmas food and drink menu for 2022, which features a variety of traditional holiday favourites and intriguing brand-new items to get you in the holiday spirit.

The Costa chain and Toblerone have partnered for the first time to present two fresh beverages this Christmas. You'll find miniature Toblerone bars, chunks of milk chocolate, crushed almonds, and a smooth chocolate sauce pouring from the cake.
