I read people's profiles on LinkedIn and noticed a pattern that most business/data analysts have master's degree. Although there is a mixture of analysts with a BS and MS in BA/DA, it appears to me that most analysts (50 to 60% of them) hold a Master's degree so I'm worried whether I will be able to get an entry-level role in this field? I have always wanted to become a data analyst but the thought of going to graduate school terrifies me because I don't have the luxury to afford a master's degree, especially where I live, living expenses are so over the top.
