BUCHAREST, Romania — Several thousand protesters in Romania joined an anti-poverty march Thursday in the capital to express dismay over the rising cost of living, marking the latest protest in Europe over high prices and pay that workers say has not kept pace with inflation.

The march in Bucharest was organized by the National Trade Union Confederation, Cartel Alfa, which said the cost of energy, food and other essentials are "spiraling to levels that send millions of workers into poverty." Inflation has hit a record high in the Eastern European country, a European Union member since 2007.
