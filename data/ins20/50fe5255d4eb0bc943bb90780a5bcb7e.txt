It is doubtless a positive to see that the Stem, Inc. (NYSE:STEM) share price has gained some 35% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last year have been less than pleasing. In fact, the price has declined 48% in a year, falling short of the returns you could get by investing in an index fund.

If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for Stem isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price.
