Don't talk to me about British Airways. Ten minutes before we got into the cab to take us to the airport, I glanced at my phone to check the terminal number and discovered that our flight to Spain was cancelled.
I wasn't alone. According to the Telegraph website, tens of thousands of Brits were stranded at airports – while, coincidentally, the first cargo of refugees had that very morning been deported to Rwanda. It seems that if you want to go abroad this summer, your best shot is to apply for asylum in Britain.
