A range of food and drink containers that could not be recycled in Palmerston North before will be added to the list of items people can drop off at the Ferguson St recycling centre. The liquid paperboard or Tetrapak containers are often used for long-life milks, juice, stock and other foods. City council group manager for resource recovery Bryce Hosking said the product was difficult to recycle because it was made up of several layers of different materials that were hard to separate. That problem had been overcome in an arrangement with SaveBOARD, which would process the product in Hamilton and turn it into building materials such as ceiling tiles and panels.
