Saka has started all but two of Arsenal's 14 games this season, virtually ever present in the manager's Premier League side.
The 21-year-old was in the starting XI once again on Thursday night for the Europa League clash against PSV Eindhoven, playing 85 minutes at the Emirates despite picking up a minor knock earlier in the second-half.
