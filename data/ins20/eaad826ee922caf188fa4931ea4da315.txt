The Green Bay Packers placed outside linebacker and special teamer Tipa Galeai on injured reserve on Saturday, meaning he'll miss at least the next four games.

Galeai, who is fourth on the team in special teams snaps, suffered a hamstring injury against the New York Giants last week in London and did not participate in any of three team practices this week. He was ruled out by the Packers on the final injury report Friday.

Putting Galeai on injured reserve opens up a spot on the 53-man roster. The team did not immediately make a corresponding roster move to replace him.
