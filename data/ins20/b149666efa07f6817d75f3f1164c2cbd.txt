NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is set to decide at a plenary meeting this week whether to remove Pakistan from its 'grey list' of countries facing enhanced monitoring. Pakistan was included in the grey list in June 2018 for failing to do enough to counter terror financing and money laundering. It is widely expected in Pakistan to exit the list as the FATF's last plenary meeting in June concluded the country 'largely addressed' all 34 action items in two action plans given by the multilateral watchdog.
