Apple's MacBooks repeatedly top our lists for the best laptops of the year, but the one drawback has always been that they come with a pretty hefty price tag. A problem that's not helped by the fact that Apple almost never drops prices on its own products, so deals on these sleek laptops are pretty slim. But if you are hoping to grab a MacBook at less than list price, you can save big by opting for a refurbished model. Apple sells refurbished devices directly, but right now you can take the savings even further with this one-day sale at Woot.
