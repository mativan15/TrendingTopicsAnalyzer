BOWERS BEACH, Del. (AP) — For many, when the metaphorical seas get choppy, they turn to family to find calmer waters.When Capt. Bob Trowbridge of the Bowers Beach-based Captain's Lady charter vessel is dealing with dangerous waters off the coast of Delaware, he literally turns to his loved ones for help. The Captain's Lady, a 70-foot-long, 82-passenger charter boat with his-and-hers bathrooms and a sun deck powered by twin diesel engines, takes charters daily from its Paskey's Wharf dock in Bowers Beach.
