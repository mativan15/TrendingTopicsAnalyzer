The boss of Hargreaves Lansdown has announced he is leaving the DIY investment platform less than eight months after setting out a strategy for the FTSE 100 company that has received a lukewarm reception from investors.Chris Hill, who has led the business since 2017, will leave the group by November next year, Hargreaves said on Monday.It comes despite Hill having set out a new five-year plan for Hargreaves in late February which involves suspending special dividend payments to shareholders until 2024 to foot a £225 million bill that Hargreaves expects from a further push into the wealth management market.
