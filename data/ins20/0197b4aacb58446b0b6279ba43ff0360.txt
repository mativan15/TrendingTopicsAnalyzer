 If you ever feel anxious before an important job interview, Google wants to help you with its new Interview Warmup tool.Interview Warmup (opens in new tab) helps you prepare for a job interview by asking you a series of questions chosen by 'industry experts' to simulate real-life scenarios. From there, an AI will comb through your responses, pointing out patterns and talking points in your response. The idea is you take that feedback and polish up your answers by focusing on those terms.
