Jordan Poole was punched at practice by Draymond Green on Oct. 5 before signing a lucrative extension with the Warriors.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Calling it a 'long' couple of weeks, Golden State guard Jordan Poole is ready to chase a repeat championship alongside Draymond Green after the fourth-year pro took a punch to the face from Green at practice.
Poole wasn't injured by the violent punch Oct. 5. Green rejoined the team after a leave of absence, and he met with Poole in the days before they played together again Friday night against the Nuggets.
