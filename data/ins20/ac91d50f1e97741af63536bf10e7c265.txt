Roberto De Zerbi twisted on his heels and pulled the bottom of his black gilet up to his chin. It was one of the first of Brighton & Hove Albion's 19 shots against Nottingham Forest but he knew that for his team, who have now gone three games without a goal, every chance really does count.Leandro Trossard hit the crossbar but that was far from Brighton's best opportunity as Pascal Gross, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana and even their central defender Adam Webster had opportunities to turn a dominant performance into a victory.
