Las Vegas chapels of love that use Elvis Presley's likeness could find themselves becoming Heartbreak Hotels.The licensing company that controls the name and image of "The King" is ordering Sin City chapel operators to stop using Elvis in themed ceremonies, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported on Monday. Authentic Brands Group sent cease-and-desist letters in early May to multiple chapels, which are expected to be in compliance by now.With Elvis so closely tied to Vegas' wedding industry, some say the move could decimate their businesses.
