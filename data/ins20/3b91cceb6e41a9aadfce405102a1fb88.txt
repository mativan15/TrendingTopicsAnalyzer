Benoît G. Bourgon, a founding member of the Vigilance Lac-Brome residents group, said short-term rentals are already a problem in the town. (Radio-Canada)The town of Lac Brome, Qc. may soon be holding a referendum on whether or not to allow short-term rentals on its territory.The town, located about 100 kilometres east of Montreal, is a popular destination for lakeside vacations. Currently, short-term rentals, such as Airbnbs, are only allowed in certain restricted areas.The proposed rules would allow them in the entirety of the town, a move that some residents said would exacerbate an existing problem.
