There's plenty of Jewish comedians in America, but ever since Jon Stewart stepped down as host of The Daily Show in 2015, they have been few and far between on late-night television.

So perhaps Stewart felt some sort of obligation to address the latest antisemitic outbursts from powerful cultural figures like the rapper formerly known as Kanye West and former president of the Untied States Donald Trump. The host of Apple TV+'s The Problem with Jon Stewart used the opening portion of that show's companion podcast on Wednesday to share his thoughts on the topic, including why he think 'antisemitism' is the wrong word to be using.
