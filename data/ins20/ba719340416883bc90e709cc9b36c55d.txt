People seem to be spending a lot of money on McDonald's Happy Meal toys.

The fast-food chain released a range of figurines and merch for adults earlier this month in collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, which immediately sold out upon its release. Streetwear fanatics who weren't able to get their hands on the capsule are taking to resale platforms like eBay and Grailed, where toys are being resold for as much as $30,000 USD.

According to CNBC, a user on eBay was selling a pack of unopened products from the collection for $300,000.
