An official five-star rating system for social media platforms to indicate how safe they are for children should be introduced to better protect young people online, a new report from criminal justice experts says.The study from Crest Advisory, which began in 2019, recommends that alongside the rating system, compulsory age verification through a national system should be introduced, as should an alert system – run by a regulator – that would notify parents and others about threats on social media.
