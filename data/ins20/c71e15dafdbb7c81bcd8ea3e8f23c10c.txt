The cold war of words between Beijing and Washington over the future of international relations continued this week with Beijing telling Washington to focus its energies on its domestic problems.It began last week during a global summit where the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined Washington's "context" for building a "rules-based international order." And he argued that China poses a threat to that order.It was soon followed by a harsh response from the Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang, who warned of a "malicious confrontation" between Beijing and Washington, with far-reaching consequences for international relations.
