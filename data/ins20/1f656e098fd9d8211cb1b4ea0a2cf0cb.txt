naphtalina/iStock via Getty Images SVB Securities downgraded Zymeworks Inc. (NYSE:ZYME) to Market Perform from Outperform on Friday, noting its recent pipeline updates and the licensing deal the Canadian biotech signed with Jazz Pharma (JAZZ) for cancer therapy zanidatamab. After discussions with JAZZ management, the analysts led by Andrew Berens note that the Ireland-based company is unlikely to exercise its options for the treatment targeting some of the more significant indications, such as breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
