An imbalance in the health care staffing market has been the biggest driver of growth for Plano-based LiquidAgents Healthcare.

'Our growth has been driven by helping resolve the imbalance between supply and demand in the marketplace,' said CEO Sheldon Arora. 'Half of our focus is to take care of health care professionals, creating a positive and smooth working experience for those looking for more career flexibility.
