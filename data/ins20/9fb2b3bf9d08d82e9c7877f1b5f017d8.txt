Florida Panthers

Rudolfs Balcers was left all alone in front of the net as he received the feed from Sam Bennett. The Florida Panthers winger made his way to the crease, gliding in front of Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Felix Sandstrom before backhanding the puck into the net and celebrating with his teammates.

Balcers' first goal with the Panthers put Florida ahead for good in a 4-3 win over the Flyers on Wednesday at FLA Live Arena in the team's home opener. Florida improves to 3-1-0 on the season.
