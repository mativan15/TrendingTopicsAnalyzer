Jun. 4—HIGH POINT — Rob and Lori Crawford came to visit High Point this past week specifically to shop for furniture — a lot of furniture. They even set aside three days for it.

And they quickly realized they had bitten off more than they could chew, said Christina Payne of Visit High Point.

"Like most people, they heard High Point is a great place to shop and find furniture," she said. "They came in and drove around and they felt overwhelmed right away."

Payne has seen this reaction often. There are 56 retail furniture stores in the immediate High Point area alone and nearly 100 in the larger region.
