Damarri Mathis got off to a rough start on "Monday Night Football." Things got worse from there on a historically bad night of penalties for the Denver Broncos.

The rookie Broncos cornerback was flagged for pass interference on the first play from scrimmage, setting up the Los Angeles Chargers with a 30-yard gain into Denver territory. When his night was done, he'd been flagged four times for pass interference in one of the most heavily penalized games in Broncos history. His last penalty kept alive a drive that resulted in a game-tying field goal that sent the game to overtime, where the Chargers secured a 19-16 win.
