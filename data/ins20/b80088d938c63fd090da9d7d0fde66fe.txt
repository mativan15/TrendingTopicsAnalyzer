These last few days, weeks, months, years have been a shit show, and rather than thinking of the real world I decided to revisit a literal shit show and see what some of the cast of Game of Thrones has been up to.Starting with the Mother of Dragons:Emilia Clarke:She's currently filming The Pod Generation with Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a romantic comedy about "A New York couple and their wild ride to parenthood in this brave new world by using a new tool developed by a tech giant, Pegasus." Emilia is also EP.
