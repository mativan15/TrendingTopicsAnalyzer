PortraSTAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG) is an industrial REIT which trades at some discount to peers. Due to a recent slide in the stock price, the valuation has dipped to buyable levels. That said, investors will be wise to temper their expectations in light of the rising interest rate environment, as the growth rates of the past are unlikely to repeat themselves moving forward, at least based on current market conditions. While the long-term future for industrial REITs like STAG remains bright, the leveraged balance sheet means that growth will need to take a breather.
