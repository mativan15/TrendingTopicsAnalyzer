Growing up, Charithra Chandran rarely saw anyone in the media who looked like her.'It wasn't my reality,' the 25-year-old actor reflects. 'I remember not feeling beautiful growing up. There's one memory where I wanted to rub the colour off my skin – I would put my hands in water, and try to rub the colour off, because I was being sold this idea that beauty was white, 6ft, super skinny – and I didn't see anything different.'A turning point came when Chandran saw Lupita Nyong'o wearing a pale blue Prada dress at the 2014 Oscars.
