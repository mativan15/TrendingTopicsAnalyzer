With support for his Liberal Democratic Party plummeting, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday ordered an investigation into the Unification Church, which has ties to several members of the ruling party.

In July, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated while delivering an outdoor campaign speech. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, posted online that his mother made large donations to the Unification Church, which led to his family going bankrupt, and he blamed Abe for promoting the organization.
