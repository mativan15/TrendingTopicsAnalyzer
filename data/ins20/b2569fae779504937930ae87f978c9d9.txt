Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at the Offshore Northern Seas 2022 (ONS) meeting in Stavanger, Norway on August 29, 2022.

Elon Musk plans to cut Twitter's workforce by almost 75% after he finalizes the deal to buy the social media company, a move that's likely to cause chaos among employees, according to a new report from the Washington Post. And that's to say nothing of Musk's plan to reinstate the accounts of far-right figures like former president Donald Trump.



The news comes as Bloomberg News reports Musk is on track to actually close the deal and buy Twitter after months of backpedaling and litigation.
