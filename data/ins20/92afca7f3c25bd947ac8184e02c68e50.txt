Thiruvananthapuram: Veteran social activist Daya Bai (82) called off her 17-day fast outside the Kerala secretariat on Wednesday after the state government gave a written assurance of providing better treatment and care for 'endosulfan pesticide exposure victims' in Kasaragod district. Two state ministers — Veena George and A Bindhu — gave water to Bai to end her strike, which had become a major embarrassment for the Left front government.
