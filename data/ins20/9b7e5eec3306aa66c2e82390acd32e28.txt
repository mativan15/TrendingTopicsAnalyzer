Taylor Heinicke's return to the field for the Washington Commanders could be imminent.

Starting quarterback Carson Wentz reportedly has a fractured finger on his throwing hand that will sideline him for several weeks. If Wentz is unable to play, Heinicke is expected to make his first appearance this season for Washington. ESPN's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday that Wentz suffered a fractured ring finger.

The Commanders (2-5) play the Green Bay Packers next Sunday at FedEx Field.

Heinicke, a former star at Old Dominion, has been Washington's backup since the team acquired Wentz, signing the veteran to a four-year, $128 million deal during the offseason.
