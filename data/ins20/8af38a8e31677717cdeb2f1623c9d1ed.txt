NEW DELHI: The already-beaten down paints sector faced fresh headwinds after announced double the spending on its entry in the business. Termed as a 'Jio Moment' for the Indian paint industry by Jefferies, Dalal Street analysts believe the Aditya Birla Group's foray into the industry is expected to disturb the 'oligopolistic structure' of local businesses. It is expected that Grasim may go for an aggressive strategy (pricing or otherwise). This, Jefferies said, would disturb the market structure which may have a greater impact on smaller players but may also be at risk.
