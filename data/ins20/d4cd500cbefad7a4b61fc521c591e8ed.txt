It's time to get defensive on U.S. equities amid "significantly" rising recession risks, according to Citigroup. The global asset allocation team downgraded U.S. equities to neutral amid troubling signs — including disquieting signs in the stock market and hawkish guidance from the Federal Reserve chair — despite not technically holding a recession in its base case. "While typically equities only peak shortly before the start of a recession, this time it may happen earlier than we expected, potentially because we have elements of a deflating bubble," a Thursday note read.
