In the Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, CDC researchers said 14 of the 17 cases reported international travel in the 21 days prior to symptom onset. Sixteen of the patients identify as gay, bisexual, or men who have sex with men. One of the patients was treated with the antiviral Tpoxx (tecovirimat), made by SIGA Technologies (NASDAQ:SIGA).
