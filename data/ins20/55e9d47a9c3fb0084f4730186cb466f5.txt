Ukrainian energy officials said on Wednesday they had no choice but to introduce restrictions on electricity supplies across the country and scheduled blackouts nationwide after losing at least 40 per cent of the country's power generating capacity following days of Russian attacks. "Unfortunately, according to new data, about 40 pc of the total infrastructure and our generating capacities are really seriously damaged," said Oleksandr Kharchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's energy minister, reported CNN.
