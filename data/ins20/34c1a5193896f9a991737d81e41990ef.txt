Saxonburg-based Coherent Inc. announced the launch of a new laser technology that the company said will improve the efficiency of electric vehicle battery and motor manufacturing.

Coherent (NASDAQ: COHR), which until recently went by II-VI Inc. before undergoing a name change following an acquisition, claims that its new HIGHvision machine vision system for laser welding heads allows for ultra-high accuracy when welding components of batteries and motors found in EVs. This lowered costs of ownership while preserving quality and reliability, Coherent said.
