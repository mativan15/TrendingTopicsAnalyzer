Eight of Cincinnati's public company CEOs were paid at least 100 times that of their companies' average worker in 2021.

Rodney McMullen, CEO of Kroger (NYSE: KR), topped the list of CEOs with the highest ratios of pay compared with their companies' average worker. McMullen's $18.2 million total compensation in 2021 was 679 times that of the median Kroger employee's pay, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Large U.S. public companies have been disclosing CEO pay ratios since 2017.
