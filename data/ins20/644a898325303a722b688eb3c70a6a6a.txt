Award-winning former Associated Press photographer John Gaps III, who documented everything from war zones to the NCAA College World Series during his career, was found dead at his home in Des Moines, Iowa, his family confirmed Tuesday. He was 63.

Gaps was found by police in his home Monday when his son, Ethan Gaps, requested a welfare check after not hearing from his father for several days.

Gaps said it was the risks he took to get a unique shot — more so than his photography skills — that make his photos stand out.
