Toronto police have arrested a 14-year-old boy in a recent taxi scam investigation after a TikToker warned residents about the scam that almost cost her her debit card on Sunday evening.

On Monday, Toronto police received a call after someone observed a taxi cab involved in a similar scam at the Cedarbrae Mall parking lot.
