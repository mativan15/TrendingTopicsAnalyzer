Midtown, Saskatoon's flagship shopping centre, has unveiled a new event space called The Studio, billed as a community-focused hub for connecting and creating. 'The Studio is a multi-venue type of space that can be used by community groups or business groups for a variety of different events,' said Midtown Plaza general manager Tara Faris. 'It could be a business meeting, it could be trading sessions, it could be a craft market or a pop-up market, paint night, what have you. It's just a very versatile space that has lots of different functional layouts.
