SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah is determined to get tougher this season.

The Utes put extra emphasis on physicality in preparing for the upcoming season after a series of close losses led to an 11th-place finish in the Pac-12 a year ago.

Seven of Utah's 16 losses in league play were by six points or fewer so they were only a few plays away from finishing above .500 during Craig Smith's first season at the helm. Falling short in that manner is a feeling none of the returning players want to experience again.
