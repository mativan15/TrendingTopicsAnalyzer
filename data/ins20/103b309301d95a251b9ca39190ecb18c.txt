Stan Kroenke is going to have quite the tab to pay for the Rams' relocation from St. Louis to Los Angeles.

According to ESPN's Seth Wickersham, NFL owners are expected to approve a plan that sticks Kroenke with the remainder of the bill owed to St. Louis for the relocation settlement. That bill will be for $571 million, which is a substantial portion of the entire $790 million settlement for the city of St. Louis.

NFL teams have already paid $219 million of the $790 million, which leaves Kroenke with the rest of the money owed.
