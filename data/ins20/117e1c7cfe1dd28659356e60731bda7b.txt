• ITIL-306 is a novel TIL therapy engineered with our CoStAR platform (CoStAR-TIL) targeting folate receptor alpha which is designed to boost TIL activity in the tumor microenvironment

• CoStAR-T cells demonstrate enhanced proliferation and other effector function, which may increase TIL efficacy and eliminate the need for high-dose interleukin-2

• Patient with non-small cell lung cancer that is refractory to standard therapies is first to receive ITIL-306

• Initial clinical data from dose escalation cohorts expected in 2023
