Fortnite update 22.20 brings back Fortnitemares (Image: EPIC GAMES)Fortnite developer Epic Games has announced plans to release a brand new update for PS5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch and Android. Fortnite update 22.20 has an October 18 release date and a 9am BST UK launch time. Needless to say, as a major update, the download will be accompanied by a period of extended server downtime, which begins when matchmaking is disabled at 8.30am. Anybody already in a game can continue playing until 9am BST, which is when maintenance begins in full.
