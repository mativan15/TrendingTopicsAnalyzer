Published: 08:38 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 08:47 EDT, 15 October 2022 Furious road users have resorted to dragging eco protesters out of the road and begging them to move today as Just Stop Oil blocked busy Shoreditch High Street in East London.In one clip of the disruption, caused by 29 protesters who glued themselves to the road just after 12pm, a van driver claims he desperately needs to get his sick wife to hospital.Tensions between the driver and activists reach boiling point as it appears as though he is driving towards members of the group, who are sitting on the floor.
