Last week, Cisco Systems was on Wall Street's radar following a lackluster financial report that sent its shares on a wild roller-coaster ride.The network pioneer reported 87 cents per share earnings, slightly ahead of analysts' estimates. However, revenue came up at $12.84 billion, well below analysts' estimates.Wall Street didn't know what to do with the company's report, selling off initially and then recovering together with the overall market. Thus far this year, Cisco shares have dropped 28%, compared to 24% of the overall market.
