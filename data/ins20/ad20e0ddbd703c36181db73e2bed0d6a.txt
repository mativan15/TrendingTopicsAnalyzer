Collider.com There are just days until audiences can finally see Dwayne Johnson take center stage as DC Comic's ultimate anti-hero Black Adam. The film tells the story of vengeful Teth-Adam, who returns to the world after being locked away for 5,000 years following his failure to use his superpowers as a force for good. Fueled by a desire to pull the universe into line through his ruthless form of justice, Teth-Adam goes head-to-head with Earth's modern (and much less callous) heroes The Justice Society Of America.
