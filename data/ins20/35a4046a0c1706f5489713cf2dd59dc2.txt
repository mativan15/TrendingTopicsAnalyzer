Political heat in Munugode dipped to unacceptable levels with a tomb of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president, J.P. Nadda springing up in the middle of a road in Marriguda under Choutuppal on Thursday. Unidentified persons dug a grave with a photo of Mr. Nadda set atop it along with flowers and a banner that read Regional Fluoride Mitigation and Research Centre. Though some persons claiming to be fluoride victims are said to be behind it, the BJP said such cheap politics was the handiwork of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS).
