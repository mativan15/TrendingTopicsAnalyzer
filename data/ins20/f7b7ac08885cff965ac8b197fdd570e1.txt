THG shares have jumped on the news that Japan's SoftBank will sell its stake in the troubled British online shopping group to its co-founder Matthew Moulding and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.The move has cemented Moulding's control of THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, which owns a range of internet health and beauty retailers, and ended speculation about SoftBank's disastrous investment.The Japanese firm, run by its founder, Masayoshi Son, is offloading its stake – once worth £500m – for just £31m, making a loss of £450m on its investment.
