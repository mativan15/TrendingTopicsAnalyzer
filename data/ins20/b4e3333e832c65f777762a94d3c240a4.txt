Regi Davis was eating at a restaurant in South Dakota during the iconic Sturgis Motorcycle Rally when he saw someone who looked familiar walk in and sit down a few tables away. Davis eyed them and let out a pirate's greeting used between passengers on the High Seas Rally, a motorcycle rally on a cruise ship he had been on many times."I look, and I go, 'Arrrgh,' and they 'Arrrgh!' ... and so that's how we figured out our common connection," the 58-year-old told USA TODAY.Davis, who is a riding academy manager at Adamec Harley-Davidson, has been riding since the early 1980s.
