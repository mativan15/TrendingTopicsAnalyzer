NEW BEDFORD — The Whaling City will, for a brief moment, be at the center of one international political race when Thelma Cabrera comes to town on Oct. 26.

Cabrera, an indigenous woman of Mayan Mam ancestry, will speak at the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores on Acushnet Avenue at 6 p.m.

"We are not bringing her here to get votes or fundraise," Adrian Ventura, director of CCT, said in Spanish. "We want her to motivate our youth."

Cabrera is widely expected to run in the nation's 2023 general elections; her second attempt for the office.
