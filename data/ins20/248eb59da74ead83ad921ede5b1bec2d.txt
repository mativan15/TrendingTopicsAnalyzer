After a two-year absence, hundreds gathered for a fish-filled dinner Saturday as Barrie's annual Lobsterfest returned. The event has been a tradition for 43 years, organized by the Barrie-Huronia Rotary Club. On the menu was a 1.5 lb lobster featuring live entertainment and a live auction. With tickets sold out this year, it serves as a vital source of funds for the club's work. "The city is a beneficiary of a number of our projects, and it's a win-win for both," says Sherri Maynard, the incoming president of the club.
