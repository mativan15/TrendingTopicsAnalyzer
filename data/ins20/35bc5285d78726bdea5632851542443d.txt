The web hosting world is large and varied, with many services competing for your trust and dollars. There are plenty of worthy choices, and AccuWeb Hosting ranks among them, thanks to its many robust hosting plans that offer plenty of flexibility. In fact, AccuWeb Hosting's dedicated hosting packages are so well rounded that they get our Editors' Choice nod. Although the service lacks month-by-month shared hosting payment options, and its Windows plans lack the ability to create unlimited email accounts, AccuWeb is still one of the best web hosting services around.
