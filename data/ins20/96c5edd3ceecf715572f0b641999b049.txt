Amanda Tischler, senior vice president of marketing, Washington Capitals

Whether she brought the parent company of the Washington Capitals good luck, or her timing was just a coincidence, Amanda Tischler started working for Monumental Sports & Entertainment at just the right time.

The Potomac native, trained journalist and hockey enthusiast left Major League Baseball Advanced Media to join the Caps in 2017 — arriving just in time to welcome the franchise's first Stanley Cup.

In her current role as senior vice president for marketing at one of the top revenue generators in the National Hockey League, she's led noteworthy efforts like the development of new jersey designs and experiential marketing efforts like the All Caps holiday display that took over The Wharf last December.
