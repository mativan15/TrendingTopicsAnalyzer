The Supreme Court has asked the CBI and the ED to sit together within a week and share material with regard to the money transactions and disclosures made by Mainak Mehta, brother in-law of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, who is an accused in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli also asked Mainak Mehta to share with the CBI whatever relevant information he has on the bank accounts investigated by the probe agency. It was hearing a CBI plea challenging the August 23 order of the Bombay High Court by which Mehta was allowed to travel to Hong Kong and stay there for three months.
