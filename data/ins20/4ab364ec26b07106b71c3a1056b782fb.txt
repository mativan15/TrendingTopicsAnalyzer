The Indianapolis Colts signed wide receiver Keke Coutee from the practice squad to the active roster, waived offensive tackle Luke Tenuta, and elevated running backs Phillip Lindsay and D'Vonte Price ahead of the Week 6 matchup with the Jacksonville Jaguars, the team announced Saturday.
Given the news that both Jonathan Taylor (ankle) and Nyheim Hines (concussion) were ruled out Saturday, it makes sense that the Colts would elevate both Lindsay and Price to the active roster for the game.

This is Lindsay's second standard elevation and Price's first of the season.
