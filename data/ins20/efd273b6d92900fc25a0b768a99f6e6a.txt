Dustin Johnson's flip-flop came with a heavy price tag.
The Telegraph in the UK is reporting that LIV Golf, the upstart golf league backed by the Saudi government and fronted by Greg Norman that is seeking to disrupt the PGA Tour, paid Johnson 'around' £100 million — or about $125 million — to join their series.
Big bucks are certainly in play. Golfing legend Jack Nicklaus recently said that he was offered 'something in excess of $100 million' to head up the league. That role eventually went to Norman.
