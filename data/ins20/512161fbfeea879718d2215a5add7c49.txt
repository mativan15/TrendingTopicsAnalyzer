Finding the right monitor can be hard work, especially if you're looking for one that can deliver the ultimate gaming experience. Fortunately for you, we've got an awesome deal on tap. Amazon's selling the AOC CU34G2X ultrawide curved gaming monitor for $327.59. That's a savings of $72.40, and far and away the cheapest price this monitor has even been on Amazon. (We've had our eye on it for a while.) Not only is this monitor adjustable and the design frameless, but the specs are solid as well.

The 34-inch AOC gaming monitor has an ultrawide 3440×1440 resolution, a one millisecond response time, a 1500R curvature, and a 144Hz refresh rate.
