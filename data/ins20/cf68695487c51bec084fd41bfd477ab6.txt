Manitoba is giving $200,000 to The Link for Youth programming in Thompson, Families Minister Rochelle Squires announced Monday.
The money is going to the StreetReach North team to provide enhanced mental health, cultural sports and programming to at-risk youth in Thompson and surrounding communities.'Our government is committed to working collaboratively with service providers to offer a comprehensive, coordinated community response strategy that addresses the sexual exploitation victimization of children and youth,' Squires said.
