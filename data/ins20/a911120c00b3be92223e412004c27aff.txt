The Issue: Mayor Adams' comments about the record-high number of deaths in the subway this year.
Nine people have been murdered in New York City's subways so far this year, including a victim thrown on the tracks at the Jackson Heights station on Oct. 17 ('How Many Subway Slays Does It Take?' Nicole Gelinas, PostOpinion, Oct. 17).
