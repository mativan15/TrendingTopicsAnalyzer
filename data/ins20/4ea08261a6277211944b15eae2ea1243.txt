AgenciesPunjab and Haryana high courtThe Punjab and Haryana High Court was on Thursday informed that the security cover of 424 protectees which was scaled down on a temporary basis will be restored from June 7. The Punjab government last week had pruned the security cover of 424 people, including Punabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who was shot dead on Sunday. Punjab's senior deputy advocate general Gaurav Dhuriwala told the High Court about this after a petition of former deputy chief minister O P Soni against the withdrawal of his security came up for a hearing in the court of Justice Raj Mohan Singh.
