Mary Berry calls this 'a quick and easy midweek pasta dish'.She says: 'Adding peas to the pesto gives a lovely natural fresh flavour. Use fresh garden peas, if you grow them, instead of petits pois. We have used cashew nuts instead of pine nuts in the pesto to give creaminess to the sauce.'Serves: 4-6Ingredients:350g spaghettiFor the pea pesto:250g frozen petits pois115g unsalted cashew nuts55g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve (optional)2 large garlic cloves, halvedLarge bunch of basil, roughly chopped100ml olive oilMethod:1.
