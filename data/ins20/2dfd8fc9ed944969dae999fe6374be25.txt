Stockland has launched an incubator initiative it calls S Connect Starter aimed at assisting small businesses to grow and gain exposure and experience in its shopping centres. The program provides businesses with an opportunity to partner with Stockland to overcome traditional barriers to launching retail stores by giving them access to shopping centres. First-time retailers will get advice on operations, marketing and financing on their retail journey through a dedicated lease agreement in a Stockland centre, along with assistance and guidance provided by mentors.
