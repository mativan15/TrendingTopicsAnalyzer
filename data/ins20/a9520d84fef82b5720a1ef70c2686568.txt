The co-founder of Carzam has blamed the collapse of the used-car dealer on Alex Chesterman's handling of the rival company Cazoo.Peter Waddell, 56, launched the Peterborough-based Carzam 18 months ago alongside John Bailey, the former boss of Manheim auctions, with the promise of delivering used cars nationwide within 24 hours. Together they invested £50 million. However, the business entered voluntary receivership last week.Waddell told The Times that Carzam could not raise funding to expand after the shares of Cazoo, a UK dealer that was listed by Chesterman in New York, have slumped since it floated in August last year.
