The fight against inflation shouldn't be at the cost of economic growth is what seems to be the RBI's approach as it manages the delicate balancing act to bring down prices even when the economy is still not completely out of the woods. "It can't be a situation where the operation is successful and the patient is dead," said RBI governor, Shaktikanta Das, in an exclusive interview to The Economic Times.

The RBI governor justified the off-cycle announcement on rate hike by stating that the action was merited so as to avoid a bigger shock in the June policy.
