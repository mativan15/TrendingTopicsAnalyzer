Almost 55,000 retired teachers could potentially receive new payments to supplement pensions under a new proposal through the California State Legislature. Named Senate Bill 868, this proposal would provide quarterly payments to teachers who retired before 1999, aimed at offsetting inflation. The proposal, introduced by Senator Dave Cortese, would provide additional payments on top of two other inflation-based CalSTRS benefits.
