By LIU YINMENG in Los Angeles | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2022-06-06 08:08 Share - WeChat The Summit of the Americas is shaping up to be a diplomatic blunder that threatens to erode regional ties that the United States had hoped to restore in the Western Hemisphere, analysts and experts said ahead of the conference being held this week.
"The Summit of the Americas has become the Summit of Friends of Washington. It represents an embarrassing failure for the United States, since so many countries are either not sending their leaders, or are sending a lesser representation of their government," John Kirk, a Latin America studies professor at Dalhousie University in Canada, told China Daily.
