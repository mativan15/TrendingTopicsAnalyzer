The United Nations recently declared that access to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a universal human right. The declaration was the result of a hard-fought global campaign, coming hot on the heels of the UN Human Rights Council's recognition of the right last year. It's been a long road to get here, as the right was first recognized 50 years ago in the landmark Stockholm Declaration. You might hear this news and wonder what it will mean. After all, UN member states don't have to comply with the resolution.
