May 31—GOSHEN — A Millersburg firm has been chosen to oversee a new fiber project in Elkhart.

During their meeting Tuesday morning, the Elkhart County Board of Commissioners voted to award the fiber project contract to Millersburg-based Mr. Underground Inc. at a cost of $410,196.

According to Elkhart County Administrator Jeff Taylor, Mr. Underground's bid was the lowest of two bids recently submitted to the Elkhart County Highway Department for the project.

"The highway department took bids recently for a redundant fiber project that is in the general vicinity of Elkhart," Taylor told the commissioners.
