Billionaire Radhakishan Damani-led , which runs the DMart brand of retail stores, came out with a mixed set of earnings for the September quarter. Besides its expensive valuations, analysts said new growth triggers were missing in the consistently compounding stock. "The stock could take a breather on the back of the September quarter report that was relatively lacklustre. Normalised growth in sales per-store (3-year CAGR) improved a tad to 3% vs 2% seen in recent quarters," 's Richard Liu said. DMart's Q2 sales were up 37% year-on-year (YoY) at Rs 10,638 crore due to a tepid base while the profit jumped 64% YoY, aided by tax reversal in respect of earlier years.
