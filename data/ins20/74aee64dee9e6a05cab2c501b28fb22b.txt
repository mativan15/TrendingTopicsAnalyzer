A central team analyses the moisture content of paddy grains brought by farmers for sale at the direct purchase centre at Vannarappettai near Thanjavur.
A team of officials deputed by the Centre to assess the veracity of the Tamil Nadu government's plea to raise the moisture content percentage of paddy procured through direct purchase centres (DPCs) in the State visited a few DPCs in Thanjavur district on Saturday.Delta farmers who have taken up ‘kuruvai' paddy cultivation, a kharif crop, on a larger area this season in view of the early release of water for irrigation from Stanley Reservoir in May found themselves in a piquant situation as the State-owned Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, which acts as an intermediary for Food Corporation of India in paddy procurement, refused to accept paddy with more than 17% of moisture content.
