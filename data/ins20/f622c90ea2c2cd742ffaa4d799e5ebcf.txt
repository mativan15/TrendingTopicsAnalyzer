A seated Mr Xi was filmed holding papers down on the desk as Mr Hu tried to grab them.
Mr Hu patted Mr Li's shoulder as he left, as most of his colleagues stared firmly ahead.
The week-long Congress occurred mostly behind closed doors, but Mr Hu's departure occurred shortly after journalists were allowed in to cover the closing ceremony.
'Hard to draw solid conclusions'
Authorities offered no explanation for Mr Hu's exit, which came just before the 2,300 delegates at the Congress voted unanimously to endorse Mr Xi's "core" leadership position.
