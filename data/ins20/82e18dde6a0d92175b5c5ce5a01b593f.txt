A 12 member of experts on labor formed by President Yoon Suk-yeol holding its firts meeting in July in Seoul. [YONHAP] Labor regulations should be relaxed, especially the capping of the workweek at 52 hours, according to a group assembled by the president. The Future Labor Market Society, headed by Sookmyung Women's University business management professor Kwon Soon-won, released its findings outlining a general framework for the administration's labor policies. It noted the need to increase autonomy of workers to prevent side effects caused by rigid and unilaterally applied labor policies and to increase the choices that workers can make.
