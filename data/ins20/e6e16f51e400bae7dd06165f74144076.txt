A former Alameda County supervisor who championed some of the East Bay's biggest transportation projects over his 24 years in public service ended a brief retirement by landing an up to $197,000 lobbying contract for a multi-billion dollar rail project that he spearheaded during his time in office.
The contract, which was awarded in February, puts Scott Haggerty on the payroll of Valley Link – a passenger rail project connecting Stockton to the East Bay – which he once led as board chair and played a key role in seeding with hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money.
