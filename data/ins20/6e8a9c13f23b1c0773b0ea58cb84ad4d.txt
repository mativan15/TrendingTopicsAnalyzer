Lithium mining stocks have been having a great year. Shares of the three largest lithium producers listed on a major U.S. stock exchange -- Albemarle (ALB -8.80%), Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM -6.25%), or SQM, and Livent (LTHM -14.44%) -- returned 57%, 155%, and 63%, respectively, over the one-year period through May 31. The S&P 500 index returned negative 0.3% over this period.
The rising demand for lithium is primarily being driven by growing consumer adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).
