6:18 PM ETBefore Swiss snowboarder Jan Scherrer went to Beijing for his third Olympics in February, he made an agreement with his wife, Sasha. If he were to win a medal in Beijing, something he hadn't done in either of his previous two Olympic Games, he would have to get whatever tattoo she wanted."I thought, 'Well if I end up in the top three, I'm not going to care about anything anyway,' so I said yes," Scherrer said this week in an Instagram video.As fate would have it, the now-28-year-old Scherrer earned the bronze medal in the halfpipe, and eight months later he made good on his promise to his wife.
