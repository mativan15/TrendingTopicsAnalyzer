Hunter Biden made about $11 million in six years from 2013 to 2018 but spent so freely that by early 2019 he was turning to his father to pay off debts of more than $800,000.An analysis of Hunter Biden's emails and other documents reveals that the bulk of his income came from his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company and two deals with Chinese business interests.His spending is harder to fathom but included expensive homes and cars, and failed business ventures, as well hundreds of thousands of dollars squandered in strip clubs and on addictions to drugs and alcohol, according to his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, in her memoir If We Break.
