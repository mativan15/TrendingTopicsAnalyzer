OCALA, Fla. — Cannabis will soon be sold at dispensaries adjacent to some Circle K stores in Florida.

Green Thumb, a Chicago-based national cannabis consumer packaged goods company, is opening a manufacturing plant in Ocala, 60 miles northwest of Orlando, later this year. It will be producing cannabis products to be sold in its new "RISE Express" locations, all in Florida.

Those RISE Express dispensaries will be located adjacent to some Circle K stores. The dispensaries will have a separate entrance and cannot be entered from inside the Circle K.
