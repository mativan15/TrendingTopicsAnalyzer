In a speech on September 1st, President Joe Biden declared that American democracy was under attack from Donald Trump and his supporters, who still falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen. Is Mr Biden right? Many people who support Mr Trump's version of events are running for positions in local government that help administer elections, including as secretaries of state, who oversee the certification of election results. Election officials have been threatened and intimidated by Mr Trump's supporters; a swathe of new voting restrictions have been implemented across the country by Republicans.
