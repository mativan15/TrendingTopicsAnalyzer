A Scottish man detained in India for nearly five years has been told he will finally go on trial next month to face murder and terrorism charges

The family of Jagtar Singh Johal, 35, claim he was abducted and tortured by police in the state of Punjab.

Successive British prime ministers have raised the case of Mr Johal, from Dumbarton, with the Indian authorities.

The Indian government has denied he was tortured or mistreated.

At the time of detention in 2017, Mr Johal was an active blogger and campaigner for Sikh human rights, which are said to have brought him to the attention of the Indian authorities.
