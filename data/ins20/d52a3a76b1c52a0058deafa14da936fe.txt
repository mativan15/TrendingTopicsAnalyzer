Little Simz has won the Mercury Prize 2022 best British album of the year.
The singer beat fellow nominees Fergus McCreadie, Gwenno, Harry Styles, Jessie Buckley & Bernard Butler, Joy Crookes, Kojey Radical, Nova Twins, Sam Fender, Self Esteem, Wet Leg, and Yard Act.
The event, hosted at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, west London, was initially scheduled to take place last month, however, organisers postponed the event following the death of the Queen on September 8.
It was cancelled at the last minute shortly after news broke that the late monarch had died death, prompting the start of a national period of mourning.
