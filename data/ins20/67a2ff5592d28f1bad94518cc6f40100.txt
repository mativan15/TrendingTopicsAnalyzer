The Wrap Universal/Blumhouse's 'Halloween Ends' is still going to turn a sizable profit with an estimated 43 million opening weekend, but its day-and-date release on Peacock and weak reviews from critics and audiences alike are already having an impact.Prior to release, the final installment in David Gordon Green's 'Halloween' reboot trilogy was projected to open to 50 million, matching the 49.4 million opening of last year's 'Halloween Kills,' which was also a day-and-date release.
