The man who succeeded Stephen Harper to represent southwest Calgary in Parliament and who led the charge for former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole's leadership review is retiring at the end of 2022.
Calgary Heritage MP Bob Benzen made the announcement late Thursday, calling his service of the riding 'an honour and a privilege.''As a Member of Parliament, I have always voted with the best interests of Calgary and Alberta in mind, while staying true to my constituents and my conscience,' Benzen said.
