SANTA ANA (CNS) - An attorney said in court Friday that Singer Cardi B repeatedly "blew off" an RVCA marketing employee's attempts to change her debut album cover because the photoshopping of a tattoo on a model made some people mistakenly think the tattoo artist was performing a sex act with her. Kevin Michael Brophy Jr. is suing Belcalis Almanzar, known by her stage name Cardi B, alleging his privacy was invaded. The official claims in the federal lawsuit before a jury in a Santa Ana courtroom are misappropriation of a likeness, use of a likeness in violation of state law and false light.
