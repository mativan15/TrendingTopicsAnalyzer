A sharp rally in the broad U.S. stock market over the last week in May was not enough to save star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund from notching its seventh straight month of losses, extending the longest losing streak in its history. The ARK Innovation fund, which garnered billions of dollars from retail investors in 2020 as it soared during the COVID-19 pandemic rally, fell 6.6% in May. That decline came on the heels of a nearly 29% tumble in April, the worst in the fund's history.
