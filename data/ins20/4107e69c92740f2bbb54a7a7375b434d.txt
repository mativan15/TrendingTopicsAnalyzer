Frankie and JessBy Tia JamesOct 20, 2022My dearest friend (Army Vet) has been busting his tail!! This is my friend's little brother; John.  They both are kick a** servers, and my friend has been working double shifts to pay his I own bills AND his brother's (HUGE Shout out to DREW at the Taylorsville Texas Roadhouse ❤🤍💙 Sunday-Wednesday normally) medical expenses....... I worked with Drew to help stock his apartment with some food. It's been a slow process but the turtle 🐢 won the race 🏁 right?? My friend has his own medical issues and is still doing what he can to make sure his little brother is taken care of.
