Erik ten Hag already has a future Manchester United legend in his ranks: Marcus Rashford. That's according to Ander Herrera, who's heaped praise on his former teammate. Herrera spent more than three years as Rashford's pal in the Old Trafford dressing room, witnessing first-hand his meteoric rise from academy prodigy to senior star. Now 24, the Mancunian native remains an integral part of the Red Devils' squad, now under his third permanent manager in Ten Hag and playing alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo.
