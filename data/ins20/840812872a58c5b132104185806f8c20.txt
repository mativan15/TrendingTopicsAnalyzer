The September hiring rate was the highest since March and helped push the unemployment rate down two-tenths of a percentage point to 3.4 percent, the lowest since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. The national rate was 3.5 percent in September.But 13,500 people left the work force, meaning they didn't have a job and were no longer looking for one. That was the largest decline since January 2021, and left the state's labor pool with 2,000 fewer workers than at the start of the year.The labor force participation rate, the share of working-age population employed and unemployed, decreased by two-tenths of a percentage point to 65.
