The newest crypto on the block, Aptos, launched its mainnet this week to considerable buzz around its token airdrop to early users, but also questions about whether the network—which has raised $350 million in VC funding—can live up to the hype about its tech.

The blockchain's first real test may come soon, however, as a rush of NFT projects prepare to launch on the network. NFT trading has in the past put the Ethereum and Solana networks under considerable stress, so how will Aptos hold up if demand for its NFTs matches the buzz?

The Aptos launch came with sizable expectations, in part due to the ample VC funding and also its origins from Facebook's scrapped Diem initiative.
