The Cleveland Browns continue to spend money to retain their young core. In the last few years, the team has inked Myles Garrett, Nick Chubb, Joel Bitonio, Wyatt Teller and Denzel Ward to big money deals. They also gave Deshaun Watson a big new contract upon acquiring him.
Now, after earlier reports that the two sides were close on a deal, the Browns have inked TE David Njoku to a four-year deal with over $56 million.
Njoku hinted at him signing shortly after Cleveland brought back DE Jadeveon Clowney at the start of the week.
