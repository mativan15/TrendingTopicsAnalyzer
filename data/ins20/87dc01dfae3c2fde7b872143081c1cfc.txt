Mehsana resident Arvind Patel, who is into the business of decorating 'mandaps' for events and gatherings, borrowed Rs 7.2 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY). He used the loan to expand his business. 'Earlier we used to employ eight persons, now we employ 12,' Arvind said as he virtually interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 'Garib Kalyan Sammelan' Tuesday.
When PM Modi asked if he was returning the loan to the bank on time, Arvind replied in the affirmative. In response, the PM appreciated the small-time entrepreneur for generating employment under PMMY, launched in April 2015 and provides loans upto Rs 10 lakh to non-corporate and non-farm small and micro enterprises.
