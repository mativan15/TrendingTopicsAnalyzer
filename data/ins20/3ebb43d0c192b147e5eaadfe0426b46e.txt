A man who lost $24 million in cryptocurrency in an elaborate SIM swapping scam has won a multi-million-dollar judgment against the thief, who was 15 at the time of the hustle.
According to court documents [PDF] filed Friday in federal New York City court, Ellis Pinsky agreed to pay Michael Terpin $22 million for his starring role in the SIM swap and crypto heist. Pinsky was a New York high school student at the time of the theft in 2018, and it's said he paid back $2 million about a year later to his victim.
