NUREMBERG, Germany, June 02, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--VIA optronics AG (NYSE: VIAO) ("VIA" or the "Company"), a leading supplier of interactive display systems and solutions, today announced plans for a new production site in the Philippines.

In September 2021, the Company incorporated VIA optronics (Philippines), Inc., for the design and development of camera solutions.
