Oct. 20—The fate of a former Cumberland County corrections officer, on trial for the death of a 9-year-old girl, now rests with a jury of his peers.

Kenneth Morang, 64, was charged with manslaughter in January 2020 after Raelynn Bell died from traumatic brain injuries days after Morang crashed into her family's car.

Attorneys delivered closing arguments Thursday morning before handing the case off to the jury.

Morang was driving home to Standish on July 21, 2019, after working two consecutive 16-hour shifts at the Cumberland County jail.
