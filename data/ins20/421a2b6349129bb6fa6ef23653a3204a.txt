You can buy a vowel, but money — or a Legendary Legend Star — can't buy the priceless look on a drag queen's face when she comes face-to-face with an icon of pop culture.

Wheel of Fortune hostess Vanna White made a surprise appearance on Friday's episode of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 7 when she — seemingly unbeknownst to the cast — showed up to the Vanna White-themed portion of the AS7 ball.

This week's challenge winner, Jaida Essence Hall, first hit the runway with a candid admission.

"Vanna White is probably the first white lady that has ever been in my household," she explained.
