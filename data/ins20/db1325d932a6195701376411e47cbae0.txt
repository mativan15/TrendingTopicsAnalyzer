 Get to know Meghan Markle! The Duchess of Sussex, 41, chatted with Variety for a new interview tied to the magazine's Power of Women issue. The magazine announced Meghan as an honoree for the special issue on Sept. 14, though the release of her cover was postponed "out of respect for the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth II," who died at age 96 on Sept. 8. In addition to the Archetypes host, Variety honored Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Ava DuVernay, Malala Yousafzai and Elizabeth Olsen in this year's Power of Women circle.
