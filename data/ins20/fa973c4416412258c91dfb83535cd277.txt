Published: 01:40 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 03:00 EDT, 30 May 2022 Northern NSW towns hit by this year's devastating floods have been left "exposed" by the emergency, which highlighted a housing crisis, telco failures and government missteps in the region, an inquiry has been told. A NSW parliamentary committee is looking into the official response to the flood catastrophe of February and April that struck primarily in the Northern Rivers region. At least 10 people died in the wild weather that forced thousands of residents to flee their homes and left many towns in the region severely damaged.
