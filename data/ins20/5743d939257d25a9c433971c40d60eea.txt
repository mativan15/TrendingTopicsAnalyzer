Recently, the antimicrobial potential of essential oils extracted from plants has gained extensive research interest, primarily for the development of novel antimicrobial treatments to combat emerging microbial resistance. The current study aims at investigating the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of essential oil derived from gold coin daisy, which is known as Asteriscus graveolens (EOAG). In this context, a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of EOAG was conducted to identify its phytoconstituents.
