Rumors about a massive valuation of Second Life have been floating around Silicon Valley for months. The original rumors said the company raised a new round of financing at a valuation of somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion. When I asked the company about it over the summer they said, on the record, that they had not raised new money, but declined to comment further.
Another rumor speculated that one of the shareholders of Second Life had sold part of their stake in the company to a hedge fund or other private equity investor.
