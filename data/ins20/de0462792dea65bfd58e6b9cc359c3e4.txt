For national emotional wellness month, Twitter Inc. has stuffed employee inboxes with tips on self care and balance. The outgoing messages, however, are frantic. With Elon Musk's deal to buy the company set to close in one week, employees are bracing for layoffs — which Musk has been telling investors could slash 75% of staff, according to people familiar with the matter.
