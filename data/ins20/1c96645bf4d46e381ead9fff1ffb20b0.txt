Marco Bello/Getty Images News Cathie Wood, CEO and CIO of ARK Invest has jumped back into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), as the popular fund manager purchased nearly 250K shares on Thursday across three ETFs. Previously, Wood and her team were once upon a time holders of NVDA before liquidating all positions of the chip giant back on Nov. 5, 2021. Since Wood departed NVDA, the stock plunged roughly 40% after trading around the $297 level to Thursday's close of $178.51. ARK Invest grabbed shares of NVDA across three different exchange traded funds with the bulk of the shares going towards her flagship fund.
