relif Earnings of ServisFirst Bancshares, Inc. (NYSE:SFBS) will benefit from double-digit loan growth through the end of 2023. Further, the margin will slightly expand amid the rising rate environment, which will further support the bottom line. Overall, I'm expecting ServisFirst Bancshares to report earnings of $4.52 per share for 2022, up 19% year-over-year. For 2023, I'm expecting earnings to grow by a further 14% to $5.16 per share. Next year's target price suggests a small upside from the current market price.
