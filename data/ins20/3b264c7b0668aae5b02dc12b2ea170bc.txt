Less than a month after Freedom Financial Network rebranded itself to Achieve, the personal finance company with major operations in Tempe has announced that it secured $225 million in new funding to update technology and expand its reach.

Achieve — based in San Mateo, California, but one of the Valley's largest employers — said it raised that amount in the form of a fully committed debt facility with participation of O'Connor Capital Solutions, the private credit union of UBS O'Connor LLC, and others.
