Published: 08:59 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 09:00 EDT, 18 October 2022 Sir Keir Starmer has accused Tory MPs of putting their party's interests ahead of the country's, as he claimed some secretly believe a change in power might be a 'good idea'. The Labour leader suggested many people feel 'the real risk now is carrying on with this lot' after the Government 'demolished' its ill-fated mini-budget, leaving it with 'no economic policy'. Speaking to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2, he said the new Chancellor had 'basically undone everything that Liz Truss said she was going to do' as leader.
