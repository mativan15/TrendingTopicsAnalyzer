Collider.com [Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for Halloween Ends.]Four years after the bloodbath that took the lives of her mother (Judy Greer) and boyfriend (Dylan Arnold) in Halloween Kills, Andi Matichak's Allyson is in a very different place. In an effort to move forward and leave Michael Myers in the past, she's building a home with her grandmother, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), and working as a nurse. A relationship with a Haddonfield police officer doesn't pan out, a connection Allyson seems far better off without, but now there's someone new in the picture -- the town pariah, Rohan Campbell's Corey Cunningham.
