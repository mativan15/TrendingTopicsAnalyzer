Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin may have bolted the University of Tennessee in 2009 after just one season, but it appears that he still has some fond memories of Knoxville. The Rebels, sitting at 6-0 and No. 9 in the country to start their season, are playing their own game against a school from Alabama on Saturday.  Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin on the sideline during the NCAA football game between the Ole Miss Rebels and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets on September 17th, 2022, at Bobby Dodd Stadium in Atlanta, GA.
