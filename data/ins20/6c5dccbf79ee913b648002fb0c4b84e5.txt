The Aurora City Council will vote Tuesday on an agreement with the Aurora-based Community Fund to establish a private fund for the Financial Empowerment Center.

The new Financial Empowerment Center Fund would allow the organization to gain support through charitable contributions, both outright and deferred, from city residents, individuals, corporations and entities seeking to benefit the city.

Right now, the city partners with The Neighbor Project, based in downtown Aurora, to administer and run the Financial Empowerment Center, which provides one-on-one financial counseling and coaching, free of charge for participating residents of the greater Aurora region.
