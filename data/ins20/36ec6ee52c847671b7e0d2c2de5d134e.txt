Shares of Redbox Entertainment (RDBX 24.42%), probably best known for its DVD-dispensing video kiosks, rose a dramatic 26% in early trading on June 2. The interesting thing here is that the biggest news of late came out on May 11, when the company agreed to be acquired by video streaming and content company Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE 4.98%). The details of that deal are very important. So what
Redbox shareholders will receive 0.087 of a share of Chicken Soup for the Soul for every share of Redbox they own.
