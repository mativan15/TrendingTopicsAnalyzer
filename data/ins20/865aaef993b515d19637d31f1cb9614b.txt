Donald Trump has defended Kanye West amid the rapper's deepening antisemitism controversy, insisting that the rapper has always 'been great to me.'Mr Trump, whose daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and grandchildren are all Jewish, was asked by Salem News's Larry O'Connor how he felt about West's recent attacks.'Well, I haven't really seen the statements he's made. I did watch the Tucker Carlson interview and he was really nice to me. Beyond anybody, he was. He was great to me,' said the former president.
