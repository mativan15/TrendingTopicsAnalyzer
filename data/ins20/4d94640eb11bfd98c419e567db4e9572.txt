A sedated patient is lying on his side on a surgical stretcher for a colonoscopy at MNGI Digestive Health in Plymouth.

A doctor, flanked by a nurse and an anesthesiologist, works through the exam. A large screen sitting a few feet away allows the doctor to see inside the patient's body, but it's the small green boxes — periodically appearing on the screen — that represent the new era of medical technology.

Those green boxes are artificial intelligence at work. The device being used is called GI Genius and is sold by Medtronic.
