I've been investing since I was 14. Somehow, that's the last 18 years (how can I be 32 already?). Over that time, I've always had a job and saved, read hundreds of books on investing, paid attention to  stock market news, gotten degrees in finance, and more. TL;DR: I've spent a lot of time, energy, and money on the stock market.
The amount of money I've made investing in stocks in that time (through two full-blown bull markets) pales in comparison to the amount I've made with rental real estate. Of course, that isn't because I'm a genius real estate investor.
