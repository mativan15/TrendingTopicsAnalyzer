The FBI's Los Angeles office has been extraordinarily busy at City Hall, launching probes into councilmembers, lobbyists, city lawyers, political aides and executives at the Department of Water and Power — some of whom have pleaded guilty.Now, voters in Tuesday's election are set to choose a new city controller, a position that is itself something of a watchdog. The field of candidates has been confronting the question: Can the controller's office, which performs audits and keeps an eye on the city's books, also serve as a check on wrongdoing?Kenneth Mejia, one of the six candidates seeking the job, says he has already been doing that type of work, by shining a spotlight on city spending and alerting voters to improper campaign donations raised by one of his opponents, Councilman Paul Koretz.
