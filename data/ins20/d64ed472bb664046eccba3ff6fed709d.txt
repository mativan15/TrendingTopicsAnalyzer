A couple of years ago, Motorola introduced its first phone with a built-in stylus, which quickly became one of the company's best-selling handsets. And now TCL is jumping on the trend with its first attempt at making a budget Galaxy Note alternative with the $258 TCL Stylus 5G.
Featuring a large 6.81-inch FHD+ display, the TCL Stylus 5G provides ample room for things like drawing, taking notes or simply watching videos. And similar to other TCL handsets, the phone features a blue light filter and support for the company's NXTVISION tech, which can upscale SDR content to HDR to improve things like contrast and color saturation in both movies and games.
