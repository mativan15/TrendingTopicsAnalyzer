sergeysan1/iStock via Getty Images The flying taxi market has obtained some very notable orders from the airline sector, yet most of the stocks haven't rallied this year. Lilium N.V. (NASDAQ:LILM) is a notable laggard with the stock trading at a price more like a stock option with a binary outcome. My investment thesis still remains Neutral on this stock due to the limited order book and lower profile than competitors in the space. Lining Up Small Orders Lilium is one of the few public eVTOL manufacturers that hasn't announced a recent order or investment from a major international airline.
