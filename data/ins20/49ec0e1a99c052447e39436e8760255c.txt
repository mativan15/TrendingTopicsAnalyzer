The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. To wit, the Black Diamond Group Limited (TSE:BDI) share price has flown 153% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite. It's also good to see the share price up 14% over the last quarter.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
