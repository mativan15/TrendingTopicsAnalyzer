Despite the pollution, train strikes and expensive rent, London is actually a very magical place. It's actually tricky to walk around the city without noticing the impact of witchcraft; whether it's the slew of mystic shops in Soho or the immersive witchcraft walking tours — Londoners are obsessed with the city's witchy legacy.

We're not talking about green-faced, black cat-holding, pointy-hatted ladies, ‘Mystic Meg', or the people on ‘Witchtok' selling tarot readings for £200 a pop.
