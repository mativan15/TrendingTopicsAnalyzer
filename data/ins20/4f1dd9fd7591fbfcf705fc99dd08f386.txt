CANNES  — Top European powerhouse Studiocanal has renewed its global deal with Nickelodeon which will board Season 3 of CG animated megahit 'The Adventures of Paddington.' Marking most surely one of the biggest single title content deals unveiled at this year's Mipcom, the Nickelodeon renewal for Season 3 comes as Studiocanal has also unveiled a slew of second-window deals on Season 1 after the title's hugely successful global rollout overseen, like Season 2, by Nickelodeon. It comes, moreover, just months after Studiocanal announced in June that Dougal Wilson is attached to direct 'Paddington' 3, the third feature film in the franchise.
