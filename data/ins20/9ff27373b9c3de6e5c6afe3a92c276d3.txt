Slash Film In Ridley Scott's 1979 film "Alien," the sinister android Ash (Ian Holm) describes the killer creature loose aboard his spaceship as "the perfect organism," admitting that its "structural perfection is matched only by its hostility." He also says that he admires its purity. The alien is "a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality." Little else is revealed about the xenomorphs in that original film, with the murderous alien remaining very, well, alien.
