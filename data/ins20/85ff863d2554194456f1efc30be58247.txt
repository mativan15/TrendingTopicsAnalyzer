Brian Close used to say 'if you can't think, you can't bat'. A thinking cricketer is a better cricketer. But I do not blame Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, or any of our other young players for struggling to adapt to Test cricket.
For most it is not their technique that is the problem but the structure of our game, driven by money and Twenty20, whack-it cricket. 
They just do not play enough first-class cricket to train their brains properly and now I read that Rob Key, the director of England cricket, wants to reduce the Championship even further.
