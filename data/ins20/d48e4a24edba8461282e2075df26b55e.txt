OXFORD, Miss. (AP) —Jaxson Dart is warming up to the idea of being a running quarterback.Dart ran for 115 yards, one of three Mississippi 100-yard rushers, and the ninth-ranked Rebels rolled up 448 on the ground in a 48-34 victory over Auburn Saturday.It was the first time since 1976 the Rebels had three 100-yard rushers in a game."You don't get that every week,' Dart said. 'I think the best thing was just about every play you could feel Auburn wearing down more and more.'Ole Miss (3-0 Southeastern Conference) is 7-0 for just the second time since 1962 and first time since 2014.
