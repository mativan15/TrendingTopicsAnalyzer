Fast fashion retailer Missguided is on the brink of collapse after being issued with a winding-up petition by creditors.

It is understood the business could call in administrators as early as Monday.

Missguided was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors.

It has suffered from supply chain problems, rising freight costs and increasing competition from rivals like Boohoo and Chinese firm Shein.

In recent weeks Alteri has been trying to secure a sale of the fast-fashion business.
