England rugby coach Eddie Jones sees his November schedule as a 'mini World Cup' highlighted by a rare clash with the All Blacks at Twickenham, and he has made a left-field appointment to help his squad's development. Jones, always looking elsewhere for gains, has drafted former Great Britain hockey coach Danny Kerry into his coaching team as a training coordinator less than a year out from next year's real Rugby World Cup in France. 'I've known Danny for a long time and his depth and breadth of coaching knowledge will be a real asset to us as staff,' Jones said.
