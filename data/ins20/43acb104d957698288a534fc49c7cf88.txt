The biggest question about the biggest K-pop band has been answered.

The members of BTS will enlist in South Korea's military as required by law, the band's label said on Monday, ending months of public debate about whether the group qualified for an exemption to mandatory conscription.

The announcement of the band's decision — which came less than two days after it had performed its first concert in months — effectively confirms the hiatus that the members had first mentioned this summer. The seven members will reconvene 'as a group again around 2025' after completing their service, the label, Big Hit Music, said in a statement posted on Twitter.
