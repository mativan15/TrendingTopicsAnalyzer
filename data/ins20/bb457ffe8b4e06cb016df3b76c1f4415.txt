Finally, Harry and Meghan got what they deserve: boos!
That smug smile, at long last, has been wiped off Meghan's face. Actual tears, not her usual crocodile variety, welled up. She was visibly unnerved.
Makes sense. Like all malignant narcissists, Meghan is only capable of feeling sorry for herself. Lest we forget Meghan, the grand duchess, standing among impoverished, starving African children and griping — to a broadcast interviewer! — 'Not many people have asked me if I'm OK.'
May I be among the first to ask: So, Meghan, how are you feeling now?
After two years of accusing the British royal family of everything from wishing Meghan would kill herself to being racist toward her unborn baby to being held literal prisoner by royal staffers to accusing Kate Middleton of making Meghan cry — while branding themselves as eco-warrior-humanitarian-mental-health-experts, motto, for real, 'Be kind' — these two get their comeuppance.
