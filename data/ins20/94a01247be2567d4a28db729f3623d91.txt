SOUTHAMPTON manager Ralph Hasenhuttl wants to sign midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Wolves — and will pay up to £20million.
Gibbs-White has headed back to his parent club after the 22-year-old's dazzling campaign on loan at Sheffield United, with a dozen goals as Blades reached the Championship play-offs.
