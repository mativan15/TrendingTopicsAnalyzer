Sharna Burgess has shot down speculation suggesting she's not living with Brian Austin Green.

The 36-year-old dancer - who is expecting her first child, a baby boy, with the 48-year-old actor - took to social media to explain that the reason she is buying a house is because her mom is relocating to be nearer to the couple and needs somewhere to live, not that she is no longer living under the same roof as her partner.

Taking to her Instagram Story on Sunday (29.05.22) to clear up the rumour, she wrote: 'I've been looking at properties again today.
