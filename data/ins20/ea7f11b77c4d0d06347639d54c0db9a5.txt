Los Angeles Rams rookie running back Kyren Williams was placed on injured reserve after an ankle injury in the season opener.

The start of Kyren Williams' rookie season with the Los Angeles Rams got off to a rocky start, to say the least.

After undergoing offseason surgery due to a foot injury he suffered in OTAs, the fifth-round running back injured his ankle on special teams in the first game of the regular season against the Buffalo Bills.

He's been on injured reserve since then, but Rams coach Sean McVay said Williams is a "possibility" to enter the 21-day practice window off of IR as the bye week treads on for LA.
