Crypto assets are to be treated as financial products in SA, to make it easier for regulators to monitor the market and help to safeguard consumers.The Financial Sector Conduct Authority defined crypto assets as 'a digital representation of value' in a gazette notice published on Wednesday. A crypto asset isn't issued by the central bank, but can be traded, transferred or stored electronically for purposes of payment, investment or other forms of utility, according to the announcement.The announcement is the first legal step that was required to bring the cryptoasset industry within the South African legal framework, said Brent Peterson, head of legal at Easy Crypto Ltd.
