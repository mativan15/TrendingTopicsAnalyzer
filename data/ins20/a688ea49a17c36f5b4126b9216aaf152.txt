Despite the abundance of geopolitical uncertainty and darkening economic clouds, global IT spending is projected to hit $4.6 trillion in 2023, up 5.1 percent from 2022, according to Gartner's latest forecast.
So sanguine is the omnipresent IT analyst giant on the tech spending outlook, it increased growth estimates for spending next year, with growth up from the 3 percent it originally expected for 2021 to 2022.
US inflation hit 8.2 percent in September, despite the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.
