Calendly is a tool for scheduling appointments and events. It eliminates the usual back-and-forth emails and messages involved in nailing down time. For example, as a recruiting officer, you can share your calendar with applicants to tell them about your availability. Even if they don't have Calendly, these applicants will see your available time slots, guiding them in choosing a mutually workable time to meet.
This scheduling software removes likely time zone confusion since you'll receive time slots in your time zone.
