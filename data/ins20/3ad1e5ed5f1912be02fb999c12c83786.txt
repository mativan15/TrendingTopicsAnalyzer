Liz Truss has used a minor breach of the rules on the security of official documents as a pretext for further surrendering her government to the Sunakites. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, sent a draft ministerial written statement to an MP from her personal email. It looks as if the prime minister, possibly advised by the chancellor, decided to use this minor breach of the rules as an excuse to get rid of a minister who has openly defied her pro-growth policy of allowing more immigration. That argument appears to have come to a head at a meeting yesterday, when Braverman was resisting pressure from Truss to announce a liberal policy on increasing the number of visas for skilled workers.
