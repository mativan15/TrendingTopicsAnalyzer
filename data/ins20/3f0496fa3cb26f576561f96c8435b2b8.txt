CLEVELAND — The Yankees season is on the brink. The Bombers' bullpen coughed up a two-run lead in the bottom of the ninth Saturday night and Guardians right fielder Oscar Gonzalez hit a sharp grounder through second base to walk off a 6-5 win over the Bombers in Game 3 of the American League Division Series at Progressive Field.

The Guardians take a 2-1 lead into Sunday night's — do-or-die for the Yankees — Game 4 of the best-of-five-games series. Entering this postseason, the winner of Game 3 in a best-of-five postseason series tied at 1-1 has gone on to win the series 71.
