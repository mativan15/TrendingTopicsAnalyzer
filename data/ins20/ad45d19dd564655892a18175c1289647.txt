Out of the Los Angeles Lakers' six preseason games this month, Anthony Davis suited up for only three of them due to lower back tightness.
When he did play, he looked like his old, dominant self, grabbing rebounds with regularity, blocking shots and scoring with ease and efficiency.
The fact that Davis only played in half of L.A.'s exhibition games raised concern among fans, not to mention criticism. Of course, his ability to stay healthy will be a major key to the Lakers' chances of returning to the playoffs and being very competitive.
