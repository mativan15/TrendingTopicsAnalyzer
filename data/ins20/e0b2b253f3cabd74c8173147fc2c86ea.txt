Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan said Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) would develop only when it was freed from the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), and accused it of suppressing dissent against the proposed three capitals.'Protests by the YSRCP against the JSP's stand on three capitals were intended to stifle its voice. The scenes witnessed in Visakhapatnam were due to criminalisation of politics.
