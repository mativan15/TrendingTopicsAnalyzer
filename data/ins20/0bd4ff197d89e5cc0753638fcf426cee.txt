The Dolphins put a couple of defensive players on injured reserve Wednesday.

The team announced that linebacker Trey Flowers and cornerback Nik Needham have gone on the list. Both players will have to miss at least four games, although Needham will definitely be out for a much longer period of time.

Needham tore his Achilles in last Sunday's loss to the Vikings and will miss the rest of the season as a result of the injury.
