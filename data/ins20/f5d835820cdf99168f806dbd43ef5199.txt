Criminal gangs are expected to target entire streets during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend, a security expert has warned. 
Carlos Dhunay expects a 20% increase in burglaries and says his team is braced for an influx of calls from homeowners. 
With more than 16,000 street parties expected to be held over the weekend, this could leave ample opportunities for thieves. 
As people party with their neighbours, many are likely to leave their doors unlocked, giving criminals a chance to slip inside while everyone's distracted.
