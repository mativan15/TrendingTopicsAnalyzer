A 'sophisticated' email scam targeting the Waikato Citizens Advice Bureau has prompted a strong warning for people to be vigilant and not give out passwords online. It follows the hacking of the bureau's email account on Monday, and the sending of several hundred fake invoices and requests for passwords. Scammers hacked an office email account after fooling a worker into giving out their details with a 'phishing' email supposedly from another bureau office, bureau manager Vicky Haden-Jones said. That meant the hackers got access to a list of email addresses of bureau officials and other agencies, but not clients.
