Two new specials on South Carolina's now-infamous Murdaugh family will air in the next two weeks.

First up is a discussion-based special report from CNN called 'The Murdaugh Murders: A Twisted Tale of Power and Money,' which will feature The State's John Monk, the South Carolina Press Association's journalist of the year for 2021 who has covered courts, crime, politics, public corruption, the environment and other issues in the Carolinas for more than 40 years.

The CNN report is scheduled to air at 8 p.
