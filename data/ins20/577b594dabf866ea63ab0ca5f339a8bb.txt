Connected technology company Harman has rolled out a new flexible work programme - 'Harman Flex' - under which all its employees can work remotely forever. This is part of the company's effort to widen its talent pool, while continuing to build a culture of autonomy and trust in line with an evolving global workplace and current trends within India as well.

India is a key market for the firm's business and global ambitions. Out of 30,000 employees globally, 10,000 are based out of India. The new flexible work programme has been drafted on the basis of candid feedback from employees, employee engagement surveys and inputs from CEO all-hand calls in the last two years.
