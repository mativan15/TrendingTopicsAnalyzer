CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's top court has ruled to give the U.S. government 60 days to request the extradition of fugitive Malaysian businessman Leonard Glenn Francis, also known by his alias "Fat Leonard," who is implicated in a U.S. Navy bribery case.

The supreme court ruling was issued last week but only made public on Wednesday by a reporter with official media.

Francis was arrested on Sept. 21 at Caracas' main airport as he prepared to leave for Russia. The U.S. government had previously issued a red flag request through Interpol for his detention.
