May 27, 2022, Nukus, Karakalpakstan – Today, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched IT Women – Karakalpakstan – a comprehensive information communication technologies (ICT) training program for rural women and girls in the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The program provides training in essential ICT skills that will empower women to take advantage of a broad range of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.
Rural women in Uzbekistan often have no access to digital technologies such as wi-fi or mobile internet connections, which limits their ability to pursue formal jobs or careers in business.
