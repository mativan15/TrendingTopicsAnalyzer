Jets wide receiver Elijah Moore was not at practice today for undisclosed reasons. According to a new report if it were up to him, Moore would never be at Jets practice again.

Moore has asked for a trade because he is frustrated with his lack of targets in the Jets' offense, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.

But the report says the Jets have no plans to trade him.

Of course, plans can change: If the Jets get a good enough offer, they would surely trade him.
