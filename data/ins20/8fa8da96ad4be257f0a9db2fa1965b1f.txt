Israel's efforts toward technological solutions for climate change are numerous, and as of this week, world-renowned. On Tuesday, the Israeli climate-tech company HomeBiogas was awarded the World Sustainability Award in the field of Circular Economy for their innovative waste-to-energy solutions that tackle climate change by reducing methane emissions and providing clean energy to thousands of people around the world.

The term 'circular economy' represents the notion of converting waste back into a source of energy with minimal loss, thereby creating energy loops that will ease the demand for the consumption of external fuel.
