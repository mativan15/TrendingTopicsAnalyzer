STORY: Elon Musk is reversing course on his decision to stop funding Starlink internet service in Ukraine, citing the need for 'good deeds.'

The decision came a day after he said his rocket company SpaceX could no longer afford to pay for it.

In a tweet on Saturday (October 15), he wrote, '...even though Starlink is still losing money and other companies are getting billions of taxpayer dollars, we'll just keep funding the Ukrainian government for free.'

On Friday (October 14), the multi-billionaire and Tesla CEO said that SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
