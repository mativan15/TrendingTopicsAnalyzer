After months of waiting, Netflix has finally released season five's The Crown trailer – and it looks like it's going to be one affecting series.The trailer opens with Windsor Castle on fire – an omen, no doubt, of what is to follow.'The royal family is in genuine crisis,' says a voice, as an (even more) dramatic version of The Verve's Bitter Sweet Symphony begins.The camera flashes between all the show's biggest players – from the Queen (Imelda Staunton), to Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki), to Prince Charles (Dominic West), to Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), to John Major (Jonny Lee Miller) and to Prince Phillip (Jonathan Pryce), who are all looking extremely troubled.
