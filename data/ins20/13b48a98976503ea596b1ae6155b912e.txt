The Arizona Cardinals and New Orleans Saints have been mostly bad this season. Arizona more than New Orleans.

As we know from this NFL season, however you played last week might not have anything to do with how you play this week.

The NFL is incredibly unpredictable this season, so it's hard to depend on teams staying on a linear path to the top or bottom. But this much is true: 3-4 in the NFL is not the end of the world, but 2-5 is a really big hole to dig out of.

A pair of 2-4 teams play on Thursday night and while it's a little too early to say their seasons are on the line, it's probably not too far from the truth.
