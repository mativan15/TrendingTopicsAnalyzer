Week to date, shares of Best Buy (BBY 2.24%) were up 15.6% as of 10:31 a.m. ET on Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earlier in the week, Best Buy reported a decline in sales and profits, but its fiscal first-quarter results were better than investors had expected, considering the inflation and supply chain problems across the economy. 
Given the stock's low valuation and high dividend yield entering the quarter, investors took the news as a good reason to scoop up shares at a discount.
