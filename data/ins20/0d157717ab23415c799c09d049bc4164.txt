LONDON: British Prime Minister Liz Truss has enjoyed the shortest of political honeymoons -- her chaotic premiership apparently mortally wounded despite having barely begun.Discounting 10 days of mourning for the late Queen Elizabeth II , Truss had only a week before her political programme imploded, leading to the sacking of her finance minister."That is the shelf-life of a lettuce," The Economist newspaper commented last week.Truss wins a vote by Conservative party members by 81,326, against 60,399 for Rishi Sunak, who served as finance minister under previous prime minister Boris Johnson.
