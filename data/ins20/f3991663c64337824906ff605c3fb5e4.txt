IANSSony headphones.Welcome to our Tuesday Heardle feed. We have got a song that came out last decade by a Canadian singer. We have hints and clues to help you make the correct guess. But before that, here's all you need to know about Heardle and what makes it a music lover's delight.

Heardle is an internet-based musical puzzle created by digital music house Omaske Studios. The game is inspired by internet sensation Wordle, which is known for its simplicity. Like Wordle, you can play Heardle only once a day and without any ads or sign-in requests.
