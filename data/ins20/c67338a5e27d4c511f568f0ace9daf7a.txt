Marjorie Taylor Greene 'came out of nowhere' to become one of the Republican Party's most influential powerhouses, journalist and author Robert Draper, who writes for The New York Times Magazine, tells host Andy Levy in this week's episode of The New Abnormal.Draper describes how Greene, running a family construction business, began to involve herself in confrontational politics around 2017, 'trying to be a right-wing social media influencer by showing up to the Capitol and harassing Democratic staff members' before being elected to Congress in 2020.
