Mick Buckworth, like many of his ancestors, loves being on the land.The farm manager of Rumbalara Aboriginal Cooperative in Shepparton, in regional Victoria, said the skills he has developed – from knowing how to plant 'kangaroo tails' to carefully putting traditional beehives together – were both valuable and satisfying.Buckworth will soon be sharing those skills with a group of First Nations trainee farmers, who will undergo training in regenerative practices as part of a new pilot scheme. Regenerative farming involves practices focused on conservation and rehabilitation of the natural environment.
