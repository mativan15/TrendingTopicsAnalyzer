Many health-care companies talk about addressing high costs and health equity, but too many fall flat in reaping impact, says one health-care CEO.

"We have to clean up our act. None of us is blame-free in this environment of ever-increasing health care costs," SCAN Group & Health Plan CEO Dr. Sachin Jain told Yahoo Finance at the 2022 All Markets Summit.

As an example of increasing costs, Jain pointed to Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla's comments to Yahoo Finance about raising prices for COVID-19 vaccines.
