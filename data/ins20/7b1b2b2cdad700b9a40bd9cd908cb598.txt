Investing.com -- Hurricane Ian's toll on the world's insurance industry came into focus on Tuesday as Swiss Re (SIX:SRENH) said it expects claims of over $1.3 billion to cover the devastation caused by the storm.

The world's largest reinsurer said it expects to have posted a net loss of $500 million in the third quarter as a result and warned that it's likely to miss its profit targets for the year.

'While the 2022 target of 10% Group [return on equity] is unlikely to be reached given the impact from natural catastrophes, the Ukraine war, and financial market volatility, the Group remains confident in the mid-term outlook and committed to its 2024 profitability goals,' Swiss Re said in a statement.
