OREM, Utah — Fending off attacks from his independent challenger, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah worked to distinguish himself from former President Donald Trump in a contentious debate Monday evening.'I stood against my party time and time again to oppose reckless spending. I will do it again and again and again. We need people who say no,' the second-term Republican said. Lee repeatedly said that his voting record demonstrated that he wasn't beholden to any party or politician. Twice he told the audience at Utah Valley University that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators — Rand Paul and Susan Collins.
