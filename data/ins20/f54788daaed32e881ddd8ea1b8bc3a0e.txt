Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker clashed over abortion, voting rights and more —including personal issues — during the first and only debate in the Georgia Senate race Friday.

Georgia is home to one of the most competitive Senate contests of the 2022 cycle, which could determine who controls the 50-50 split chamber next year.

As of late, the race has been consumed by allegations that Walker, a former NFL star, paid an ex-girlfriend to terminate a pregnancy over a decade ago.
