NEW YORK — Emotions are running high after the New York state Senate passed a bill that disallows fossil fuel power plants from setting up new projects to provide energy to proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mines for two years.

Environmentalists and state Assemblywoman Anna Kelles – who sponsored the Assembly version of the bill – called on New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to not only sign the bill into law, but to also deny air permits for bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation at a press conference on Friday.
