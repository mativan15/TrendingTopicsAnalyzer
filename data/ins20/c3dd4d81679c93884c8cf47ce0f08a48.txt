If you've ever had to get a construction permit, you know that the process can be very painful and time-consuming. There are many reasons for this, and they vary depending on where you are located and what you are trying to get built.
Pulley is a San Francisco-based startup that wants to help speed up that process with its 'purpose-built' software, and it has raised $4.4 million toward that effort.
Susa Ventures led its seed round, which interestingly included participation from other investors such as BoxGroup, Fifth Wall, Suffolk Construction and South Park Commons, but also a group of high-profile angels from within the industry as well as in the tech space in general.
