The NHL will have one less winless team by this evening.

That's because the Wild (0-3) and Canucks (0-3-1) are facing off on Thursday at Xcel Energy Center, a matchup that guarantees one slump is going to come to an end.

"We expect our guys to be desperate, really desperate," coach Dean Evason said. "We've lost three games in a row. We have to have our best game obviously here tonight."

Jordan Greenway will return to action, his first game of the season after recovering from offseason surgery.
