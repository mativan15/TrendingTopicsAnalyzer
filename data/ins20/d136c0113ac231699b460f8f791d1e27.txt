As we head into the waning days of October, spooky season is well underway and Microsoft has announced the next wave of Xbox Game Pass games. The rest of this month will include some creepy games to set the Halloween mood, along with a stellar Japanese RPG making its Xbox debut for the first time.The highest-profile game of the bunch may be Persona 5 Royal, widely regarded as one of the best RPGs of all time and the recipient of a rare 10/10 from GameSpot. Most Persona games have only appeared previously on PlayStation, but Atlus recently announced it would be expanding to other platforms like PC, Xbox, and Switch.
