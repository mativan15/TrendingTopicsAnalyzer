The Gunners took the lead at Elland Road through Bukayo Saka but were forced to soak up an enormous amount of pressure, with Leeds laying siege to the north Londoners' goal at times.
Patrick Bamford had the chance to level the scores from the penalty spot but dragged his effort wide, while Leeds also had a second late penalty overturned – with Gabriel Magalhaes' red card also rescinded.
