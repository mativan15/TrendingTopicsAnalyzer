The Thriller Parade will have its 20th anniversary this year, and it's moving to a Saturday night. The parade has gained Lexington national attention, as USA Today ranked Lexington as a top 10 Halloween destination in the United States, according to a press release from the city.

'Zombies will rise again, as the Halloween Festival and Thriller Parade haunts downtown on October 22nd,' Gorton said in a press release.
