Energy companies enjoyed surging oil prices but there was little else to cheer about during Thursday's Australian sharemarket session.All but two sectors finished in the red as the benchmark ASX 200 suffered a 58.1 point, or 0.8 per cent, loss to 7175.9, its lowest close of the past five days.The high-growth technology, payments and healthcare sectors all took a beating as another round of hawkish US Fed speak and a 50 basis point interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada amplified fears around inflation.
