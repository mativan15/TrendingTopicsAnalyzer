Residents of Etobicoke-Lakeshore (Ward 3) will see some familiar faces on the ballot come Oct. 24, as two candidates square off once again for the position of city councillor. For the second time, Amber Morley will try to unseat incumbent Mark Grimes, who has been representing Ward 3 for almost 20 years now. Etobicoke-Lakeshore can be found on the southwestern region of Toronto, bordered by Lake Ontario to the south, Bloor Street to the north, Humber River to the east and The West Mall to the west.
