Chelsea confirmed the completion of the deal in statement Monday. It ends almost 20 years of ownership under billionaire Abramovich, during which the club rose to become one of the dominant forces in the English Premier League.

Abramovich was forced to put the team up for sale earlier this year, shortly before being sanctioned as part of the UK's response to Russia's war in Ukraine.
