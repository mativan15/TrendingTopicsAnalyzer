HALIFAX - A high-profile ally of former U.S. president Donald Trump is at the centre of an academic controversy at the University of New Brunswick, where the administration has promised an independent review of how he received a PhD in 2013. Doug Mastriano, a retired U.S. army colonel, was a little-known state senator in Pennsylvania until he took an active role in the movement to overturn Trump's 2020 election defeat. In May, with Trump's support, he won the Republican nomination to run for state governor, catapulting his far-right campaign into the national spotlight.
