Several Russian oligarchs have spoken out against the war but have stopped short of criticising Mr Putin personally fearing reprisals or a backlash against their employees working in Russia.
Mikhail Fridman, a Ukrainian-born tycoon, was slapped with sanctions by Britain and the EU despite his business ties to Ukraine, and billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has been proactive in mediating between Russia and Ukraine, is still on the blacklist.
The UK Government earlier this week gave the greenlight to Mr Abramovich to sell Chelsea FC, the proceeds from which are supposed to go to help Ukrainian refugees.
