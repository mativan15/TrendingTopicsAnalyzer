Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has warned that the US economy may be headed for a recession as surging inflation is causing too much pain.He expressed this view while retweeting a CNBC interview with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Tuesday in which the banker warned that he saw a 'good chance' of a recession in the US and advised business owners to be cautious and prepare for more market volatility as growth headwinds mount.'Yep, the probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches,' Bezos wrote on Twitter in response.
