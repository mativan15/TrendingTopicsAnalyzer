A warm Thursday evening brought groups of people, with the occasional lone book-reader or phone-surfer, to the original limestone steps at Burnham Park's Promontory Point, a serene spot cherished by locals and tourists alike tucked away in the East Hyde Park neighborhood on Chicago's lakefront.In an effort to maintain the point's historic charm, hundreds of thousands of federal dollars have been requested for the 2023 fiscal year to re-up a study looking into the long-awaited preservation of the limestone revetment at Promontory Point, which has been there since its creation in 1938.
