Chidambaram said PM Modi should call a closed-door meeting with former RBI governors like Raghuram Rajan 'who have the interests of the country at heart'
 

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should immediately call a closed-door meeting with a group of eminent professionals to discuss the situation of the rupee which on Thursday hit a new record low of 83.20 against the dollar. BJP's Amit Malviya trashed the suggestion and said Chidambaram had "some audacity" to come up with the "unsolicited advice".
