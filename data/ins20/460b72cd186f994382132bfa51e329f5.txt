Z Talent, a longtime salon in the Highlands Douglass neighborhood, is closing.

The business made the announcement in a Facebook post on Thursday. Located at 2401 Bardstown Road, owners said the building in which the salon operated was attached to a Commonwealth Bank & Trust Co. branch.

Commonwealth was acquired by Stock Yards Bank in a $153 million deal earlier this year. The Bardstown Road location was one of four Commonwealth branches that were closing as a result of proximity, as there is a Stock Yards branch nearby at 2292 Bardstown Road.
