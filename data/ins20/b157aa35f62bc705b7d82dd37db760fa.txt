Filmmaker Karan Johar on Monday night shared a couplet on his Instagram story which went, 'Mehnat raaston mein dhakke kha rahi hai, aur kismat mehlon mein raj kar rahi hai' (The hardworking and the deserved are not getting their due, but the ones born with the silver spoon are enjoying their riches, unaware of the toil other people are putting in to get where they are). The filmmaker added a post script in the story which read, 'Just heard it, wanted to share.'
The director sharing this post might seem a bit unusual and ironical, since Karan is not usually associated with shayaris, and also because he is infamously linked with the nepotism tag.
