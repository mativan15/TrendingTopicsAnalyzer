Law Debenture stands out from its rivals on account of its unusual structure. 
The £880m trust invests mainly in London-listed stocks but is supported by a professional services business, which generates around a third of its income. 
This gives fund managers Laura Foll and James Henderson the flexibility to avoid higher yielding (or expensive) stocks in favour of companies that pay lower dividends but have, in their view, more attractive long-term prospects. 
The trust has fallen by 5pc over the past 12 months, compared with rivals' 7pc decline.
