(Bloomberg) -- Whirlpool Corp. reported lower-than-expected sales and earnings for the third quarter and cut its outlook for the year, citing softening demand and rising inflation into 2023.The 111-year-old manufacturer, which sells all manner of household appliances from refrigerators to stand mixers, on Thursday cut its full-year adjusted earnings-per-share outlook to $19 from a range of $22 to $24. Third-quarter results took a hit from high inflation that resulted in slowing consumption, the company said in a statement.
