The demand for high yield bond ETFs is suddenly surging. After experiencing roughly $10 billion in outflows year-to-date, high yield fixed income ETFs have brought in more than $2.7 billion in investor capital over the past week, and $4.3 billion in a month.

While some of these inflows are somewhat chasing performance, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas speculated that investors may be turning to junk bonds because they believe the Federal Reserve 'has been too hawkish' and are concerned that the central bank's aggressive stance on rate hikes could wind up hurting the economy.
