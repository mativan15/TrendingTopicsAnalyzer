Farmers say they are struggling to make money growing food because of the rising cost of diesel. Diesel prices increased 72% to $2.64 a litre over the past year according to Stats NZ, taking the cost to fill the tank on harvester to $3500. After housing costs, petrol and diesel prices were the biggest contributor to annual inflation, which dropped slightly to 7.2% in the September quarter. Farmer Hamish Marr, who plants wheat, barley and oats, in Canterbury, said the price of diesel impacted how he managed his farm and the choice of crops he planted.
