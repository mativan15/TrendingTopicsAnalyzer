Buckle up Michigan football and Michigan State football fans, because it's going to be a long one.

In case a bye week leading into the rivalry game between Michigan (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) and Michigan State (3-4, 1-3 Big Ten) isn't enough time for trash talk and stale storylines, schedule makers built in a few more hours for build up.

The schools announced Monday the game Oct. 29 will be played at night, set to kick off at 7:30 p.m. on ABC. The two sides have met under the lights just once since their first meeting in 1898 — that was on Oct.
