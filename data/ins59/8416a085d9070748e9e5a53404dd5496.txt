The licensing company that controls the Elvis Presley name and image is ordering wedding chapel operators in Las Vegas to stop using Elvis in themed ceremonies, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.Authentic Brands Group sent cease-and-desist letters in early May to multiple chapels, which are expected to be compliant by now. But with Elvis so closely tied to the Vegas wedding industry, some say the move could damage business.'We are a family-run business and now we're hanging with the big dogs,' said Kayla Collins, operator of LasVegasElvisWeddingChapel.
