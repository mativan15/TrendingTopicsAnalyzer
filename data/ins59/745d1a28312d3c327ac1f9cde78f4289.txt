The Houston Texans defense has been a big reason why they've been able to stay competitive in games

Even being as bad as a one-win team would seem to be, the Houston Texans still have a few positives to draw from.

One of them is their defense, which rank a respectable 13th in the NFL in points allowed.

Texans head coach Love Smith has a history of being a good defensive coach, and he's been able to get good play from a defense with a lot of young pieces.

They have given up a lot of yards, ranking 31st in the league, but they tighten up once opposing teams get in the red zone, being fourth in red zone defense.
