Matt Jones said it 'wouldn't be a good look' if the US PGA Tour bans members who have signed with Greg Norman's Saudi-backed breakaway league as he insisted he had no contact with his idol before jumping ship to the mega-money series.

Jones, 42, is the highest-profile of the four Australians to join the LIV Golf Tour, which will host its inaugural event outside London next week. The 48-man field will compete for a $35 million purse in a 54-hole event featuring no cut.

The two-time Australian Open champion said his decision was based around his family, given Norman's tour offers shorter events under shotgun starts.
