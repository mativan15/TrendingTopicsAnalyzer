Whoopi Goldberg put remarks made by Meghan Markle about the entertainment industry into perspective Wednesday after the Duchess of Sussex said she cut short her modeling gig on the game show 'Deal or No Deal' because of how it made her feel.

'OK. I just want to say that on that show, you basically had a suitcase and they wanted to know ‘Is this the deal you want or this is not the deal you want?,' 'The View' co-host quipped on Wednesday's episode, summarizing the duchess' job description on the program.
