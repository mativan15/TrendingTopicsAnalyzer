Why is checking the post history always so disappointing? Found out a top poster in an artifact sub is a virulent antifeminist and I just want to enjoy things without men sucking

I know for myself, I have a bias that if I visit "safe" subs that come off as more educated or whatever, I'll somehow magically be able to avoid terrible men and I can just talk and participate and upvote cool shit when I see it without having to go "hey, is it possible this is a man who thinks I don't deserve rights?" I spend a defined amount of time exposing sexism on reddit and when I'm not in that frame I just want to chill and enjoy things, you know?Now I'm not a historian by training, but fuck it, history is cool and I like looking at antiquities as much as the next person.
