(Bloomberg) -- Foreign investors are returning to emerging Asian equities after several weeks of outflows, as China reopens from Covid lockdowns and the dollar pulls back from a year-long rally.Weekly inflows for Asian stock markets excluding Japan and China climbed to almost $2.7 billion last week, the most since February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Taiwan and South Korea saw the biggest inflows at around $1 billion each, paring combined outflows for the two tech-heavy markets for the year to under $40 billion.
