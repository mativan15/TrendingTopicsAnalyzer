The ascension of Coinbase Global (COIN 0.63%) stock after it debuted on the Nasdaq in April 2021 likely marked the pinnacle of the most recent crypto bull run. Peaking at $369, shares of the crypto exchange have had a brutal descent since and have shed more than 80% of its value, trading for about $63. Most of the blame for this lackluster performance can be placed on a weaker cryptocurrency market. 
Coinbase generates the bulk of its revenue from transaction fees on cryptocurrency purchases and sales on its trading platform.
