The number of venomous snakebites in rural Africa may be highly underestimated, researchers have suggested, with far more deaths estimated to be occurring than previously thought.Across the world, there may be as many as 5.4 million snakebites and over 125,000 associated deaths every year, according to a 1998 World Health Organization (WHO) report. Snakebites are a particular hazard in tropical and subtropical developing nations, where there may be a scarcity of antivenoms and a lack of access to health centers.
