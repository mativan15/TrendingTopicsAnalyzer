Millions of Americans who requested a tax deadline extension earlier this year have just one more day to file their 2021 income returns without facing a financial penalty.  Typically, about one in ten Americans asks for an extension; however, this year, the ratio was closer to one in eight.That's because of additional challenges for filers this year that are related to the COVID-19 stimulus payments and the expanded child tax credit.
