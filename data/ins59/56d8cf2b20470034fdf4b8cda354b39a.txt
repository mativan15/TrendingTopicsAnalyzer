The new Turtle Beach Recon Cloud is an all-in-one controller for playing games on Xbox, PC, Android, and mobile streaming (Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Steam Link). This controller, now available in the US, is essentially Turtle Beach's existing Recon but with the addition of Bluetooth to wirelessly pair with phones, tablets, and PCs. The other key component giving the Recon its 'cloud' designation is the simple addition of a mobile phone clip in the box, which screws into the gamepad's top for a very sturdy mount.
