Jen Shah's future on The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City — and in real life — may become clearer next month.
 
But in the meantime, she was spotted out in New York City, despite not being among the attendees participating in BravoCon 2022's official weekend events.
 
"Jen was wearing black sunglasses and dancing salsa to Gloria Estefan on the rooftop of the Gansevoort Hotel on Friday night," a source tells PEOPLE. "There were a lot of Bravo stars and she ran up to Margaret Josephs, Tamra Judge and other Housewives who were there, trying to talk to everybody and say hello.
