Family-friendly workshops on outdoor spaces

Published on 20 October 2022

The MidCoast is invited to attend fun and family-friendly workshops across the region in November to help Council develop an open spaces and recreation strategy.

'We all love the outdoors in the beautiful MidCoast region. Everyone is invited to contribute to this 15-year strategy. We want to get a fresh perspective on how the community uses these important spaces, and wants to use them in the future. This will help us confirm and prioritise their needs,' said Council's Manager Strategy and Projects, Amanda Hatton.
