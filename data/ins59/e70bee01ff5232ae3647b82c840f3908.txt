A new bull factor for the stock market could emerge in 2023 after the Federal Reserve shocked markets with aggressive interest rate hikes earlier this year, according to a Friday note from Bank of America.While most investors pay attention to the Fed's ongoing rate hikes, behind the scenes the central bank is reducing its near $9 trillion balance sheet via $95 billion per month roll-offs of its treasury and mortgage debt.But that move, combined with quickly rising interest rates, is sucking liquidity out of the global market and could spark a shift in the Fed's policy heading into next year, according to the note.
