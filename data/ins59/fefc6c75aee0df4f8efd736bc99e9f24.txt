The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday removed Pakistan from its 'grey list' after more than four years, though the multilateral watchdog said that Islamabad will have to continue its work to further improve systems to combat terror financing and money laundering. FATF placed Pakistan on its list of countries under increased monitoring, or the so-called grey list, in June 2018 for its failure to tackle terror financing, especially the activities of UN-designated terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).
