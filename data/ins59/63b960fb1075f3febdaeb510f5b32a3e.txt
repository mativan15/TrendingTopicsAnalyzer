On top of all that, optics have never been cheaper, and integration between hardware and software has never been better.Celestron's new StarSense Dobsonian telescope is a great example of this. With a smartphone cradle on the scope, and a carefully calibrated app, you can easily find your way around the night sky even if you have no idea how to visually navigate the stars.
