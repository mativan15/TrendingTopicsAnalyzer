We already knew that Razer was teaming up with Verizon and Qualcomm to make a 5G gaming handheld dedicated to cloud gaming. And today, the gaming peripheral maker officially unveiled the device as part of its RazerCon 2022 event. The Razer Edge includes a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a 2400x1080 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. The device runs Android 12 OS, features 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM, 128GB of storage, and uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 chipset. Unlike the Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld, the Razer Edge offers two configurations: a Wi-Fi-only model and a 5G model.
