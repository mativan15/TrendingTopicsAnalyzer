American corporations and financial institutions are conducting a rapid expansion into Europe, using the crisis in Ukraine for their gain, the secretary of Russia's Security Council, Nikolay Patrushev, said during a meeting of the body on Tuesday.Among other things, American firms 'have already taken under their control a segment of the European gas market,' he reported. Semiconductors and other high-tech sectors of the European economy are of great interest to the US too, he said.Russia was a primary supplier of energy to Europe, particularly of natural gas, before the Ukrainian crisis cast doubt on the future of trade.
