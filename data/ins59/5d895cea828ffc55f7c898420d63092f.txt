After losing her husband Paul Daniels a year earlier, Debbie McGee says her time on Strictly Come Dancing in 2017 allowed her to stand on her own two feet.
Married for nearly 30 years, McGee and Daniels first met in 1979 after she joined the line-up for one of his magic shows.
They soon became a couple and went on to work together for over three decades.
However, in 2016 Daniels had a fall and it was soon discovered he had an incurable brain tumour.
He died less than a month later, aged 77.
The next year McGee joined the 15th season of Strictly where she made it all the way to the finale, before being announced as a runner-up to Joe McFadden with her dance partner Giovanni Pernice.
