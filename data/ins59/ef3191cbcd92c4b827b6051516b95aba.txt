Colour images of the Queen during her younger years have come to light ahead of her Platinum Jubilee.
The images of Elizabeth II, who is now 96, span more than 25 years – from her birth in 1926 to 1953, just before her coronation.
The rarely seen shots were rediscovered in the TopFoto archives and mostly show the monarch when she was known as Princess Elizabeth.
One recently colourised picture shows the future Queen recording her first radio broadcast with her sister Princess Margaret from Windsor in 1940 – aired during Children's Hour for BBC radio.
