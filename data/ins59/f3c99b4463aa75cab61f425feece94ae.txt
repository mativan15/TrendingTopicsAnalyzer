OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau privately slammed Ontario Premier Doug Ford for 'hiding' from his obligations to help end last winter's 'Freedom Convoy' occupation in the capital, the Emergencies Act inquiry heard Tuesday.

The comment was included in a typed summary of a Feb. 8 phone call between Trudeau and Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson. By that point, the protesters who arrived in Ottawa in long convoys of semis and other vehicles to demand the removal of COVID-19 health measures had been entrenched for almost two weeks, as city officials pleaded for help from other levels of government.
