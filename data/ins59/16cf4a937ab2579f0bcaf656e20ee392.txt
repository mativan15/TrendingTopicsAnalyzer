Costco Wholesale COST traded as low as $406.51 on May 20 then rebounded to $474.88 on Friday, May 27, but could not hold its annual pivot at $471.70. Costco sales beat estimates but same-store sales disappointed. This was caused by rising freight and labor costs. Costco is a global leader in retail sales. Costco operates 830 warehouses globally, which includes 574 in the USA. Costco has a p/e ratio of 35.10% and a dividend yield of 0.82%, according to Macrotrends.
