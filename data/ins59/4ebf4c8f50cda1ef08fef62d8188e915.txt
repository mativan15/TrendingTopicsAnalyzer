Leon Neal/Getty Images News Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) intends to exit its 32% stake in Haleon, GSK's (NYSE:GSK) consumer healthcare business which is headed for a spinoff in July. GSK said that following the demerger, Pfizer intends to exit its 32% ownership interest in Haleon in a disciplined manner, as Pfizer aims to focus on science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. GSK added that the separation of the consumer health unit will be effected by way of a demerger of at least 80% of GSK's 68% stake; listing of Haleon on the the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and setting up of a level 2 sponsored American depositary receipt program on the NYSE.
