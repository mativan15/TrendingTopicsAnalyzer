HOUSTON — The kid could not even catch his breath before he was tested at shortstop in the first playoff start of his big-league life. If Oswald Peraza did not know that the ball always hunts you when you are under duress, he found out the hard way two pitches deep into Game 2 of the ALCS.
Jose Altuve hit a hard bouncer to short, and Peraza, stationed in the hole as part of the shift, went charging hard to his left. He slid into the back edge of the infield dirt as he fielded the grounder, then spun around as he rose and fired.
