In almost 26 years of living in Israel, I have traveled to Holon but a handful of times. Until my recent visit to the city, I did not know that Holon is Israel's 10th most-populous city (196,292), has the second-largest industrial area of any city in the country, and received its name because of the sand dunes on which it was built – (hol means sand in Hebrew).

Most importantly, though, I did not know that Holon is home to one of Israel's top hi-tech academic institution, the Holon Institute of Technology (HIT).
