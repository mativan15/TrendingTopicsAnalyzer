It hasn't been the best quarter for National Tyre & Wheel Limited (ASX:NTD) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 17% in that time. But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. In three years the stock price has launched 167% higher: a great result. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
