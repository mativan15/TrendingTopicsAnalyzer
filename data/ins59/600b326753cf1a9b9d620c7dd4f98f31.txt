America's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, began running a primetime television ad in the past fortnight featuring a single tweet: 'Crypto is dead'.The statement remained in the centre of the screen as the authors changed and the dates scrolled backward, from this month to March 2020 to September 2017, April 2013 and August 2012.
