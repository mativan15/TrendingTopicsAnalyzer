Washington: Biden administration officials are discussing whether the US should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews, including the deal for Twitter and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, according to people familiar with the matter.

US officials have grown uncomfortable over Musk's recent threat to stop supplying the Starlink satellite service to Ukraine -- he said it had cost him $US80 million ($127 million) so far -- and what they see as his increasingly Russia-friendly stance following a series of tweets that outlined peace proposals favourable to President Vladimir Putin.
