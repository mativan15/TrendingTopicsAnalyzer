There are several new things that BJP is experimenting for the Himachal Pradesh (HP) assembly elections. It carried a consultation process among party workers to select the assembly candidates. It has also collected suggestions from the common man from all the 68 assembly segments of the state, calling this initiative 'Sujhav Aapka Chunav Aapka' (your suggestion, your election). As part of the initiative, the party sent 68 LED Raths to all the 68 assembly constituencies, each of which carried a suggestion box.
