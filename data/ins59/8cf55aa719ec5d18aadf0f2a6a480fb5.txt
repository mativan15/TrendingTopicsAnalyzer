Each year, Denver Business Journal recognizes the region's fastest-growing companies with over $1 million in annual revenue in our Fast 50 awards.

Finalists in DBJ's Fast 50 were nominated and had to submit three full years of revenue for audit. DBJ ranked the 2022 companies based on their percentage of revenue growth from 2019 to 2021.

Each company was required to be privately held, for-profit, headquartered in the seven-county Denver-metro region and had to report an average of at least $1 million in revenue for the three most recent years, with no year less than $200,000.
