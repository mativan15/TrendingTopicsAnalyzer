Oct. 15—MONTVILLE — David Clang decided a few years ago that he was going to attend Norwich Tech and play football for the Thames River cooperative program rather than stay at home and play football at Montville.

"When I first went to a tech school, everybody from Montville was telling me, 'Why go to a tech school?," said Clang, a senior co-captain. "'You're pretty much ending your football career.'"

That definitely hasn't been the case for Clang.

Clang recovered a fumble at the Montville 15-yard line on the second play of Friday night's game to set up the Crusaders' first touchdown.
