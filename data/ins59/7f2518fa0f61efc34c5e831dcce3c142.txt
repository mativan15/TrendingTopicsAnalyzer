A 67-year-old Ontario man is $1 million wealthier after winning a Maxmillions prize in a recent Lotto Max draw. Larry Culp of Hamilton, Ont. said he has been regularly playing the lottery for 40 years, and his personal favourites are the Lotto Max and Lotto 6/49 games. 'I play a mix of my own numbers and Quick Picks,' Culp said at the Toronto OLG Prize Centre when he picked up his cheque for the Sept. 23 draw. He said he checked his ticket early one Saturday morning, and thought he had won $1,000.
