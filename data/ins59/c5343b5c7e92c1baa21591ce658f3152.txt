For those planning on beating the summer heat by staying in and gaming, Walmart is yet again offering a chance to score the still-elusive PS5. The mega-retailer will have the standard $499 PlayStation 5 in stock today (June 2) at 3pm ET, and as with previous Walmart restocks, you'll have to be a Walmart+ member to have a shot at buying one.
 

 Essentially Walmart's answer to Amazon Prime, Walmart+ is a premium shopping service that gets you access to exclusive deals (such as this PS5 drop) as well as perks like free shipping from Walmart.
