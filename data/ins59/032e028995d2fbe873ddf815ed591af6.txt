HOUSTON – Off the bat, Aaron Judge's eighth-inning drive appeared to be on a home run trajectory.

A standing, orange-toweling waving sellout crowd at Minute Maid Park froze for a moment, then found its voice again as Kyle Tucker caught the ball at the top of the right field wall.

On a warm, windy Thursday night, the New York Yankee slugger's late bid for a go-ahead two-run homer off reliever Bryan Abreu became the Yanks' last best chance to steal a victory.

Alex Bregman's third inning, three-run homer off Luis Severino held up, sending the Astros to a 3-2 win and giving Houston a two games-to-none advantage in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series.
