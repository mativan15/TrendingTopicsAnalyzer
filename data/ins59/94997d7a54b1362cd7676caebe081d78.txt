Rebecca Dobson, 30, a critical care nurse at St Thomas' Hospital, and George Jamieson, 29, an architect, were married on April 23, 2022, at Balcombe Place in Haywards Heath, West SussexRebecca's friend had mentioned that George liked her. They were both in their second year at the University of Nottingham and, not by chance, ended up on the same dancefloor. 'We met in a naff nightclub listening to cheesy music,' he says. 'Her dance moves were as daft as mine.'George had spent his teenage years in Singapore, where his father worked in the oil business, and returned to England to study architecture.
