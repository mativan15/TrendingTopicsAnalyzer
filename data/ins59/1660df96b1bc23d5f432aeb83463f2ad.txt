With less than a month to go for bypolls to the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party faces a litmus test as the electoral battle will be its first after the party romped to power in Punjab. The test will be even bigger for Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann who had vacated the Sangrur Lok Sabha seat after being elected to Vidhan Sabha from Dhuri Assembly constituency. In Lok Sabha, AAP had only one MP from Sangrur. 
The by-election is scheduled for June 23. Mann is a two-time MP from Sangrur and had won the seat with a huge margin of over 1 lakh votes both the times.
