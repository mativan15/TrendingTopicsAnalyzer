Albertans accessing Kananaskis Country without a provincial park pass will be facing fines, effective Friday.
'As of today, we are now moving towards having automated automatic licence plate reader technology deployed in the park,' Michael Roycroft, Alberta Parks' regional director of Kananaskis, told Global News. 'We have vehicles out there today, scanning licence plates.'So we're now moving into the more formalized enforcement approach.'That comes after a year of education and raising awareness about the park passes.
