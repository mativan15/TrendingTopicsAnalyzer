A new report indicates the travel industry in Asia-Pacific may be the only one in the world to recover by 2023. This year's "Travel & Tourism Economic Impact" report — an annual publication by the London-based World Travel & Tourism Council — shows that, compared with pre-pandemic levels, tourism revenue in 2020 dropped more in Asia-Pacific (59%) than anywhere else. Recovery efforts in the region were muted in 2021, with most countries there maintaining strict border restrictions. Tourism revenue's contribution to regional gross domestic product rose about 16%, lower than the 28% in Europe and 23% in North America.
