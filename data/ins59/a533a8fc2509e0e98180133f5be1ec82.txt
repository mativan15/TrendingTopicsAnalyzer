The pound and the FTSE 100 continue to make gains today after Jeremy Hunt's bonfire of Liz Truss' economic policies buoyed traders today.Global markets have backed the new Chancellor's decision to axe many of the Prime Minister's tax cuts and spending plans as she fights for her political life.  In an extraordinary 6am statement, the Treasury said Mr Hunt will announce an overhaul of the disastrous mini-Budget within hours rather than waiting until Halloween. It sent the FTSE 100 rising, the pound up against the dollar and euro and the cost of Government borrowing down.
