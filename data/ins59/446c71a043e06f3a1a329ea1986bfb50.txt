The Sports Pope is using his pulpit to ask for more brevity from Bob Costas.
Mike Francesa has been releasing podcasts on the BetRivers network in the near-immediate aftermath of Yankees playoff games this week. After both Games 3 and 4 this weekend, he had heard more than enough of Costas. 
Saturday night, after the Yankees bullpen blew Game 3 in Cleveland, Francesa was talking about Harrison Bader's power when all of a sudden, he broke into an aside on Costas.
'Costas, who will not be quiet no matter what,' Francesa said.
