A WHO confirmed that its Office for Internal Oversight Services was investigating the allegations, but said it could not offer details as the probe is ongoing.
'It has been a protracted and complex investigation, with the situation in the country and the challenges of gaining appropriate access, while ensuring the protection of staff, bringing additional complications,' a spokesperson said. 'We cannot estimate when the investigation will be completed.'
Syria has been engulfed in a civil war for 11 years, sparked by President Bashar al-Assad's use of deadly force to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrations in March 2011.
