Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday lauded the 'exemplary work' by the Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) — the state government's think-tank — and said that the body has played a key role in several programmes rolled out in the Capital over the past seven years, statements that come two days after the agency's vice-chairperson was served a notice for allegedly misusing a public office.The think-tank, which was founded in 2015, has been involved in 70 key Delhi government programmes, Kejriwal said during a press briefing on Wednesday, adding that DDC supplements the state cabinet's work.
