Variety - TV News Following a quarter that saw Netflix release several of its most popular titles of all time — per the streamer's self-reported internal measurements — and a return to subscriber growth after two straight quarters of losses, co-ceo and chief content officer Ted Sarandos is feeling 'better and better' about the company's 17 billion content spend budget for 2022.'Both the scope and scale, as well as the range and cadence of hits is improving,' Sarandos said during Netflix's prerecorded Q3 earnings interview with his fellow execs, which was released Tuesday afternoon following the announcement of the third-quarter results.
