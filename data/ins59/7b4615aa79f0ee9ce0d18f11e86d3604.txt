ClaudioVentrella Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:ISRG) remains strong in the robotic surgery industry and it is well known for its leading da Vinci robotic surgical system. ISRG posted a slowing total revenue YoY growth of 3.97% this quarter compared to its 31.01% in FY21. Grandview research estimates that the global surgical robot market is growing at 19.3% CAGR, from 2022 to 2030. This implies that the market is far from maturing, however, looking at the company's slowing top line growth posts some concern, making this stock unattractive at its valuation today.
