At Gary Vaynerchuk's multi-day non-fungible token (NFT) conference 'VeeCon' in Minneapolis, there was no visible sign of the market collapse that preceded the crypto-palooza.

‘Happy' singer Pharrell Williams had just left the main stage after bestowing the virtues of Web 3.0 and telling the enthusiastic NFT collector crowd 'you are changing the paradigm right now.' Nearby, a line of mostly men in their late 20s and early 30s waited patiently to buy whatever merch they could afford.

And yet, in the prior six weeks, more than $1 trillion in crypto assets had been wiped away while the value of NFTs fell more than 80% from their market peak.
