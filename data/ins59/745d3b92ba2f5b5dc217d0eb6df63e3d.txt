(NYSE:PLTR) on Seeking Alpha since early October 2021 and have been increasingly pessimistic about the company's prospects ever since. Seeking Alpha, author's profile I have been betting on a decline in PLTR stock from the beginning of my coverage, despite massive support from retail investors on Seeking Alpha, Reddit, and other platforms.
