Winnipeg mayoral candidate Don Woodstock says city hall needs a clean sweep. Woodstock said if heis elected mayor, he would get rid of the Executive Policy Committee, '...where the mayor holds everybody at ransom for anything they have to do in their community," said Woodstock. "If they don't - at the beckoning of the mayor - they don't get anything done. That's not democracy." Woodstock also said the process for bids on city contracts needs to be overhauled. "If you were to call any sub-trades in the city, and you make ten phone calls, I guarantee not one of them would have a good word to say about the City of Winnipeg, and I know this because my business deals with them on a regular basis," he said.
