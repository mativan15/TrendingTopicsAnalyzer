LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Legendary bond and fixed income investor William H. (Bill) Gross today released a new Investment Outlook, "50 Basis Deposit/No Return". In this latest Outlook, Mr. Gross writes that the total return bond fund concept he innovated at Pimco, which "worked famously until the beginning of this year" at Pimco, DoubleLine and elsewhere, "have in the last five years become quasi 'index funds'." Mr. Gross believes investors making 401K allocations, and pension and insurance balance sheets, have been "misled" believing the funds will produce a defensive return in times of stress.
