A 27-year-old former Ohio woman accused of luring two men to their deaths is one of the star witnesses in the double murder trial being played out in the Somerset County Clerk of Courts this week.

Jasmine Browning/Hinton was called to testify for the prosecution against her former boyfriend, Samson Washington, and father of her child, Tuesday morning. But seconds after she entered the courtroom and began slowly walking up the aisle toward the witness chair, she balked, turned and walked quickly out of the courtroom.
