The UK lagged behind France in luring foreign investment again last year as Emmanuel Macron fights to win more business from the City.
The gap between the number of foreign investment projects sealed in the UK and France widened after Mr Macron's drive to entice deals through pro-business policies.
France was the top foreign investment destination in Europe in 2021 with 1,222 projects, up 24pc compared to the year before to mark a record for the region, according to EY's annual attractiveness survey.
