 In a rare bonhomie, Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Sunday visited Holy Lodge, the private residence of Mandi Lok Sabha member Pratibha Singh, and invited the state Congress chief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Tuesday rally on The Ridge. Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj and other local leaders also accompanied the CM when he went to Holy Lodge, which had remained the nerve centre of the Congress politics during party stalwart Virbhadra Singh's tenure.
