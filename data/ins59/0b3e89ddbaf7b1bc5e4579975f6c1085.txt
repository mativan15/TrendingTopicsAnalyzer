Whether someone needs to apply for a job or work on a school assignment, computers are important tools to help set up children and adults for success. That's why GoldBook Financial donated the necessary supplies to open a computer lab at Central Arizona Shelter Services' family shelter.

The opening of the lab was 'very much a collaborative effort' between Goldbook Financial and Central Arizona Shelter Services, said Victor Goldman, GoldBook Financial's CEO.

The lab, which opened in May of this year, consists of six computers that children and adults alike can use for whatever they need.
