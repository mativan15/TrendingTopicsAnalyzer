BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe — Amazon arrived in South Africa in 2004, grew its workforce in the country to 4,000 people, which then expanded to 7,000 in 2020, and then in February this year announced another round of job offerings.

To house a staff that has become one of the largest in southern Africa, Amazon started building a headquarters in Cape Town, a $270 million project intended to be the company's business hub on the continent.

In March, a judge blocked the project after it encountered local resistance because the construction was set to break ground on land that is home to the Khoisan, a group of people whose traditions trace to precolonial times.
