President Emmanuel Macron's government on Wednesday sought to ram its 2023 budget through parliament without a vote after battling in vain to get it approved by the fractured lower house of parliament.

The administration is trying to lift the country out of an economic squeeze that has sparked industrial action and street protests.

But following weeks of disruption from strikes at oil refineries and fuel depots that have caused shortages at petrol pumps, the government waited until after Tuesday's broader strike action and demonstrations before unveiling the controversial measure.
