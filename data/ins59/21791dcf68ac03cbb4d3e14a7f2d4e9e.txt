Mortgage rate movements were mixed after dropping in recent days. The 30-year fell slightly to a new low since early April, and the 15-year rose.
 
The average rate offered for a conventional 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.43% from 5.45% the previous business day, while the average 15-year rate rose to 4.49% from 4.45% the previous business day. Last month both reached their highest points since at least 2019, and likely much farther back: 6.19% and 5.26%, respectively. Now the 30-year is the lowest it's been since early April, before those peaks.
