Six weeks into a season of extremely low expectations, the Falcons (3-3) are tied with Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the division lead. Making it even more impressive, Atlanta has managed to have success while opening with a very difficult stretch of games that included the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. The Falcons overpowered a team that reached the NFC championship game a year ago, winning 28-14 while throwing just 14 passes.
