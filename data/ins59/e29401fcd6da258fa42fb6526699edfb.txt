Small and medium scale (SME) enterprises in Pimpri Chinchwad have demanded action against unauthorised Mathadi workers or head-loaders who they say have created an atmosphere of fear in the industrial area. During an interaction with the newly-appointed police commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad, Ankush Shinde, the industrial association also drew attention to the security situation in the area which has made businesses feel unsafe.
Sandeep Belsare, the president of the Small Scale Industries Association of Pimpri Chinchwad, said the number of unauthorised Mathadi workers in the area has gone up manifold.
