Jeff Swensen/Getty Images News About two years ago, Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) completed a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company to be listed on the NASDAQ. Since then, the company's stock has fallen more than 91%, leaving early investors with heavy losses. Despite EVs being a strong secular trend in time to come, we think that RIDE has more room to fall, given the company is most likely to raise capital from the issuance of debt or equity, or a combination of both. Problems with the company Since the inception of the company, the CEO has been changed twice in less than five years; the first one being Steve Burns, voluntarily leaving the company that he founded a week after amending its annual report with the SEC, stating that the RIDE is at the risk of bankruptcy with insufficient funds to begin commercial production of EVs on 8 June 2021.
