The Prime Minister's recent apology isn't good enough for Janet Street-Porter. On today's edition of Loose Women, Janet took aim at Liz Truss following the under-fire Conservative Party leader finally saying sorry to furious Tory MPs on Monday, as Jeremy Hunt urged furious MPs to "give her a chance" and said he believed she would still be Prime Minister at Christmas. Joining Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Linda Robson, Janet discussed the recent reports regarding the government and Truss - blasting the Prime Minister's 'feeble' apology and calling for her to be ousted from her position by the end of the day and replaced by 'someone boring'.
