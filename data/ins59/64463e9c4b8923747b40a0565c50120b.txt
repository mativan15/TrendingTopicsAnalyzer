By Khristopher J. Brooks June 2, 2022 / 3:33 PM / MoneyWatch A former employee at the world's leading online marketplace for non-fungible tokens has been arrested and charged in what federal authorities say is the first insider trading case involving NFTs.Prosecutors allege that Nathaniel Chastain, 31, capitalized on his role as a product manager at OpenSea to buy NFTs before they were widely promoted on the site, later selling them for a profit when other investors bought the digital items. He resigned last September after the New York company discovered his activity, according to a company blog post in 2021.
