It's virtually neck-and-neck between Justin Trudeau and Pierre Poilievre as the preferred prime minister in the minds of Canadians. New polling from Nanos Research has found that the Conservative Party leader is the preferred prime minister for 30 per cent of Canadians. But Trudeau isn't far behind, sitting at 29.8 per cent. "Giddy up. It's a horse race. You know, we asked Canadians every week who they would prefer as prime minister. And check out the numbers. You can see basically a statistical tie between Pierre Poilievre and Justin Trudeau," Nik Nanos said on CTV News' Trend Line podcast.
