Funding Will Support Community Engagement and Technology Innovation to Deploy More Clean, Renewable Wind Energy 
 WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Biden-Harris Administration, through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), today announced its intent to use $30 million from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to fund research and development projects that will lower costs for wind energy projects on land and offshore to benefit communities across the country. Wind energy accounted for more than 9% of total domestic electricity generation in 2021 and will play a significant role in achieving President Biden's goals to reach 100% clean electricity by 2035 and a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050.
