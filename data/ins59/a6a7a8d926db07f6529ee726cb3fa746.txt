OTTAWA - An Irish political party pushing to unify the island of Ireland wants Ottawa to halt post-Brexit trade talks with Britain, arguing that London is undermining the agreement that brokered peace between Catholics and Protestants. "It is the duty of friends to sometimes pull each other up, whenever they are behaving in a way which is not acceptable," said Sinn Fein member of Parliament John Finucane. This week, the Belfast MP, who sits in the United Kingdom's House of Commons, travelled to Toronto and Ottawa to ask Canadian leaders for their help.
