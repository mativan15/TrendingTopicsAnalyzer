WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm jokingly referred to President Biden as 'the man with the cash' at a Wednesday event announcing $2.8 billion in federal grants to companies involved in the production of electric vehicle batteries.
'It's my pleasure to turn it back over to the man with the cash, President Biden!' Granholm said at a virtual event with some of the 20 recipient companies in the White House-adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
Biden laughed but otherwise didn't comment on Granholm's remark before saying there's a 'new industrial revolution' underway through the development of advanced technology.
