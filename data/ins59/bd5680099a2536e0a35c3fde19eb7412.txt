Cisco's, Dan's Hamburgers and Wink have been added to the Austin360 Restaurant Hall of Fame.

The entertainment site of the Austin American-Statesman announced the new class Oct. 18, alongside its 2022 Dining Guide, highlighting the 27 best places to eat in the area.

Cisco's, a Tex-Mex institution in East Austin that's been open for more than 70 years, was lauded by the Statesman for its continuity and consistency in a rapidly changing part of the city. It is owned by Matt Cisneros and located at 1511 E.
