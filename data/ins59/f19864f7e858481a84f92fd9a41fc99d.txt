WASHINGTON - Canada's clash with the United States over the Nexus trusted-traveller program should be resolved well before the president and prime minister meet in December, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said Friday.

Champagne, who was in Washington, D.C., to meet with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, said he raised the issue with his U.S. counterpart as an example of a situation that would be in the interest of both countries to solve promptly.

'If I look at the challenges that we're facing, I would say this should be an easy one to resolve, because after all, this is about making sure that the border is as fluid as possible,' he told a news conference.
