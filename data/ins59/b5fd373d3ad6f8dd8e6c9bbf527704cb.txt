Chancellor Olaf Scholz punted Germany's looming energy crisis into next winter in order to end an internal feud over the fate of the country's three remaining nuclear power plants. Despite vocal support from climate activist Greta Thunberg, he decided to extend the operational lives of the three plants only until April 15 2023. Afterward, Germany's over 50-year-long experiment with atomic energy comes to a likely end just three months longer than planned. 'The problem has only been postponed,' wrote conservative first minister Markus Söder of Bavaria, the wealthy state that is home to one of the plants.
