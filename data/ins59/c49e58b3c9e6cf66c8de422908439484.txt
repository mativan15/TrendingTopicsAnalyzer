Polsinelli PC is in talks to move its St. Louis office from downtown to Clayton, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Kansas City law firm, with 90 local lawyers, has discussed leases with at least two Clayton landlords, including Centene Corp. (NYSE: CNC), the people said.

It currently has an office at the 12-story 100 S. Fourth St., which is called the Deloitte Building and carries exterior Polsinelli signage.

Polsinelli, led locally by Office Managing Partner Jane Arnold, didn't respond to requests for comment, nor did Centene, which has been subleasing space in its newer 20-story tower, Centene Plaza C at 7676 Forsyth Blvd.
