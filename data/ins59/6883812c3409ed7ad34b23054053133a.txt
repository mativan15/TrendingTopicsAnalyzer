Tiny homes are having a serious moment. Whether you want to have an instant guest room behind your 'normal' house, a home office that's separate from your living quarters or to seriously downsize, tiny homes are where it's at. There are even a bunch of reality shows dedicated to the phenomenon.

Well, it turns out that you don't have to hire a special contractor to build your pint-sized home — you can just pick one up at Amazon.
