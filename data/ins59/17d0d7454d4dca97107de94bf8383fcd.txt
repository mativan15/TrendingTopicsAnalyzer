Liverpool have defied their stuttering, mid-table start by downing champions Manchester City 1-0 at Anfield, helping Arsenal forge four points clear at the top of the Premier League.

A brilliantly-taken 76th minute goal from Mohamed Farah was enough to hand City their first defeat of the season on Sunday in a dramatic, high-octane affair that saw Reds' boss Jurgen Klopp sent off.

Arsenal roared clear with a ninth win in 10 games, a hard-earned, scrappy 1-0 victory at Leeds courtesy of a first-half Bukayo Saka goal in another eventful affair brimming with controversy.
