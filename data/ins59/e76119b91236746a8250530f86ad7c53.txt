The Wall Street giant plans to once again combine its expanded asset management and private wealth businesses into one unit run by Marc Nachmann, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman will also fuse its investment-banking and trading operations under one group run by Dan Dees, Jim Esposito and Ashok Varadhan. The money-losing consumer unit will be broken up. The moves mark a reversal for Solomon, 60, who had forged ahead with plans to separate the asset management and wealth business two years ago despite skepticism within the bank.
