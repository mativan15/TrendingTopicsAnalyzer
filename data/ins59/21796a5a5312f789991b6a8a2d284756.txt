This week, we're looking at a role we all think we know well: the Chief Information Officer, or CIO.  This is another role about which we could ask ‘when is a CIO not a CIO?' To paraphrase a well-known Australian ad from the 1980s, 'CIOs ain't CIOs'.
I've had more interest this year from marketers looking to refresh their understanding of the CIO as a buyer persona. It's timely. We've been seeing this title pop up in places we wouldn't have expected to see it. It's popping up consistently across multiple studies, so we think it's a thing and not just a vagary of a particular survey.
