PeskyMonkey/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is shifting a portion of the production of its iPads away from China and towards Vietnam after strict COVID-19 lockdowns across China led to disruptions in AAPL's supply chain and distribution of its products. The geographic move illuminates Apple's plan to diversify and expand their supply network as last year the tech giant shipped approximately 58M iPads around the world with the overwhelming majority coming from China. In order to further safeguard against any and all supply chain issues, Apple has asked its suppliers specifically around Shanghai to bolster their inventories with printed circuit boards, mechanical and electronics parts as well as other key components used to create and distribute products efficiently.
