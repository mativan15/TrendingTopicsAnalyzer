Trends may come and go, but there's no doubt that what we wear, watch, andwhip up at a certain moment in time can leave a huge cultural mark. When Allrecipes was founded in 1997, the dish du jour was one we all now recognize as a classic: the molten lava cake. In the years since, we've seen countless other foods and drinks go in and out of style. Crab cakes, avocado toast, and rainbow-colored everything were all once the rage — and eventually all over social media.
 
Today, we turn to platforms like Instagram and TikTok for inspiration and find ideas for everything from easy dinners (hello, baked feta pasta) to buzzy drinks (remember when everyone was making Dalgona coffee?) to show-stopping party tricks (love it or hate it, butter boards are a thing).
