The world's first "surf coaster" is heading to SeaWorld Orlando.

SeaWorld is making waves with three groundbreaking new roller coasters: the world's "first surf coaster," the world's "first launched flume coaster," and the "longest and steepest straddle coaster" on the West Coast.

Each of SeaWorld's three namesake parks will debut a new type of coaster next spring.

"We strive to continually bring new thrills to our parks while also providing unique and engaging experiences with marine life that guests may not otherwise ever have a chance to have," SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment CEO Marc Swanson said in a statement.
