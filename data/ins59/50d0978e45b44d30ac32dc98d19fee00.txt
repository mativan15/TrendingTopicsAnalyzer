Chinese President Xi Jinping's predecessor, Hu Jintao, was escorted out of the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress on Saturday in an unusual move that has divided opinion.The former president was led out of the closing ceremony of the congress by stewards who escorted him from his seat on the stage but he appeared reluctant to leave the event.Hu had been sitting to Xi's left in the main auditorium of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and the 79-year-old reportedly appeared frail, which has led to speculation about his health.
