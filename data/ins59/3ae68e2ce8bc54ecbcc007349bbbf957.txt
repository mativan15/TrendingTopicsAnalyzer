Scott Olson/Getty Images News Stock index futures reversed course and are slightly higher Thursday helped by some buillish earnings, but volatile yields are also having an impact. The S&P futures (SPX) +0.2% and Dow futures (INDU) +0.4% are higher. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) +0.1% are faring the worst following Tesla's top-line miss with logistical issues hitting deliveries. AT&T helped sentiment as it beat on the top and bottom lines. The S&P is facing tactical resistance at 3,706-3,740 and at 3,807, but there is still support at the 200-week moving average and 50% retracement at 3,600-3,500, BofA says.
