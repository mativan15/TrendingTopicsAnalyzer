Jim Farley knows time is money. The Ford CEO sees a great profit opportunity in technology that will allow drivers to sleep in their cars.Speaking at the Bernstein Conference on Wednesday, Farley said advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including full autonomous capability, are something customers will be willing to pay big bucks for.He acknowledged Tesla's ability to charge $12,000 for its Full Self-Driving system, which doesn't yet live up to the promise of its name, as an example of the pricing power the potential of time-saving ADAS holds for the industry.
