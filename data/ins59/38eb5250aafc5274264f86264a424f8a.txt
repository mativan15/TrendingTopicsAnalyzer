By Australian Associated Press Published: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 Australia has a competition problem and addressing that to create a "zippier" economy and boost living standards, a Labor minister warns. Andrew Leigh, assistant minister for charities, competition and treasury, will make that argument in a speech on Monday at the Sydney Ideas talk series. He will argue a fresh round of competition reforms are needed, with stamp duty, privatisations and occupational licensing among the priorities.
