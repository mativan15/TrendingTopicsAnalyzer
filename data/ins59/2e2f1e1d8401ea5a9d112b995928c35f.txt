New England s most eminent novelist, JOHN P. MARQUAND was brought up at Curzon's Mill on the Artichoke River, a homesite north of Boston. In this familiar essay, which holds the salt and savor of old New England in its every line, he draws a picture of the tidal mill.CURZON'S MILL, which has been in the possession of my family since 1820, is on the Artichoke River in Newburyport, Massachusetts. I am so ignorant as not even to know the origin of the name of the Artichoke River, whose brownish waters turned the wheel of our tide mill for over two hundred years, and would in all probability be turning it still if plumbing had not been invented and if the city of Newburyport had not been taught the necessity for an adequate water upply.
