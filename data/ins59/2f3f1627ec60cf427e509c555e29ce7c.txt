(RTTNews) - The Japanese stock market is slightly higher on Tuesday after being in the red in most of the morning session, extending the gains in the previous two sessions, with the Nikkei 225 staying below the 27,400 level, despite the lack of cues from Wall Street overnight, after economic data released showed better-than-expected unemployment rate and retail sales growth in April. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is up 7.91 points or 0.03 percent at 27,377.34, after touching a high of 27,463.33 and a low of 27,250.
