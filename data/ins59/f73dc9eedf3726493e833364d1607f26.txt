We're selling 280 shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) at roughly $56.97 a share. Following Monday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 470 shares of AMD, decreasing its weighting to about 1% from 1.6%. This small sale of Advanced Micro Devices is consistent with what we explained last Monday when downgrading our rating of the semiconductor stock to a 2. While this AMD move is a tough sale to make after its nasty decline this year — and we regret not selling more before the collapse of the PC industry — we believe it's necessary to reduce our exposure to semiconductors.
