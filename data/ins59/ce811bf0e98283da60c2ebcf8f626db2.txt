CAIRO, June 1 (Reuters) - Egypt awarded eight gold and metal mining exploration licences in its eastern desert region, the petroleum ministry said on Wednesday, a second test of a 2020 legislative overhaul designed to unlock vast untapped mineral resources.

Egypt, campaigning to attract $40 billion in private investment in the next four years, last month outlined an array of state assets that it would offer to investors, part of a plan to withdraw from certain economic sectors.
