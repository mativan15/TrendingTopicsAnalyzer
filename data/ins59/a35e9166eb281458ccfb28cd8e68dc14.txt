Lebanon's financial system is estimated to have suffered from $72 billion in losses, but a recovery plan laying out how those funds would be recovered has yet to be finalised. "The state cannot finance whatever and however is asked of it, and the recovery of deposits should not come exclusively from its own pocket," Khalil told reporters.
