Warner Bros. Discovery just sent a bright signal about its intentions regarding the NBA. The media company has re-signed Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith to new multi-year deals to host TNT's flagship studio show, 'Inside The NBA,' just as anticipation is building for negotiations around the NBA's next rights deals, which are slated to expire with Warner Bros. and Walt Disney's ESPN after the 2024-2025 season. Shaquille O'Neal, the fourth member of the show's studio team, struck a broader pact with the parent company in 2020.
