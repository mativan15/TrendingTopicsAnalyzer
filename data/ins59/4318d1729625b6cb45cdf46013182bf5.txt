The freeze in deals in the City has forced a string of stockbrokers to axe jobs as they brace for a prolonged slowdown over the winter.Numis, finnCap, Peel Hunt and Zeus Capital are all understood to have cut staff as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and new stock market floats dry up amid tough economic conditions.The cuts at the small and mid-cap brokers are thought to be most brutal at the Manchester-based Zeus, whose clients include fast-fashion company Boohoo. Sources said Zeus is cutting close to a quarter of its staff — about 15 people.
