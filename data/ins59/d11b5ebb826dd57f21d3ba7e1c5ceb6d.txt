Boston will wear the uniforms in Tuesday's season opener.

The Celtics revealed a new-look 'City Edition' uniform on Monday that carries multiple references to the late Bill Russell.

Boston announced that the team will wear the special uniforms during Tuesday's season-opener at TD Garden against the 76ers, as well as 10 other times in total over the course of the year (honoring the 11 championships won by Russell and the Celtics of his era).
