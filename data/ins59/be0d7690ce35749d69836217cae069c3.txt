General Electric Co. plans to vacate its Fort Point headquarters in early 2023 and is now looking for a smaller office space in the city, the company revealed Tuesday.

The move comes as GE (NYSE: GE) prepares to divide itself into three companies, focused on aviation, health care and energy. GE currently has roughly 100,000 square feet at 5 Necco St., a renovated candy factory. The move was first reported by the Boston Globe.

The decision represents the final blow to then-CEO Jeff Immelt 's vision for a Fort Point headquarters at the time GE moved to Boston from Connecticut in 2016.
