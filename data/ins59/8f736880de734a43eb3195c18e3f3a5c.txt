By Michael Susin Cizzle Biotechnology Holdings PLC said Monday that net loss for 2021 widened given the company's business development stage. The U.K. diagnostics company said net loss for 2021 was 3.9 million pounds ($4.9 million) compared with GBP14,000 the year earlier. The company said it has maintained low levels of borrowing, but is likely to increase borrowing facilities and issue new shares to fund working capital once the businesses become profitable. The company said that it has broadened its interests in the detection of a range of early-stage cancers and expanded its potential customer base through diagnostic tests that can help in the development of personalized medicines.
