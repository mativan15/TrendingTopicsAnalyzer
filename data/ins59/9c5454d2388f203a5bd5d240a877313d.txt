The Shanghai Stock Exchange said ETFs based on policy bank bonds would be allowed in the so-called collateralized REPO business starting next week. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange said in a separate statement that ETFs based on treasuries, local government bonds and policy bank bonds would be eligible in such financing activities.
