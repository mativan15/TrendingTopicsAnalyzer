Stocktrek/Stockbyte via Getty Images Defense is a key exposure that investors should be considering for their portfolios. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), or just Raytheon, is a broadly exposed military company as it has accumulated over the years valuable platforms from Rockwell Collins and United Technologies.

While there are some headwinds hitting the company, and supply-side constraints are proving a problem, growth is all but assured.
