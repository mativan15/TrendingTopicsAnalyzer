HOBOKEN, NJ — For the first time since 2019, mile-square Hoboken, N.J. will hold its Halloween costume contest in person after its traditional Ragamuffin parade. Because so many events are returning this year after the pandemic, the Halloween & Costume Association (HCA) has called Oct. 31, 2022 the "Biggest Halloween in US History."They said that 93 percent of American Millennials planned to celebrate, and they described it as a "4-day Halloweekend." In Hoboken, both millennials and longtime residents find ways to celebrate and best themselves each year.
