May 28—A state district judge has denied a request by Brownsville death row inmate Ruben Gutierrez seeking a DNA test that he claims will clear him in the 1998 murder of an 85-year-old Brownsville widow.

Judge Benjamin Euresti Jr. of the 107th state District Court, issued his ruling Thursday. His ruling came a week after the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit also denied a motion Gutierrez filed requesting a stay be issued as he waited for a ruling from Euresti.

Gutierrez filed the motion for DNA testing in July 2021.
