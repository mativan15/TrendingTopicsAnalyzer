Capital One made waves in the premium credit card space with the introduction of the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card and is working hard to keep the momentum going.

One year after its launch, the Capital One Travel portal is adding a new feature, specifically for premium cardholders: the Premier Collection. Rivaling similar programs offered by American Express and Chase, the Premier Collection will offer cardholders an elevated experience and money-saving perks when staying at luxury hotels and resorts.
