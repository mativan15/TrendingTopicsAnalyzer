Jane Technologies' impressive cannabis marketplace is finally available in an app. The company today launched its first iOS app enabling users to browse the inventory of local cannabis dispensaries and make purchases within the app.
Its web-based marketplace is lovely, and I've found it amazingly accurate, thanks to its live inventory information. I'm thrilled the company is bringing the power of its web marketplace to a smartphone app. Users can shop local retailers by stores, products, or categories and browse confidently, knowing the listed inventory is accurate.
