A week after the results of Vishu Bumper of the Kerala Lotteries department were announced, the jackpot winners turned up at the Lottery Directorate here on Monday to claim their prize. Two relatives from Manavalakurichy in Kanyakumary district are set to share the first prize of 10 cr. Dr. Pradeep Kumar and Ramesh had bought the prize-winning ticket from a lottery vendor at Valiyathura when they arrived at the Thiruvananthapuram airport to receive a relative earlier this month. The draw of the Vishu bumper lottery was held on May 22.
