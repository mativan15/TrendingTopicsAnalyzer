Nearly a year after signing a lease in Lebanon, athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer New Balance has announced plans to invest $68.5 million to establish a new distribution center in the city.

The investment is expected to create 150 new jobs to support the company's digital commerce business, as well as service wholesale and retail operations, according to a state news release.

The 350,000-square foot facility is expected to be completed in 2023. It will be located in the Speedway Industrial Park on Bill France Boulevard.
