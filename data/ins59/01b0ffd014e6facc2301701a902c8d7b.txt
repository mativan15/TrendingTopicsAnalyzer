By Anniek Bao Airbnb Inc. will offer to move its existing Chinese homeowners and rental listings to rivals, including Meituan and a unit of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., as it winds down its domestic operations in China. The home-rental giant said in a statement Friday that homeowners on its Chinese platform can apply to list their personal information and property details on other platforms, including on the hotel service platform of Chinese food delivery company Meituan and on Fliggy, a unit of e-commerce titan Alibaba.
