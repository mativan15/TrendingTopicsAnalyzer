Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who was campaigning with Vance on Wednesday, said the GOP should model its use of leverage after 2015, when a Republican-controlled Congress successfully reversed an oil export ban during the Obama administration.

He agreed that Republicans would have more sway over priorities like border security and said 'Joe Biden is going to have to negotiate and give more to the Congress if' the GOP takes complete charge on the Hill. But Cotton did not seem to want a repeat of 2018.
