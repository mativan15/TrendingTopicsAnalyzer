The return of the N.C. State Fair has brought fresh energy to the Blue Ridge Corridor, but a pile of rubble across the street from the N.C. Museum of Art gives a peek into the region's future.

For years, the area had languished as sort of an attic for state government. But now, a mail service center directly across from the museum has been demolished, setting in motion the rise of the new 10-story home for the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

The DHHS move is critical on two fronts — one, it will free up space at Dix Park and, two, it moves thousands of workers to a new headquarters on Blue Ridge Road, increasing the demand for amenities there.
