Disney hired Mark Bozon, a top gaming executive from Apple, as a senior creative leader for its cross-divisional Next Generation Storytelling initiative — which encompasses Disney's 'metaverse' ambitions.
In a May 20 tweet, Bozon announced he was leaving Apple after 12 years, saying 'I'm headed to an absolute dream job' (without revealing he was heading to Disney). Most recently, he served as games creative director for Apple Arcade, the tech giant's game-subscription service.
Bozon was hired by Mike White, Disney's SVP of Next Generation Storytelling & Consumer Experiences, a 10-year company veteran who earlier this year was appointed to lead development and coordination of Disney's metaverse strategy.
