New Delhi: India has ranked 107 out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022. The peer-reviewed annual report, jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, termed the level of hunger in India as ‘serious' as its GHI score is 29.1. India's neighbours performed better in GHI 2022 with Nepal ranked 81, Sri Lanka 64, Bangladesh 84 and Pakistan at 99. In 2021, India secured the 101st position among 116 countries assessed. Important to note, GHI scores are comparable within each year's report, but not between different years' reports because of updated data, changing methodology and the number of countries being assessed each year.
