He may have lost by a big margin, but Shashi Tharoor did put up a big fight in the election for Congress president. In fact, the best fight in three elections over the last 25 years. The Thiruvananthapuram MP secured 1,072 votes of the total of 9,385 votes, while Mallikarjun Kharge finished way ahead with 7,897 votes. 
416 votes were declared invalid. So Tharoor effectively ended up with 11.95% of the valid votes cast. Considering the Congress tradition of going wholeheartedly with candidates favoured, though not openly, by the Nehru-Gandhi family, Tharoor could be proud of his tally.
