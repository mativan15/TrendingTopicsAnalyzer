Separately from its CHESS project, Lofthouse said other technology upgrades put in place had already caused the rate of incidents to drop 'hugely' in recent years, and the bourse would continue to improve its systems.'I think you can see that what we're doing is already having a really significant impact,' Lofthouse said. 'With change comes risk of course, but the bigger risk is in not doing it.'ASX chairman Damian Roche said the board was 'thrilled' to appoint Lofthouse, adding that the internal appointment reflected the strength in the management ranks of ASX.
