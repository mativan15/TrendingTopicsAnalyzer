Aaron Donald wants a new contract.

The Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle has spent the bulk of his career as arguably the best player in football. His current deal doesn't pay him as such. Armed with a Super Bowl ring and all the personal accolades an NFL defender can accomplish, Donald is saying that he's fine with retiring at 31 years old if he and the Rams don't come to terms.

He started the chatter before the Super Bowl and doubled down on Monday on the "I am Athlete" podcast alongside retired NFL players Brandon Marshall and Pacman Jones.
