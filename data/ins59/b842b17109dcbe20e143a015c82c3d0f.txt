M﻿att Gault, BBC SportIt was a game of two halves for Southampton. Badly in need of a win after four straight defeats, the Saints started brightly and took the lead, albeit in fortuitous fashion when Romain Perraud's deflected shot found the bottom corner.
But having given themselves the edge at the break, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side failed to further assert themselves as West Ham dominated the second half. In the end, Southampton can count themselves lucky that West Ham managed only one goal from 25 shots.
