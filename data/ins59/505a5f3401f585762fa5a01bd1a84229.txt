This week, Shannon sits down with former Director of the National Economic Council and Host of FOX Business' Kudlow, Larry Kudlow to discuss the economy, family, and faith.
Larry shares his thoughts on the Biden Administrations' handling of the national inflation crisis and how his faith in God keeps him grounded. Later, Larry and Shannon emphasize that there is power in seeking help in moments where you feel as though you've fallen short. Follow Shannon on Twitter: @ShannonBream
