Liz Truss's battle to cling onto power after new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt tore up her economic strategy became even harder as the Tory membership who appointed her Prime Minister appeared to be turning on her.A snap poll of party members released as she held a crunch meeting of her Cabinet on Tuesday saw more than half respond that she should resign and 83% say she was doing a bad job.Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg appeared cheerful as he left the Downing Street meeting but most ministers were grim-faced and refused to say whether they were backing Ms Truss.
