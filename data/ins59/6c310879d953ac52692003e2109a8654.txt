Council bosses are to use nearly £2 million of government cash to pay for food vouchers during school holidays.

Families in Oldham who are eligible for free school meals will now get extra financial support for feeding their children in the the October, Christmas, February and Easter holidays.

The vouchers, funded by the latest round of the Household Support Fund would be £15 a week, per child, increasing to a total payment of £20 a week per child at Christmas.

Households will receive their first set of vouchers this week as schools in the borough break up for half-term on Friday.
