When web surfers cross between the mainstream internet's centralized giants such as Google and Facebook and crypto's wild world of DeFi and NFTs, a new startup called Spindl wants to know.

The Miami-based company is trying to rebuild for Web3 a fundamental piece of Web2's e-commerce backend. That piece is called 'web attribution,' and it's how internet businesses track where their customers came from – and create user acquisition strategies to get more.

Antonio García Martínez, the CEO of Spindl and a veteran of Silicon Valley AdTech, said attribution is integral to internet commerce.
