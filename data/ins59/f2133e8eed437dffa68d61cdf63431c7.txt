One of the many recruits on campus at the University of Florida over the weekend was 2024 four-star linebacker Kris Jones, and he came away impressed with the game-day atmosphere at the Swamp, according to Gators Online.

The Gators offered Jones over the summer and he quickly made his way to campus once the dead period was lifted at the end of July. This was his first time in town on a game day, though, and a packed house gave him a taste of what an SEC matchup is like. Fraternities wrote his name on banners leading up to the game, and Jones took notice of all the love he was getting from Gainesville.
