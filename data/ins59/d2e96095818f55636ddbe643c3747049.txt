Charles Barkley has agreed to a 10-year deal with TNT that is expected to be worth well north of nine figures, The Post has learned.
Barkley currently has three years left on a contract that pays him $10 million per season. His current contract coincides with TNT's agreement with the NBA deal expiring after the 2024-25 season. If Turner were not to keep the NBA, Barkley could potentially own rights to go work for another network or a digital platform, if Amazon or Apple or others are involved.
The exact amount Barkley will make is not yet known if he fulfills the entire contract, but it will be well in excess of $100 million and could approach $200 million.
