Several Xbox controllers prop up a phone with the logo for Call of Duty Mobile on the screen.

Microsoft is desperate to get in on the mobile gaming market, so much so that a big part of its plans to buyout a huge chunk of the game publishing world apparently hinge on creating their own mobile gaming app store.
