Some Veracyte, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCYT) shareholders are probably rather concerned to see the share price fall 36% over the last three months. On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 68% in that time. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 65% decline over the last twelve months.

While the stock has fallen 11% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.
