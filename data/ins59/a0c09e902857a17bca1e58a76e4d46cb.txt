Advancing Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) requires creating a culture that values and elevates different viewpoints and perspectives. Employee Resource Groups, or ERGs, are one of the most engaging and important ways for companies to do this. Corporate culture is ever-changing, and ERGs form a foundation of culture change at a grassroots level.
