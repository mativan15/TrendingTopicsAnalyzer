In 2022, the maximum monthly Social Security benefit is $4,194. This would provide a generous $50,328 in retirement income for those who receive it.
Most people won't come anywhere close to maxing out their benefits, though. In fact, the average monthly retirement check is just $1,657, which means the typical senior gets $2,538 per month less than the biggest possible check. So, the big questions are, why do so many people fall so short, and will you get anywhere close to the max benefit?
