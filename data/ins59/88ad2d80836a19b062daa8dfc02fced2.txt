When Abanti Das was handpicked as a candidate for the Dhamnagar byelection in Odisha on Wednesday, the biggest qualification the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) attributed to her candidature was her experience in the self-help group (SHG) movement. Though Ms. Das holds the post of chairperson of the Tihidi block and has been in public life for quite some time, she too appealed first to her SHG members to ensure her victory.   Ms. Das is likely the second BJD candidate after Pramilla Bisoi, the septuagenarian Member of Parliament from Ganjam's Aska constituency, who has emerged in Odisha's political arena from the BJD's flagship Mission Shakti programme for women.
