The National Party is urging the Government to push ahead with new defence purchases as the geopolitical contest in the Pacific heats up. The Government has been shifting priorities and deferring future purchases of large assets for the Defence Force, as it recovers from the pandemic. Budget 2022 had an emphasis on mending existing woes: $525 million for maintaining ageing defence assets, $137m to improve buildings and infrastructure, and $90m for wages.National Party defence spokesperson Tim van de Molen says there has been no action to show we are playing a leadership role in the Pacific.
