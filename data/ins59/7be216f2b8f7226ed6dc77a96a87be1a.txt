Two of Tennessee's top GOP lawmakers promised to introduce legislation banning gender-affirming surgeries for minors during a rally against such treatments Friday at War Memorial Plaza in downtown Nashville.

House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland, was the first speaker to call for a ban on the treatments, such as those that had been, until recently, performed on a small number of patients over the age of 16 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center since 2018.

The procedures are performed following parental consent and after full psychological examinations.
