Showers are to continue in Tamil Nadu till October 18, according to the Indi Meteorological Department (IMD). The rain activity has gained momentum in the state after back-to-back cyclonic circulations forming in the Bay of Bengal and adjoining the Andaman Sea. Isolated heavy rains are likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikkal till October 18. The cyclonic circulation lies over west central and adjacent Southwest Bay of Bengal in lower tropospheric levels and another cyclonic circulation will form over the Andaman Sea around October 18.
