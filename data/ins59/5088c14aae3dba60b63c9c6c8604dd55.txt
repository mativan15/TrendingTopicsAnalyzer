Mark Bowers is the brewmaster at Aeronaut Brewing Co. in Somerville, Mass. On a Tuesday evening in May, as the brewery's weekly session of high-intensity trivia wrapped up, he told me about the time he helped re-create a mid-19th-century beer based on yeast regrown from an antique bottle of brew produced in 1850 at Bunker Hill Breweries, a long-defunct facility once in historic Charlestown. He also provided what amounted to a mini-dissertation in the art of capturing wild yeast.
