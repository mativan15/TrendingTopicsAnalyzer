Home-bred electronics maker Lava is in advanced talks for a joint venture with Shanghai-based Huaqin Technology, the world's largest original design manufacturer (ODM) for mobiles and tablets, industry executives and government officials familiar with the matter said. The joint venture could be a first for any Indian company since the government announced curbs on Chinese firms in 2020 following the border skirmish between the two Asian neighbours. Senior executives of Huaqin are set to visit India to finalise the final contours of the deal, which will give Lava a stronghold in the country's fast-developing electronics manufacturing sector, officials said.
