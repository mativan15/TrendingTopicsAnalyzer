Australian bus manufacturers, workers and energy experts have called on state governments to provide the industry with firmer guarantees about how many electric buses they will buy as Australia's eastern states seek to replace thousands of diesel vehicles before the 2032 Brisbane Olympics.Victoria, Queensland and the ACT have committed to buying only zero-emission buses from 2025, while NSW plans for all buses in the greater Sydney region to be electric by 2035. Bus manufacturers say they can build hundreds of buses a year 'from tomorrow', but need more certainty from state governments who purchase and own most of Australia's public bus fleet.
