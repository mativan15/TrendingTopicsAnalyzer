The Amazon executive in charge of the company's worldwide consumer business is resigning after 23 years as the e-commerce giant deals with its overabundance of warehouse space.

Dave Clark's last day at the Seattle-based company will be July 1, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote Friday in a company blog post. Amazon did not name a replacement for Clark, but Jassy wrote that he expects to have 'an update' over the next few weeks.

'As much as I have loved the ride, it is time for me to say goodbye to start a new journey,' Clark wrote in an email to his team that he posted on Twitter.
