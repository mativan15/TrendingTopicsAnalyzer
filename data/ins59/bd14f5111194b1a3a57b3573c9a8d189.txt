You Gotta Eat Here is a first-generation Black-owned restaurant, founded in 1997 in the JeffVanderLou neighborhood by Andre and Dorothy Williams, who are deeply committed to enduring despite the challenges their location suggests, as well as the pandemic era.

Today, the family business has seven total employees, including five family members. You Gotta Eat Here is known for its burgers, wings, chicken tenders, and sandwiches.

The Past

The Williamses overcame funding challenges to launch You Gotta Eat Here thanks to support from Justine Petersen, a Missouri not-for-profit corporation that helps low- to moderate-income individuals and families build assets and create change.
