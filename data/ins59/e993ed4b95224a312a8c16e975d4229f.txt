June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes fell on Friday, dragged down by shares of Apple and Tesla, while a solid jobs report supported the view that the Federal Reserve would continue on its aggressive policy tightening path to cool decades-high inflation.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined in early trade, with consumer discretionary .SPLRCD losing 2.2% and technology .SPLRCT falling 1.6%. The energy sector .SPNY was an outlier with a gain of 1%.

The Labor Department's closely watched report showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 390,000 jobs last month and wages grew solidly, while the unemployment rate held steady at 3.
