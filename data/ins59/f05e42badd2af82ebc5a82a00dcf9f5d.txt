May 31—Monadnock Family Services plans to purchase Antioch University New England's building on Avon Street by the end of June, with an aim of moving in by next spring, an official said last week.

The move, first announced in October by both entities, will allow the community mental health center to have all of its Keene services under one roof, rather than in several buildings throughout the Elm City.

"That will create more efficiencies ... reduce a lot of our operating costs in terms of parking and storage that are extra expenses and gives us a building that's more fit to purchase," said CEO Phil Wyzik.
