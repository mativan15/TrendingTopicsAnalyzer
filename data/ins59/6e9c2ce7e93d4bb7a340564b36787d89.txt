Gold Fields Limited GFI and Yamana Gold Inc. AUY announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement per which Gold Fields will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Yamana in a deal valued at around $6.7 billion. This will create a top-four global gold major with a diversified portfolio of high-quality, long-life flagship assets across some of the world's most established gold mining jurisdictions with tangible near- and long-term growth opportunities.



Yamana has mines in Canada, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, which is in sync with South Africa-based Gold Field's strategy of expanding in mining-friendly jurisdictions across the Americas.
