Bill Pugliano/Getty Images News Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) -0.3% pre-market Thursday after reporting mixed Q3 results, with adjusted earnings that missed estimates and revenues that exceeded expectations, but both metrics fell from a year ago, as higher energy costs hurt margins. Q3 net income fell to $760M, or $1.02/share, from $1.71B, or $2.23/share, in the prior-year period. Q3 total revenues fell 4.9% Y/Y to $14.1B but finished ahead of estimates: Packaging & Specialty Plastics -5% Y/Y to $7.3B, as price gains and resilient demand in functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene prices and reduced demand for industrial and consumer packaging in Europe; Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure -9% to $4.
