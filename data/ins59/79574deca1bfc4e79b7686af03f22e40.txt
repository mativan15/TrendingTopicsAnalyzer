Analysis: Would the Bears look to acquire a receiver before the trade deadline in two weeks to help Justin Fields?

It's two weeks until the trade deadline so Bears social media will begin firing up with demands they deal for a wide receiver, any wide receiver.

They don't need a deadline to demand this or even the possibility of a trade, as pleas for the Bears to sign one of the unsigned wide receivers floating about have been common since last summer.

Expect nothing from them in this regard, even if it seems Justin Fields doesn't have open receivers often enough.
