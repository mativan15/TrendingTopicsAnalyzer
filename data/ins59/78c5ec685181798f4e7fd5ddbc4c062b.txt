Published: 16:04 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 16:05 EDT, 21 October 2022 Oklahoma State has the postseason in its sights after being banned last season. The NCAA punished the Cowboys after former assistant coach Lamont Evans accepted up to $22,000 so he could help steer athletes to certain financial advisers. Evans was arrested as part of a federal corruption investigation in 2017, and he pleaded guilty in 2019. Oklahoma State played in the NCAA Tournament in 2021 while the case was being appealed.
