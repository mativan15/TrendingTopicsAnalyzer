Around seven million homes in the UK will experience dire fuel poverty without a further £14bn package of emergency support, campaigners have warned. The Warm This Winter pressure group says despite the Energy Price Guarantee, the £400 energy bills payment and other support already announced, much more help will be needed to prevent the "severe health impacts of living in cold, damp homes crippling the NHS and causing excess winter deaths".
The group is calling for urgent additional assistance for the most vulnerable.
