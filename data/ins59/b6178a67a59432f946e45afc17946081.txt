Earlier this week, ESPN's NFL draft analyst Mel Kiper released his early top-25 rankings for 2023 prospects.
While no Badgers made the top 25, Kiper also put out a top-10 players by position list which included two Wisconsin stars. Redshirt junior Joe Tippmann was listed as the No. 6 center, while senior defensive lineman Keeanu Benton came in as the No. 8 ranked defensive tackle.
Both Benton and Tippmann will have the chance to raise their stock throughout the 2023 season as key parts of Wisconsin's team.
