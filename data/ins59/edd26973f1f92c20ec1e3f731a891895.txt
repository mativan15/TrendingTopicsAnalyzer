President Biden's approval rating rebounded by 6 percentage points this week but remains underwater with the public, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that raises alarms for Democrats in a midterm election year. Mr. Biden's approval rose from 36% to 42% — up from the lowest level of his presidency the prior week — though the national poll found that 52% of Americans disapprove of his performance. His popularity among Democrats rose from 72% to 78% but only 12% of Republicans approve of his performance, the poll found.
