Dear Katie,
I am writing on behalf of our lovely neighbour, a 90-year-old widow. She has failing health and because of her Christian upbringing is very trusting of people, who she believes are inherently good.
Where companies are concerned, she considers that if she is a loyal customer this will bring rewards. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Over the past few years I have saved her quite a few hundred pounds by changing her house and car insurance and utility providers by switching companies.
