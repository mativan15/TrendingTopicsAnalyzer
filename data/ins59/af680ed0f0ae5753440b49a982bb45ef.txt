Time is running out to submit proposals for the fourth annual International Symposium at Colorado State University, which will be held from Feb. 27 to March 1 in the Lory Student Center. 
Organizers are calling for proposals for either one-hour sessions or presentations, or from those who wish to participate in a multimedia showcase of international activities. The proposals are due on Monday, Oct. 31, and will be reviewed and selected by a committee. 
Students, faculty and staff are all invited to submit proposals that cover a wide range of international topics such as educational experiences, research, social and environmental issues, health, music and arts, culture, language and politics.
