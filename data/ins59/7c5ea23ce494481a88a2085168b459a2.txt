Lynn Lolokini Ikimotu-Pavihi has a day job – she's an associate principal at Favona Primary School. She also has a night job – once a week she teaches Vagahau Niue at the Centre for Pacific Languages. She also has a radio gig – once a week she reports and broadcasts for the Niuean programme live on the Pacific Media Network. In between, she translates English content into Niuean and back again for Government agencies, handles interpretation in the courts, composes music and runs her own publishing company, putting out her own books in Niuean for her community.
