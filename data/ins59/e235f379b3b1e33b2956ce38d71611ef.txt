With winter around the corner, the Delhi government is all set to launch its ‘Red Light on Gaadi off' campaign to curb vehicular pollution from October 28, environment minister Gopal Rai said on last evening. A blanket of smog engulfed the capital Saturday morning as Delhi's air quality – at 262 – has already dipped to the ‘poor' category just ahead of Diwali and it is expected to worsen in the coming days.Delhi faces severe air pollution crisis every year due to factors like vehicular emission, firecracker bursting, stubble burning in neighbouring states, burning of garbage and illegal industrial activities, among others.
