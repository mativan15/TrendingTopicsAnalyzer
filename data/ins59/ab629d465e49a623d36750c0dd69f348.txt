Luca Bernabei, CEO of Italian production powerhouse Lux Vide behind TV hits like The CW's 'Devils,' made the decision in March to sell the majority stake in his family-owned company to international distribution giant Fremantle.

The acquisition is part of Fremantle's global push into scripted content after being known primarily for reality TV hits such as 'American Idol' and 'America's Got Talent.' Bernabei sees the acquisition as the right decision — especially as we're approaching what many financial analysts believe will be some rough economic times ahead.
