A claim by Todd Chrisley's ex-business partner that they had an affair that lasted between six months and a year is pure "fantasy," Chrisley's attorney said in his closing arguments on Friday. Mark Braddock, the man who alerted the FBI to Todd and Julie Chrisley's finances, is an admitted liar, and the fact that the government used documents he provided them in the celebrity couple's bank and tax fruad trial is enough to find them not guilty, attorney Bruce Morris told the Atlanta federal jury. "I suggest to you that Mark Braddock is the very picture of reasonable doubt," he said Friday.
