Priyanka Chopra has achieved an immense amount of success not just as an actor, but also for her philanthropic ventures. Chopra is a role model for the youth and an icon in her own right.
Variety honoured her at their ‘Power of Women' event in 2017 — and her speech is one for the books.

She begins her speech by talking about her roots and background, and how she was born to incredible parents.
