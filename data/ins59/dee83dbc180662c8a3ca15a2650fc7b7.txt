It's staying-in season, which means the best party in town is on the sofa. Make yourself a cup of something hot, snuggle up under a blanket and enjoy (finally) flicking through that coffee table book you still haven't got round to reading.In rich autumnal tones, the most coveted interiors pieces this season are made to match the turning colour of the leaves on the trees. Christina Lundsteen's stripy bolster cushion or Soho Home's table lamp, in deep shades of red, are the perfect match for Made's green floor lamp or Paul Smith's Botanist scented candle.
