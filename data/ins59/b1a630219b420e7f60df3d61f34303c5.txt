iamporpla/iStock via Getty Images I've been an investor in Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI) for the past four years, but I exited my position earlier this year at prices between $60 and $80 per share. I've written more articles about IPI than any other company, so I wanted to give an update on my thought process. In a nutshell, I think IPI is still cheap relative to its short-term earnings potential but less clearly cheap than it was at $8 or even $30. IPI is a cyclical stock, despite its business diversification and operational improvements.
