Investing.com -- Shares in Sosandar (LON:SOSS) leaped in early trading in London on Tuesday after the fashion startup defied the broader malaise in the U.K. retail sector with a second straight half-year profit and a 72% rise in sales.

The group was also upbeat about its outlook, despite signs that the U.K., where it makes nearly all its sales, is slipping into recession.

'Early autumn trading has been very positive with particular success in key growth areas of outerwear, knitwear and partywear,' the company said in a statement, adding that it was 'confident' of further gains in market share.
