The UK's big energy suppliers haveurged the government to reverse part of its energy prices bill, saying it grants 'extensive' new powers to ministers and puts billions of pounds worth of investment in jeopardy.The bill, which is making its way through parliament, was introduced as part of efforts to reduce household costs and address the broader energy crisis.But in a letter to the business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, companies including EDF, Centrica and Octopus said they had been 'alarmed' to find that the bill grants 'extensive new powers for ministers in relation to the regulation of the sector'.
