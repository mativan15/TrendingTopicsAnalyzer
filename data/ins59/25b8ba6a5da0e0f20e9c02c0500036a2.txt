May 30, 2022 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Largo Inc. ("Largo" or the "Company") (TSX: LGO) (NASDAQ: LGO) announces that the Toronto Stock Exchange ('TSX') has accepted its notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ('NCIB') to purchase for cancellation its common shares (the 'Common Shares').
