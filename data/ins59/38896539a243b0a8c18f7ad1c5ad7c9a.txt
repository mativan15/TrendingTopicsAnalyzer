NASA's James Webb Telescope has captured another spectacular image from the cosmos, this time an arrangement of newly-forming stars 6,500 light years away dubbed the "Pillars of Creation". The newly-forming stars from the Eagle Nebula, the area brimming with gas and dust, were first captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope back in 1995, but the latest images have put the pillars on full display in some of the clearest detail spectators have ever seen. The Eagle Nebula is 6,500 light years away from Earth and is a young open cluster of stars.
