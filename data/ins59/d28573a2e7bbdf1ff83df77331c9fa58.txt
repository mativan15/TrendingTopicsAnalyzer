Marjorie Taylor Greene debates Marcus Flowers in Georgia (Screen grab)

Georgia Representative Majorie Taylor Greene on Sunday used her only general election debate to comment on her Democratic opponent's headgear and cast herself as a 'victim' of the January 6 attack on the Capitol despite supporting the aims of the rioters that day.

Ms Greene is running for a second term against Marcus Flowers, who has raised significant amounts of money but has little change of defeating her because of the makeup of Georgia's 14th district.
