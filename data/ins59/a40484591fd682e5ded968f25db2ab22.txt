DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST: 
 This is FRESH AIR. The dystopian thriller "Crimes Of The Future," opening in theaters this week, is the first new movie in eight years from David Cronenberg. The Canadian filmmaker is known for such mind-bending films as "Videodrome," "The Fly" and "A History Of Violence." His latest movie takes place in a not-so-distant future and stars Viggo Mortensen and Lea Seydoux as a pair of performance artists who operate surgically on each other in public. Our film critic, Justin Chang, has this review.
