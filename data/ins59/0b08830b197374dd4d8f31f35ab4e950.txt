The Japanese yen weakened past 150 against the U.S. dollar, a key psychological level, reaching levels not seen since August 1990. The Bank of Japan's two-day meeting is slated for next week. Policymakers have ruled out a rate hike in order to defend against further weakening of the currency. On Thursday, Japan's 10-year government debt yields breached the 0.25% ceiling that the central bank vowed to defend – last standing at 0.252%. The yield on the 20-year bond also rose to its highest since September 2015.
