Here's what a ball-strike challenge system in Major League Baseball could look like.
In the above video, Yankees prospect Jasson Domínguez takes a borderline pitch at the knees in the Arizona Fall League on Oct. 7.
It's called a strike by the home-plate umpire. Domínguez challenges the call, and the automated ball-strike (ABS) system proves him right.
The pitch is shown crossing the plate just below the strike zone -- using the same type of 3D visualization of the ball's trajectory through the zone that you often see on TV broadcasts of MLB games after close pitches -- and the call is overturned to a ball.
