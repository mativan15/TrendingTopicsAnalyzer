The dashing left-handed opener will be 36 next week, a time when cricketers may consider winding back their commitments, but Warner has unfinished business.LoadingHe also has significant records pending. Sitting on 95 T20 internationals and 2850 runs, he should join captain Aaron Finch as the second Australia to reach a hundred T20 matches and 3000 runs during the next few weeks.Warner also needs four more Tests to reach a century of matches and 183 runs for 8000. With his 138 one-day internationals, Warner looks set to be the only Australian with 100 games in all three formats by the end of the summer.
