Married At First Sight UK star Sophie Brown has opened up about her recent ADHD diagnosis, which she received while filming for the E4 reality dating programme.
Sophie met and married Jonathan Wileman at the altar, and the pair went through a series of ups and downs, to him comparing her to Waitrose and himself to Morrisons on their first day, up to Jonathan sparking a lot of backlash when he said he wouldn't his wife to have ‘horse legs'.
