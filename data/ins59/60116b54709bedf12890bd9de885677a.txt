The Uruguay international's goal in the 1-0 victory over West Ham was the third time in three starts he has found the net. Nunez could have added to his tally in an impressive 57-minute appearance, having also hit the post, but his header from a left-wing cross is something Tsimikas hopes to be able to replicate regularly.
