Jun. 5—Miami University's usually quiet campus during summer break is instead bustling with construction of two major buildings totaling more than $154 million in new student facilities.

And a few blocks away, renovation work on Miami's first business development incubator continues on that $15 million project.

The building boom is the first on Miami's main Oxford campus in years for Butler County's largest university and employer.

Jessica Rivinius, spokeswoman for Miami, shouted Friday over the din of construction of the new $96 million Clinical Health Sciences and Wellness Facility, saying eventually it will be used by most of the school's more than 16,000 students who live on and around campus.
