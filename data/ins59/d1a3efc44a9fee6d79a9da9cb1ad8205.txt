Permit me one more pass at Joe Biden's alleged plan for fighting inflation. As I think most common-sense folks know, it is not a serious plan. As my pal Kevin Hassett said last night, it's not exactly the Marshall Plan.  Three quick points in this non-plan. First, blame everything on the Federal Reserve. "It's their problem, not mine," Mr. Biden inferred, and I'm thinking that if the Fed does what it needs to do in tightening the money supply and raising interest rates above inflation, then Biden will blame the resulting election-year recession on the Fed.
