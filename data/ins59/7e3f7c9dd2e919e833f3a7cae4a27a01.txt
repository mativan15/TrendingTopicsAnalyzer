Salesforce co-founder and co-CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Tuesday that the rising value of the dollar played a part in the software company lowering revenue guidance in its latest quarter."Our guidance is really impacted by foreign exchange," Benioff said in an interview on "Mad Money." "We have now had to consume about $600 million of foreign exchange changes … since we first gave guidance last November.""The [U.S] dollar gets stronger and stronger as an incredible safe haven. And while that's great if all of your revenue's in the United States, we do have strong businesses internationally – we're the third-largest software company in Japan right now," he said, adding that he's "never seen anything like" the deceleration of the Japanese yen since March.
