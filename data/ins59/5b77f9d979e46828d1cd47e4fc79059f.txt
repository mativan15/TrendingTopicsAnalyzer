One bright spot regarding market sell offs is that investors can often find high-quality stocks trading at much more attractive prices. When the market is in decline, investors rush for the exits on even the best names. This can provide opportunities for long-term investors who have been waiting for prices to drop.

Take Air Products & Chemicals Inc. (NYSE:APD) for example. Shares of this Dividend Aristocrat are down nearly 15% year-to-date, which is very close to the decline in the S&P 500 Index.
