The Raiders held practice on Thursday and not surprisingly, Darren Waller did not practice. The Pro Bowl tight end hurt his hamstring early in the team's Week 5 game against the Chiefs and has yet to return to the field.
Waller spoke with Jim Trotter of NFL Media on Wednesday and said it would be unlikely that he would be ready to return for this week's game against Houston.
