A pair of underachieving 2-4 teams face off on Thursday night when the Arizona Cardinals host the New Orleans Saints.

Maybe, the winner can turn its season around.

Kyler Murray and the Cardinals get DeAndre Hopkins back for the first time since a knee injury sidelined him for the final three games of last season and a six-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs delayed his return.

Arizona is 3-9 in its past 12 games since a 10-2 start in 2021.
