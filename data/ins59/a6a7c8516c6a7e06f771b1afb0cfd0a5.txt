Ireland's inflation rate is lower than that of Britain, the United States and most EU states, the public expenditure minister said yesterday following an almost one-point increase in a single month.As Eurostat revealed Ireland's consumer price index had risen from 7.3 per cent in April to 8.2 per cent in May, Michael McGrath acknowledged such rapid price increases had a significant impact on living standards and business competitiveness.He said the government would respond to the latest price index in pay talks with the public sector unions, and in the context of the October budget.
