Oct. 14—CANNON BEACH — During a forum held at the Coaster Theatre on Thursday night, candidates for City Council agreed on some issues and were divided on others, particularly on how to move forward with the construction of a new City Hall and police station.

The forum was organized by Vote Smart Cannon Beach, which was started by residents who describe the group as nonpartisan.

The candidates were each given a minute to answer more than a dozen questions related to issues including housing, parking, vacation rentals, the use of lodging tax revenue and divisiveness in the community.
