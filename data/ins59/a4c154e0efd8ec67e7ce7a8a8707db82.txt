Yesterday, Elon Musk decided to enter the charged Twitter debate on whether artificial general intelligence (AGI), or the ability for AI to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can, is imminent.  He put it this way:  Of course, Musk's tweets should always be taken with truckloads of salt. The world's richest man is also known for some of the world's worst Twitter takes, from manipulating Tesla stock to giving Kanye West's 2020 presidential run his 'full support' — not to mention the recent 'will he or won't he,' regarding his deal to buy Twitter itself.
