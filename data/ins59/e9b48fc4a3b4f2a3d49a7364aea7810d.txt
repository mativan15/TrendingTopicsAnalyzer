The $30.1-million project is a partnership between the City of Edmonton, the government of Alberta and the Edmonton Soccer Association.'We're always needing more opportunities, particularly during the winter months,' said Adrian Newman, CEO of the Edmonton Soccer Association.'(With) soccer, it enables us to do clinics, practice times — which were in short supply (of) before — and of course the league games, which are organized by Edmonton Minor Soccer and the adults with Edmonton District Soccer.
