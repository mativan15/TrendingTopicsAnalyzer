Indian news outlet The Wire said on Tuesday it is setting up an internal review to assess the documents, information, source material and people it relied on for critical stories on Meta that claimed the social juggernaut gave governing party BJP's top digital operative an unchecked ability to remove content from Instagram and a series of follow-up pieces in which it said Meta executives were misleading people.

The statement on Tuesday follows the security researchers that the Wire portended to rely on – and supposedly cited an email by him to confirm the authenticity of a Meta executive's email – saying fake emails were used to suggest they participated.
