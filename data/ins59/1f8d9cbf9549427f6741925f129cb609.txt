Most evenings, Sandra McGuckin tries to unwind by playing Wordle and Virginia Lottery games online, she told lottery officials.

But a recent lottery game was anything but relaxing when McGuckin won a jackpot playing Prospector's Gold, the Virginia Lottery said in an Oct. 18 news release.

'I was screaming like a lunatic!' she said. 'My son and husband came running into the room!'

The Virginia Beach mom plans to use her $256,143 prize to pay off some bills and possibly buy a new car, she told officials.
