The annual recognition program, which relaunched on May 2, 2022, during Teacher Appreciation Week (May 2 – 6), serves to recognize and reward 100 teachers across the U.S. and Canada with a free cruise, as well as a chance at up to $25,000 for their school. The educators with the most votes will travel to Galveston, Texas for an exclusive five-day sailing aboard the Company's record-breaking ship, Norwegian Prima, from Oct. 27 to 31, 2022, where GRAMMY Award-winning artist and superstar Kelly Clarkson will host an exclusive concert on board.
