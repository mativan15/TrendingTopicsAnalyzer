By Cristina Roca Beiersdorf AG will take Delivery Hero SE's place on the DAX index, Germany stock-exchange operator Deutsche Boerse AG said late on Friday. Shares in the maker of personal-care products will trade on the blue-chip index as of June 20, while those of Delivery Hero will be relegated to the MDAX index. The DAX has 40 constituents. They are chosen based on their free-float market capitalization, which is reviewed every three months, Deutsche Boerse said. Write to Cristina Roca at cristina.
