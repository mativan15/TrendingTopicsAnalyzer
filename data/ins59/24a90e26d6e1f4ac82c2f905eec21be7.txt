An Emmy award-winning ABC News journalist who broke several high-profile national security and terrorism-related stories has gone missing since the FBI reportedly seized classified information from his laptop during a raid on his Virginia home, according to published reports. 
James Gordon Meek, a 52-year-old investigative reporter and producer of Hulu's acclaimed documentary '3212 Un-redacted,' has not been seen in public since heavily armed federal agents raided his penthouse apartment in Arlington in April, according to Rolling Stone.
