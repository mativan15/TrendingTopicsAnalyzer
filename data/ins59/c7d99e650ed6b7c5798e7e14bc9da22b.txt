First Lady Jill Biden was married at the age of 18 to her first husband. Eventually the relationship collapsed, and she found herself divorced with no income and home in her mid-20s. While getting over the breakup was painful, it also taught her a financial lesson she will never forget.'I knew I would never, ever put myself in that position again – where I didn't feel like I had the finances to be on my own, that I had to get money through a divorce settlement,' Dr. Biden told Harper's Bazaar in a cover interview that appeared in its June-July issue.
