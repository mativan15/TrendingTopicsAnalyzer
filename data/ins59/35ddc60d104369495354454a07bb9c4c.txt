Cadillac confirmed Monday that its forthcoming flagship Celestiq sedan will launch late next year with all of the futuristic bells and whistles befitting a bespoke EV starting 'north of $300,000.'
The Celestiq isn't just a flagship for the GM luxury brand. The four-seater is slated to set the direction for the brand's transition to a full battery-electric lineup by 2030.
GM is loading up the Celestiq with new features and tech, pushing the price point well beyond other Cadillac models. When GM begins building the Celestiq by hand December 2023 at its Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, the vehicle will cost roughly 10 times an entry-level Cadillac.
