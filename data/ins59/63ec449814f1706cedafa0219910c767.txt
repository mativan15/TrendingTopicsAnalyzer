USC recruiting is a stock you want to buy, right? Not so fast, says one college football recruiting analyst.
Ari Wasserman of The Athletic isn't telling people to sell USC stock in the recruiting world, but he isn't yet buying, either:
USC — Hold: If this question was asked right after the Lincoln Riley hire, I'd have told you to buy. But now Riley's presence — along with Caleb Williams — has the Trojans overpriced. If you have it, hold. If you don't, this isn't where you want to buy in. USC is priced as though it has already been to the College Football Playoff.
