Matt Gault, BBC SportWhile a point extends West Ham's unbeaten run in all competitions to five games, their overriding feeling leaving St Mary's will have been one of frustration. First, Hammers boss David Moyes expressed his exasperation at two refereeing decisions in his post-match comments.
Moyes insisted that Tomas Soucek should have been awarded a penalty and that Southampton's goal should not have stood after Jarrod Bowen was obstructed by Peter Bankes as he attempted to reach the ball ahead of Saints goalscorer Romain Perraud.
