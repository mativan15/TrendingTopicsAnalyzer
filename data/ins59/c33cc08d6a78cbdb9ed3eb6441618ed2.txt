Intel Corp. set targets far lower than expected when it filed to take Mobileye Global Inc. public at a valuation of about $16 billion on Tuesday.

That's slightly more than the $15.3 billion than the Santa Clara-based chip giant paid for the Israel-based self-driving technology company in 2017 and far below the $30 billion to $50 billion valuation that had been talked about earlier this year.

Intel said in its filing that it plans to sell 41 million shares for between $18 and $20 each, raising $820 million in the initial public offering.
