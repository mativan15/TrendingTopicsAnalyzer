While some Apple Store employees push to unionize, Apple has reportedly told some of its retail workers it's planning to make its scheduling rules more generous and flexible. For instance, Apple will extend the minimum time between shifts from 10 hours to 12 hours, impose a limit of three days per week that workers are allowed to work past 8 p.m. and reduce the number of consecutive days they can be scheduled to work from six days in a row to five (except during holidays or product launches), according to a Bloomberg report.
