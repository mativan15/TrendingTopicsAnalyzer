A human rights activist in Iran told VOA's Persian service that according to her sources, authorities at Tehran's Evin prison shot at prisoners who were fleeing the fire and smoke during a deadly blaze there Saturday.
"Everything we see from the government is just a disaster,' said Pouran Nazemi, a civil and human rights activist based in Iran. There was no immediate response from Tehran to her comments.
Iran says eight people were killed in the fire but Nazemi said the number is still unknown as "several hospitals are on alert" and that government forces "are standing in front of them and not letting anyone close.
