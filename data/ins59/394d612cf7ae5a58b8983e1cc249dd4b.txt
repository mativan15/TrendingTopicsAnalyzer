Will they, or won't they? Monday at 5 p.m. Central is the NBA's contract extension deadline for Kevin Porter Jr. and the Houston Rockets, along with all other first-round draft picks from 2019.
Porter, who turned 22 this offseason, is entering the fourth and final season (2022-23) of the rookie contract he signed after being selected by Cleveland in the 2019 first round. He was traded to Houston in January 2021, which gave the Rockets his contract rights.
Even if the Rockets don't extend Porter, he would be a restricted free agent in the 2023 offseason.
