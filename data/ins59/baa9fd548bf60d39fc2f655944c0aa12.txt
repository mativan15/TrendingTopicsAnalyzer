By Australian Associated Press Published: 13:35 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 13:35 EDT, 31 May 2022 Single-use plastic shopping bags have been banned in NSW ahead of further changes to eliminate other plastics later this year. The ban came into effect on Wednesday after laws passed parliament in November. Retailers who continue to provide the bags could face a fine of up to $275,000. The state will expand the ban on single-use plastics in November to include straws, coffee stirrers, cutlery, plates, cotton buds, polystyrene cups and containers, and cosmetics containing plastic microbeads.
