Actor Sonali Bendre is tired of being seen as a 'glamorous' person through the Bollywood lens, instead of a serious actor. And she is working really hard to turn it around. 'Bollywood has always seen me more as the glamorous person, then, as a serious actor. I want that to change. I have nothing against glamour, I love being glamorous. But there is more to me,' Bendre tells us. She continues, 'And I would like those layers to be explored'. In fact, it has turned out to be the driving force to decide her upcoming projects, be it non-fiction television or her return to mainstream acting with her OTT debut project.
