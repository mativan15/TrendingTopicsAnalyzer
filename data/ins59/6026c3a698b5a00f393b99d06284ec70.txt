Stranger Things actor David Harbour has described being mentally ill as "a natural condition of poverty" while reflecting on fame as the popular series returns to Netflix. Harbour, 47, found fame for his portrayal of Jim Hopper in the science fiction drama series Stranger Things and also hit the headlines when he married British pop star Lily Allen.
However, he has reflected on how becoming successful later in life affected his mental health over the years due to "worries over not having enough money to live on".
