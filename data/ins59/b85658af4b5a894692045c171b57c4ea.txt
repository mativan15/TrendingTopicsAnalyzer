Several parts of Mumbai have reported an uptick in dengue and influenza H1N1 cases, primarily due to the extension of the monsoon season. Every year, cities across India witness a spurt in vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria and chikungunya in the wake of heavy rains. The BMC on Tuesday said that 178 cases of dengue and 13 cases of swine flu had been reported in the first 16 days of the month, as reported by TOI. 
Overall, Mumbai has logged 746 cases of dengue this year and two deaths. Swine flu cases have seen a big surge in 2022, with 325 infections and two deaths in the city - so far.
