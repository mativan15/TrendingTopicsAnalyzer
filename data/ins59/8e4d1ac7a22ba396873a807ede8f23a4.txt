DNY59In July, I covered the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:SQQQ) in "SQQQ: The Nasdaq 100 May Be Headed For Another Leg Lower." Since then, the Nasdaq 100 and most stocks have declined materially, causing SQQQ to rise by around 25%. The Nasdaq 100 index currently rests near its annual low after losing around a third of its value this year. Investors and speculators are racing to either purchase "discounted" stocks or betting on an even more giant wave of declines. The Nasdaq index has fallen significantly this year, which is not atypical of most recessionary situations.
