A former Vatican official has said he was under intense "psychological pressure" to finalise a deal over the Holy See's troubled investment in a London property, but entered into the negotiations without a lawyer and did not realise the deal made the Vatican nothing in return.Fabrizio Tirabassi gave evidence for seven hours about the frenzied meetings he attended in London on 20-22 November 2018, saying that the Holy See had thought it would salvage its €350m (£300m) investment in the former Harrod's warehouse and stem its losses.
