NEW YORK (AP) — Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified Thursday that there was nothing suspicious about his interactions with a Donald Trump ally who is being tried on allegations that he secretly fed confidential information to the United Arab Emirates.

Tom Barrack, the onetime chair of the Trump's inaugural committee, is accused of using his 'unique access' as a longtime friend of Trump to manipulate Trump's campaign — and later his Republican administration — to advance the interests of the UAE.
