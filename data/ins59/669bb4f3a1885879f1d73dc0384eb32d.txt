Tony Fadell has worn many hats, from an inventor and entrepreneur to investor and mentor. But he is most famous for being the man who created the iconic iPod — he also co-invented the iPhone during his time at Apple. Fadell's life journey is not common even by Silicon Valley standards, and that's why his new book ‘Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making' is being called an advice encyclopaedia for everyone.
He spoke to Nandagopal Rajan for Express Audio's Our Own Devices podcast on entrepreneurship, designing for customers and innovation.
