deepblue4you/E+ via Getty Images Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) stock slid 3.5% in early Thursday morning trading after Wells Fargo downgraded shares one of America's biggest auto lenders to Underweight from Equal Weight. In addressing Ally's (ALLY) weaker than expected third-quarter results, Wells Fargo believes net interest margin pressure and falling used car pricing will keep weighing on fundamentals and sentiment, according to a note written to clients. "There's not enough clarity on the macro to make their planned December update a positive catalyst, in our view," Wells Fargo noted.
