In letters sent to loved ones back home, jailed American Sarah Krivanek writes: "my soul is in torment."
 
Krivanek, 46, is serving a one-year, three-month sentence in a remote Russian penal colony in connection with domestic assault charges that stemmed from a November 2021 dispute in Moscow. She told the court that she was defending herself from repeated attacks against a Russian man she knew and nicked him on the nose with a knife.
 
She'd been living and working in Russia's capital as a schoolteacher for five years when the incident occurred.
