New York gubernatorial candidate Tom Suozzi claims Gov. Kathy Hochul's obsession with the Buffalo Bills could doom the Big Apple's public schools.
The Long Island congressman told The Post Friday he believes Hochul, a Buffalo native and fellow Democrat, surrendered too much political capital during this year's budget negotiations to secure support for construction on a new $1.4 billion stadium for her favorite football team – to be funded with an unprecedented $850 million in public money.
This, he claims, made it all but impossible for Hochul to deliver Mayor Eric Adams the four-year extension of mayoral control over city schools that she promised or help combat rising crime by fixing state bail laws.
