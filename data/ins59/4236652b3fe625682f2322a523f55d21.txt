Dealing with the Brisbane River silt that chokes Moreton Bay, restricts shipping channels and threatens the water supply should be a 'green legacy' from the 2032 Olympic Games, according to a former Queensland government minister.

Stephen Robertson, who has held several portfolios including resources and water, said replanting eroded sections of the riverbank upstream would stop billions of tonnes of topsoil flowing from farms in the Lockyer Valley with every flood.

The Brisbane River has a silt problem.
