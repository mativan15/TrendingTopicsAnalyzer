NEW YORK (AP) — Mike Trout's future, he admits, is very much in doubt. Not as a baseball great. As the commissioner of a fantasy football league that's suddenly gotten a lot of attention. 'Am I going to resign? I haven't made that decision,' the Los Angeles Angels star said Wednesday, laughing. 'But every commissioner I know always get booed,' he said. The bizarre saga began last Friday when Cincinnati outfielder Tommy Pham slapped San Francisco outfielder Joc Pederson before a game. Pham later said it was over a fantasy football dispute, and he was suspended three games by Major League Baseball.
