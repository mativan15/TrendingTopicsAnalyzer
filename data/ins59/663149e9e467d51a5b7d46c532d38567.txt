The Vikings enter the bye week with a charmed 5-1 record and a roster that is "pretty clean injury wise," said head coach Kevin O'Connell, whose to-do list is still plenty populated after straining through four straight one-score wins.

Six games into O'Connell's offense, the Vikings rank middle of the pack across the board — points (14th), red-zone efficiency (13th), third downs (17th), yards (20th) — and have fielded an uneven defense that allows a lot of yardage, but not as many points. Playing clean with limited turnovers and penalties helped them overcome issues like 10 three-and-out drives in Sunday's win against the Dolphins.
