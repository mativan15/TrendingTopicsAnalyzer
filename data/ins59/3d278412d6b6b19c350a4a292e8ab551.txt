Massimo Giachetti Singapore-based cancer drugmaker Aum Biosciences is going public on Nasdaq via a business combination with SPAC Mountain Crest Acquisition (NASDAQ:MCAG). The transaction reflects a pre-money equity value of $400M for Aum and is expected to provide ~$69M of cash held in Mountain Crest's trust account, assuming no redemptions, the companies said in a statement on Thursday. After closing, the combined company will operate under a holding entity to be formed as a Cayman Islands exempted company (Holdco) and intends to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol AUMB.
