Group4 Studio Thesis InMode Ltd. (NASDAQ:INMD) is slated to report its Q3 earnings release on October 27. The company recently raised its full-year revenue guidance while expecting record revenue in Q3. Accordingly, it led to a surge last week, but the market digested most of its gains by the end of the week. We assess that INMD has been de-rated by the market, even as it trades well below its overvalued highs in late 2021. It's also trading below the valuations of its broad industry peers, suggesting the market is less confident of its growth prospects.
