Published: 16:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 16:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 After they both missed the playoffs last season and languished near the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, the Indiana Pacers and Washington Wizards will start the climb back to respectability when they meet Wednesday night in a 2022-23 season opener at Indianapolis. Washington will begin its season looking to rebound from a disappointing 12th-place finish in the East a season ago. The Wizards opened the 2021-22 season 11-5 but went just 24-42 the rest of the way.
