Vancouver - The Vancouver Canucks set some dubious records on their season-opening road swing. Not only did they become the first team in NHL history to lose their first four games of the season while blowing multi-goal leads, but after five straight losses (0-3-2), Vancouver is the only team in the league that has yet to record a win. Despite the dismal record, the Canucks are still looking at the positives, said head coach Bruce Boudreau. 'It's not like we're going out and playing and losing 6-1 every night and getting outplayed,' he said.
