PhonePe's revenue from operations grew 138% to Rs 1,646 crore in the fiscal year 2021-2022 (FY22), the digital payments company said on Tuesday. Overall losses, excluding Employee Stock Ownership Plan (Esop) costs, narrowed marginally to Rs 827 crore in the same period. Its losses (excluding Esop costs) were Rs 886 crore in FY21 and Rs 1,566 crore in FY20. Revenue from operations was Rs 690 crore in FY21 and Rs 371.7 crore in FY20. 'The increase in revenue is primarily driven by the robust growth PhonePe has seen across all its lines of businesses,' the Walmart-owned company said.
