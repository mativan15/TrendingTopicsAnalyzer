Oct 21 (Reuters) - Global bond funds witnessed outflows for the ninth successive week in the week ended Oct. 19, as some higher-than-expected inflation readings raised worries that major global central banks would continue to raise interest rates aggressively.

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, investors disposed of a net $11.88 billion worth of global bond funds after offloading $12.87 billion worth in the previous week.

During the reported week, inflation data from the U.S. and Britain showed that consumer prices rose more than expected in September, solidifying expectations that central banks will remain firmly in rate-hiking mode.
