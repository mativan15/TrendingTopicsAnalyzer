'I would hope you're being honest since you're in the witness box at the High Court.' https://t.co/HTZjILUala— BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) May 21, 2022 Interesting moments from the trial:-Rooney planted several fake stories as part of her investigation, which she told nobody about, including her husband, Wayne. These stories and the photo evidence of Rebekah Vardy being the ONLY person to view the stories were submitted into evidence at trial.Lol the fake stories Coleen planted to entrap Vardy. Love Coleen.
