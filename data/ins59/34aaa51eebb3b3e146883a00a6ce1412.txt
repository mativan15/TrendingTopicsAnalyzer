ATLANTA (AP) — A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters.

Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection in the midterm elections on Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock's behalf — composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda.

'Who I'm really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda, because I'm a really big fan of his,' said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock.
