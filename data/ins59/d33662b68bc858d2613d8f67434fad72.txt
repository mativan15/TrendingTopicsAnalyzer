ROME (Reuters) - Giancarlo Giorgetti, Italy's new economy minister, is a veteran political wheeler-dealer viewed as a moderate and relatively pro-European member of his right-wing League party.

A low-key counterweight to the party's fiery, eurosceptic leader Matteo Salvini, Giorgetti has spent most of his 26 years in parliament behind the scenes, negotiating on others' behalf and making influential friends in finance, including outgoing premier Mario Draghi.

The 55-year-old career politician was not, however, the first choice for a job that, despite having served as industry minister in Draghi's outgoing government, he told Reuters he wasn't sure he was capable of doing.
