Elon Musk ordered Tesla staffers back into the office full-time on Tuesday — and invited employees who weren't happy to pack up and 'pretend to work somewhere else.' 
In a terse email sent to corporate Tesla staffers, Musk wrote that 'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers.'
'If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly,' Musk added.
