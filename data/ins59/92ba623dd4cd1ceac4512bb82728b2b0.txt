The current returns on India's small savings schemes have slipped below the formula prescribed for determining their rates by 44 to 77 basis points (bps), despite a 10 to 30 bps increase effected by the government on some schemes' returns for the October-to-December quarter. (100 basis points equal one percentage point).Effecting the first increase in small savings rates since January 2019, the government raised returns on five of 12 such schemes in operation for this quarter. This was the first tweak in small savings since the April-to-June quarter of 2020 when they were slashed across schemes.
