The Criminal Asset Bureau (CAB) has argued before the High Court that gangland figure James ‘Mago' Gately and his partner, Charlene Lam, should not be granted free legal aid to defend proceedings in which the bureau alleges their family home was bought with the proceeds of crime.CAB opposes the application, claiming the couple can afford to pay for their own legal representation. It says they have gone on foreign trips, including cruises to the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, and spent more than €440,000 on their home.
