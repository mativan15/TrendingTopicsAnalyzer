Shantaram's journey to the screen has had a journey every bit as epic as the story in the novel by Gregory David Roberts on which it's based. 
Russell Crowe and Johnny Depp are just two of the names connected to abandoned projects since the book debuted in 2003.
So, what's the problem? Well, in this 12-part adaptation, it's plain to see: there's just too much to pack in (the novel stretches to a door-stopping 900-plus pages) as the story loops around the story of escaped bank robber Lin's quest for personal freedom and the intricate politics of 1980s Bombay, a city of extreme wealth and desperate poverty.
