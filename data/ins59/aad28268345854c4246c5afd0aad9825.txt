Sister Wives star Christine Brown is dipping her feet back into the dating pool after leaving Kody Brown.
 
In a conversation with Entertainment Tonight, Christine, 50, revealed she's dating "very, very casually" since the breakup.
 
"I'm single now, right? So I kind of just decide what I want to do and then do it. It's been just very, very simple," she said. "Everything's just a lot easier as far as just planning and day-to-day life."
 
But Christine isn't looking for love just yet. "Not romantic, because that's way too fast, but dating for sure," she explained.
