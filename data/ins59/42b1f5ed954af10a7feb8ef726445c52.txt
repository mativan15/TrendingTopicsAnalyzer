A research doctor and biotech founder based in California has been accused of hiring a hitman to murder one of his business partners.

Dr. Serhat Gumrukcu, 39, of Los Angeles was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the 2018 murder of Vermont resident Gregory Davis, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney for Vermont.

A federal grand jury in Vermont indicted Gumrukcu and Berk Eratay, 35, of Las Vegas, Nevada with conspiring to use interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire which resulted in Davis' death.
