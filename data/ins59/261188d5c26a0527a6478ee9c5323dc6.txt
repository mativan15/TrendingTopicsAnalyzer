DULUTH — The Northland Foundation announced Monday that it has $25,000 available to individuals or small groups that are working to raise awareness around Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.

The foundation is offering up to 10 grants of $2,500 each to grassroots organizations that need a financial boost toward supplies, hosting events, or paying workers.

Erik Torch, the foundation's director of grantmaking, stood in front of red dresses and shawls — symbols used in awareness campaigns — in the atrium of City Hall for the announcement.
