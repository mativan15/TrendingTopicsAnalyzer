Love Island's Paige Thorne has claimed she wasn't allowed to speak to bombshell Jay Younger for a week when he entered the villa, as she spilled secrets from the series. The 24-year-old also said she "hated" her baywatch outfit she wore for the heart rate challenge, and suggested the show should come with a warning that it had been "enhanced" for entertainment. During an episode of the Saving Grace podcast, Paige was asked by host Grace Kelly if there was anyone in the villa that she wanted to speak to but wasn't allowed to.
