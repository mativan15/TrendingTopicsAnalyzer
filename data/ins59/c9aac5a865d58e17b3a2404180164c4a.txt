Beleaguered Chinese tech giant Huawei has named two execs to run its enterprise and carrier businesses following the death of Ryan Ding Yun, who had managed both units.
Ding passed away in the early hours of October 7, Huawei confirmed to us at the time, due to a "sudden illness." He was 53 and had worked for the company for almost half his life.
Huawei has asked David Wang Tao, exec director of the board and chairman of its Infrastructure Managing Board, to run the enterprise group. And David Li Peng has been passed the controls for the carrier business.
