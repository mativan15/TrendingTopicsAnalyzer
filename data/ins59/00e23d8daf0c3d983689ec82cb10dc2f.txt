When Aboubakar Soumahoro was a child in his West African home country of Ivory Coast, he cleaned people's shoes to make money. He also had a dream to go to Italy. He would cut out magazine pictures related to the country and save them in a record book.
His dream came true in 1999 when he arrived in Rome, Italy's capital. He was 19 years old and shocked by the difficulties he faced in a country he had prized for so long.
"Sleeping rough in the streets was traumatic, especially when I realized that this was the result of a political decision that targeted the migrants," Soumahoro told Reuters.
