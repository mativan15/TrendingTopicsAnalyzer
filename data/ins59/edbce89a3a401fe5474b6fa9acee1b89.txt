The world is facing extraordinary challenges, most immediately the COVID-19 pandemic and its socioeconomic impacts. The pandemic, along with climate change, conflicts, slowing global economic growth, widening digital divides, rising hunger and structural inequalities among and within nations, is likely to continue to create stress fractures, unless new and vigorous practices are adopted to promote inclusive and sustainable development.

The recent accumulation of crises is threatening the development achievements that have been made in recent decades, and threatening to impede and postpone the imperative conversion to more inclusive sustainable development.
