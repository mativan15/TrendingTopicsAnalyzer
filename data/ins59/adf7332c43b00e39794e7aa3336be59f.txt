Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has launched its first ever all-electric vehicle.First deliveries of the Rolls-Royce Spectre will be made at the end of next year after pressure from its wealthy clientele for the BMW-owned marque to join the zero-emission automotive revolution.The two-door Coupe will be built at Rolls's plant in Goodwood, Sussex, which employs 2,000 people.It will cost more than £300,000, somewhere between its top-of-the-range Phantom, enjoyed by political and business potentates alike, and the Cullinan, the marque's controversial move to create Rolls-Royce's first 4x4.
