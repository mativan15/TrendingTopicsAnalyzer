Decentralized finance (DeFi) could require new kinds of voluntary regulation to manage the severe threats it poses, finance professor Tarik Roukny told the European Commission today, as the EU executive ponders how to regulate a sector that doesn't easily fit under existing financial norms.

The commission seems set to take Roukny's comments on board as it finalizes the landmark Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA), which largely regulates centralized entities, and turns policy attention towards more distributed forms of lending or investment that are based on software protocols.
