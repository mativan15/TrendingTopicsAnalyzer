Tokyo shares closed lower Friday, extending losses after falls on Wall Street as US Treasury yields rose, reflecting fresh rate hike worries. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.43 percent, or 116.38 points, to end at 26,890.58, while the broader Topix index fell 0.71 percent, or 13.43 points, to 1,881.98.

 The overall mood of global investors has soured as US yields head higher and the Federal Reserve continues its aggressive rate-hike campaign to fight inflation.

 The Fed's "strategic bias is for more rate hikes now and fewer later when fighting inflation and will continue to bite so long as inflation remains sticky", said Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management.
