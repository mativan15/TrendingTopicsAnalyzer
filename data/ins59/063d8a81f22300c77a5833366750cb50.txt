While many Western buyers are avoiding Russian crude in response to its invasion of Ukraine, Indian private refiners such as and Nayara have been among the biggest buyers this year of discounted Russian supplies. They are reaping major profits by reducing domestic sales and aggressively boost fuel exports, including to buyers in Europe, which is now boycotting imports of Russian energy.
