(Bloomberg) -- In the build up to the splashy biopic 'Elvis,' which premieres in theaters on June 24, Elvis-mania has started to take hold.The film got a 12-minute standing ovation at Cannes. Las Vegas chapels stopped getting cease-and-desist orders to halt Elvis-impersonator weddings. Even the travel site Booking.com is getting in on the action, offering the 'Ultimate Elvis Experience,' a special two-night stay at the Guest House at Graceland, birthplace of 'The King' in Memphis, that includes behind-the-scenes tours of attractions like the Presley Motors Museum, chauffeured vintage Cadillac rides, an advanced screening of the movie with a surprise cast member, and a souvenir Elvis-themed Gibson Epiphone guitar.
