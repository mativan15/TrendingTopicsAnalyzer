CNN —

Wendy Williams has some irons in the fire.

The former daytime talk show host entered a wellness facility over the summer and now her representative says she is 'home and healing.'

'Wendy is excited about the road ahead and looking forward to releasing her many projects,' Williams' publicist Shawn Zanotti told Entertainment Tonight in a statement. Adding a sentiment from Williams, 'Thank you to my fans for your love, support and many prayers, I am back and better than ever.'

Williams has been open about her previous struggle with addiction.
