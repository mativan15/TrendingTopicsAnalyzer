The rapper and the Senate candidate each, in their way, offer up a ridiculous caricature of Black conservatism.

Fox News viewers tell me I'm a Black liberal.

A lot of people who know me personally, tell me I'm a Black conservative, citing the fact that I work for Fox News, my church-going and my long marriage.

I'll give both sides this much:

I am a Black Democrat with some conservative views. And I am always happy to defend the value of Black conservatism in American history.
To my eyes as a civil rights historian, Booker T.
