Jun. 4—Midland High football coach Thad Fortune described Jake Worley as the picture of how to properly balance the workload between classes and athletics.

Worley became a senior leader for the football and track teams while finishing in the top 10% of his graduating class.

"It's no surprise having watched him work every day for the last year and a half that he would also be successful in the classroom," Fortune said. "He's just steady every day, consistent, he was the same kid every day in a good way.
