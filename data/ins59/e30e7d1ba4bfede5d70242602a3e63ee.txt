Twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of engaging in 'unlawful conduct' aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company.The lawsuit filed late Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claims the billionaire Tesla chief executive has sought to drive down Twitter's stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price. San Francisco-based Twitter is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status as well as compensation for damages.
