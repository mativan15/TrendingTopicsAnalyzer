A special team set up by the Mumbai Police, which was inquiring into allegations that a witness in the Cordelia cruise ship drug raid case — at the behest of an NCB officer — tried to extort money from actor Shah Rukh Khan's manager Pooja Dadlani to set Aryan Khan free, said the probe has made no headway as Dadlani did not file a complaint.
Prabhakar Sail, the witness who leveled the extortion allegations, died last month of a heart attack. A vigilance team of the NCB was also looking into the allegations.
