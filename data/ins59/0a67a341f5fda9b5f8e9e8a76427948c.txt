Denzel Mims has been waiting for his opportunity with the Jets, and he finally may get one Sunday in Denver. 
Head coach Robert Saleh said the little-used receiver will be active for the first time this season against the Broncos, as a replacement for fellow receiver Elijah Moore, who on Thursday requested a trade and will sit out the game. 
Mims also asked for a trade in August, but the Jets did not oblige the third-year receiver's request. Instead, they made him a healthy scratch for their first six games.
