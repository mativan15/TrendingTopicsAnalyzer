It's no secret: The manual transmission is a dying breed. While enthusiasts love to shift gears themselves, manufacturers are finding it harder and harder to justify keeping three-pedal options around. BMW, though, seems committed to the stick shift, at least until 2030.

CarBuzz caught up with M boss Frank van Meel at a recent event at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit in South Africa and asked where the brand stood on the manual transmission.

"The manual is, unfortunately, not so widespread anymore," van Meel told CarBuzz.
