Work is underway on two new communities by Fischer Homes, Greater Cincinnati's largest homebuilder.

The homebuilder will open Oaks of Eastgate in Batavia and Summerlyn Farms in Lebanon. Brian Johnson, Fischer's Cincinnati market resident, told the Courier the communities will help meet the huge demand for patio homes in the area and each offer great locations.

The communities are made up of paired patio homes, which are around 1,200 square feet homes attached to another unit. Johnson said Fischer's patio homes are usually built on slabs, which means the homes have minimal steps and could be good for older or retired buyers.
