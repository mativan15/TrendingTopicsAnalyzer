The excitement around web3 and the metaverse have pulled plenty of entrepreneurs who defined the first generation of native mobile apps to begin questioning what's next.

Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley is on the co-founding team of a new startup called LivingCities, alongside Matt Miesnieks, who sold his most recent startup 6D.ai to Niantic for an undisclosed sum, as well as designer John Gaeta best known for his work on the Matrix Trilogy. The trio say they have banked $4 million in early funding led by DCVC for their project.
