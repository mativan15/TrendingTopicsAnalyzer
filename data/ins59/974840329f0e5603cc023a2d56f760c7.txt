SAN DIEGO -- The Padres, when they desperately needed it, came up with yet another five-run rally that shook Petco Park on Wednesday afternoon. Now they're headed to Philadelphia with a split -- and this National League Championship Series is up for grabs again.
San Diego overcame an early four-run deficit to even the series at a game apiece with an 8-5 victory in Game 2. In a wild five-run, 39-minute bottom of the fifth inning, the Padres brought 11 men to the plate and turned a two-run deficit into a three-run lead with one clutch hit after another.
