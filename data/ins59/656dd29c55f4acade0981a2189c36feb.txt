The Battle for the Victory Bell returns to Saturday night prime time as Duke and North Carolina clash at Wallace Wade Stadium.

The ACC Coastal Division rivals both have good chances to be bowl teams this season, a rarity that they would each play in college football's postseason in the same year. It hasn't happened since 2015.

UNC (5-1, 2-0 ACC) leads the Coastal Division and a win over the Blue Devils Saturday night would clinch bowl eligibility for the Tar Heels and solidify their place as the front-runner to reach the ACC championship game.
