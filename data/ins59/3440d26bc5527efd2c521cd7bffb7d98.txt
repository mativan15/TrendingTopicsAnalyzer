WHP580 NewsroomJun 2, 2022>> EMS Agencies Might get More Money from State (Harrisburg, PA) -- Some state lawmakers are hoping to help EMS agencies in Pennsylvania get more money. State Representative Martin Causer says one of the biggest hurdles they face is in the area of Medicaid reimbursement and he's trying to do something about that. He says the agencies have only seen two increases in this kind of reimbursement in the last 20 years. His house bill passed out of committee last week and now goes to the full house for consideration.
