Series record: First meeting. WHAT´S AT STAKE? Both teams hope to rebound from last week's home losses. Stanford pitched a first-half shutout and wound up holding on for a 16-14 victory in South Bend, Indiana - the Cardinal's first win over an FBS foe in more than a year. The Fighting Irish are 1-2 at home this season and must win their final three games at Notre Dame Stadium to post a winning record in coach Marcus Freeman's first season.
