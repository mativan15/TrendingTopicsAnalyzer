'Obviously, Moriarty in our story is our hero, but he's not necessarily a good guy, he does have moments of anger, moments of frustration – he's willing to lean on the criminal underworld,' Monaghan adds. 'And Sherlock Holmes isn't the bad guy in it, he's a detective working with the police, but he has his own personal agenda.'Boyd, Monaghan's co-star in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and his conversational sparring partner in their weekly podcast The Friendship Onion, stars as Colonel Moran.
