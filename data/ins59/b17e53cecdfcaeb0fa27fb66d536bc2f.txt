There are not a lot of choices in the really large, luxury SUV segment, but today I bring you one of my favorites, the Lincoln Navigator L Reserve 4x4. The L designation means it is longer than the regular version and adds a lot of cargo behind the 3 rd row seat.

Pop open that big, long hood and you'll find a 3.5-liter V6 twin-turbo EcoBoost engine that is putting out a very strong 440-horses, and is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission.

My Flight Blue review vehicle is a 4-wheel drive, but you can get it in a 2-wheel version as well.
