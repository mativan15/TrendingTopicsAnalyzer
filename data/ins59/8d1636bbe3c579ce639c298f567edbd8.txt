With attention turning to corporate earnings reports, the Nasdaq rose more than 3% to start out the week. Participating in the upswing, electric vehicle stocks surged. Signs of potential support from China's government gave a lift to names like Tesla (TSLA), Rivian Automotive (RIVN), Lucid Group (LCID), Nio (NIO), XPeng (XPEV) and Canoo (GOEV).
