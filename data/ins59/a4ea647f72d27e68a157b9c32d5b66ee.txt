President Biden on Friday touted recent figures showing the federal budget deficit fell by $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2022 from the prior year's levels, as Democrats work to fend off Republican attacks on the economy and inflation ahead of midterm elections.

Biden boasted the decline as 'the largest one-year drop in American history' in remarks to reporters on Friday.

'Let me repeat that. The largest ever decline to the federal deficit,' he said. 'Let me be clear. This record deficit reduction includes the cost of my student loan plan and everything else we're paying for.
