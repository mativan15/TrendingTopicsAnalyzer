The Rangers had to sacrifice their top depth forward in the name of cap space, and now they've lost him to the waiver wire.
Dryden Hunt was picked up by the reigning Stanley Cup champion Avalanche on Thursday, before the Rangers' 3-2 overtime loss to the Sharks. The Rangers already have had two players sidelined with minor injuries, and Hunt had to fill in for three contests. Hunt even scored the game-tying goal in the third period of the Rangers' first loss of the season, against the Jets last week.
