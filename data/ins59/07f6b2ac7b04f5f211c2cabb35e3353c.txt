However, entertainment company Broadband Choices recently used science to find the answer. In the company's annual "Science of Scare" study, researchers curated a list of the most terrifying movies and showed them to 250 participants in customized "screaming rooms" to find out which horror flicks pushed them to the edge. In order to achieve this, researchers monitored viewers' heart rates while watching popular scary movies.
