Elon Musk made a clear distinction between himself and Warren Buffett on an earnings call.

The Tesla CEO said he designs and develops products, whereas Buffett invests and allocates capital.

Musk rejected the idea of having a portfolio of businesses, or a structure like Berkshire Hathaway.

Elon Musk has distanced himself from Warren Buffett, saying he creates and builds things as opposed to playing the stock market and moving money around.

The Tesla CEO was asked, during the automaker's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, whether he saw value in creating a parent or "umbrella" corporation like Google-owner Alphabet.
