Washington — 
Germany's announcement that it will take in 1,000 at-risk Afghans with their families from Afghanistan will be challenging, an Afghan lawyer says, because it is becoming increasingly difficult for Afghans to leave Afghanistan.
In a joint statement, the German Foreign and Interior ministries announced the new humanitarian admission program on Monday.
'The plan is to approve around 1,000 Afghans at particular risk, along with their family members from Afghanistan for admittance every month,' said the statement.
