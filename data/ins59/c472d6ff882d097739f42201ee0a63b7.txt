 The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to entertain an urgent plea to lift a ban on the production, storage, sale and bursting of fire crackers in the capital. "Spend your money on sweets… Let people breathe clean air," a Bench led by Justice M.R. Shah said. The petition filed by BJP MP Manoj Tiwari had challenged the ban imposed by the Delhi government. The ban, which includes green crackers, would be in place till January 1, 2023.
