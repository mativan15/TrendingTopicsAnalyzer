"Dear HDFC User, Your HDFC Account Will Be Blocked Today. Please Update Your PAN Card Immediately. Click Here." Like many cyber victims, Delhi's Sunil Arora (58) was also perplexed after receiving this warning message on his mobile phone. As soon as a panic-stricken Arora clicked on the link, Rs 20,000 was swiftly deducted from his account. It was at this moment that Arora realised that he has been duped by cyber cheats and there was nothing wrong with his bank account.

Though Arora, who works with a private company and is only two years away from his retirement, registered a police complaint, he never got back his hard-earned money.
