Three months ago, Cadillac revealed a 'show car' version of the Celestiq, the brand's ultra-luxury battery-powered sedan. Today, I got to spend time with the production model, and yowza, this is a damn fine-looking automobile with a sky-high price tag to boot.Sure, paying north of $300,000 for a car is out of reach for most of us, but Cadillac is going after the 1 percent of the 1 percent here with the 2024 Celestiq, offering customization that is beyond the scope of uber-luxury brands like Bentley and even Rolls-Royce.
