New Zealand's last remaining Covid-era travel requirement has been scrapped. From Thursday, arrivals will no longer have to fill out the New Zealand Traveller Declaration. The online form was introduced in March, as a way of collecting details of a passenger's travel history, as well as Covid-19-related health information, including proof of vaccination and pre-departure test results. Once complete, passengers would receive a Traveller Pass containing a unique QR code which they would need to present to board their flight.
