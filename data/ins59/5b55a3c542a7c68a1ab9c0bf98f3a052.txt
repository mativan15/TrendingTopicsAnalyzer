Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday tweeted that he thinks a recession will last until the spring of 2024, after earlier saying "a recession of sorts" in China and Europe was weighing on demand for its electric cars. Musk earlier told analysts on a conference call that the weakness in China and Europe was causing demand to be 'a little harder than it otherwise would be.' "Just guessing, but probably until spring of '24," Musk said on Twitter after a user asked him how long the recession would last.
