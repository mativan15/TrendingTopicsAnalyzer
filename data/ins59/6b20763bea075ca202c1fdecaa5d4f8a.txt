Major retailers are already bracing for a tsunami of returns during and after the upcoming holiday shopping season.  Stores typically offer free returns for holiday goods albeit with some exceptions. However, some companies are rethinking this strategy amid rising transportation and other inflationary costs.According to a survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF), retailers incur $166 million merchandise returns for every $1 billion in sales. On top of that, retailers lose $10.30 to return fraud for every $100 in returned merchandise accepted, according to the world's largest retail trade association.
