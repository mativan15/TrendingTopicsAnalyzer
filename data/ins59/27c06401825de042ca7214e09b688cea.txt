Published: 00:41 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 00:41 EDT, 20 October 2022 New Zealand's longest serving MP has signed off after 35 years, giving verdicts on prime ministers Helen Clark and Jacinda Ardern, and revealing his role in getting the world's greatest netballer playing for New Zealand. With his grandchildren and Labour colleagues in the house, colourful and contentious MP Trevor Mallard gave his valedictory address in parliament on Thursday. With a cheeky rebuke to a former Australian prime minister, the sports fan disclosed how he lured Irene van Dyk, a recent immigrant, to play for New Zealand and become the most capped netballer of all time.
