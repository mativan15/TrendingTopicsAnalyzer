Rank the Kardashian-Jenner clan from youngest (1) to oldest (7). Test your trivia knowledge by putting items into the correct order. Use the arrows on the right to move items up or down, until you have them in the right places, according to the question of the day. Then hit 'choose' to find out if you're correct. You get three chances, so three strikes, and you're out. We've given you a little helping hand though: The answers you have right and wrong will flash green or red quickly in between chances.
