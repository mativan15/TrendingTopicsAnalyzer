The 2022 ALDS was a series to forget for José Altuve.

The Houston Asros second baseman struggled mightily at the plate against the Seattle Mariners, entering Saturday's matchup batting 0 for 8 through two playoff games. Game 3 didn't provide much of a fresh start. Altuve went 0 for 8 in Houston's 1-0 series-clinching win, striking out three consecutive times starting in the seventh inning.

As Altuve struggled atop the order, Houston's offense followed suit.

Altuve sports a relatively solid plate approach, sitting just a tick above league average in chase percentage at 28.
