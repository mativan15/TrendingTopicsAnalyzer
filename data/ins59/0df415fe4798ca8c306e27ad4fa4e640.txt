Pittsburgh is a city of bridges.Many of them beautiful steel structures made from the alloy for which the city is famous.The large bridges span the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which converge in the city to form the Ohio river which flows all the way to the Mississippi.Overall, locals claim that between the big and the small there are more than 400 bridges in the Pittsburgh area. However, all that bridgework is expensive to maintain. And across the United States in the past, sufficient money was not always available to keep the roads, tunnels, and bridges in the optimum condition.
