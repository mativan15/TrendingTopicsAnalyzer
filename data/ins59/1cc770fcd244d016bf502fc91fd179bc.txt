Sutton's prediction: 5-1Manchester City are too good not to bounce back from last weekend's defeat by Liverpool. They have got a bit of a point to prove after that performance.Brighton are still without a win in four games under Roberto de Zerbi, which is starting to become a concern.The Seagulls took the game to Liverpool when they went to Anfield and drew 3-3. They will probably try to do that against City too, but things could get a bit messy for them.Whelan's prediction: 4-0This is pretty easy to call.
