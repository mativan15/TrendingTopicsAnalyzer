Earlier this week, I was among the first, lucky few to watch the spotlit figures of Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad rise from the stage floor of the custom-built Abba Arena to rapturous applause. 
What was easy to forget in the moment of the spectacle was that the Abba members I was staring at weren't real. Of course, this is physically evident, given the famous four here resemble their much younger selves while dressed in '70s sequinned ensembles. 
Yet despite knowing the Swedish pop legends have been immortalised in avatar form, the realism is hard to ignore.
