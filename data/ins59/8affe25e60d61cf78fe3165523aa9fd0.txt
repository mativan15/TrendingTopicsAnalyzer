The forward was subbed off injured in the 52nd minute of Tottenham's 2-0 home win over Everton on Saturday.
A penalty from Harry Kane on his 400th Spurs appearance and a Pierre Emile Hojbjerg strike were enough to move the Lilywhites to within a point of league leaders Arsenal, with the Gunners set to play Leeds on Sunday.
Up next for Tottenham is a big clash at Old Trafford, but Richarlison will not be making the journey to Manchester, with the Brazilian pictured on crutches in the mixed zone post-Everton.
