News television continued to remain the most popular medium for news. A large number of Indians trust newspapers when it comes to news although the number of social media users are high and increasing in the country. People's trust on social media for news was "moderate or low," a survey-based study by Lokniti-CSDS in partnership with Konrad Adenauer Stiftung on media consumption behaviour in India has revealed. The survey said that although Twitter and WhatsApp have emerged as most highly trusted among social media platforms, only a sixth of users "highly trust" them for news.
