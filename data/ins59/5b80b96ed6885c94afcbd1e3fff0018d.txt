Months after launching late last year, Aptos Labs became a unicorn by promising to offer a blockchain that was faster and more stable than rival efforts.

But after its technology got put to the test by the public for the first time this week, observers weren't super-impressed. The price of its newly trading token fell by more than 40%. And investors and enthusiasts complained that Aptos' blockchain was processing transactions more slowly than expected.
