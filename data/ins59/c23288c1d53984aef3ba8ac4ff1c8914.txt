The big shareholder groups in TerraVest Industries Inc. (TSE:TVK) have power over the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

With a market capitalization of CA$410m, TerraVest Industries is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors.
