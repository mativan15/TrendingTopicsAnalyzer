Sometimes on a road I use regularly there's a forlorn-looking man sitting in a lay-by surrounded by various toadstools and zoo animals he has carved from bits of worryingly orange wood. And I've never once, ever, seen anyone stop to buy one, because why would you? Who thinks, as they trundle to work, 'What I really need today is a wooden heron'?I haven't seen the vendor for some time, and it saddens me because I can only assume he has given up, and with his business venture in tatters he's now at home deciding which of his toadstools he should burn to stay warm.
