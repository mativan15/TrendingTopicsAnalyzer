Seattle will create a database of homeless camps and provide more than $100 million to a regional group trying to tackle the region's ongoing crisis of people without homes, the city's mayor announced Tuesday."Issues created over decades cannot be solved overnight, but we must reject the status quo where people are left to suffer unsheltered on sidewalks and in parks," Mayor Bruce Harrell said in announcing his plan to address the city's homelessness crisis.Seattle, like many West Coast cities, has faced a vexing problem of unhoused people for decades.
