Alicia Kearns, who recently became the chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, also said the Government's problems are linked to policy and not just communication, warning 'dogmatism scares people'. The critical remarks come as another senior Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, said he wants an 'apology and a fundamental reset'.
