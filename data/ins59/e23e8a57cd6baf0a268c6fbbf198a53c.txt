There's no denying it: WWE is in a holding pattern until Money in the Bank next month. Roman Reigns unified the WWE and Universal Championship titles at WrestleMania, but Hell in a Cell marks the second pay-per-view in a row where he hasn't defended it.

The aforementioned main event should be an excellent match.
