The ex-wife of Chad Reu-Waters testified about the rocky marriage they had years before his arrest for murder in connection with a Mississauga man who was found in a freezer. Catherine Reu told the court how their fights escalated after the victim in this case — Ashley Max Domenic Pereira, 33 — went missing in 2002. She said that verbal arguments turned to threats and testified, 'He said he would kill me and he said he had done it before...and that's when he said it was Ashley.' Reu told the court she believed the victim and the accused were involved in a business deal together worth $100,000, but somehow she was told, 'He ended up taking Ashley to a storage unit in Guelph, strangled him, and put him in a freezer.
