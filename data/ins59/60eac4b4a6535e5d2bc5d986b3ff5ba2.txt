It's nice to see the Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) share price up 12% in a week. But will that repair the damage for the weary investors who have owned this stock as it declined over half a decade? Probably not. Five years have seen the share price descend precipitously, down a full 73%. While the recent increase might be a green shoot, we're certainly hesitant to rejoice. The fundamental business performance will ultimately determine if the turnaround can be sustained.

The recent uptick of 12% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a lot at historical fundamentals.
