The measure, which was approved by by a vote of 36 to 27 in the state Senate early Friday morning, now moves on to Governor Kathy Hochul for consideration. The state Assembly approved the bill last month. Hochul has 10 days to sign or veto the legislation.

If the bill becomes law, it would be among the most significant restrictions in the US against the energy-intensive process.
