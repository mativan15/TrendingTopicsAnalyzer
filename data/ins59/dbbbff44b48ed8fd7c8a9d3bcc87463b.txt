The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) for allegedly overstating how much available funds and balances customers had on their credit card accounts, and charging fees and interest to customers who relied on this information when making withdrawals.ASIC alleges that between May 2016 and November 2018, more than 165,700 ANZ customers were charged cash advance fees and interest for withdrawing or transferring money from their credit card accounts based on incorrect account balance being displayed on the ANZ website, ANZ app, and at automatic teller machines.
