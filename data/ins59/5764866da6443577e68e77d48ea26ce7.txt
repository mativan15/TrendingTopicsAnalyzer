Elon Musk expressed excitement Wednesday over his pending acquisition of Twitter despite his past efforts to walk away from the $44 billion deal.  The billionaire, who runs Tesla, spoke about the transaction during electric vehicle maker's conference call with analysts and investors. "I think it's massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential," Musk said. "Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.
