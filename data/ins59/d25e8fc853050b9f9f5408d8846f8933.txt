The joke in Britain is that the country is becoming like Italy – but without the weather.  In other words – ungovernable.
Just as Italian politics seem to throw up a new government most weeks, so the UK seems to be churning through Prime Ministers.  Liz Truss announced her resignation on Thursday after a mere six weeks.  The shortest-lived Prime Minister in history, she´d barely unpacked her bags in Downing Street before having to pack them back up again.
Her successor – due to be announced next week – will be the country´s third Prime Minister this year.
