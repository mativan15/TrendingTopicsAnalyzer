Jackie, Tony & RyanOct 17, 2022The average American is willing to pay more than twice as much than the sticker price says for products that last a lifetime. A new poll of 2,000 U.S. adults found, on average, people would pay 108 percent more than the listed cost of any item they're shopping for, as long as it lasts at least 20 years. Three in five respondents claim they're more inclined to spend money on quality items than something that's cheaper both in price and quality. Items that last the longest were reportedly the most 'valuable' to 69 percent of respondents.
