Of all the excellent games that dropped during the Nintendo Switch's launch year, none were more surprising than Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Ubisoft's Minion-esque bunny monsters, who once terrorized Rayman, teamed up with the famous plumber for a wacky and approachable take on XCOM-style, turn-based strategy. The sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope ($59.99), doesn't have that same surprise factor. And if you're a Nintendo fan who only tolerated the Rabbids in the previous game, you may not enjoy their increased prominence.
