APAim to announce plan at G7 Summit on June 26-28 taking into account India's position on ensuring climate justice while addressing climate change issues.The United States and Germany, on behalf of the G7, have proposed setting up an India-G7 partnership to help fund and support India's transition from a 'fossil-based economy to a carbon-neutral economy'. Both countries are keen to announce the partnership at the G7 Summit, where India has been invited, later this month. The idea, sources said, is to devise an India-specific ‘Just Energy Transition Plan (JETP)' taking into account India's position on ensuring climate justice while addressing climate change challenges as well as its commitments on increasing the share of renewable sources in its energy mix.
