Hello there, Reno. I'm here in your inbox per usual to get you caught up on everything you need to know about what's going on in town. Because community news matters! Let's do this. First, today's weather: Some sun; windy in the p.m.. High: 77 Low: 56. 📢 I'm looking for business owners and marketers in Reno who want to build awareness, connect with customers and increase sales. I have a limited number of sponsorships available to introduce our Reno Daily readers to local businesses they need to know about.
