Steven Gerrard always knew he would have to face up to the brutal part of being a manager when he took on the Aston Villa job, according to former team-mate Jamie Carragher.Villa sacked Gerrard in the wake of a 3-0 Premier League defeat at Fulham on Thursday night, and confirmed on Friday morning his backroom staff had also left the club.Having guided Villa to 14th last season, former Rangers boss Gerrard paid the price for a run of just two Premier League wins from 11 games this term.It remains to be seen who will next be in the Villa hotseat, with former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel both likely to be among the contenders.
