Aided by strong global cues, domestic stock markets on Monday rallied by 1.90 per cent amid expectations of softening inflation worries and low valuations. The benchmark Sensex shot up by 1,041 points to 55,925.74 and the NSE Nifty index rose by 309 points to 16,661.40 as IT stocks made a sharp comeback.
Foreign investors, who were big sellers in the last seven months, pumped Rs 502 crore and domestic institutions invested Rs 1,524 crore on Monday.
Nifty rose for the third consecutive session following positive global cues due to China easing Covid curbs and sharp Friday gains on the Wall Street.
