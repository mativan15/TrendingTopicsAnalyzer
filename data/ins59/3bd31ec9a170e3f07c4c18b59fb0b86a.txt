The country that stretches across the world's largest archipelago is building the new city from scratch on a piece of land in Borneo, some 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) northeast of the current capital Jakarta. Riady, a grandson of the group's founder Mochtar Riady, said he's exploring opportunities to build hospitals or education centers in Nusantara, as the new capital will be called.
