A downtown restaurant worker was hit in the head with a gun and robbed, according to Olympia police.

And the suspect is still at large, Lt. Paul Lower said.

About 9:30 p.m. Oct. 11, the suspect entered a restaurant in the 400 block of Legion Way Southeast just before it closed for the night, Lower said.

The man pulled out a gun and charged up to an employee at a cash register, demanding money. When the employee hesitated, he hit the worker in the head, pointed the gun at the person and received some money.
