TVLine.com Prime Video's new series The Peripheral is some seriously dark and mind-bending science fiction — and it's bending my mind a little trying to figure out what to say about it. On one hand, it's a visually stunning, smartly realized story that kicks off with an exceptional pilot (premiering this Friday). On the other hand, the next two episodes I watched were a letdown, getting more meandering and confusing as they went. So do I recommend it, in the hopes that it finds a groove later on, or do I warn you away, despite all the fun sci-fi flourishes?
