Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images News Mizuho Americas weighed in on Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) after hosting a conference call with CFO Claire McDonough as part of the firm's annual Auto Tech seminar. Following the call, Analyst Vijah Rakesh and team said they believe R1T/EDV production lines ex-commodity chips are healthy and that a second shift in the second half of 2022 will be phased in. On the cost side, vertical integration with LFP and Enduro is expected to drive cost reduction for Rivian and help it reach EBIT break-even in 2024.
