Pakistan has formally responded to the FATF's decision to remove it from its grey list, saying the country's engagement with the global watchdog has led to strategic improvements in its laws and procedures and made its domestic anti-terror financing and money laundering regime more resilient.
The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering, on Friday removed Pakistan from a list of countries under 'increased monitoring', also known as the 'grey list'.
