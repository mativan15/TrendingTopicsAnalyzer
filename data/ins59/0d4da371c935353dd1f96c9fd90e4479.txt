Published: 21:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 21:51 EDT, 20 October 2022 Ravi Shastri claims a bilateral series between India and Pakistan on neutral turf like in Australia would be a commercial success, but concedes it's unlikely such a proposal will be approved. Sunday night's blockbuster between Pakistan and India at the MCG will headline the group stage of the Twenty20 World Cup, with 92,000 expected to attend. Tickets for the match sold out within 30 minutes when they went on sale, with Shastri labelling it the "Big Daddy" of all games and claiming 150,000 fans would attend if capacity allowed.
