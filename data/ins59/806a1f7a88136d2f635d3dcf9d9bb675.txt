MERRILLVILLE—The Lake County Prosecutor's Office has charged Gerald Lynn Smith, 60, of Madisonville, Kentucky, with murder, murder while committing or attempting to commit rape, and rape in connection with the brutal slaying of 69-year-old Gloria Hansell who was found strangled inside her Gary, Indiana home on June 17, 1994. Hansell, a widow, lived alone at 3966 Buchanan Street and relied on an in-home oxygen machine due to poor health.
In 2020, the Indiana State Police Lowell Regional Laboratory was requested by The FBI's Gang Response Investigative Team (GRIT) to re-examine evidence collected in this case and Smith was developed as a suspect from the analysis of male DNA found in the victim's sexual assault kit collected at her autopsy.
