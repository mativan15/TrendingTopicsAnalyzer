The markets are looking bearish as inflation and interest rates rise, leading investors to scrutinize potential investments with a more discerning eye. After a record-breaking year for fintech fundraising in 2021, the market has begun to come back to Earth. Fintech valuations in the public markets began to cool off in the first quarter and have continued to drop. F-Prime's index of 50 publicly-traded fintech companies was down 71.5% as of mid-May.  The bear market has gradually crept into the private markets, with companies like Fast, Bolt, and Klarna either announcing significant layoffs or shutting down entirely.
