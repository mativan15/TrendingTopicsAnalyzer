GameStop (GME -3.64%) and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY -4.27%) were two of the market's hottest meme stocks last year. Both companies experienced massive short squeezes last January, but their stocks have declined sharply since hitting those frothy levels. GameStop's stock hit a split-adjusted all-time high of $86.88, but it now trades at about $25. Bed Bath & Beyond's stock rallied to a multi-year high of $52.89, but it's now only worth about $5 a share.
Both stocks lost their luster as rising interest rates drove investors away from speculative meme stocks and other risky investments.
