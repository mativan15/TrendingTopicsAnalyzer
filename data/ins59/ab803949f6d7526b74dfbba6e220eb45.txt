LONDON, May 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IFRS 17, the new accounting standard for insurance contracts, will affect many insurers across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) when it comes into force for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. Analysis from AM Best suggests preparation for the new regime varies significantly by country and insurer.

A new Best's Commentary, "Market Preparedness for IFRS 17 in the MENA Region Varies," notes that in general, companies operating in the region's more-mature regulatory environments show greater readiness for IFRS 17.
