A national conference on 'Deiveegamum  Desiamum – Unarvom Unarthiduvom' (spiritualism and nationalism) that was to be organised by the Krishnagiri government College for Women as part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav was cancelled following criticism from a section that it was an attempt at 'saffronisation' in educational institutions.The conference was to be on king Raja Raja Cholan, freedom fighter V.O.Chidambaram Pillai, and Neelakanda Brahmachary. Anantharamakrishnan Senthivel , a law faculty, had taken to Twitter questioning if this was an attempt at inveigling of saffron content in government institutions.
