Hong Kong has unveiled a HK$30bn ($3.8bn) co-investment fund to attract overseas businesses back to the city after an exodus of talent sparked by strict lockdowns and a tumultuous political climate.A raft of measures to address the brain drain were announced by Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, in his first policy address on Wednesday – but his plans have largely failed to reassure investors.Lee, who said the workforce had shrunk by about 14,000 people in the last two years, unveiled visa and tax concessions to lure skilled workers back to the financial hub and announced that he would cut property duties for non-permanent residents.
