Not long after the introduction of USB 4 version 2.0, Intel has announced that it's been working on 'the next generation of Thunderbolt ' connectivity standard which will be capable of speeds of up to 80Gbps. While a name has not yet been officially confirmed, the new standard may be called Thunderbolt 5.
The foundation of the next-gen Thunderbolt standard is USB4v2, which also supports 80Gbps connections.
With the new and improved Thunderbolt, higher speeds do max out at 80Gbps in regular scenarios but during transmitting HD video, can bump up to 120Gbps of available bandwidth.
