The recent market sell-off that's hard-hit the technology sector offers a "good entry point" for shares of Zoom Video , Daiwa Capital Markets said. Analyst Stephen Bersey double upgraded the popular stay-at-home beneficiary to outperform from underperform, saying in a Friday note to clients that the recent pullback in tech presents an excellent opportunity to buy Zoom Video. He also sees strengths in the company's core business model. "We recommend that our clients overweight shares of ZM as we think that near-term market growth expectations have tempered," Bersey wrote.
