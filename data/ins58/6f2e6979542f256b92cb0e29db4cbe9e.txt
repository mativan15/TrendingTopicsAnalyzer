The blue city of Austin wants to take on the red state of Texas by effectively decriminalizing abortion, a move that would protect its residents in a post-Roe v. Wade America who still want or need to receive the medical procedure. The landmark 1973 case that legalized abortions nationwide is widely expected to be struck down or severely scaled back by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court in the coming months, a move that would prompt a Texas trigger law to take effect and criminalize almost all abortions.
