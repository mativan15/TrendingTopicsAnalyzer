Another nickel and a half increase greeted motorists at gas stations in Nova Scotia Friday morning. 'I'm not going to make it take more than it does,' said Mike Green while pumping gas. His fill-up almost reached $200. It's a pain not just being felt at the pumps. 'The price of everything is going up, people don't have enough money to pay for everything,' Green says. In April, inflation hit 7.1 per cent in Nova Scotia, well above the Bank of Canada's preferred rate of one to three per cent. That's why the central bank is increasing interest rates, but the effect will not be seen right away.
