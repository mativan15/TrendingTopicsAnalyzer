The head of Obsidian Entertainment, the California-based studio that developed Fallout: New Vegas, has said the company would jump at the chance to make another Fallout game someday. Feargus Urquhart told DualShockers plainly, "Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it."Urquhart said it's now a matter of if the opportunity arises, and recent events may suggest Obsidian has a greater chance of making it happen, though nothing is confirmed right now. Obsidian was a private company until 2018 when Microsoft acquired the studio.
