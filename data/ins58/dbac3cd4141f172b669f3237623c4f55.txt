AgenciesAIIMS Delhi (File Photo)With a view to streamline treatment facilities for MPs, AIIMS Delhi has come up with a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) that include providing a nodal officer to coordinate and facilitate medical care arrangements. The move has, however, drawn sharp criticism from a section of doctors who have called out the "VIP culture" at the premier health institute. In a recent letter to YM Kandpal, joint secretary at the Lok Sabha Secretariat,AIIMS director M Srinivas has listed SOPs for the outpatient department (OPD), emergency consultation and in-patient hospitalisation of sitting MPs of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.
