Did you miss a session from GamesBeat Summit 2022? All sessions are available to stream now. Watch now. Bright Gambit is an indie support initiative founded by a collective of games industry veterans. Its goal is to create more opportunities for growth, where there's the most need. And today it is announcing five games. The fund aims to assist a broad diversity of studios across the globe. The ideal candidates are studios that may not be traditionally funded due to social or economic constraints, lack of opportunities in the region, or not having a business-side support structure.
