Patrick Duffy and Linda Purl found love during the pandemic thanks to technology, a story becoming almost as conventional as the ovens they now use to bake the 70-year-old sourdough starter Duffy has cultivated since he was a little kid.

The "Dallas" star, known for his role as Bobby Ewing, and actress Purl, who played Fonzie's girlfriend Ashley Pfister on "Happy Days," traveled in the same social circles for decades while they worked in the entertainment industry, but never sparked a match.

Duffy and Purl were part of a texting group created by Richard Thomas, also known as "John-Boy" from "The Waltons," but as soon as COVID-19 lockdowns forced people to connect in different ways, Duffy and Purl discovered they had something special.
