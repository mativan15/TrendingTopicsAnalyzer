The Goa government has urged Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to exempt the coastal state from the order, which makes it mandatory to get permission from the naval authorities to construct any structure within 500 metres of a naval base. State Minister Mauvin Godinho met Singh who was in Goa on Friday during his transit visit to the state and briefed him about the issues faced by people from Vasco town, which is located adjacent to the INS Hansa naval base. 
Several permits for constructions have been stalled, as the Naval authorities were delaying their permission without any reason, Godinho claimed.
