Full disclosure: I almost bought a Volkswagen Golf R Estate last year. For someone like me – a new dad with a dog and a young family to cart around, who fancied something with a bit of grunt – it would have been the ideal choice. The R with a bigger boot always was all things to all people, with space for five, a huge boot, four-wheel drive and blistering performance from its 2.0-litre turbo engine.
Now, there's a new one. Well, sort-of. The Mk8 is, beneath the skin, a heavy overhaul of the old Mk7, so perhaps it's not entirely accurate to use that term.
