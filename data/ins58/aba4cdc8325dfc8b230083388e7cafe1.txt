Seattle's first taste of postseason baseball in 21 years was electric, exhilarating, excruciating, surreal, crushing and long.

A city that had waited two decades for this game got the equivalent of two games.

It had drama, nerves, heartbreak and smoke. It had a sellout crowd that stood for hours, never flagging, willing, willing, willing the hometown nine toward victory. A team that's lifted an entire region with its verve and spirit fought to the bitter end but couldn't quite get there.

It had 18 pitchers and a postseason record 42 strikeouts.
