Prince Edward Island has become the first province in Atlantic Canada to cover most of the cost of glucose sensor technology, often referred to as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or flash glucose monitoring systems. It's good news for people living with diabetes on the island, who say real-time blood sugar information is all but required to manage the most severe cases. The P.E.I. government says there are more than 15,000 Islanders living with diabetes, with about 10 per cent requiring intensive management.
