CONCLUDING INSTALLMENTCHAPTERS 27-37Previous Chapters of ‘A Prairie Grove'IN the early chapters of this book Donald Culross Peattie has traced the story of a prairie grove in Illinois from the time of the glaciers. Remembering for the trees and the great grass province and all the wild creatures that lived in and upon them, he has re-created the drama of the beasts — the wolf, cougar, lynx, and buffalo — that hunted and were hunted by others of their kind and by the Indians. The Indians in turn were startled, hunted, and robbed by the traders and the coureurs de bois, innocently or not so innocently aided by priests and explorers.
