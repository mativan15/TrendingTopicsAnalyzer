Through two games of the 2022-23 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have a glaring lack of 3-point shooting. They have been competitive, particularly on Thursday night versus the Los Angeles Clippers, but their inability to hit from the outside has led to an 0-2 start.
But another problem L.A. has is a lack of useful depth at the wings, particularly at the big forward position.
Reportedly, the team is interested in possibly signing Maurice Harkless, a free agent forward.
Via Marc Stein:
'There were also some fresh rumbles this week that the Lakers have given some internal consideration to the merits of free agent swingman Moe Harkless, who is only a career 32.
