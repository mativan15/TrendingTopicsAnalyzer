Chennai: Global business groupings concerned over what they term as the ' onerous ' nature of the recent directives by India's cybersecurity watchdog have told the central government that the provisions could have a "detrimental impact on cybersecurity" for organizations that operate in India. In a letter to Sanjay Bahl, Director General of the CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) on Thursday, co-signed by bodies such as US Chamber of Commerce, US-India Business Council, US-India Strategic Partnership Forum and techUK and others, they said CERT-In's requirements may also make it more difficult for companies to do business in India.
