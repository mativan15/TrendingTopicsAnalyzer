Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited troops on the frontline in the northeastern region of Kharkiv in his first official appearance outside of Kyiv since the start of Russia's invasion.In a video address later on Sunday, he praised regional officials in Kharkiv but said he had sacked the regional head of the country's top security agency, the SBU, due to his poor performance.
"He did not work to defend the city from the first days of the full-scale war but thought only of himself personally," he said.
