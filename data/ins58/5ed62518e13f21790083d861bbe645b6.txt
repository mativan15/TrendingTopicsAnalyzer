KathrynHatashitaLee/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Fairfax Financial Holdings (OTCPK:FRFHF) is a global insurance and reinsurance conglomerate based in Toronto, Canada which currently writes net premiums of more than $21 billion annually. Among Fairfax's insurance subsidiaries are Allied World, Odyssey Group, Crum & Forster, and Northbridge Financial. Investors today are valuing Fairfax at 71% of book value adjusted for three transactions which should close by the end of the year. That is absurdly cheap for a property casualty insurer that is consistently underwriting profitably and does not currently hold a long-duration bond portfolio.
