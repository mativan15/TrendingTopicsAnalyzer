AgenciesRepresentative imageA central bank deputy governor today rooted for internationalisation of rupee and even take up unavoidable risks if India is to progress to be an economic superpower. While listing the advantages of internationalisation of the rupee, Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said it reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves; something that has in recent months been a worry for stakeholders as the RBI has burned $114 billion of its reserves since September last year in a desperate attempt to halt rupee's record plunge.
