Published: 17:30 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 18:10 EDT, 21 October 2022 England's fringe players such as James Maddison have been left in the dark over whether their World Cup dream remains alive with Gareth Southgate opting not to inform those he named in his provisional squad on Friday night.The FA handed FIFA a 55-man long list of players who could feature in Qatar, but it will not be published and the individuals concerned have not been told, and neither have their clubs. Players on the edge of the squad were hoping to receive a boost that they remain in Southgate's thoughts, but the manager has decided to keep his cards close to his chest to avoid distractions with a month to go until the tournament.
