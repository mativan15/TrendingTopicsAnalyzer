A day after 10 men were arrested in connection with a kidney transplantation racket in South Delhi, the police said the investigation has revealed that the alleged mastermind of the gang, Kuldeep Ray (47), was involved with a Rajasthan-based kidney racket in the past.
'He has worked as an OT technician for over 20 years… Around three-four years ago, he came in contact with a Rajasthan-based gang that sold kidneys illegally and he operated on many patients. Soon, he realised he can make more money by starting his own gang,' said an officer.
