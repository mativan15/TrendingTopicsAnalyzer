(Bloomberg) -- Knit fabric manufacturer Teejay Lanka Plc, whose customers include Nike and Uniqlo, is seeing demand pick up as production shifts from China because of Covid lock downs in that country.The company, which produces about 45 tonnes (1.6 million ounces) of fabric a day in Sri Lanka and an equal amount at its Visakhapatnam, India, facility, plans to scale up operations in the neighboring country by next month, Director Hasitha Premaratne said in a phone interview. 'We are seeing strong demand until July,' due to relocation of fabric manufacturing away from China, Premaratne said.
