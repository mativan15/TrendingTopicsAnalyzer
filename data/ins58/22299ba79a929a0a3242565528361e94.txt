Buoyed by a strong recovery in travel demand in the Indian market, Singapore Airlines plans to increase the number of flights to India where the group is currently operating at around 75 per cent of its pre-pandemic capacity. Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group -- comprising full service carrier Singapore Airlines and low-cost airline Scoot -- currently serves 13 destinations across India. On Monday, a senior Singapore Airlines executive said the carrier expects to announce more flights to India in the coming months.
