The Oklahoma City Thunder will be without two of their three lottery-pick rookies for at least the next week's worth of games.
The Thunder announced on Friday that forward Jalen Williams underwent successful surgery to address a right orbital bone fracture and will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days.
Williams suffered the injury during the Thunder's season-opening loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves when Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels attempted to dunk the ball and elbowed the 21-year-old in the eye, cutting his NBA debut short to just six minutes.
