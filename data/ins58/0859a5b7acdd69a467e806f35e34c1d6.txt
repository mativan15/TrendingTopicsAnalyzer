(Bloomberg) -- Quebec's center-right leader kept key cabinet ministers in place, despite being spoiled for choice after a landslide election victory in Canada's second-biggest province.Premier Francois Legault, whose Coalition Avenir Quebec won 90 of 125 seats in the legislature on Oct. 3, reappointed his top two economic lieutenants on Thursday. Eric Girard, former treasurer of National Bank of Canada, continues as finance minister, while businessman Pierre Fitzgibbon becomes a so-called economy 'super minister,' with the energy portfolio added to his responsibilities.
