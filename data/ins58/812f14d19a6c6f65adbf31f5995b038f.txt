MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday backed a decision by his predecessor to cancel a deal to buy 16 Russian military heavy-lift helicopters and said his administration has 'secured an alternative supply from the United States.' Marcos Jr. said at a news conference that the Philippine government will negotiate to get back part of the down payment it made to the Russian aircraft manufacturer. It was the first time Marcos Jr., who took office in June, has commented publicly on the touchy issue involving Russia.
