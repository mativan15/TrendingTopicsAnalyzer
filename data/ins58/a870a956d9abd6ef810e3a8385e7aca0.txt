No account of Newman fascinates more than his own. He blazes off the page as a painfully honest mass of contradictions, who evidently looked to these interviews as a form of confessional, despite no abiding religious belief. On page one, he calls the book 'the story of a little boy who became a decoration for his mother', while lamenting the core of himself lost inside.
These two halves of him – 'the orphan and the ornament', his words – were wildly tough to reconcile. They essentially explain the entire challenge of his stardom: to put himself out there as the blue-eyed boy on all the posters – the most bankable, beautiful male Hollywood icon of his day – while suffering inner crises of confidence at every turn.
