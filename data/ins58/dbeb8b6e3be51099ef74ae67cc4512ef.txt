Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ:RELL) shareholders would be excited to see that the share price has had a great month, posting a 32% gain and recovering from prior weakness. The last 30 days bring the annual gain to a very sharp 57%.

In spite of the firm bounce in price, there still wouldn't be many who think Richardson Electronics' price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 12.5x is worth a mention when the median P/E in the United States is similar at about 14x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.
