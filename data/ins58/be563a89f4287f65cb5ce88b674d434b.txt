Alabama football is known for winning championships and producing NFL-caliber players that find their way to teams via the annual draft. This past 2022 draft proved to follow the trend of previous drafts by having multiple former members of the Crimson Tide being taken off the board in the first round and even more being selected in later rounds.
In the upcoming 2023 season, Alabama will return many key players that could prove to be early-round selections in next year's draft.
ESPN NFL draft expert Mel Kiper seemingly agrees, as his first 2023 Big Board was released.
