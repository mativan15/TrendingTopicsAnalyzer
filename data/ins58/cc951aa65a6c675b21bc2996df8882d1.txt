The personal saving rate has been shrinking relatively steadily for more than a year now, suggesting higher and higher prices have eroded people's financial cushions. In April, it fell to its lowest since September 2008, when the economy was slammed by a housing market crash and financial crisis, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Friday. Just two years ago, when the pandemic shut down most opportunities to spend money outside the home, it was a record high 33.8%.
 
The dwindling saving rate underlines just how much inflation running near a 40-year high has forced people into tough choices when it comes to expenses.
