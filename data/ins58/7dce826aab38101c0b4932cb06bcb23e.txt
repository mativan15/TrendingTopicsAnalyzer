R.M. Nunes FB Financial (NYSE:FBK) stock slid 5.1% in early Wednesday morning trading after Truist analyst Jennifer Demba downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy as credit conservatism as well as a tougher funding backdrop are set to weigh on its loan growth. Demba also pointed out that the bank's net interest margin is nearing its peak, and "mortgage results will likely contribute little to earnings medium term," as the housing market cools down amid historically high mortgage rates, she wrote in a note to clients.
