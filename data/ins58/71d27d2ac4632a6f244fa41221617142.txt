India's imports have only been rising despite its collective push for Atmanirbhar Bharat, Make in India and Production Linked Incentives (PLI) schemes as imported components still constitute a significant portion of most finished products, equipment, or machines manufactured at home. Be it a large manufacturing or engineering corporation or a micro-enterprise that employs just 5 or 10 people, all are dependent on imports of components that are not available in the country.For instance, over 6 lakh micro, small and medium enterprises in Karnataka have to import various auto components, electrical or electronic items, chemicals, machine tools, machinery, industrial dyes, wools, yarn, cables, wires, metals, sheets, paints, etc.
