A WOMAN posing as an official of the
Zamboanga City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (ZCDRRMO) was
arrested after a dozen people complained to the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) that they were allegedly recruited and promised jobs in
exchange for money, GMA News reported. The report, quoting NBI Director Eric
Distor, said agents from the NBI Western Mindanao Regional Office (NBI-WEMRO) arrested
Jennifer Quebite Molina in an entrapment on May 23. Distor said the arrest stemmed from the
complaints of 13 individuals who claimed they were victimized by Molina.
