Published: 13:16 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 13:24 EDT, 31 May 2022 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing backlash over his calls to implement a 'national freeze' on handgun ownership in his country in the wake of the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas.Critics claim his new proposed ban will do nothing to protect citizens as many guns 'are already illegal' and the 'freeze' doesn't tackle the 'root cause' of the crime problem, which is gun smuggling. Trudeau, 50, announced on Monday that his government will introduce the legislation to prevent people from buying and selling handguns anywhere in the country.
