A photo of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini hanging on a wall in the Italian ministry for economic development will be removed to 'avoid controversy', the outgoing minister has said.The newly elected senate speaker, Ignazio La Russa, a Brothers of Italy co-founder who collects fascist memorabilia, criticised the move as an example of 'cancel culture'.The 'disturbing fact' of the photo's presence was revealed by the trade union, Cgil, following confirmation from public administration workers.
