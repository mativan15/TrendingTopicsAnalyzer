Two years ago, Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin quietly co-founded a consulting firm with a top city aide, who's also a lifelong friend, and two men from Virginia.The arrangement has raised several potential conflict of interest issues for Irvin: There's a mayor going into business with a city employee who is so close to Irvin that the mayor calls him a stepbrother. There's the employee skirting through a process requiring city approval for side jobs. And there's the two Virginia men, who went on to get a $15,000 city contract without their ties to Irvin being disclosed.
