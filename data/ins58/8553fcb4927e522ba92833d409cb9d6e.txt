Apple has reportedly cut production of its iPhone 14 Plus to re-evaluate demand less than two weeks after its debut in stores.

At least one manufacturer in China has been told to immediately halt production of iPhone 14 Plus components and two Apple suppliers in China that use the parts to assemble them into larger modules are also cutting their production by 70 per cent and 90 per cent respectively, according to US tech publication The Information.

Apple shares dipped on Tuesday local time, losing about $4 per share when the news broke.
