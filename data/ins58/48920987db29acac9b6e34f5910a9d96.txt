The man who founded the Student Volunteer Army in the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes has hung up his shovel after 12 years at the organisation's helm. In September 2010, Sam Johnson set up a Facebook event to encourage his university mates to help clean up silt created by liquefaction during the quake. What was initially a group of several hundred people swelled, with volunteers shifting an estimated 40,000 tonnes of silt. The movement grew further after the February 2011 earthquake, with 25,000 people joining – and an incredible 400,000 tonnes of silt shovelled from driveways.
