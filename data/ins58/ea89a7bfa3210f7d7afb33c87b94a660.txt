Harried buyers of Mahira Infratech's affordable housing project in Sector 104 again asked the department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Wednesday to stop the developer from demanding money until the issue of the developer being blacklisted was resolved. They also demanded that payment should be linked to construction and either it should be temporarily halted or the department must withdraw its decision to blacklist Mahira Infratech. The DTCP, on its part, has asked the developer to extend the deadline for payment by 15 days.
