★★★★★When her music first seeped into the consciousness of listeners on this side of the Channel a couple of decades ago, the French-Algerian singer Souad Massi was a singer-songwriter who specialised in quiet, melancholic miniatures steeped in the chanson tradition. She's broadened her palette since then, particularly in some ebullient live shows that, at times, have even had a touch of the unbuttoned rock chick about them.If you haven't heard her before, Sequana is an ideal place to start. It's also just about the best disc she has recorded.
