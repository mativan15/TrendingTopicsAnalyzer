Glenveagh Properties, one of the biggest homebuilders in the State, has opened up a new front to add to its land and development pipeline, with an offer to partner farmers and other owners of zoned sites near urban areas.The move comes as Glenveagh has noted a sharp decline in the amount of development land coming to the market in the past 18 months — and as local authorities prepare to release draft maps marking out which landowners will be subject to a 3 per cent annual tax on zoned land from 2024.
