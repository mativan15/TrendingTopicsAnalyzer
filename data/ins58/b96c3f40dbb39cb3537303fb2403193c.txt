The Covid-19 pandemic decimated activity in large North American central business districts, none more so than downtown San Francisco, which has struggled mightily to rebound.These statistics, from a recent report by the University of California at Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies that uses mobile-phone location data, are from last spring (a report with updated numbers should be out next month). Timelier Google location data for the whole city indicate that while retail and recreation mobility has continued to rise, activity at workplaces — which are concentrated downtown — has been about the same in September and October as in the spring.
