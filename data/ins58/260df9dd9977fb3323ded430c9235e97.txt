STATESBORO, Ga. — Texas Tech finished on the short end of a long, rainy night in Georgia at the Statesboro Regional on Friday.

The Red Raiders fell behind by two runs in the first inning, then endured a five hour and 57-minute rain delay and another eight innings of frustration punctuated by a wild pitch at the worst time possible.
