Elite women's baseball could be coming back to Thunder Bay, with the northwestern Ontario city bidding on the two major upcoming world cup events. The Thunder Bay International Baseball Association is putting in bids for the 2023 Women's Baseball World Cup qualifier, and the 2024 Women's Baseball World Cup. The bid follows the successful international friendship series between Team Canada and Team USA. The five-game series was the first international competition for both sides since 2019, after COVID-19 shutdowns.
