A day after Competition Commission of India (CCI) imposed a raft of strictures on Google's dominant mobile operating system Android, the technology giant said it would 'review the decision to evaluate the next steps.' Citing 'abuse of dominant position', the antitrust watchdog on Thursday laid down about a dozen measures requiring the American company to provide fair access to all stakeholders and slapped a penalty of ₹1,337.76 crore ($162 million). It also ruled that device makers do not have to pre-install other services offered by Google.
