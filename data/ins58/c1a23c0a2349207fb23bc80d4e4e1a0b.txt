Across Canada, consumers are noticing the bare shelves at their pharmacies this cold and flu season. Many have taken to Twitter to document how children's and adult cough syrup, throat lozenges and cold medications are hard to find. While supply chain issues have been blamed for months as the reason behind the shortages, the chief pharmacist officer at the Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA) says the current problem has as much to do with increased demand, with more people now catching cold viruses and with flu season ramping up.
