A disgruntled but tech-savvy bus conductor in India changed the password of the vehicle's LED display board after setting it to flash the cuss word 'mother*****r' in the Hindi language followed by the name of the operator who sacked him.The incident happened at the Satna bus stand in central Madhya Pradesh state on Sunday and was allegedly carried out by the bus conductor who wanted to take revenge on the employer for sacking him.A video of the text on the bus flashing the words 'madar**** Sukheja' – translated as 'mother*****r Sukheja' – has gone viral on social media.
