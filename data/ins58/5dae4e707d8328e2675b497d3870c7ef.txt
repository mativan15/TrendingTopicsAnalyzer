Las Vegas sportsbooks have No. 9-ranked UCLA (6-0, 3-0 in the Pac-12) as six-point road underdogs when they visit No. 10 Oregon (5-1, 3-0) on Saturday at 12:30 p.m. PDT (Fox).

These are the last two unbeaten teams in conference play, so the winner will have the inside track for a berth in the Pac-12 Championship Game in Las Vegas on Dec.
