 A suspended Niagara teacher is facing multiple charges in connection with a sexual assault investigation at a St. Catharines school that began in May.
Niagara police say the suspect was arrested in Calgary, Alta., on Tuesday after departing Ontario around the time a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued by a judge.
