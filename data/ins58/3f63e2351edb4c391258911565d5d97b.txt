Konami is bringing its long-dormant horror game series Silent Hill back from the grave in a very big way. The publisher posted a nearly-hour-long video highlighting multiple SIlent Hill projects, some of which leaked beforehand, including several new Silent Hill games, a high-profile remake, and even a new Silent Hill movie from the director and producer of the 2006 Silent Hill movie adaptation. 
While Konami created the franchise, along with others such as Castlevania and Metal Gear, the publisher is working with development partners to bring these new creations to life, though those with ties to the original games, including Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka, are still involved in production.
