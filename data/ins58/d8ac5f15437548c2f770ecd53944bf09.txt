By Kathryn Hardison Shares of Laser Photonics Corp. slid 18% to $4.05 Monday, reversing course after shares jumped last week after the company said it would expand its sales force and that Coca-Cola Co. installed the company's system in its manufacturing facilities. Laser Photonics, an industrial developer of CleanTech laser systems for laser cleaning and other applications, said Friday that it is implementing an aggressive hiring campaign to expand its sales resources because of a recent increase in leads and inquiries.
