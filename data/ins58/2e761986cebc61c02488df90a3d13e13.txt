The Hawaiian Airlines® World Elite Business Mastercard®* earns 3 HawaiianMiles per dollar on eligible Hawaiian Airlines purchases, 2 miles per dollar on gas, dining and office supply store purchases and 1 mile per dollar on all other purchases.
These category bonuses aren't the most lucrative unless you spend enough with Hawaiian Airlines to maximize the earning bonus. The card has a $99 annual fee, so you'd have to spend at least $3,300 on Hawaiian Airlines purchases annually to break even.
In addition to these bonuses, the Hawaiian Airlines Business Card offers up to 40,000 bonus miles if you complete certain spending thresholds:

Earn 20,000 bonus HawaiianMiles if you spend $50,000-$99,999 in annual purchases; or
Earn 40,000 bonus HawaiianMiles if you spend $100,000 or more in annual purchases

There's also a first-year welcome bonus of 80,000 bonus HawaiianMiles and a $99 statement credit after spending $2,000 on purchases in the first 90 days.
