After months of speculation about a possible retirement from television, Charles Barkley has reversed course and won't be leaving TNT or the 'Inside the NBA' crew for the foreseeable future. Barkley signed a 10-year extension with Warner Bros. Discovery Sports, which owns TNT, worth over $100 million, and could approach $200 million, Andrew Marchand of the New York Post reported on Monday. Barkley's agreement coincides with contract renewals for fellow 'Inside the NBA' crew members Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O'Neal, although contract figures for those individuals are not currently known.
