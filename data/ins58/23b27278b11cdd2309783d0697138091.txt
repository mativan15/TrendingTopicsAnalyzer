Matthew Perry is speaking out about his addiction journey. In his new memoir titled "Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing," the "Friends" actor revealed the challenges he faced when he hit rock bottom. "I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side of everything again," Perry shared, according to People.
