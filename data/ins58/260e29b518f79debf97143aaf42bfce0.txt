India's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic likely stumbled again in the first quarter of this (calendar) year (Q4FY22) primarily due to Omicron-related restrictions and higher inflation, a Reuters poll showed. Growth in Asia's third-largest economy was pencilled in at 4.0% for the January-March quarter from the same period a year ago in a May 23-26 Reuters poll of 46 economists, down from 5.4% in Q4 2021. If realised, that would be the slowest in a year, and a third consecutive quarter of weaker growth.
