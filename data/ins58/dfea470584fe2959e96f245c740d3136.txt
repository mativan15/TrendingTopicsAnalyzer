After years of touting cloud gaming, Microsoft presented a much less optimistic outlook on the nascent technology this week. The company called cloud gaming 'immature' and 'unproven' in a dense, tidbit-rich filing as part of its latest effort to push through a $68.7 billion deal to acquire video game maker Activision Blizzard, pending regulatory approval.'Today cloud gaming remains in its infancy and unproven as a consumer proposition,' Microsoft wrote in a Tuesday response to the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), adding that it didn't expect the situation to improve in the next few years.
