I'm so worried about energy bills that my husband and I have stopped cooking jacket potatoes because they take so much time in the oven.
I even worry about boiling vegetables and using the toaster.
Right now, I have to question every single thing I spend money on. This is because I rely on disability benefits to survive. But the amount I receive barely covers my essential costs, let alone allowing me to live a full, independent life.
I was diagnosed with MS, aged just 21 – only a month after getting married.
