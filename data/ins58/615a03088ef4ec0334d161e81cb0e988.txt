Faulty handling of poultry waste has for long been cited as the cause for problems ranging from pollution of waterbodies to increase in stray dog population in the State.But now, major strides are being made by the Local Self Government department and Suchitwa Mission in the past two years to tackle the issue, with 40 chicken waste rendering plants becoming functional across 10 districts under public-private-partnership model. Plants are to be set up in the remaining four districts too within a year.
