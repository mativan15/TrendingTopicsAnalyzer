Frantic trading during market turmoil sparked by the disastrous mini-Budget has boosted the London Stock Exchange Group.
The company on Friday said third quarter revenues had jumped to £1.9bn, up 16pc compared to a year ago.
It came after volatile markets in the wake of Liz Truss's ill-fated tax cutting plan benefitted the owner of the London Clearing House, as investors rushed to convert assets into cash.
Markets were spooked by a string of surprise tax cuts, which left the Government's spending plans partly unfunded.
