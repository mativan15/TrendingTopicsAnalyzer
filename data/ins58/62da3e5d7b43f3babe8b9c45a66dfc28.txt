There has been a lot of recent chatter about a contract extension between LT Orlando Brown Jr. and the Kansas City Chiefs.
Brown Jr. remains on the hunt for an agent and nothing between the two sides is imminent, but there remains a lot of optimism that a deal can get done before the July 15th deadline for the teams to extend franchise-tagged players. What might a deal between the Chiefs and Brown look like, though?
A contract extension could very well rival the top contracts handed out to left tackles in the national football league.
