Politics has become very divisive in recent years, if elected, what would you do to improve the tone? Divisive tribal thinking is only possible when two sides can see themselves in direct opposition. By bringing an independent third-party to the Senate that isn't loyal to a caucus, negotiation and discussion will be more moderate to return to deliberative politics instead of demonizing rhetoric.

What would your top priorities be if elected? Expand ballot access, inclusion, and options. Abolish slavery in MN that uses victimless crimes to provide cheap/free labor.
