The recent market sell-off has crushed a lot of growth stocks, including many fintechs. Since the start of 2022, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF has lost 56%. However, for investors with a long-term outlook, this sell-off is an excellent opportunity to buy into these fast-growing companies at cheaper price points. Marqeta (NASDAQ:MQ) is one intriguing fintech trading at a deep discount since going public in June 2021. 
Marqeta creates payment products for companies in a fraction of the time of its competitors and helps companies cut down on fraud in the process.
