TikTok on Friday denied that it used specific location data to track certain U.S. individuals, pushing back against a Forbes report that alleged the Chinese-owned video app was planning on carrying out such monitoring.

On Thursday, Forbes published an article alleging TikTok, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, planned to use its app "to monitor the personal location of some specific American citizens," citing materials viewed by the publication.

Other allegations include:

The monitoring is carried out by TikTok parent ByteDance's Internal Audit and Risk Control department whose leader reports directly to the CEO.
