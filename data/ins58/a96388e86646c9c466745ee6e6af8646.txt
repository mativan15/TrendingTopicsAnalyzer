Tesla hired a PR firm to monitor employee conversations on social media, CNBC reported.

The firm researched an employee Facebook group and union organizers during a unionization drive.

Tesla has previously violated federal labor law for suppressing organizing efforts.

Tesla kept a close watch on some employees' social media moves as they attempted to form a union at the automaker's Fremont, California, factory in 2017 and 2018, CNBC reported Thursday.

During the organizing push, Elon Musk's automaker paid MWW, a PR consultancy, to monitor an employee Facebook group and research union organizers on social media, CNBC reported, citing invoices and other documents it obtained.
