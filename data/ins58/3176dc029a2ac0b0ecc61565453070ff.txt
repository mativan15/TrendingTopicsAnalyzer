For investors navigating this inflationary environment, there has been no better risk-free return than the Series I bond. The asset, backed by the U.S. government, has a variable rate based on inflation. Right now, that interest rate is a record 9.62% through Oct. 31. It's expected to fall to roughly 6.48% in November , although the rate will only be known once the government announces it. The asset also has a fixed rate, which is currently zero. While inflation is still high, the Federal Reserve is hiking rates in an effort to bring it down.
