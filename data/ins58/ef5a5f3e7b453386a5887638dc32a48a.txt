Phoenix has long been known as one of the most competitive markets for grocery stores in the country, but it could face a shake-up should grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons consummate their planned merger.

Kroger (NYSE: KR), which is the parent company of Valley-based Fry's Food Stores, and Albertsons (NYSE: ACI), which also owns the Safeway brand, are two of the largest players in the Valley's grocery market. If the $24.6 billion merger agreement between the two companies goes through it could have a major impact on Valley consumers as well as company employees, local executives, suppliers, other grocers and real estate developers.
