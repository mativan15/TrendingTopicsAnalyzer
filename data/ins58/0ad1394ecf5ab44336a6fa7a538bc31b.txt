I can't believe Blizzard made babysitting the payload worse in Overwatch 2

Playing attack on Kings Row, what a great way to start the day. Fighting through the narrow cobblestoned streets of London at dawn or dusk, this Overwatch map is one of my favorites for a reason. It has everything you need, from great vantage points for snipers like Widowmaker to make use of to choke points that tanks like Reinhart can valiantly defend. The only problem is that I can't experience these when I'm stuck babysitting the payload. Left alone again while my team pushes forward further up the map, which seems like a world away.
