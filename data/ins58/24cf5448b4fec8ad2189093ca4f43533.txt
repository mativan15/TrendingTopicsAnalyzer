Carly Simon has lost both of her sisters to cancer this week, with Lucy and Joanna Simon dying just one day apart. 
According to a report from the New York Times, Lucy, 82, who was a Broadway composer, died from metastatic breast cancer on Thursday, October 20. 
The pair's eldest sister Joanna, who was an opera singer, is also reported to have died at the age of 85 a day earlier on Wednesday, October 19, following a battle with thyroid cancer.
