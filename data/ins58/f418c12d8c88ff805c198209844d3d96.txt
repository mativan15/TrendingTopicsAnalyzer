History aficionados might soon be able to live in a home on an old barracks that dates back to the 1700s. A planning application has been approved for a massive new development of houses and a huge park, on Calvary Barracks in West Hounslow. The famous military site has links to Oliver Cromwell, Florence Nightingale and Winston Churchill. Hounslow Council voted in favour of an application to build 1,525 new homes, hundreds of car parking spaces, retail units and over 10 acres of parks including sports pitches and playgrounds.
