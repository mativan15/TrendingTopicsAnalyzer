The 'social prescribing' of gardening, singing and art classes is a waste of NHS money, a study suggests.Experts found that sending patients to community activity groups had 'little to no impact' on improving health or reducing demand on GP services.The research calls into question a major drive from the NHS and Department of Health to increase social prescribing as a solution to the shortage of doctors and medical staff.In 2019 the NHS set a target of referring 900,000 patients for such activities via their GP surgeries within five years.
