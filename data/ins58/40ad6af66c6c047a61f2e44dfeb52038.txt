The bustling city of Toronto is one of the most popular in Canada, and there are many Black-owned businesses you can support there. In addition to being the largest Canadian city, Toronto is 'a world leader in business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture,' according to the Toronto website. You won't have to worry about frequent crime or filth either; Toronto consistently gets high marks for safety and cleanliness.

There are plenty of nods to The Culture as well, such as Caribana Toronto, which takes place over July and August.
