Relative to the amount of shareholder equity, Weyerhaeuser Co. (NYSE: WY) may be among the major real estate investment trusts (REIT) with the least amount of debt. This consideration may be of greater importance as the Federal Reserve takes further actions to increase interest rates. Those REITs with significant debt loads are likely to be more adversely affected by the increases.

That's why Weyerhaeuser stands out as REIT prices have mostly collapsed: If you were a bargain hunter, a 'least amount of debt' factor might be of interest.
