A service of thanksgiving is the latest in a run of events the Queen has had to pull out of for mobility reasons.The Prince of Wales will officially represent her at the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday after she experienced 'discomfort' during Thursday's Jubilee celebrations.And in recent months, the 96-year-old monarch has been absent from a series of major engagements including the State Opening of Parliament.The Queen was pictured seated in her official Jubilee portrait (Royal Household/Ranald Mackechnie/PA) / PA MediaWhile she made a number of in-person visits in the weeks leading up to her Jubilee celebrations, including a surprise visit to open the Elizabeth line and to tour the Chelsea Flower Show using a golf buggy, the Queen has faced ongoing 'episodic mobility problems', stretching back to last autumn, and now uses a walking stick.
