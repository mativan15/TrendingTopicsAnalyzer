The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by STAG Industrial, Inc. (NYSE:STAG) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 32%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 25%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 5.3% in three years.
