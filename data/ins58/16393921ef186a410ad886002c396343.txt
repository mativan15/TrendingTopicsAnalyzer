It's time to bet on Dish Network as shares could more than double in the near term, according to Truist. Analyst Greg Miller upgraded the stock to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation following its first investor day in over a decade. "Although DISH lacks a track record in a technical field with an unproven technology, we believe its spectrum holdings, discounted price points, rich $300b+ annual target market and potential enterprise partnerships position it well as a Buy rated stock," he wrote.
