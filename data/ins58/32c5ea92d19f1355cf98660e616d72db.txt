A Bank of America ATM in Palmdale sustained serious injuries Sunday morning after an explosive device was detonated in an attempt to get money from the machine.

Although the ATM was broken, it did not give up any cash, according to Deputy Tracy Koerner, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

'All we know is someone detonated some type of device trying to gain access and it was unsuccessful," he said. "No money was gotten out of the machine."

The explosion at 4:05 a.m. was powerful enough to blow out the windows of several shops, according to a KTLA report.
