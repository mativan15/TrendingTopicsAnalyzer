Jun. 4—A total of 1 local teams qualified for this spring's MIAA girls lacrosse state tournament.

There's a lot to break down as competition looms, so let's get right to it.

Division 1

Top seed: Walpole (18-2)

Local teams in mix: Peabody (No. 24 at 15-3); Beverly (No. 33 at 12-8)

The Tanners strung together a fantastic regular season under first-year head coach Michelle Roach, emphasizing a complete approach to all three phases of the game with offense, defense and goaltending. Now, they'll embark on what they hope will be a deep tourney run when they head to No.
