There's been a change in what voters want from Washington. The latest Fox News survey asks which of two messages voters would send to the federal government: "lend me a hand" or "leave me alone." A majority of 52% would ask Washington to "lend me a hand," up from 44% in 2021. The 8-point increase comes mostly from a 19-point jump among Republicans, as views among Democrats held steady. Still, Democrats (69%) are much more likely than Republicans (38%) to say lend me a hand. FOX NEWS POLL: KELLY UP IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE, HOBBS & LAKE BATTLE FOR GOVERNORSHIPLast year, 47% told the government to "leave me alone.
