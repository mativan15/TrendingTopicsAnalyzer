Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin would be open to the idea of leaving the Toffees to join Manchester United, Arsenal or Newcastle ahead of next season, according to reports. The 25-year-old is said to have no shortage of external interest in his services and it seems as though a change of scenery could soon be on the cards after Everton only managed to stay up by the skin of their teeth earlier this month.Newcastle are believed to be weighing up a potential summer move for Calvert-Lewin, while United and Arsenal have long been credited with a shared desire to snap him up in the not-too-distant future.
