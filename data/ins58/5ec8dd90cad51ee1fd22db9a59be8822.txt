JOHANNESBURG, Oct 21 (Reuters) - South Africa's plan to kick-start its transition from coal to renewable energy will need $46.5 billion, more than five times the $8.5 billion Western nations have pledged to the project over the next three to five years, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The sources said the investment plan, submitted to donor countries this month, is provisional and the figures could change ahead of the agreement being signed.It is not yet clear how the remaining $38 billion will be funded or how the bill breaks down.
