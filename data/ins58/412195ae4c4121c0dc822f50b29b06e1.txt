In January, New York City Mayor Eric Adams issued his 'Small Business Forward' plan, which required all city agencies to revisit and make proposals for either eliminating or reducing the fines imposed on small businesses for many of the city's regulations that were deemed unnecessary or excessive. 
As of just a few weeks ago, the recommendations – all 118 of them – are now here and in writing. And the result is underwhelming. To give credit where it's due, I appreciate that the mayor is taking steps to make life better for his city's small business owners.
