Increased menu prices and additional fees on receipts like kitchen appreciation, fuel surcharge, or wellness, are the latest efforts by restaurant owners to offset higher food and labor costs. However, these costly checks may also risk the loyalty of returning customers.

In April 2022, menu prices increased by 7.2%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's the largest one-year increase since 1981.

Consumers are "sensitive" to these menu price changes, according to Hudson Riehle, National Restaurant Association SVP of Research.
