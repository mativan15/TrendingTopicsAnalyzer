Published: 21:25 EDT, 14 October 2022 | Updated: 21:25 EDT, 14 October 2022 After rallying from a 3-0 deficit to defeat the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener, the Edmonton Oilers turn their attention to a home game against the defending Pacific Division champion Calgary Flames on Saturday night in the Battle of Alberta. It's a rematch of a 2022 Western Conference second-round playoff series that Edmonton won, 4-1, to advance to the conference final. The Oilers then lost to eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado.
