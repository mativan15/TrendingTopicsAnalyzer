HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's Democratic nominee for governor, has smashed the state's 2-decade-old campaign spending record as he competes against Republican Doug Mastriano, who was on track to spend less than a tenth as much.The race between Shapiro and Mastriano may test how powerful that campaign spending is in one of the nation's highest-profile races for governor. One candidate has spent more money than any other gubernatorial nominee ever in Pennsylvania, and the other has spent less than any other major party nominee in at least the past two decades.
