Like many others, I have been the subject of highly personalised attacks by the government in recent months. Boris Johnson referred to 'Islingtonian remainers' as if they were a terrorist group. Liz Truss said that members of an 'anti-growth coalition' lived in north London townhouses and took taxis. And Suella Braverman expressed her loathing for the 'Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati'.My crime? I have lived in an Islington townhouse and read the Guardian for the best part of 40 years, I occasionally take taxis, and I have always believed in European integration.
