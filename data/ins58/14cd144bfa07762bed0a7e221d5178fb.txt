The first rental construction in six years in trendy West Hartford Center is expected to begin in a month as two forlorn buildings are torn down to make way for luxury apartments that could test the upper limits of the area's asking rents.

The 48-unit apartment building will replace the buildings at 920 and 924 Farmington Avenue — an area considered the gateway to the heart of the Center. The new rentals could be ready by the fall of 2023.

The mixed-use project — expected to cost more than $15 million — has been christened 'The Byline' after a writer's credit at the top of a newspaper story.
