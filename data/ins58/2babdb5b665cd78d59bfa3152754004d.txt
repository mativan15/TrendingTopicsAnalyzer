NEW DELHI The Interpol on Thursday launched the first ever metaverse specifically designed for law enforcement agencies worldwide during its 90th General Assembly in Delhi, the global police body said in a statement. This 'fully operational' Interpol Metaverse allows registered users to tour a virtual facsimile of the Interpol General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, France without any geographical or physical boundaries, interact with other officers via their avatars, and even take immersive training courses in forensic investigation and other policing capabilities, it said.
