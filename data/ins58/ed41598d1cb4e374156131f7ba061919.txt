Investing.com -- Factory gate inflation in Europe's largest economy continued its record-breaking run in September, as companies again passed on sharp increases in their energy costs to buyers.

German producer prices rose by 2.3% on the month and by an eye-watering 45.8% on the year, statistics office Destatis said on Thursday.

The numbers show sustained inflationary pressure in the economic pipeline, and add to the pressure on the European Central Bank to keep raising interest rates despite the obvious slowdown in the Eurozone economy.
