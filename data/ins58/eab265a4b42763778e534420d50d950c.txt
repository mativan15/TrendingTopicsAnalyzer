As the possibility of a recession continues to weigh on tech stocks, language-learning website and mobile app Duolingo (DUOL) is shrugging off near-term volatility and focusing on future growth.

Duolingo shares jumped by about 30% on May 12 after the Pittsburgh-based company reported first-quarter earnings, and the stock has fluctuated as a sell-off driven by steep losses in tech stocks rocked the market in recent weeks.

'Our stock has fared pretty well, considering everything that's been going on in the market, and ultimately, we're very long-term focused,' Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn told Yahoo Finance (video above).
