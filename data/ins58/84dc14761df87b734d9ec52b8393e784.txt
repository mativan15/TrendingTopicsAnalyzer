(RTTNews) - The Singapore stock market on Thursday wrote a finish to the three-day slide in which it had stumbled more than 60 points or 1.8 percent. The Straits Times Index now rests just beneath the 3,210-point plateau and it's expected to open in the green again on Friday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is broadly positive, with support expected from the technology, retail, oil and airline stocks. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.
