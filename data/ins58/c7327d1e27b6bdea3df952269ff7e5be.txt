The Prince of Wales will officially represent her at the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday after she experienced 'discomfort' during Thursday's Jubilee celebrations. And in recent months, the 96-year-old monarch has been absent from a series of major engagements including the State Opening of Parliament.
