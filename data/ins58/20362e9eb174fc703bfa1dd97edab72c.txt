On November 14, 1987, the Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 29-27. This one stings, because Ohio State was winning, 27-22 with 16 seconds left, and Hawkeye quarterback, Chuck Hartlieb, completed a pass on 4th and 23 to an All-American tight end (it's Iowa so of course, it's a tight end) Marv Cook, who not only converted the fourth down but also scored a touchdown.
