Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2022 results on Thursday, October 20, 2022. We expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates. While the company reported a 13% increase in total revenue in the last quarter, it still missed street expectations. The main reason behind it was high growth numbers in 2021 and advertising budget cuts in 2022 due to the tough macroeconomic scenario.
