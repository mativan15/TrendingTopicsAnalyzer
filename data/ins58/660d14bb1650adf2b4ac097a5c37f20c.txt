Baris-Ozer Clinical-stage biotech Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLRX) shed ~27% at the open Tuesday after the company said that following a death of the study subject it will pause enrollment of new patients in the Phase 1/2 trial for lead asset seclidemstat in connective tissue cancer. The three-patient arms study is designed to evaluate seclidemstat as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcomas. The company said that the death of a metastatic FET-rearranged sarcoma patient due to an event classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) led to its decision to pause enrollment.
