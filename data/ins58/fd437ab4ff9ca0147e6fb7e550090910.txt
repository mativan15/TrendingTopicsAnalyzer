SINGAPORE—A global financial watchdog added Myanmar to its list of countries where businesses and financial institutions are at high risk of exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing, potentially accelerating the country's economic isolation that was triggered by a military coup last year.

The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based intergovernmental body whose 39 members include almost all of the world's major financial centers including the U.S., China and a number of European nations, said on Friday that Myanmar failed to address a large number of deficiencies in its anti-money-laundering and terrorist financing systems.
