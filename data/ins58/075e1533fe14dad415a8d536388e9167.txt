Photo: Ben Ashwell/The Wall Street Journal Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wants to bring more software developers and engineers out of back rooms and deeper into the business as the bank embarks on a sweeping reorganization to place greater weight on its client services offerings. The bank is trying to improve the developer experience for both internal and external workers, and is rewriting processes so that developers are more engaged with business goals from the beginning of projects, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.
