Swiss cyber giant Acronis celebrated the success of its year-old R&D center in Israel at its partner event on May 25 in Herzliya. The company's Israel branch saw a whopping 400% growth in cloud monthly recurring revenue (MRR) over the past year.

'It has been an amazing year for Acronis as a company, and specifically Acronis in Israel,' said Acronic president and COO Ezequiel Steiner. 'The company has broken records in terms of growth. We only grow because [Acronis employees] help us grow.'

Governments worldwide saw a 1,885% rise in ransomware attacks over the past year, according to the 2022 Cyber Threat Report released in February by SonicWall.
