Published: 04:06 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 04:14 EDT, 17 October 2022 Conor McGregor has taken to Twitter to say he 'carried' Floyd Mayweather during the 'opening rounds' of their 2017 bout before insisting he would 'end' the 45-year-old in a rematch. It has been nearly five years since the two combined for a highly-anticipated crossover fight in Las Vegas and McGregor is still furious with the result of the 2017 bout. Mayweather dominated the blockbuster showdown and secured a tenth round TKO victory over the UFC star.
