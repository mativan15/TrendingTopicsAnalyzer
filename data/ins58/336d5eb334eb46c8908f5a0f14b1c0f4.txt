(NYSE:VTR) is one of the four major real estate investment trusts ((REITs)) which derives most of their earnings from senior housing operated portfolio (SHOP), owning or managing (through unconsolidated joint ventures) approximately 1,200 properties. However, the stock has failed to achieve significant price growth, and when compared to its peers, looks really poor. When it comes to its dividend, Ventas has been able to pay a steady 3 percent plus yield over the past ten years.
