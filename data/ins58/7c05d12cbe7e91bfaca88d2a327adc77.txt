Hospital stocks plunged in trading on Friday after two leading hospital companies — HCA Healthcare Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. — failed to meet investor expectations for the third quarter. HCA's HCA, -6.71% stock was down 8.6% after the hospital operator said revenue in the third quarter of this year came in short, at $14.9 billion, slightly below the FactSet consensus of $15.0 billion. Same-facility admissions and emergency-room visits were both down for the quarter, although surgeries were up.
