As Caleb Kilian rolled through a successful start to his Triple-A career with the Iowa Cubs this season, front office members of the Chicago Cubs repeatedly said for weeks that the prized pitching prospect was close to making his big-league debut.

Kilian is finally ready.

The Cubs plan to promote the 25-year-old right-hander from Iowa, the top pitching prospect in the organization according to MLB Pipeline, per two sources close to the situation. Kilian was not on the field at Principal Park while pitchers were throwing prior to Friday's game.
