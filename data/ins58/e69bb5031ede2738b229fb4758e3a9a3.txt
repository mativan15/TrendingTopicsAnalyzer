Jun. 3—For more than a decade, The Well Church in Boulder held its Sunday services in an apartment, a middle school, a beer garden — whatever place it could find.

That will soon change.

After years of impermanence, the church is this year poised to move into a permanent location on South Broadway. It purchased and is renovating the former site of the South Broadway Church of the Nazarene.

Pastor Matt Patrick hopes the space will offer the church some stability and a sense that it's part of the larger community.
