Published: 13:40 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 13:43 EDT, 17 October 2022 The White House announced a five-year plan that aims to limit how much sunlight hits Earth to combat global warming and it involves spraying particles into the atmosphere to reflect light back into space - a similar technique codenamed 'Operation Dark Storm' in The Matrix 4 animated film.While it sounds like a plot from a science fiction film, US government officials are looking to spend around $10 billion per year on the program that would send flying aircraft into the stratosphere to release an aerosol with reflective abilities.
