One would think going 35-14 overall and earning the fourth seed in the deepest conference in college baseball this season would be enough to earn an NCAA regional to host this college baseball postseason but that wasn't the case for Notre Dame as the Irish will be the second seed in the Statesboro (Georgia) region.

Most believed Notre Dame was headed to hosting their own regional but that wasn't the case as brackets were released on Monday. Mike Buddie, who holds a chair on the selection committee gave reason to why Notre Dame was left out as a regional host on ESPN2 following the selection show.
