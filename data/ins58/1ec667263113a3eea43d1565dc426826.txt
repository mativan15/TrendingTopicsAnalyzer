Thus far, two wide receivers, Tyler Harrell and Aaron Anderson have yet to make their debuts at Alabama. The two missed the first four games due to injury but haven't seen any action up to this point after being suited up for several weeks now.
The expectation to begin the season was that Harrell would have a sizable role at wide receiver. However, that has not been the case so far. At Louisville, Harrell hauled in 20 receptions for 559 receiving yards and six touchdowns. The junior averaged almost 24 yards per catch with the Cardinals.
