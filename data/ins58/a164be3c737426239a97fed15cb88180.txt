Hamilton youths – along with counterparts from Auckland – make of most of an 80-strong cohort involved in ram raids across the country, says the Police Association president. Chris Cahill was commenting Monday on calls for Hamilton to be given a decent slice of a new $6 million fund to cut the risk of 'repeat victimisation to smal retailers'. That cash would go towards security and prevention equipment, such as bollards, alarms and fog cannons. It comes as Hamilton's mayor has been left ‘underwhelmed' by the government response to requests for more help.
