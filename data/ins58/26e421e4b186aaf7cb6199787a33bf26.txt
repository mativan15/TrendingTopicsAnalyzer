Q: Our old water heater is nearing the end of its life and seems to be leaking. We're thinking about replacing it with a smaller tankless system, but the price tag is higher. Is it worth it?

A: You can tell it's time to replace an older tank-based system if you've been running out of hot water during showers or have to wait forever to even get hot water. It's not unheard of to experience leaking pipes and fixtures, poor water quality and mechanical issues toward the end of a tank's life. Generally, tank-based water-heating systems should be replaced every 10–12 years.
