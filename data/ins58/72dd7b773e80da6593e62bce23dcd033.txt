Published: 04:49 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 04:49 EDT, 18 October 2022 Mark Watt would relish a showdown against England at Melbourne next week as Scotland's slow left-armer insisted his side have 'unfinished business' at the T20 World Cup. Scotland are basking in the afterglow of beating two-time champions the West Indies at Hobart and a win over Ireland on Wednesday will all but guarantee their progress from their first-round group. If Scotland miss out on top spot, the consolation in being runners-up is they would go into England's Super 12s group and a battle of Britain would take place on October 26 at the 100,000-capacity MCG.
