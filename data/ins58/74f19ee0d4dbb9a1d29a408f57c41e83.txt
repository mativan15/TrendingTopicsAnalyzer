Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper has told his players to 'make it happen' as they look to kickstart their season.Forest are on the bottom of the Premier League after six defeats from the last seven games and their visit to Brighton on Tuesday precedes games against Liverpool and Arsenal.Having overhauled his squad with 23 new signings in the summer there has been an understanding that it will take time for Forest to gel, but Cooper says they cannot afford to wait.'We have got to face up to our league position, face up to the reality of it and don't have the mentality of that we will be alright or things will improve.
