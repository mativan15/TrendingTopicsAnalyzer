Authorities say that the malnourished woman fled from Timothy Haslett Jr last week after the 39-year-old took his child to school.The alarm was raised when she ran barefoot to a neighbour's home in Excelsior Springs wearing a latex dress and a metal dog collar with a padlock around her neck and begged for help.The woman told police that she had been picked up in Kansas City in early September and been kept in restraints in a small room built in the basement of the house where she had been raped and whipped.
