Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi is still looking for his first win after three Premier League games in charge, although their performances have perhaps deserved more. 
They scored three goals in an away draw at Liverpool and it should have been more, and defeats against Tottenham and Brighton were both even contests according to expected goals. Despite those back-to-back defeats, victory for Brighton tonight will give them their best ever start to a top-flight campaign with 17 points from 10 games.
