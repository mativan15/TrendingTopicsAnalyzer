The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed Aug. 16, created a tax credit for consumers who buy new electric vehicles. The clean vehicle credit is worth up to $7,500. It's nonrefundable, meaning buyers need to have a federal tax liability to get full or partial benefits. The credit also comes with assembly, manufacturing and other requirements that may initially limit consumers' tax break. The historic climate legislation President Joe Biden signed in August offered a federal tax break — worth up to $7,500 — to households that buy new electric vehicles.
