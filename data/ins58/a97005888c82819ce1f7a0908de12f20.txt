The injuries keep piling up for the Miami Hurricanes, who were already missing six starters to open their game against the Virginia Tech Hokies and lost another one in the first half in Blacksburg, Virginia.

Will Mallory exited with an injury in the second quarter Saturday after taking a hit to the head on a 20-yard reception on the second play of the period.

The tight end was slow to get up and WQAM reported he would not return. Virginia Tech defensive back Nasir Peoples was flagged for targeting and ejected for the hit.
