Demand for air conditioners rises when the weather warms up. But consumers in Japan may face difficulties getting new equipment this year due to a supply shortage. People are being advised to test their units, and replace or repair them if there is any problem before the hottest days of the summer arrive. Some manufacturers say their production and shipment volumes have been affected by the global chip shortage and the coronavirus lockdowns in Shanghai. Major air-conditioner maker Daikin Industries says it conducted a survey of 600 consumers in April.
