(RTTNews) - The Switzerland stock market ended notably lower on Tuesday, in line with most of the markets across Europe, as rising inflation and looming interest rate hikes rendered the mood bearish. Weak Swiss exports and retails data too weighed on sentiment. The benchmark SMI ended with a loss of 124.88 points or 1.06% at 11,611.38, slightly off the session's low of 11,597.39. Credit Suisse tumbled more than 5%. Givaudan drifted down 3.7%, while Swiss Re, ABB, Swiss Life Holding and Sika lost 2 to 2.
