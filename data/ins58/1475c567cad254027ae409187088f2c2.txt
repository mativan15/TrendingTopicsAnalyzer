WASHINGTON — The federal government Thursday laid out for the first time how it will determine penalties for foreign companies that break agreements to protect US national security.When some foreign companies buy US firms, they sign agreements with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group of federal agencies, to mitigate national security concerns about the new ownership. The committee, known as CFIUS, can levy fines, some of them very large, on companies that break those agreements.
