 A recent spike in suspected drug overdoses prompted Peterborough Public Health to issue another drug poisoning alert on Wednesday.
The health unit did not disclose the number of drug poisoning incidents but said an 'increase' is likely attributed to reports this week of a 'bad batch' of drugs circulating within Peterborough and Peterborough County.
