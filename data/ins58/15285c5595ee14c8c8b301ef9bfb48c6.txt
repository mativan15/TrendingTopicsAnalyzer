Oct. 15—One scoring outburst was all Wyomissing needed to down Conrad Weiser on Friday night.

The Spartans racked up 35 points in less than five minutes during the late second and early third quarters on their way to a 49-10 win over the Scouts in a Lancaster-Lebanon League Section 4 game at Robesonia.

"It's nice to be able to do that," Wyomissing coach Bob Wolfrum said about the offensive onslaught. "Maybe we ought to start the games that way."

While the Spartans (5-0, 8-0) scored the victory — their Berks-record 33rd consecutive regular season win — they did not get off to a strong start.
