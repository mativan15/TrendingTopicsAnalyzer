Sean McVay has already said that Durant, Hill, Allen and Jefferson will be back after the Week 7 bye, which is excellent news. Hill, Allen and Jefferson should all step in as starters right away against the 49ers in Week 8, while Durant will also have a chance to start if he can unseat Derion Kendrick.
Durant has missed four games with a hamstring injury, Allen has missed five games with a knee injury, Jefferson hasn't played yet after having knee surgery and Hill has been out since injuring his groin in Week 2.
