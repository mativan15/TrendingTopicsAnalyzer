If Jonathan Dowdall's political career had a high point, it was May 23rd, 2014 when he came fourth out of 19 candidates running in the inner city for a seat on Dublin City Council.As a fresh-faced 36-year-old with a highly successful business, Dowdall was an inner-city success story whose star was on the rise in Sinn Féin.Within three years, Dowdall had lost his business, his council seat and his freedom while his former party was doing everything it could to disavow him. Five years later and Dowdall is again facing into a lengthy prison sentence and a life of looking over his shoulder following his commitment to giving evidence against the alleged perpetrators of the Regency Hotel attack.
