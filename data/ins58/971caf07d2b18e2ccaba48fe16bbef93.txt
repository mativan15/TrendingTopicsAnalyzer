Kellyanne Conway rejected Schumer's push for Trump to nominate Garland to the Supreme Court in 2017.

Conway in her new memoir detailed how Trump asked for her thoughts on the matter in the Oval Office.

"I don't think much of it, sir," she said to Trump, who eventually nominated judge Neil Gorsuch.
