U.S. consumers say they have been strongly affected by rising inflation, as it has changed their spending and saving habits.
According to the latest BMO Real Financial Progress Index, a quarterly survey conducted by BMO Harris and Ipsos, many Americans feel a major impact on their finances from inflation.
Close to 60% of respondents reported inflation adversely affected their finances. Out of that 60%, a quarter of them felt a "major impact."
On top of the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of continued financial struggle, which also severely impacted 60% of people's finances, now consumers face rising prices.
