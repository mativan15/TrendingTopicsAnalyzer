Damian Lewis has been tapped to star in supernatural black comedy The Radleys, based on Matt Haig's popular novel of the same name. The film has Heartstopper director Euros Lyn at the helm and is produced by Debbie Gray (Good Luck To You Leo Grande) through Genesius Pictures with Cornerstone Films handling worldwide sales.

	Story follows the Radley family, an ordinary family – or at least that's what the neighbors think. They are, in fact, vampires and only parents Helen and Peter (Lewis) know about the family's true nature.
