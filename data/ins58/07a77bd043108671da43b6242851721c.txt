Kanye West is back at it again. I write this with the sensitive understanding that he is troubled with mental health issues. Kanye recently spoke out in a troubling manner, as he warned Jews about toying with him and those opposing his agenda. He threatened Jewish people about a supposed conflict with him over a Jewish agenda.

'I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I'm going death con 3 on Jewish people.' He was upset that Instagram restricted his account over anti-Jewish remarks. 'Who do you think created cancel culture?' he tweeted.
