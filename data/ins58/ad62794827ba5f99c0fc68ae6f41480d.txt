GIANTS at JAGUARS

1 p.m., Jaguars by 3, 42 ½

HANK'S HONEYS: It's an inviting line if you're a big fan of the impressive 5-1 Giants but the bubble could burst here. The Jaguars' defense is built to stop them. Its weakness is against the pass and the Giants have just been getting by there. But that defense is ranked third against the run with a defensive front that can stand up to the Giants' emerging offensive line. The Jaguars are 2-16 ATS in their last 18 games against NFC teams. Their last win? Over the Giants.
