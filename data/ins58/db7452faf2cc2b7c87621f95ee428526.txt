Gandhinagar: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal in Gujarat's Ahmedabad district will act as a centre for learning India's diverse maritime history. The 'long period of slavery' and indifference made us forget or overlook India's rich maritime history, the Prime Minister said in his address after reviewing the construction of the complex at Lothal, about 80 km from Ahmedabad. He added that the heritage developed in the country in the last eight years 'gives us a glimpse of the vastness of India's legacy'.
