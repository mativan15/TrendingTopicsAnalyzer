Warning: This story contains spoilers for The Boys season 3, episode 1. You've been warned. 
The Boys has gone to places no other show could possibly go to and just when you thought it couldn't get anymore diabolical, then comes season 3 which kicks off with the single most uncomfortable moment yet.
For those yet to watch the moment in question, it takes place 10 minutes into episode one, which finally landed on Amazon Prime Video today. 
In it, a supe with the power to shrink gets whisked off into a private room during the premiere of Dawn of The Seven, a new movie obviously starring The Seven, by a guy with a fetish for tiny men who can fit anywhere.
