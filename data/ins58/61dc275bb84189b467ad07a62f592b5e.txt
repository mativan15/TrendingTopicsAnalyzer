Steel prices fell about 40% to ₹57,000 a tonne in the domestic market over the last six months on subdued export orders in the wake of the 15% export levy, according to SteelMint.In early 2022, the prices of hot rolled coil (HRC) started showing an upward trend. It had become a matter of concern for the user industries as movements in steel prices have a direct impact on industries like real estate and housing, infrastructure and construction, automobile and consumer goods.The steel prices in the domestic market peaked at ₹78,800 per tonne in April.
