Teladoc Health (TDOC 3.33%) and Novavax (NVAX -8.37%) shares have traveled a similar road. In the early days of the pandemic, both stocks soared. Investors bet on Teladoc winning more and more customers as people avoided crowds and turned to virtual medical visits. And they bet on Novavax's ability to bring a coronavirus vaccine to market.
Since then, the path has gotten bumpy for both stocks. Investors worried that Teladoc's successes wouldn't last beyond the pandemic. And they lost faith in Novavax after it took longer than expected to bring its vaccine to market.
