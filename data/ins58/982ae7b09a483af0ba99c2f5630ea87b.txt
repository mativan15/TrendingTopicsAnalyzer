'In some cases, we've seen victims lose their entire life savings.'

People are falling victim to scammers pretending to be tech support, and they're losing millions of dollars.

FBI Boston Investigators are noticing a rising trend in which fraudsters, posing as customer service representatives from tech companies, convince victims that their finances are compromised. Victims are told to move their assets, and the scammers gain control.

Officials said this is also happening through cryptocurrency transfers and malware downloads.
