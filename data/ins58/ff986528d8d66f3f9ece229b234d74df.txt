THE Cebu City Police Office (CCPO) is ready for All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day on Nov. 1 and 2, 2022.



According to Lieutenant Colonel Wilbert Parilla, CCPO's deputy director for administration, they've already ironed out security plans.



'Naka-template nana siya kay kada tuig maning atong paghatag og seguridad sa mga menteryo,' Parilla said.



(We already have a template since we provide security at cemeteries during this period every year.)



With the easing of pandemic-related restrictions, there is no more limit to the number of people who want to visit their departed loved ones.
