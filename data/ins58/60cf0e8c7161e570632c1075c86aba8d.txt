California police arrested two men suspected of committing a series of armed robberies in and around Los Angeles, days after they allegedly shot a guard several times. Gregory James, 47, of San Pedro, and Lamond Akins, 30, of Compton, each face charges of robbery and discharging a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence in connection with the Monday heist. The Justice Department said both men ambushed a Loomis guard who had just finished working on ATMs at a Bank of America in Los Angeles' Harbor City neighborhood.
