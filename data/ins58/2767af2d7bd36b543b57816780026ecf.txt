Tory rebels have vowed that fracking will 'die a death' as they plan to make the policy the party's next U-turn.

MPs have said that the Prime Minister is now too weak politically to push ahead with plans to lift the moratorium on shale gas exploration.

The Whips' office is understood to be nervous about the number of Conservative backbenchers planning to abstain or even vote with Labour on Wednesday in an opposition day debate on fracking.

'Party discipline has broken down,' one Tory MP who is opposed to fracking said, adding that rebels believed they could '100 per cent' force a U-turn on the issue.
