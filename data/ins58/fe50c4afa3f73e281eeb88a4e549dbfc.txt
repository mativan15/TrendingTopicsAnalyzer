When shopping for a car, one of your first considerations is probably how you'll pay for it. If a new or used auto loan is in your future, it's worth researching what kinds of interest rates are available to you. Your annual percentage rate, or APR, can vary widely. Your credit score is the biggest de terming factor. You'll want to check it before you begin the process. There are plenty of free tools to check your credit score online. If your score is low, you may pay quite a bit in interest. If possible, waiting to buy while you work on improving your credit could save a lot of money.
