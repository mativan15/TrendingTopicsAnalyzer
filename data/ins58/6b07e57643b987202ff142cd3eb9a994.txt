You may not have heard of Australian actress Natasha Bassett before, but with a leading role in this summer's biggest film and the world's richest man on her arm – that's all about to change.

Bassett is dating Tesla CEO Elon Musk, according to Hollywood Life. The rumours first began to swirl on February 17, when a photo of Musk in LA exiting his G650ER private jet —worth a cool £50 million — with a 'beautiful red-haired mystery woman' surfaced.

One month later, Musk's ex Grimes, 34, revealed on the cover of Vanity Fair that she had welcomed a second child into the world with the Tesla entrepreneur via a surrogate.
