June 02, 2022 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time IRVINE, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kantata closed its first quarter operating as a new company following the successful merger of Mavenlink and Kimble Applications with strong results driven by the growth of its client roster. Notable recent client wins include: APC, Cadence Design Systems, Crowe Soberman, HERE, K3 Business Technology Group, LiveWorld, OC&C Strategy Consultants, Talan, and Venables Bell & Partners.

The professional services industry is one of the largest and fastest growing in the world, however the lack of effective technology utilization forces companies to operate without clear visibility into day-to-day operations, using cobbled together business, project, and resource management tools ill-equipped for the shifting realities of modern services engagements.
