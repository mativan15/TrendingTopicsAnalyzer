By PA Media Published: 06:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 06:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 The European Union is due to greenlight a military training mission in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops and provide around half a billion euro (£434 million) in extra funds to help buy weapons for the war-torn country. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg: 'Morally, politically, even militarily, Russia is losing this war. So, we have to continue supporting Ukraine.' Mr Borrell, who is chairing a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's foreign ministers, said the EU would set up 'a powerful training mission deployed out of the borders of Ukraine'.
