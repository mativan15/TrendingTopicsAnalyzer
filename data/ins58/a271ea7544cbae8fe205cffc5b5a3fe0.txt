I have news. Oh, Lord, what now?It's good news!I didn't know that was a thing any more . . .In fact, it's the best kind of news — Succession news. OK, now you have me interested.The first preview of the new series is out. That is music to my ears. Perfect timing for some Waystar Royco chaos. Here's a question: which functions better, the Roy family or the government?Indeed. Looks as if it will be a juicy season four too. And some of it is reportedly set in Norway.Ooh, I love a bit of Scandi noir.
