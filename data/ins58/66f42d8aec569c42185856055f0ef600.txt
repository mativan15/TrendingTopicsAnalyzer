Tracey Crouch says reform of English football has been 'delayed by politics' with plans for a new regulator for the game yet to be put before parliament.

The author of the fan-led review into football governance, which was published 10 months ago and met with widespread support, said she was 'frustrated' by the slow progress of government action, with a white paper on the proposals still to be published.

Speaking at an event chaired by the UK Onward think tank, Crouch was asked if implementing the fan-led review was high up the current government's agenda.
