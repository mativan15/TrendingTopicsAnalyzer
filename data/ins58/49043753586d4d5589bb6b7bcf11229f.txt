A WOMAN has revealed that she has spent her £150 council tax rebate to stock her fridge full of beer - arguing that she should be able to spend her money however she wants.
Sharing the clip to her TikTok account @tonisheard862, Toni, an assistant shop manager  from Brighouse, West Yorks, has caused controversy with some people arguing that the money should have gone to better use.

The video shows Toni's fridge stocked to the brim with beer, as she says: 'So I just got my £150 rebate from the council and I decided to buy all this, what do you think?'
The rebate is supposed to help with the cost of living crisis, so many were confused as to why she spent the money on a fridge full of beer, instead of something more useful or urgent, such as paying bills or buying fuel.
