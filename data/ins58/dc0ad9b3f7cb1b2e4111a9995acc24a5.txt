Gov. Ron DeSantis announces his proposed state budget for 2022-23 at the Capitol on Dec. 9, 2021.

Local lawmakers, lobbyists and labor leaders said the $109 billion state budget Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Thursday is a qualified success for Tallahassee and Leon County.

The celebration over a historic 5.3% across-the-board pay raise for state employees and a new $15 minimum wage for state workers was partly overshadowed Friday morning by the vetoes of $1 million earmarked to the Second Harvest of the Big Bend and a $50,000 appropriation for the Leon Works Expo and Junior Apprenticeship Program.
