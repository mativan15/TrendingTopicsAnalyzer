JPMorgan's chief global market strategist Marko Kolanovic is getting less bullish on stocks as risks rise that the hawkish Federal Reserve may force a policy error with its aggressive interest rate hikes.In a Monday note, he reduced exposure to equities in his model portfolio by 3%, and redistributed the allocation to government and corporate bonds."We trim risk in our model portfolio this month given increasing risks around central banks making a hawkish policy error and geopolitics. Recent developments on these fronts – namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine – are likely to delay the economic and market recovery," Kolanovic said.
