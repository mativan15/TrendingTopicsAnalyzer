Francisco Alvarez, the Mets' top prospect and one of the top-ranked in baseball, had surgery on his ankle Tuesday.

The 20-year-old catcher missed time in late August with a loose body his right ankle. The Mets shut him down and he was able to avoid surgery. He returned to Triple-A Syracuse and played well enough to warrant a call-up for the final week of the regular season.

But following the season, he underwent imaging and he had surgery to address cartilage damage resulting from the preexisting loose body.
