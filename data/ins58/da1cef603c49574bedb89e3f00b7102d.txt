IRVING, Texas (AP) — The Big 12 Conference is distributing a record $426 million of revenue to its 10 schools for the 2021-22 school year, a nearly 25% increase over last year and 10% higher than its peak before the pandemic.

Texas Tech president Lawrence Schovanec, chairman of the Big 12 board of directors, said Friday at the end of the league's spring meetings that the transitioning league is in 'a very strong position.'

Schovanec also said the search for a new conference commissioner is on track to be completed by mid-July.
