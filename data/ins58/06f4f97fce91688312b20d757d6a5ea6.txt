First, the bad news: Most 401(k) and other employer-sponsored retirement plans, as well as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), have at least some money invested in companies that contribute to fossil fuel extraction, deforestation or both.So the money sitting in your retirement kitty right now is probably bound up with the climate crisis in some way. 'There's 100-million people in the US with $10-trillion in assets that have no idea that they're investing in their own destruction,' estimates Andrew Behar, CEO of the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.
