An heir to a $2 million trust fund disappeared nearly three years ago. On Wednesday, authorities in Pennsylvania arrested his former romantic partner, who allegedly stabbed the victim to death, used his phone to pretend he was still alive and drained his allowance money. The heir, Rashid Young, 22, was reported missing in December 2019 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, according to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office. For years, his family has pleaded for answers on his whereabouts. They recently hired a private investigator, who requested Montgomery County detectives look into Young's disappearance, the district attorney's office said in a statement Wednesday.
