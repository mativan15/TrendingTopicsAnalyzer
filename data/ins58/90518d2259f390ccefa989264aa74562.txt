Helen Skelton has revealed who her biggest competition is on Strictly Come Dancing – and her answer wasn't who people expected.
The former Blue Peter presenter is partnered with Spanish pro Gorka Marquez this series, and the pair are yet to find themselves in the bottom two, earning enough public votes last week to sail through to week five.
Helen, who danced a paso doble last week and scored 29 points, will tackle the Charleston this weekend and has been training hard, with both her and Gorka admitting the competition is tough this year.
