Fans are 'happy' about recent photos where Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez are hugging and posing for pictures together at the Academy Museum Gala.

This reunion comes after the 25-year-old model spoke candidly about her relationship with her husband Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend, claiming they owe each other nothing but 'respect'.

In the photos, taken by photographer Tyrell Hampton, Gomez and the Rhode beauty founder can be seen smiling, with one photo showing them sharing a hug.

For the event, Bieber wore a sultry strapless gown from Saint Laurent's spring/summer 2023 collection, while Gomez chose a chic black suit with satin lapels and flared trousers.
