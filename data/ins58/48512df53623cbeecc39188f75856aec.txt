New York (CNN Business)Roughly 100 Sears Hometown locations are permanently closing in the coming weeks, representing roughly half of its remaining retail footprint.The closures were announced on each individual store's Facebook page rather than a single press release. The locations are spread over about 30 US states, according to multiple reports. "Unfortunately we must announce the closing of our Sears Hometown Store. It is not a decision that we have made lightly. We have loved all of our time that we have been able to spend with you over these last 10 years," the Facebook post says for its Luling, Louisiana location, about 28 miles from New Orleans, which is set to close on June 23.
