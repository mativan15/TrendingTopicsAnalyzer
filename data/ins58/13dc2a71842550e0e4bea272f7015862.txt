The preview analysis of the just started Q2FY23 results is subdued, both on a YoY & QoQ basis. The signs point to a potential further downgrading in India's corporate earnings growth outlook for FY23 & FY24. This is because the Q2 forecast reveals a flat PAT trend on a YoY basis for the Nifty50 index constituents. This is in contrasts with the actual PAT growth in Q1, which was around 20 per cent, supported by a low base and traction in economic activity.

At the beginning of fiscal 2023, the market anticipated an EPS growth of 18% to 20% for Indian corporates in FY23.
