Buying a mobile home has made Stephan Gardner's life measurably better, especially from a financial perspective.Gardner lives with his wife and son in Greenwood Village, a mobile home park, in Calgary, Alta."I don't feel I settled here," he told CBC's Cost of Living. "We just walked in and we were like, 'This place is amazing.' "The family had been renting a home in the city, and feared they would be evicted after it was sold to a new owner. They were paying $2,100 a month rent, plus utilities. That high cost was preventing Gardner from putting money toward his personal debt.
