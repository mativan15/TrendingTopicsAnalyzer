Britain's competition regulator has ordered Facebook-owner Meta to sell animated-images platform Giphy on Tuesday after a tribunal upheld its view that the acquisition could damage its rivals and remove a potential competitor in advertising.
The Mark Zuckerberg-run company said it would accept the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) order to unwind the 2020 deal.
'We are disappointed by the CMA's decision but accept today's ruling as the final word on the matter,' a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.
