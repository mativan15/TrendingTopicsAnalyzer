With the MSCI Europe down nearly 14% this year, Morgan Stanley believes European stocks have been oversold, with the index now trading below its long-run median forward price-to-earnings — an important metric used by traders to gauge the value of an asset. But despite the oversold conditions and lower valuations, the bank said it remains cautious on European stocks.
