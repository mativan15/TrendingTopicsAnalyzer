New data show consumers in Japan spent more lavishly with their credit cards during this year's spring holidays than they did before the coronavirus pandemic. The finding comes from the consumption index compiled by credit card company JCB and data analysis firm Nowcast. It rose by 6.4 percent for the first half of May from the three-year average for the same period up to 2018. There were no restrictions on social outings or travel during the holidays for the first time in three years. Spending at convenience and liquor stores surged 43.
