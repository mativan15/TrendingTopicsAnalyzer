Liz Truss stepped down as United Kingdom prime minister Thursday after just 44 days in office, making her the shortest-serving leader in British history.Truss bowed out just a day after vowing to stay in power, saying she was 'a fighter and not a quitter.' But she couldn't hold on any longer after a senior minister quit her government with a barrage of criticism and a vote in the House of Commons descended into chaos just days after she was forced to abandon many of her economic policies.'Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,' Truss said in front of 10 Downing Street.
