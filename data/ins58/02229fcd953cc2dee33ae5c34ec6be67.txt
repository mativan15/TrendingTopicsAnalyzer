Bhim Army and Azad Samaj Party president Chandrashekhar Azad has emerged as a youth leader, especially for the Dalits, by claiming to represent their aspirations, unaddressed by other parties. In the wake of the scenes of lakhs of aspirants for the Uttar Pradesh Preliminary Entrance Test trying to make it to exam centres packed into trains and buses, he speaks about the unemployment issue, the plans of his party that are yet to take off, and Dalit representation that is back in the news following the conversion row that led to Delhi minister Rajendra Pal Gautam's resignation.
