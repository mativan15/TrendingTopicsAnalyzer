Gurugram-based ACME Group on Friday said that it has signed a MoU with Japan-based NYK Line for cooperation in green ammonia. 'We have signed a MoU with NYK Line, a leading Japanese shipping company, which owns and operates a large fleet of ships including container ships, bulk carrier, VLCC, LNG carriers etc, and is actively engaged in green-related businesses including transportation of hydrogen and ammonia,' said Rajat Seksaria, CEO of AMCE Group. 
As part of the cooperation, ACME and NYK will explore offering green ammonia to customers globally whereby ammonia would be supplied from ACME-developed projects and NYK will be the shipping partner.
