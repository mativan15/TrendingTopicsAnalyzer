I first ran for Governor in 2018 because Kansas was not living up to its potential. Our state was making national headlines for all the wrong reasons: underfunded schools, a budget in shambles, a stagnant economy, and crumbling roads and bridges. All because my predecessor put his own political agenda ahead of what was best for Kansans.So I ran to get our state back on track, to steady the ship. And I'm proud of the work we've done these last four years to do just that.We brought both parties together to deliver for Kansas.
