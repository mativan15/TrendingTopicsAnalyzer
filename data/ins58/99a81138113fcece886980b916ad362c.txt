A team at TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance planned to harness data from the app to 'monitor the personal location of some specific American citizens,' according to an explosive report published in Forbes Thursday.

TikTok has been embroiled in controversy in the last few years over questions about whether the app could expose its data to the Chinese government. The company is involved in an ongoing negotiation with regulators to address national security concerns, but the Forbes report seems to confirm some of the worst fears about the social media app.
