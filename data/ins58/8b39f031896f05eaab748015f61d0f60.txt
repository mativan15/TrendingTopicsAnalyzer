Londoners are being advised to work from home on Monday, with the return to work after the jubilee bank holiday set to be derailed by a tube strike.
Transport for London (TfL) said people should avoid travelling on the network, with business groups saying employers would have to put more flexible working policies in place as 4,000 station staff prepare to go on strike.
Large parts of the Underground will be out of action after the RMT union called the strike over job losses and concerns that pension entitlements could be watered down by TfL, which is under pressure from the Government to find savings after the Covid pandemic.
