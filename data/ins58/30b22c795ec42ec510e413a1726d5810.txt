ARSENAL'S pursuit of Serge Gnabry has been handed a major boost with the winger now destined to leave Bayern Munich this summer. 
The 26-year-old has reportedly rejected Bayern's proposal of a new contract, and the club will not be making an increased offer.

It was reported last week that Gnabry was unhappy with Bayern's latest wage offer and rejected an extension. 
Now Bild claim Bayern are not budging on the terms they have laid out and do not plan to make an improved bid.
