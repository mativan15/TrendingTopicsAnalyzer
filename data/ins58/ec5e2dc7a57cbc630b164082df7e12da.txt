COLUMBUS, Ohio — Most of Ohio State's roster has turned over since the Buckeyes finished their season in the second round of the last NCAA Tournament.Coach Chris Holtmann will have a lot to learn about the identity of what essentially is a new team, with a nationally regarded recruiting class and a trio of highly regarded transfers. Ohio State will have 10 newcomers among the 14 on the roster. Six are first-year players.'Maybe with the exception of our first year when we were implementing a different coaching style, a different system, but it's been more than I've ever had to do with this number of young guys,' Holtmann said.
