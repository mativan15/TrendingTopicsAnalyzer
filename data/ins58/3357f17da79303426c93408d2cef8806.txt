NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday hit back at Union home minister Amit Shah over his accusations against the AAP, and asked the BJP not to make "excuses" for its "failure" in running the MCD for 15 years.In a series of tweets in Hindi, the AAP supremo also said that in the next civic elections, people will have to decide whether they want a Delhi filled with garbage or a clean Delhi."For something you could not do in 15 years, now you want three more years for that? Why should people trust you? You won't be able to do it.
