Speaker and audio products maker Sonos, Inc. (NASDAQ: SONO) stock has fallen (-26%) for the year selling off with the rest of the bear market. The audio products maker continues to grow both top and bottom lines. Stay-at-home mandates and lockdowns spurred growth in home theater and entertainment audio products as consumers spent more time at home during the pandemic. As workers return to the office, sales momentum has slowed from its 90% tepid growth to 20% top line growth in its latest quarter.
