With its vineyard-adjacent setting, Williams-Sonoma-sponsored culinary stage, and what can only be described as tech-bro-turned-sommelier clientele, BottleRock Napa Valley seems like it could be, perhaps, the least metal of the major music festivals. But don't tell that to the Metallica Family.  The band's fans, complete with wraparound sunglasses and foot-long beards, poured into wine country on Friday for the first day of the festival to see the heavy metal headliners.  Throughout the day, bands such as Scottish indie pop group CHVRCHES and Austin-based art rock band Spoon seemed like more natural fits to the BottleRock mold.
