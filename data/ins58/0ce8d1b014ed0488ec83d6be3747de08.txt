Lawyer Gordon McKernan has been a central figure in the LSU and Louisiana NIL space, inking several players to deals over the last year.
During the month of October, those deals will have an added dimension as they will aid the fight against breast cancer in the state of Louisiana.

For every major stat, $100 will be donated. For every big play, $250, and McKernan has promised a minimum donation of $5,000 for Saturday's game against Ole Miss, though that number could increase.
Among others, McKernan's athletes include Kayshon Boutte and Harold Perkins.
