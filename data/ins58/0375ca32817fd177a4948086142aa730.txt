The roles of VK Sasikala and her nephew KS Sivakumar in the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa should be probed, the Justice A Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry constituted by the state government in 2017 has said in its report, tabled in the Tamil Nadu assembly on Tuesday. The inquiry commission found Sasikala 'decided against a life-saving angiogram procedure' on Jayalalithaa. "The reasonable and irresistible inference to be drawn from the attendant circumstances is that the reversal decision, not to perform the timely angio, must have been engineered by R1 (respondent 1, Sasikala) who alone had the strategic advantage of influencing the decision," the commission report said.
