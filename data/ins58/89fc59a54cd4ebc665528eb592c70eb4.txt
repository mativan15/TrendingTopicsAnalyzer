Tesla (TSLA -5.77%) stock is down 7.2% on Thursday as of 9:52 a.m. ET, following the electric vehicle pioneer's release of its third-quarter report yesterday. 
The stock's drop is probably largely attributable to the quarter's revenue coming in a little lighter than Wall Street's consensus estimate. Given the challenging market conditions in 2022, many investors are reacting more unfavorably to even relatively minor blips in quarterly earnings reports than they did when the market was in a bull mode.
