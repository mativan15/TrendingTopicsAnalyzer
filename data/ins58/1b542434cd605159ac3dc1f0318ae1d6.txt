After weeks of intense and relentless selling, have real estate investment trusts (REITs) finally bottomed?

No one can say for sure, but REITs in general had a very good day Monday with some of the best up moves in awhile.

The following five REITs easily outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 on Monday, and that benchmark index was up 2.65%.

Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operates 78 hotels in 20 U.S. markets.

The 3.39% move up ran into sellers at the declining 50-day moving average.
