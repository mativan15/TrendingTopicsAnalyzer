From a canopy tent on the side of a scenic road from Poonjar that winds through the foothills of the Western Ghats, a group of women are taking turns to sell a few commodities. The items on offer include various local farm produce and their value-added versions and, of course, the local delicacies.This outlet at Malayinchippara, called a Nattupacha Native Window, has been a saving grace for not just the women who are running it, but a bunch of homestead farmers in and around the village.
