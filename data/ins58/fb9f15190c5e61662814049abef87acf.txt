Elon Musk is calling Tesla executives back to the office—and using factory workers' demanding schedules to justify his orders.The Tesla CEO sent out an email on May 31 entitled 'Remote work is no longer acceptble (sic)' arguing for the company to succeed, executives needed to be back in Tesla's main offices. He noted that Tesla factory workers' schedules were more taxing than those of its white-collar workers.'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,' the electric-vehicle magnate wrote in the internal email reported by Bloomberg.
