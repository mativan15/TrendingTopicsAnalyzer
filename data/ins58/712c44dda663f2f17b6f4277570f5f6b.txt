Published on May 29, 2022 08:06 PM IST Zulfiqar Jiskani, a resident of Pakistan's Lucky Shah Saddar area, arrested for strangling wife to death. The reason behind the murder was opposition to the man's sickening intent - a plan to 'sell' under-18 daughter. Zulfiqar Jiskani killed his wife when she refused to allow their under-18 daughter to be 'sold' for marriage. As per the victims' relatives, the man was eyeing 1,00,000 Pakistani Rupees, an outright deplorable mindset. Murder victim's brother stated Zulfiqar Jiskani earlier 'sold' two daughters for money & still wasn't done.
