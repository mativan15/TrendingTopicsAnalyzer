After years of declining numbers, the Alaskan snow crab season is canceled.

Earlier this month, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced that due to low stock, crab fisheries aren't allowed to open for the 2022/2023 season.

Miranda Westphal, a biologist with the state's fish and game department, told The New York Times that the state is looking into why the crab population was declining.
