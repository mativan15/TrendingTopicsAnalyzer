Derby put on an impressive show at the opening of its market hall in 1866. Visitors to the city, some of whom arrived on special trains, heard a performance of Handel's Messiah and 'a powerful and effective organ'. Today the hall echoes with the shouts of scaffolders. The rows of market stalls on the ground floor are lifeless, the traders having moved elsewhere. The building will not reopen until 2024. Even in its half-repaired state, Derby Market Hall is spectacular. It has a vast roof of glass and wood, with iron supports.
