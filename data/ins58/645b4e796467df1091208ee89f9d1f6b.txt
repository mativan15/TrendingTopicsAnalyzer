Juventus moved up one place to seventh on 19 points, one above Inter which travels to Fiorentina on Saturday.
Two goals by midfielder Adrien Rabiot helped Juventus crush Empoli 4-0 at the Allianz Stadium on Friday, as Massimiliano Allegri's team won two consecutive Serie A games for the first time this season.Forward Moise Kean put the host ahead in the eighth minute when he tapped in a beautiful cross from Filip Kostic.
