Hello! In this week's ETF wrap, you'll see the funds that soared in May and those that suffered. I'll also give you a look at how ETF flows shook out last month. Please send tips and feedback to christine.idzelis@marketwatch.com. You can also follow me on Twitter at @cidzelis. Some of the biggest gains for exchange-traded funds in May were linked to inflation seen in commodities such as energy, while blockchain ETFs struggled as bitcoin fell. Shares of BlackRock's iShares MSCI Chile ETF ECH, +3.29% topped the list of best performers, soaring nearly 19.
