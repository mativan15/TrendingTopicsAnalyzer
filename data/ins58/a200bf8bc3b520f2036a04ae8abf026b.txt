Here's an animation I've been working on since my last post. Not only am I new to this but found the software finicky. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to get the timing down, sync the music, and get it the way I wanted. Created with OpenShot, Blender and PhotoShop Elements. Special appreciation goes to Hayden Folker for the Soundtrack. I couldn't have imagined anything better for this!
