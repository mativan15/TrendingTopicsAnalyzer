Indiewire Hong Sangsoo's level of productivity probably hasn't been matched on the screen since the run of Rainer Werner Fassbinder. 'The Novelist's Film,' his latest gently ambling and self-reflexive drama about the craft of filmmaking, is the South Korean director's 27th movie. It's also his second this year alongside 'Walk Up.' Exclusively on IndieWire, watch the trailer for 'The Novelist's Film' below. Cinema Guild opens it at Lincoln Center on October 28 before bringing it to select theaters beginning November 4.
