(Bloomberg) -- Apollo Global Management Inc. said a 'big portion' of the $50 billion it targets to raise from retail investors over the next five years will come from Asia's growing rich, as the alternative asset manager expands beyond its institutional client base.The New York-based firm is focusing on private banks and investment advisers to expand in retail markets, said Matthew Michelini, partner and head of Asia-Pacific, in an interview. From raising very little capital in Asia in this area, Apollo managed to tap nearly $2 billion in a year, he said.
