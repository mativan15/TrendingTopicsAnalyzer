In separate charges unsealed today in the U.S. Attorneys' Offices for the Eastern District of New York and the District of Connecticut, and with the support of the Department's Task Force KleptoCapture, the Justice Department has charged nearly a dozen individuals and several corporate entities with participating in unlawful schemes to export powerful, civil-military, dual-use technologies to Russia – some of which have been recovered on battlefields in Ukraine while another nuclear proliferation technology was intercepted before reaching Russian soil.
