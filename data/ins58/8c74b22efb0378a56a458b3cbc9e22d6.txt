Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou: "The nature of the football club is we're expected to win these competitions."It's a good challenge for us tonight, every cup game, particularly away from home, is a bit of a challenge. I'm looking forward to it."Asked if he's able to make several changes without disrupting the team's flow, Postecoglou said: "We're trying to get to that point."We've still got eight games to go in this cluster before the break. If you rely on too few, you're going to get a number of injuries.
