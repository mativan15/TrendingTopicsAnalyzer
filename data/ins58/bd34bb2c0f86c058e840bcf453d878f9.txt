By Megan Cerullo June 1, 2022 / 7:09 PM / MoneyWatch Elon Musk has had it with workers who prefer to work remotely. The Tesla CEO said employees must report to their assigned offices at least 40 hours per week, according to a leaked company memo entitled "Remote work is no longer acceptable." "If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned," he said in a follow-up email to the company's workers. Musk appeared to confirm the authenticity of the leaked missives by responding to questions about them on Twitter.
