It may not be on our list of the best VPN providers, but FastestVPN will get heads turning thanks to its latest plan.This includes a 12-month subscription to Passhulk, a potential candidate for our best password manager list, worth $23.95, and a 1-month subscription to Internxt - which is definitely in our best cloud storage guide - and is worth a mere $8.99 per month.Oh and it's worth noting that FastestVPN's own subscription lasts a lifetime (or however long FastestVPN will operate) and costs a mere $20 with a 15-day money back guarantee.
