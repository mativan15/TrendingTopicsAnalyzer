So far this season, against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday in the Boston Celtics' sole game so far, guard Derrick White has started. But with the team likely to try out different coverages against different types of teams this season, he might end up coming off of the bench as well in some games.
Speaking with the media after practice on Wednesday, the Colorado native shed some light on what it was like playing for Boston with that dynamic in play for much of the team's roster. 'You've got to be locked in and ready when your name is called,' he explained via CLNS.
