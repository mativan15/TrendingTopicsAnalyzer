OPINION: New York has one last chance to step back from the abyss of pure insanity — by winning the 2022 gubernatorial election. And what does the GOP do with this lone chance at redemption? It allows a circus side show like Andrew Giuliani (the poster boy for white, GOP privilege if there ever was one) to inject himself into the race, where he has no business being. The younger Giuliani has no support, no money, no staff and most of all, aside from a glorified gopher job in the Trump White House that his old man likely got him, no resume.
