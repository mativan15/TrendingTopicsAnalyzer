Michael Carrick is poised to become Middlesbrough's sixth manager in five years and could be in the dugout at the Riverside when Huddersfield visit Teesside on Saturday.The 41-year-old former West Ham, Tottenham, Manchester United and England midfielder has been talked into a change of heart by Boro's owner, Steve Gibson, after initially suggesting he was reluctant to take the job during initial talks last week.However, a three-year contract is being finalised with Sir Alex Ferguson's former Manchester United assistants Mike Phelan and René Meulensteen expected to join Carrick's staff as he endeavours to steer Boro clear of the Championship relegation zone.
