Whether flying or driving, millions of people are expected to travel this Memorial Day weekend.

Flyer Calvin Ferrier just landed in Atlanta for a weekend with family, and it wasn't as cheap as his light flight to Atlanta.

Ferrier told Channel 2′s Matt Johnson that he paid 60% more for his ticket.

The average plane ticket costs 45% more than it did last year, according to the Airlines Reporting Corporation.
