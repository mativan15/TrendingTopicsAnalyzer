Dear Amy: I'm a financially independent 27-year-old woman. I work in the beauty industry. My parents do not support my career advancement and skill development.

I need to move and leave my current job, but I will not jump ship until I have something else lined up.

I attend conventions and trade shows to make connections in the professional world, learn new skills, and keep up with current trends.

It's an investment in myself. My parents express their disappointment and call my efforts a waste of money – and dangerous.
