A Texas man is going to prison after threatening to kill a Walmart employee he used to play online video games with, according to federal authorities.

In his plea agreement signed earlier this year, 26-year-old Rogelio Salas, Jr. admitted he called a Walmart store in McCook, Nebraska, on Jan. 8 and 'made a specific threat to kill (a specific employee).' He implied he was in the parking lot with a rifle and explosives.

The Weslaco, Texas, man made more threatening calls that day and on Jan.
