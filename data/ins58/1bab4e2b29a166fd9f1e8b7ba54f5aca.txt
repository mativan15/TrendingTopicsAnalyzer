Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accomplished feats that earlier looked unachievable, be it the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir or the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Ahead of the Himachal Pradesh election, slated for November 12, Mr. Shah was addressing a rally at Sataun in the Sirmaur district.'...no religious place was developed in 75 years. The Modi government built the Ram temple after 500 years.
