The safety of virtual reality spaces has once again been called into question as a 21-year-old researcher's avatar was raped in the metaverse. 
Last week, SumOfUs published a report titled ‘Metaverse: another cesspool of toxic content' which contains details of the researcher's violent encounter in Meta's Horizon World.
The incident reportedly took place as the researcher was studying users' behavior on the platform. Within an hour after she put on her Oculus virtual-reality headset, she says, her avatar was raped in the virtual space.
