A retired Russian general currently serving in the rogue nation's parliament admitted on state TV to targeting Ukrainian civil infrastructure — with the goal of leaving Kyiv 'swimming in s–t.' 
Andrey Gurulev, a retired lieutenant general and sitting member of the lower house of Russia's Duma detailed the shocking strategy on Russia's state-run Channel 1.
'The absence of electricity means no water or refrigerators, the absence of sewers,' he said, commenting on Moscow's recent targeting of power plants in its airstrikes against Ukraine.
