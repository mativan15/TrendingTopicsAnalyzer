The Jalen Brunson sweepstakes started with more confidence from the Mavericks.
Not long after his team was eliminated in the Western Conference Finals, owner Mark Cuban said Brunson, a free agent this summer, 'wants to stay' and noted Dallas holds the financial advantage.
'We can pay him more than anybody,' Cuban told NBA scribe Marc Stein. 'And I think he wants to stay and that's what is most important.'
The Knicks plan to pursue Brunson in free agency, according to sources, but can't outbid the Mavericks, who hold the 25-year-old's Bird Rights and could offer the max.
