LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - England have recalled Kyle Sinckler for next month's testing autumn international series, but fellow prop Will Stuart misses out with injury and centre Henry Slade has been over-looked, coach Eddie Jones confirmed on Monday.Experienced front-rower Sinckler missed the July series in Australia with a back injury and had been replaced in the side in all three tests by Stuart, who was building a head of steam for selection for the Rugby World Cup in France next year.Scrumhalf Raffi Quirke is also back in the 36-player squad after recovering from long-term injury, while tour captain Down Under Courtney Lawes is in contention after recovering from a head knock.
