PETALUMA — A threat of violence downtown prompted the early closure of several bars on Friday evening after a patron threatened to 'shoot up' Jamison's Roaring Donkey in Petaluma.
Petaluma Police responded to a call at 11:39 p.m. at the Roaring Donkey after staff reported that a Hispanic male with tattoos in a white t-shirt had made a statement that he was going to shoot up the establishment.
The suspect had left the area before the police arrived and none of the staff saw the man with a firearm, police said.
