Ever since LIC's mega IPO concluded earlier last month and the shares got listed, its IPO investors have largely been disappointed. The shares of the insurance sector giant had a weak debut on the stock exchanges, with the shares listing more than 8% lower from the issue price on listing day last month. But it's not just LIC alone! Many other PSUs that have gone public through IPOs since 2010 have been trading below their share prices.LIC isn't the first PSU to experience this, although it certainly is the most high-profile amongst all, stated a report by The Print.
