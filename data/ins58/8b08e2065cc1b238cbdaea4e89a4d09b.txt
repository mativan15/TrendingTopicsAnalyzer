An important way to measure management success is to measure inputs vs. outputs. In baseball, this would be salaries vs. wins and on-field success.

By this measure, the Jays are being significantly outperformed by smaller-market teams. The Jays are the 11th highest spenders with a payroll of $141.6 million (U.S.). They were blown out of the playoffs by Seattle with 90 wins, produced by the 21st highest payroll, of $86.
