Collider.com The premise of Romeo and Juliet has been refashioned into many different narratives over the years. Some have left an indelible mark on viewers' imaginations and to this day, stand the test of time. If you've seen Hulu's Rosaline, a take on the classic story by way of adapting Rebecca Serle's novel When You Were Mine, you might notice that Baz Luhrmann's 1996 rendering of the same classic story, Romeo + Juliet is cued up as a suggested watch right after.
