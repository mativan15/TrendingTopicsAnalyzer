Maryland football can breathe a sigh of relief, having avoided a major injury to another quarterback. Taulia Tagovailoa, the gunslinger who was carted off the field in Saturday's 38-33 win against Indiana, is considered a game-time decision this weekend against Northwestern after aggravating his sprained MCL.

After completing a pass in the fourth quarter, an Indiana defensive lineman collided with Tagovailoa's right leg. The quarterback crumpled and grasped at his right knee. The resulting MRI was viewed by team doctors and received a second opinion.
