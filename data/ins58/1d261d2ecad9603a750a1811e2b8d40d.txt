While the world waits for jurors in the Amber Heard/Johnny Depp trial to reach a verdict, some have wondered whether the two actors will be in court when the decision is read.Depp, 58, has sued ex-wife Heard, 36, for $50 million, charging that he was defamed in a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post, in which she said—without naming Depp—that she was a victim of domestic abuse. Depp argued that the piece was obviously referring to him and had damaged his reputation, including his ability to get acting jobs.
