WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) announced she submitted requests for funding for 15 community-based projects in her district. The funding requests total more than $53 million across all 15 projects. These projects span various areas, including housing, arts, sciences, education, the environment, and services for historically underserved communities, including young adults, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and people of color.  'Addressing the needs of my community and improving access to services is one of the greatest honors I have as a member of Congress,' said Congresswoman Jayapal.
