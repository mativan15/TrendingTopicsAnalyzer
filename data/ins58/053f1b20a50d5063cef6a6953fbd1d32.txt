Apple's top of the line MacBook Pro 16-inch and 14-inch models are some of the best laptops the company has ever made — but they're extremely expensive machines that rarely come down in price.
However, Apple has quietly dropped the price on these sought-after laptops with some surprising price cuts.

Spotted by MacRumors, Apple slashed pricing on the refurbished 14 and 16-inch models with both the M1 Pro and Max variants. Specifically, the prices have been reduced by about 15% off the regular pricing for brand-new units.
