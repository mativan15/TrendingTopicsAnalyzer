Meet the Harper family, led by mom-and-dad team, April and Tyron.

The Harpers are looking to land their wellness company Harp Vision a brick-and-mortar location. The business began during COVID-19 lockdowns, when the Harpers, who both live with chronic pain, decided to launch a wellness business, while promoting the message that self-care is not selfish.

Now, their whole family pitches in to help them create and package all-natural soaps, body scrubs, candles and herbal bath teas.
