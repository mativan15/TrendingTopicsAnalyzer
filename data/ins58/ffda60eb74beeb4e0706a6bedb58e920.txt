Evan Russell is available for Tennessee baseball's game against Campbell on Saturday, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation.

Russell had a meeting with UT head team physician Chris Klenck on Saturday morning. He was cleared to resume activity following the meeting.

The Vols catcher was unavailable Friday in UT's 10-0 win against Alabama State. Vols coach Tony Vitello said afterward that Russell was sick that morning.

No. 1 Tennessee (54-7) plays No. 3-seeded Campbell (41-17) at 7 p.
