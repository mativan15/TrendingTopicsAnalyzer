NZ First has kicked-off a 2023 election bid attacking Labour for failing to deliver its 'hallucinogenic objectives', and a prediction the Government will call a 'snap election'. NZ First leader Winston Peters told more than 80 party members gathered at the Rydges hotel in Christchurch on Saturday that his party was the missing ingredient for a successful Labour Government. 'If anybody thinks that the Labour Party is going to survive this next election, they know nothing about politics,' Peters said on Saturday morning.
