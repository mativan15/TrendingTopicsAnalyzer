Cristiano Ronaldo will not play for Manchester United against Chelsea this weekend, and has reportedly been told to train alone after stalking down an Old Trafford tunnel and leaving the stadium before Wednesday's match against Tottenham had finished.

As United wrapped up a 2-0 win, Ronaldo trudged away from the bench in the 90th minute after reportedly refusing to enter as a late-game substitute.
