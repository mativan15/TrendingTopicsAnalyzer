Tractor convoys organised by Groundswell NZ could cause disruption in cities and towns around the country on Thursday. The farming lobby group is calling on farmers to join its 'we're not going to take it' protest against the Government's plan to charge farmers for greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Information on the group's website showed convoys were planned for Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, with protesters aiming to reach city centres by midday. Satellite protests were also planned for more than a dozen smaller centres, including New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Gisborne, Blenheim and Invercargill.
