Takeaways, thoughts from the first half of Mario Cristobal's first season as Miami Hurricanes coach:

▪ The best things that can be said about Cristobal and his staff's work through a disappointing 3-3 start:

1). They did a good job of identifying and landing players in the transfer portal, adding four who have made a genuine impact (Akheem Mesidor, Darrell Jackson, Henry Parrish Jr., Frank Ladson) and others who are emerging (Colbie Young, Daryl Porter Jr.).

Pro Football Focus rates Jackson the 18th-best interior defender in the country this season, and that was an impressive portal hit because his body of work at Maryland was fairly limited (225 snaps as a freshman last season).
