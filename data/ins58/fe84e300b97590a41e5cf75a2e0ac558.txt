Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend insists disciplinary issues played no part in his selection snubs for Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg.Russell has been left out of the squad for the Autumn Nations Series while Jamie Ritchie has replaced Hogg as skipper for games against Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina at BT Murrayfield.Townsend challenged Russell to win his place back through form while claimed being stripped of the captaincy was in Hogg's best interests.Both were among six players who broke team protocol by going out for a drink during the Guinness Six Nations and were rested for the summer tour of South America.
