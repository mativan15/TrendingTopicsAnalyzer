Food delivery drivers in Victoria could soon have drastically improved fair pay and conditions under an ambitious plan by the state government. The election promise was announced by Industrial Relations Minister Tim Pallas on Friday and is intended to promote fairness in dealings between delivery platforms and gig workers. The impacted workers would also have access to a dedicated support service that would be a move towards tech giants treating the contractors as typical employees. This service will be a first port of call in helping workers to resolve disputes, providing comprehensive information and referring workers to federal and state agencies and, in some cases, community legal centres.
