Liz Truss will go down in history as the shortest serving British prime minister, and arguably the most hapless. The irony is that before entering Downing Street she was a political survivor who had lasted eight years in the cabinet under three different prime ministers. Her skill had been to adapt to others' instincts; her downfall was to follow her own.Truss's chance to become prime minister came in July 2022, when Boris Johnson resigned after months of scandals. She pitched herself as a continuity candidate, while setting out a vision of tax cuts that differed sharply from Johnson's own mandate.
