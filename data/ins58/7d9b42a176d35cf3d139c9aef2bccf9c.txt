I know a lot of people who have a goal of retiring early, be it in their late 50s or sometime during the first half of their 60s. Personally, the idea of early retirement doesn't interest me. (Technically, if I have my way, I'll never really retire, but that's a different story.)
When you retire early, you face a number of challenges that can be mitigated by, well, not retiring early. Take healthcare, for example. If you retire before the age of 65, you'll need to figure out coverage, since you won't yet be eligible for Medicare.
