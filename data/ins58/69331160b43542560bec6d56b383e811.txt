THE GOVERNMENT has 43.82 lakh tonnes of buffer stock of various pulses and there is no need to worry, Union Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said on Thursday.
Addressing a press conference, he said the government has sufficient stock of pulses.
'In fact, we are telling the states that you should take pulses from us for schemes like Mid-Day Meal. The Union Cabinet has already decided to provide gram for states' schemes like ICDS at Rs 8 per kg lower than the market price… Instead of buying costly from the market, they can take from us,' Singh said, adding that based on the Indent received from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, 88,600 MT of chana has been allocated to these states till date.
