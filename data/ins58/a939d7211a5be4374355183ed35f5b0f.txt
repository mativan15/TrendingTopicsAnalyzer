I think it's weird but awesome how this site brings me peace and helps me feel relaxed. Been homeless for 3 months now bouncing from hotel to hotel or sleeping in my truck. But opening up and checking my Medium page and seeing all the like minded entrepreneurs with a positive mindset helped allot right now. It's inspiring and motivating, keeps that fire under my ass to keep pushing forward and stay focused on the bigger picture! I was getting upset with myself because I haven't dedicated much time to getting this Online 💵, I've been trapped doing labor work just to secure enough money for a motel room at the end of the night and it gets frustrating knowing I could be making more online but I'd have to wait on payment as opposed to breaking my back all day and barely making pay but being able to collect cash that day just for a spot to shower and sleep.
