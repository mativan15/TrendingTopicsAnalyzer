Jada Pinkett Smith has a level of understanding that many others can only aspire to as she's more than happy for husband Will Smith to ‘enjoy' trips with his ex-wife without her present. 
The Nutty Professor actress has been married to the Fresh Prince of Bel Air star since 1997 but, before that, Will, 54, was married to first wife Sheree Zampino from 1992 to 1995. 
During their three-year marriage, Will and Sheree welcomed son Trey, now 29, and he went on to welcome two more children with Jada, son Jaden, 24, and daughter Willow, 21.
