Mark RobertsonBy Mark RobertsonMay 29, 2022Sergeant David McCoy saw Dan Williams sitting on a curb with his head in his hands when he offered to buy him lunch from Wendy's. "He told me he was hitch hiking from Ohio and going to Monroe, Louisiana to see his family." So Williams ordered a burger under the notion McCoy was paying. Turns out the restaurant took care of the bill. During lunch, McCoy learned Williams had been on the road for days trying to reach his sister. So McCoy and his 3 colleagues pooled their money and bought Williams a bus ticket.
