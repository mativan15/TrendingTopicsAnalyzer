Jeremy Peña hasn't looked like a typical rookie throughout his first season in the big leagues, something that is reflected in a recent honor the Houston Astros shortstop received.

Peña was named one of three finalists 2022 Rawlings Gold Glove Award at the shortstop position on Thursday, joining one player familiar with the Astros, and another that is a proven MLB star. Carlos Correa—who spent seven years in Houston before signing with the Minnesota Twins last offseason— and Boston Red Sox All-Star Xander Bogaerts are the other individuals up for the award.
