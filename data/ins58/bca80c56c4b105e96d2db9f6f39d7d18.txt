Suzan Deison understands the importance of relationships.

As CEO of one of the country's largest women's chambers, she has forged several connections that have helped her garner valuable sponsors and supporters to the Greater Houston Women's Chamber of Commerce.

Deison learned this lesson early on when she worked at her mother's boutique. There she gained crucial experience with customer service and the importance of relationships. Deison said in order to be successful in business, the customer must come first because a focus on human capital as well as valued relationships is the greatest asset to a company.
