(RTTNews) - Asian stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as signs that China's manufacturing slowdown is moderating helped offset fears surrounding high inflation and interest-rate hikes. China's Shanghai Composite index rallied 1.19 percent to finish at 3,186.43 after the latest figures showed another month of contraction in services and manufacturing activity, though at a reduced pace of decline amid easing COVID-19 curbs and signs of support from authorities. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 1.38 percent to 21,415.
