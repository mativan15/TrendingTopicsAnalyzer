DUBLIN, Oct. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The "mRNA Cancer Therapies Patent Landscape 2022" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
For nearly three decades, extensive efforts have been made to increase RNA intracellular stability, translational efficiency and uptake of mRNA. Several players have taken an interest in this issue, such as mRNA technology leaders CureVac, Moderna and BioNTech. These optimizations were achieved by modifying RNA non-coding elements (5' cap, 5'- and 3'- UTRs, 3' poly-A tail) and RNA coding region, and through the development of formulation technologies with specific carriers.
