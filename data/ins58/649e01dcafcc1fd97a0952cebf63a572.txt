Knesset Legal Adviser Sagit Afik on Wednesday told the High Court of Justice that while it would be better for the government to seek full Knesset approval of the impending Lebanon maritime deal, it is not necessarily legally required.

To date, the government's strategy has been to put the deal before the Knesset for debate for two weeks, but then to give a final vote of approval in late October, days before the November 1 election, by a simple cabinet vote.

Multiple NGOs, including Kohelet and Lavi, have filed petitions with the High Court to either block the deal or force a Knesset vote.
