As the nation converts itself into a gigantic royal theme park for the platinum jubilee, I'm busy batting away casting calls for me to play bogeyman on live TV. Producers of right-leaning shows hope I might come on air and perform some on-demand Queen-bashing. 'Would you be interested in debating whether flags are racist,' one asked, 'since Twitter users have compared the display of flags throughout the nation to Nazi Germany in the 1930s?'No doubt they will find someone else willing to play the villain.
