No matter what you think about the saga of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard – whether you believe their relationship was mutually abusive; whether you think Heard lied on the stand; whether believe Depp is wholly innocent of abuse – the verdict in Depp's defamation suit against Heard should outrage and appall you. A Virginia jury found that Heard defamed Depp in an op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post, and that Depp's lawyer defamed Heard when he called her claims of abuse a 'hoax.' But the jury refused to find that Depp himself had defamed Heard, and it awarded him much more money than it awarded her, essentially siding with Depp.
