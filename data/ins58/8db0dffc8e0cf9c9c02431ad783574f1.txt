LUXEMBOURG, October 18, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Eurofins Scientific SE (Paris:ERF):

Record-high 9M 2022 revenues of €5,033m, +2.7% vs. 9M 2021, driven by steady organic growth and acquisitions that more than compensated for the year-on-year decrease in revenues from COVID-19 testing and reagents of approximately €500m.

The Core Business 1 (excluding COVID-19 related testing and reagent revenues) delivered solid revenue organic growth 2 of +6.7% in Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 (adjusted for the small impact from public working days), above its mid-term organic growth objective of 6.
