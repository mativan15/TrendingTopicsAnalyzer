SAN DIEGO —

A Canadian national who lived in Southern California was sentenced to 20 years in U.S. prison on Monday for helping at least a half-dozen Canadians and Americans join Islamic State in Syria in 2013 and 2014 — including the first known American to die fighting for the militant organization.

Abdullahi Ahmed Abdullahi directly funded 'violent acts of terrorism,' including the kidnapping and killing of people in Syria, U.S. Atty. Randy Grossman said in a statement.

Abdullahi acknowledged in a plea agreement that he helped a resident of San Diego, Douglas McAuthur McCain, join IS.
