Sunlands Technology Group (NYSE:STG) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 23% in the last month. But only the myopic could ignore the astounding decline over three years. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 86% in the last three years. So we're relieved for long term holders to see a bit of uplift. Of course the real question is whether the business can sustain a turnaround. We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway.
