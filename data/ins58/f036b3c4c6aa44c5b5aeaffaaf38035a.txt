Canada-based gangster Goldi Brar, a close aide of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, on Sunday took responsibility for the killing of singer-turned-actor-politician Sidhu Moosewala in Punjab. Many aides of the gang have been arrested by Punjab Police in the past.

Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann expressed shock over the killing and appealed to stay calm.

"I am shocked and deeply saddened by the gruesome murder of Sidhu Moosewala. Nobody involved will be spared. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his fans across the world.
