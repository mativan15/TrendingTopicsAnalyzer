Academy Award-nominee Annie Mumolo, Reid Scott, Perry Mattfeld and Jordan Aaron Hall have joined the cast of Prime Video's 'The Idea of You,' starring and produced by Academy Award-winner Anne Hathaway.

The quartet join the cast as production has started on the Amazon Original movie, which is based on the best-selling, contemporary love story of the same name by Robinne Lee.

'The Idea of You' centers on Solène (Hathaway, previously billed as 'Sophie'), a 40-year-old single mom who is 'serendipitously blindsided by a second chance at love' with the lead singer of the world's hottest boy band.
