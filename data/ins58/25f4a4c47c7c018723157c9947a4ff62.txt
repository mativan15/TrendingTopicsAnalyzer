In yet another example of a lack of affordable housing in the Vancouver area, it took winning a lottery prize for a family to purchase their first home. The Pitt Meadows family plans to get into the real estate market after winning thousands of dollars on a scratch ticket. Jordan Marcellus told the B.C. Lottery Corporation that he and his family had been daydreaming about what they'd do with a lottery prize. Two days later, Marcellus found out he'd won $675,000. The prize was from a Set for Life card he was given as a birthday gift.
