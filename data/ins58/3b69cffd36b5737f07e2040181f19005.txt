Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment In my first article covering Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), I implemented a hold recommendation on it and stated investors should wait for a pullback prior to buying the stock. Since my recommendation on April 8th, Ulta did pull back down to the $345-350 range before rebounding following some phenomenal Q1 earnings results.
