A stock market indicator is looking increasingly bullish as investors search for signs that the current sell-off has nearly run its course — potentially marking a green light for renewed buying. Bank of America's Sell Side Indicator, which tracks the average recommended allocation to stocks by US sell-side strategists, dipped to 55.0% in May from a downwardly revised 55.7% in April.The latest reading marks the fifth consecutive monthly decline and puts the SSI closer to a buy signal than a sell signal for time since September 2020, when the S&P 500 began a 30% rally over the next year, according to a note from BofA analysts led by Savita Subramanian.
