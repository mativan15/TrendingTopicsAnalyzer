Antonio Rudiger cannot wait to get started at Real Madrid after his free transfer to the European champions was confirmed.

The 29-year-old turned down a lucrative new contract to stay at Chelsea, instead choosing to join the Spanish side on a four-year deal.

He leaves Stamford Bridge after five years, during which he won the FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.
