Tesla on Wednesday reported a record quarterly profit as sales of its electric cars soared in the three months that ended in September.

The electric carmaker said it made $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.6 billion in the same period a year earlier. It reported revenue of $21.5 billion, up from $13.8 billion.

Tesla said this month that it had produced more than 365,000 cars in the third quarter, a 50 percent increase from a year earlier. Sales also surged but investors have grown increasingly concerned about signs that suggest that demand for the company's luxury cars might be weakening.
