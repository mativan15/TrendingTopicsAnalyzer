LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Insurance premiums are doubling or more for some aviation and marine business particularly exposed to the war in Ukraine, increasing costs for airline and shipping firms, industry sources say.Global commercial insurance premiums rose 11% on average in the first quarter, according to insurance broker Marsh, which said the war was putting upward pressure on rates.But the overall figure masks sharper moves in some sectors, and only covers the first five weeks following the invasion.
