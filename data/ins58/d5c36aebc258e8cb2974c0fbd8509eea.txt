Waterton has purchased the Alta Roosevelt Apartments and has renamed the downtown high-rise The Elle.

The new name honors former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The new name also is a nod to the Chicago Transit Authority's elevated train system commonly referred to as the 'El.'

Chicago-based Waterton closed on the sale on Wednesday.

'Waterton will implement a value-add strategy at The Elle with updates to amenity spaces and common areas,' said Julie Heigel, senior vice president of acquisitions for Waterton.
