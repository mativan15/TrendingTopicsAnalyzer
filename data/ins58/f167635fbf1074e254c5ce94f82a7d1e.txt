A federal jury will resume deliberations Tuesday in the trial of a former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer accused of hiding his political agenda when he gave the FBI 'pure opposition research' purporting to link Donald Trump to Russia in the closing weeks of the 2016 presidential race.
The jury considered the case against Michael Sussmann for about three-and-a-half hours after hearing closing arguments Friday before being released for the long Memorial Day weekend. In the unlikely event they reached a verdict during that time, it would be read first thing Tuesday morning.
