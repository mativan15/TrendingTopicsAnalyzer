The benefit cap should be reconsidered to prevent some of the UK's poorest families missing out on a huge boost to their income, one of its Tory architects has suggested. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader who was the work and pensions secretary when it was introduced, said he would be in favour of looking again at the limit. Benefits payments are set to soar by up to 10 per cent from next April, to keep up with the rate of inflation, the chancellor has confirmed. But more than 120,000 households will not see a penny extra, despite the cost of living crisis, because of the cap, which acts as a ceiling on how much they can receieve from the state.
