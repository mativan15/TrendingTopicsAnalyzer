A multi-billion dollar Chinese tech company pulled out of financing the new smash sequel 'Top Gun: Maverick' because it was worried about angering Communist Party officials due to the film's overtly pro-American theme, according to a report.
In 2019, Tencent Holdings gave a commitment to Paramount Pictures that it would provide financial backing for the film in which Tom Cruise reprises his role as hot-shot naval aviator Lt. Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell.
Tencent was expected to help Paramount market the film to domestic audiences in China, where movie executives hoped that the sequel to the 1986 hit 'Top Gun' would gross some $80 million.
