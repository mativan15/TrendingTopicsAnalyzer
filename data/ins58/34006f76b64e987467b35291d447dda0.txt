BEIJING — Global stocks and U.S. futures rose Monday after Wall Street rebounded from a seven-week string of declines and China eased anti-virus curbs on business activity in Shanghai and Beijing. London and Frankfurt opened higher. Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong advanced. Oil stayed above $110 per barrel. The future for Wall Street's S&P 500 index was 0.9% higher after the benchmark on Friday ended up 6.6% for the week after surging inflation declined. U.S. markets are closed Monday for a holiday.
