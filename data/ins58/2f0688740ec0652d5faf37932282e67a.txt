The Carolina Panthers, even despite firing their head coach five weeks into the season, are not having a fire sale. But that doesn't mean they won't answer the phone.
On Saturday, both ESPN senior writer Adam Schefter and NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported that the team is currently listening to offers on star running back Christian McCaffrey. Schefter even noted that Carolina has already turned down two inquiries for their do-it-all rusher as recently as last week.
