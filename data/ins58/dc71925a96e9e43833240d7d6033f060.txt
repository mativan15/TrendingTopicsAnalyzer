Jun. 4—CHIPPEWA FALLS — Chippewa Falls Police Chief Matt Kelm believes his department picked the perfect time to start purchasing hybrid squad cars.

Four of the five squads predominantly driven by patrol officers are now hybrids, and Kelm's agency has seen a sharp increase in miles per gallon, and a corresponding drop in gallons of gas used.

Kelm said he started researching hybrid squad cars in 2018. In 2020, he asked the Chippewa Falls City Council to purchase two of the vehicles, which arrived in July and August 2021.
