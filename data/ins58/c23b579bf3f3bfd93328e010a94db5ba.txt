Iranian-Americans were planning to demonstrate outside the White House on Sunday in support of growing and escalating protests across Iran that on Saturday saw four killed when a fire broke out at a notorious prison.

The protest comes as others in Berlin, New York, and other cities around the world have occurred in recent weeks since the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died in Iranian police custody after being detained for not wearing a head covering.

Her death sparked both protests in the streets of Tehran and other cities as well as more subtle acts of defiance against the Islamic Republic; women have been seen in public without head coverings in greater numbers, others have cut their hair.
