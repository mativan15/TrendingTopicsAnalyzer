It was a Tuesday night last year and Ray Ferraro was at another game in another city, this one in Toronto for TSN. Ferraro was also calling games for ESPN as part of its return to broadcasting hockey, was the voice of EA Sports's NHL franchise, and more. Ferraro loves his job. He was on TV before he even retired from the league.
