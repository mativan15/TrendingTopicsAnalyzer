Delhi L-G V.K. Saxena on Monday issued a show-cause notice to Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah for allegedly using his public office for political activities, which amounted to 'misuse of public resources', as per an official order by the Planning Department. The action is based on a complaint by BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh that while working as DDCD vice-chairperson, Mr. Shah had acted as the official spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party for political gains, which is in violation of the established procedures.
