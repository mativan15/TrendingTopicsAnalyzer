Oct. 15—Nursing a slim one-goal lead, the Johnstown Tomahawks found themselves in familiar territory in Friday's North American Hockey League game at 1st Summit Arena @ Cambria County War Memorial.

The Philadelphia Rebels had a power-play chance with 33.5 seconds left in an opportunity to force the game into overtime, but the Tomahawks put their foot down to earn their first East Division victory of the season, a 2-1 triumph in front of 1,241 fans.

"Wins always feel good, but it's special when it's the first," said Tomahawks forward Anthony Galante of his team improving to 1-1-2 within the division.
