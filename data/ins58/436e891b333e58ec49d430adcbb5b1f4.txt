A sea of mourners bid a tearful farewell to popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala, who was cremated at his native village in Mansa district on Tuesday afternoon. The body of the 28-year-old singer-politician, who was shot dead on Sunday, was brought to his home in Moosa village amid tight security on Tuesday morning from Mansa civil hospital, where the post-mortem was conducted. Moose Wala's family, including his parents, were inconsolable as they sat beside the body at their home. His mother was seen trying to console her husband as people from Punjab, Rajasthan and Chandigarh among other places queued up in large numbers to get a last glimpse of the singer.
