Oct. 17—Live! at The Battery, the entertainment destination in the heart of The Battery Atlanta, will be home to holiday pop-up bar Tinsel Tavern from Dec. 1-24 from 4 p.m. to close.

The whimsical experience will feature an explosion of tinsel and twinkling lights, holiday-inspired cocktails, small bites and photo moments.

Throughout the season, Tinsel Tavern will host festive themed nights — think Dancing Elves Silent Disco and an Ugly Sweater Party — and Family Day every Sunday from 4 to 7 p.
