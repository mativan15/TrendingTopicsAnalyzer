Bengaluru: The blame game surrounding Congress leader Siddaramaiah's statement that RSS is not an outfit of Indian origin is refusing to die down.
On Saturday, CM Basavaraj Bommai asked Siddaramaiah to clarify whether he is a Dravidian or an Aryan. He was reacting to Siddaramaiah's statement on Friday that Aryans who floated RSS are not real natives of the country, and Dravidians are. 
'Let Siddaramaiah first declare whether he is a Dravidian or an Aryan before I respond to his allegations that RSS is not an outfit of Indian origin,'' Bommai said.
