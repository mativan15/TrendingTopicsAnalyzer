May 28—It's a crowded race for those vying to be the Democratic candidate for Bernalillo County Sheriff.

Among the seven Democrats who have thrown their hats into the ring to be the county's top cop are three who have worked with the current sheriff, Manuel Gonzales — a Democrat. Other candidates include a former sheriff of Quay County, a former state legislator and a 25-year-old who has never served in law enforcement. The seventh candidate, Matthew McCoy, did not respond to the Journal's request for an interview and did not complete a questionnaire.
