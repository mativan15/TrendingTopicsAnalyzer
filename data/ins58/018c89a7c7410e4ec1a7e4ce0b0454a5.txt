Giorgia Meloni could be hours away from becoming Italy's first female prime minister after holding talks with President Sergio Mattarella to discuss the formation of a new government.Far-right Meloni, who heads the nationalist Brothers of Italy party, entered the president's palace on Friday morning alongside her main polticial allies, Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, and Silvio Berlusconi, founder of the conservative Forza Italia party.The three parties formed a successful coalition to win last month's election.
