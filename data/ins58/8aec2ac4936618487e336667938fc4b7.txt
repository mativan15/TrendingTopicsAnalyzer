Nearly 60 years after a mile-long interstate uprooted a pair of bustling Black neighborhoods in Detroit, leaders plan to turn part of the highway into a lower-speed boulevard in a $300 million project that will reconnect those neighborhoods and cut down on highway pollution. Last month, the Biden administration awarded Michigan $104.6 million in grant funding from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law to help with the project.Black Bottom was a predominantly Black neighborhood in the city and the adjacent Paradise Valley served as the town's entertainment and business district, boasting jazz clubs and several other Black-owned businesses.
