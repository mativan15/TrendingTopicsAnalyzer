It's a fierce battle caught on camera - between the fatally poisonous cobra and the lightning quick grey mongoose. The video shared on the Instagram page wildanimalia shows a Indian grey mongoose engaged in a long duel with a cobra in a waterlogged field. The cobra is a highly venomous snake, and has a quick strike. And the grey mongoose is a compulsive snake-catcher with sharp reflexes that can help weave and out of the striking range of a cobra.

The fight in the muddy waters of the open field happens exactly the way the mongoose wants it.
