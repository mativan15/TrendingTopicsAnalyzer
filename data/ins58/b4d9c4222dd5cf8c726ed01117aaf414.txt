Jake Cronenworth hit the tiebreaking, two-run single with two outs in the 7th inning when they scored five runs to take the lead. The Padres beat the 111-regular season win Dodgers in front of a raucous sellout crowd of 45,139 at Petco Park in a game that was delated by rare San Diego rain showers. The Padres will host the Philadelphia Phillies in Games 1 and 2 of an all-wild card NLCS on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves 8-3 to win their NLDS in four games. The game was delayed 31 minutes at the start by rain, which returned in the eighth inning and prompted a short delay while the grounds crew worked on the mound.
