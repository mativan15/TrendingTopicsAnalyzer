A woman named Emma took to social media earlier this month to share that she was weaning her 2-year-old son off breastfeeding. She intended for the post to be lighthearted; however, it struck a nerve with dozens of commenters who said the toddler should've been weaned "over a year ago."Rather than bend to the pressure, Emma addressed her critics in a TikTok video, writing: "[It's] 2022. Let's educate ourselves & NORMALIZE natural term breastfeeding!!!" It has amassed over 200,000 views and more than 1,800 comments.
