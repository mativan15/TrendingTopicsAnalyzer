While battling through pandemic-related challenges, two Topeka organizations last year received grants from A Community Thrives, a $2.3 million initiative from The Topeka Capital-Journal's parent company, Gannett.

In 2021, Helping Hands Humane Society received $20,000 to go toward a new parvovirus isolation ward and spay-neuter clinic. The Topeka Genealogical Society was awarded for $5,000 to elevate its technology.
