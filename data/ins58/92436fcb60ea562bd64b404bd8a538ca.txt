A PLASTIC surgery addict says she feels "dehumanised" after she claims she was kicked off a flight, because of her 10kg breasts.
Social media star Mary Magdalene, known for her love of plastic surgeries, has spent over £120,000 on procedures including boob jobs, a Brazilian butt lift, fat transfers and nose jobs.

She was allegedly kicked off the plane for wearing headphones and not listening to instructions but she seems to think the reason was her appearance- specifically her 38J sized breasts.
