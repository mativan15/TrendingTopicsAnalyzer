The images of Alexia Putellas clutching the Ballon d'Or trophy for the second successive year, becoming the first female player to do so since the introduction of the women's award in 2018, were poignant.Poignant first because Putellas was standing there with the ACL injury that crushed her Euro 2022 dream and will keep her out for much of this season. And poignant also because, although injury meant she was not a signatory of the statement from 15 Spain players that said the national team environment was affecting their emotional state and health, she is the talisman of the team, has expressed support for her teammates and was clutching the trophy for them as much as for herself.
