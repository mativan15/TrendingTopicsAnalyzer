CUHRIG/E+ via Getty Images In the first quarter of 2022, Vale's (NYSE:VALE) net debt increased by US$3Bn to partially fund the US$5.3Bn shareholder returns. Yet, this did not stop the company from announcing a massive share buyback program which should reduce the number of outstanding shares by 10 percent. With iron ore prices on a decline and this buyback program in place, the dividend will likely be lowered. Investors should expect to be exposed to the cyclical nature of this company and accept lower returns in the short term.
