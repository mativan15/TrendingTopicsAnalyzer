A suburban industrial center has been sold to a local real estate investment company for $1.5 million.

Hard Hat Environmental Services LLC sold the 26,000-square-foot Carnegie Street Business Center, located at 1225 Carnegie St. in Rolling Meadows, to CSJ Investments LLC to take advantage of high demand for incubator-style units, said Peter Doughty of Marcus & Millichap Inc., who represented the seller.

Doughty said such spaces are desirable because they are easy to manage.

'This offering was on market for one week with multiple offers procured and was a great example of the amount of capital that is still chasing incubator-style industrial deals,' he said.
