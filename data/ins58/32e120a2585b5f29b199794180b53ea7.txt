Shares of WWE, the company behind Smackdown and WrestleMania, haven't traded at these levels since summer 2019. The wrestling and media company is the subject of acquisition rumors. Vince McMahon retired as CEO earlier this year after revelations that he made $20 million in unrecorded payments to accusers and Donald Trump's foundation. World Wrestling Entertainment is defying broader market trends this year. The company's stock is up more than 50% in 2022, hitting a 52-week high Monday, and trading at levels it hasn't seen since summer 2019.
