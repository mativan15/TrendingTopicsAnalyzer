During the pandemic, I have seen big problems turn into huge problems. A lot of people lost their jobs and had no way to pay the rent; others who got government assistance did not use it for necessary things.

Also, the amount of money workers get paid compared to what they pay in rent is ridiculous. These big companies make a lot off your work, and they expect you to go above and beyond. They say they care so much about their workers, but they keep many of them living paycheck to paycheck, sometimes not eating because the kids come first.
