The global pre-filled syringe market is set to expand by 12 percent annually over the next decade because of rising risk of HIV and hepatitis contraction through used needles.

Whether on accident or as a result of crime, the use of used syringes has added to the confirmed cases of HIV and hepatitis. For example, a doctor in Pakistan used HIV-infected needles on around 900 healthy children under 12, with hundreds becoming infected.

It is also estimated that nearly 385,000 health care workers accidentally re-use needles every year.
