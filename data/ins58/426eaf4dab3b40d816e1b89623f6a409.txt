Jun. 1—The search by ground and air concluded in Leon County where convicted murderer Gonzalo Artemio Lopez, 46, escaped from a prison transport bus and stabbed the driver last month as authorities said the hunt for him would expand, however, new information has been slow in coming.

On May 12, Lopez escaped from a Texas Department of Criminal Justice transport bus on State Highway 7 near Centerville after assaulting a correctional officer.

Lopez, from the Rio Grande Valley, is affiliated with the Mexican Mafia.
