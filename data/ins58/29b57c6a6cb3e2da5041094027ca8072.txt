A mum decided to ‘self disconnect' the gas supply to her home due to surging energy prices, an anti-poverty charity has claimed.
Kirsty McKechnie, from Child Poverty in Action Group Scotland, said the single mum was still being charged despite making the decision to disconnect her gas last year.
She told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ‘We've already had one parent contact one of the advice agencies who had disconnected, self-disconnected, her gas over a year ago because she was struggling with the prices.
