One of the biggest matches in AEW history may be in jeopardy. Just 24 hours before MJF vs. Wardlow at AEW Double or Nothing, MJF reportedly no-showed an AEW Meet and Greet. MJF straight-up ghosted AEW, as his absence was not planned and nobody from the company was able to contact him. Though a flight was reportedly booked for MJF late Saturday night, as of this writing it is not known whether MJF boarded the plane. MJF's status for AEW Double or Nothing remains uncertain.
