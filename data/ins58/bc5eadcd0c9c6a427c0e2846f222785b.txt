In a redesigned U.S. quarter released in 2022, Founding Father and first U.S. President George Washington faces the opposite direction from that in the previous design. In May 2022, social media users shared images that supposedly showed the face of the first U.S. President, George Washington, facing right — not left — on the back of a new quarter coin released in 2022. Many of these social media posts stated that Washington was now facing away from the coin's inscription 'In God We Trust,' and that the alleged change revealed a change in modern society's religious views.
