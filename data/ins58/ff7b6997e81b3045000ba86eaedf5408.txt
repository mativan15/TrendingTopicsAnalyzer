The Malahat First Nation has applied to the province to expand the quarry and foreshore access at its Bamberton mine site, and some people living nearby are raising concerns. The nation is asking the province to expand the active mine site 30 per cent, from almost 40 hectares to just over 50. The proposed expansion would allow the realignment of the mine's boundaries to make the quarry more efficient for production in the future. The Malahat Nation's chief administrative officer (CAO) says the majority of the mine's expansion would be inland and north of the current mine site and not towards the waters of the Saanich Inlet.
