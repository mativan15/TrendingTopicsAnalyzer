The federal government may move to tear down Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and replace it with a new campus, a state senator said Sunday.

Texas State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat who represents Uvalde, said President Joe Biden told him the White House was 'going to look to raze that school, build a new one.' Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Uvalde on Sunday to grieve with the families impacted after a gunman shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at the school on Tuesday.
