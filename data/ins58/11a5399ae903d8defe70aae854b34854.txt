The new Quinns Rock lookout and beach access was made of wood, but now is made from fibre-reinforced plastic.

A new access point and observation platform at a popular beach in Perth's northern suburbs has undergone an upgrade with an almost-$400,000 price tag, which has sparked an outcry from residents.

The demolition and removal of the original structure at the Quinns Beach Mary Street access point in Quinns Rock was recommended after an assessment of its safety, and a new one was designed and manufactured.
