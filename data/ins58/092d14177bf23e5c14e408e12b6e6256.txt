Travis Scott has settled his first Astroworld lawsuit nearly one year on from the tragedy, it has been claimed.
Last November, 10 people were killed in a deadly crowd surge at the Sicko Mode rapper's festival, held in Texas.
Many more were left injured in the crush, with hundreds of lawsuits filed against the dad-of-two, as well as Live Nation and others involved in the event.
The 31-year-old – real name Jacques Webster – reportedly reached a settlement with one victim's family, after the ordeal.
