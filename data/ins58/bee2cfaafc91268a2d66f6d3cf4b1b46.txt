A leading ad filmmaker has now spilt the beans to ETimes about a very controversial gutkha ad where Ajay Devgn and Shah Rukh Khan were recently joined by Akshay Kumar. The allegedly cancerous by-product was earlier endorsed by Devgn and Khan, in their only appearance together. 'Then they wanted to bring in a third A-lister, this time a much younger superstar. So they offered Kartik Aaryan close to Rs 15 crores to join Devgn and SRK. Kartik's response was an absolute no. Only then did the makers go to Akshay Kumar,' the ad guru informed us.
