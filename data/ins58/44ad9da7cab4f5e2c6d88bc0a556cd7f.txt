Liz Truss last Friday sacked her chancellor because he could not run the economy; on Wednesday she lost her home secretary, ostensibly because she could not keep secrets. By the end of another chaotic day, the prime minister's government was on life support.The sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor followed the financial market turmoil he and Truss unleashed through their rightwing 'mini' Budget focused on £45 billion (€52 billion) of unfunded tax cuts. The ousting of Suella Braverman as home secretary laid bare the bitterness now running through the heart of the Conservative party.
