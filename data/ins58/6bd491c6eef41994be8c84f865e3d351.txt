Let me lay it out for you, once and for all: Royalty and TV do not mix.

There is no shortage of horribly perfect examples here. What shall we choose from? The footage that emerged of the Queen Mother, Princess Elizabeth and the man who would become Edward VIII doing the Nazi salute? The Prince Philip-helmed 1969 doco that corrosively stripped away royal magic? The 1981 engagement interview between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer when he infamously quipped 'whatever love means' or, a decade later, their his'n'hers confessions of adultery on camera?(Do you want to mention 1987's It's A Royal Knockout or shall I? It later emerged that Andrew had tried to push Meatloaf into a moat only for the singer to grab the prince and yell, 'I don't give a s**t who you are.
