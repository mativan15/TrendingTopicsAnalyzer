The Deputy Governor of Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, has questioned whether UK interest rates need to rise as much as markets predict. In a speech at Imperial College Business School on Thursday 20 October, Dr. Ben Broadbent said: "Whether official interest rates have to rise by quite as much as currently priced in financial markets remains to be seen." Dr. Broadbent was outlining the inflationary consequences of real shocks to an audience of staff, students and alumni at the Business School.
