U.K. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt on Monday reversed most of an economic package announced by the government just weeks ago, including a planned cut to income tax.In a bid to soothe turbulent financial markets, Hunt said he was scrapping 'almost all' the tax cuts announced last month and signaled public spending cuts are on the way. He also scaled back a cap on energy prices designed to help households pay their bills. It will now be reviewed in April rather than lasting two years.'It is a deeply held Conservative value — a value that I share — that people should keep more of the money that they earn,' Hunt said.
