Grotto Geyser in Yellowstone National Park Yellowstone National Park under public domain Most visitors to Yellowstone National Park are interested in what they can see—geysers like Old Faithful that spew superheated water and steam into the air. But scientists are more intrigued by what they can't see: the underfoot, underground plumbing system that makes all these dramatic eruptions possible. Now, they have a much clearer picture of what's happening below Yellowstone's surface. Using a helicopter equipped with a special electromagnetic instrument, researchers mapped the Earth's composition as far as 8,200 feet—about a mile and a half—underground at the country's first national park, according to a paper published in March in the journal Nature.
