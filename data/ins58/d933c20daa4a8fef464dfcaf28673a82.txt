RiverNorthPhotography Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) just reported its third-quarter earnings. The Columbus, Ohio, based regional bank is the only bank holding of my dividend growth portfolio. I bought the bank in 2020 after the pandemic sell-off as it was part of a project I was working on back then, which was focused on buying undervalued companies. I never sold the stock because I fell in love with its ability to deliver long-term shareholder value through steadily rising dividends and a juicy yield.
