A former official for the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, will act as a liaison between a Kansas chamber of commerce and Panasonic Corp., which plans a $4 billion, 4,000-job electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in De Soto.

Rob Richardson was chosen as the Panasonic opportunities manager by the Lawrence-Douglas County Economic Development Council and Chamber of Commerce.

'We believe it is essential to have a point person specifically tasked with furthering our interests in the many facets of the Panasonic development process," said Bonnie Lowe, CEO of the chamber and EDC.
