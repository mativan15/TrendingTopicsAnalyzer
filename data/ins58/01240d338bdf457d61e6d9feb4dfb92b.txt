Caesars Entertainment and real estate investment trust SL Green announced a pitch Thursday to bring a casino to Times Square.

The proposal aims to secure one of the three full-service casino licenses allocated to the New York City area by state officials in April.

The 100% private-funding plan involves renovating the 1515 Broadway building owned by SL Green and turning it into Caesars Palace Times Square.

In addition to being a casino, it would also include a theater to accommodate performances of the musical 'The Lion King,' which is currently based in the Minskoff Theatre at 1515 Broadway.
