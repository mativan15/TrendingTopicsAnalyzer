Ten miles or a 15-minute train journey south of Manchester city centre is Britain's only airport other than Heathrow to have two working runways, which, if fully utilised, could lead to it eclipsing Gatwick and Stansted, the country's second and third largest hubs. A new-look terminal will help it on its way — but the story of its impending growth is not so much about aircraft as it is about trains.Manchester airport sits in a company called MAG, which also operates Stansted and East Midlands airports and which itself is owned by Manchester city council and its nine surrounding boroughs, plus Australian pension money in IFM Global Infrastructure.
