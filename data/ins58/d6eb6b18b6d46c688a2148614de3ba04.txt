Nearly 10 months after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached assets worth Rs 5.73 crore of NCP leader Eknath Khadse, his wife Mandakini Khadse and son-in-law Girish Chaudhri, in connection with a money laundering case, the central agency issued an eviction notice instructing him to vacate all the properties that were attached last year. The agency has been investigating Khadse and Chaudhri for buying land in Pune's Bhosari village for Rs 3.75 crore when its actual value was over Rs 31 crore. The ED has alleged that the land was purchased in Chaudhri's name and money for the deal was allegedly routed through five shell companies.
