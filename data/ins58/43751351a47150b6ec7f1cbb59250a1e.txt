John R. Bryson, Professor of Enterprise and Economic Geography, Birmingham Business School, told Express.co.uk: 'The Kremlin's goal for its special military operation in Ukraine are unclear. The initial invasion was justified by Vladimir Putin's belief that the Russians and the Ukrainians were one and the same people.'After the collapse of the USSR, Russian nation-building switched to a focus on forming a single Russian nation constructed around Russian language and culture.'President Putin has argued for many years that Ukraine is inextricably linked with Russia, and the two countries have undeniable historical ties that should make them united as one.
