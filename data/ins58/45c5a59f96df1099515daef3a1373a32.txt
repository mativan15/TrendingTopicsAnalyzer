Stocks climbed after the S&P 500 breached a technical level that has triggered rallies in the past, with risk appetite improving as more of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's unfunded tax cuts were reversed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 650 points, or 2.21%. The S&P 500 jumped 2.75%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 3.33%.

Bank of America Corp. gained after reporting its highest quarterly net interest income in at least a decade. Treasury yields dropped with the dollar, while pound and UK bonds jumped.
