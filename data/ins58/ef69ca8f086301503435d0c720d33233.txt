As much as 56% of the dedicated freight corridors have been commissioned, according to the latest progress report on the crucial railway lines. Also, more than 99% of the land required for the eastern and western corridors of the project has been acquired, said RK Jain, managing director of Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL). "Only small patches of land on the Vaitrana-Mumbai link need to be cleared to complete the entire land acquisition for the existing freight corridors," Jain told ET, adding that this was the only section where commissioning would spill over to 2024.
