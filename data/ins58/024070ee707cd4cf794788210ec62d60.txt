A Cambridge couple, who lost their cat Ozzy, said they were tricked into believing he was found. On May 22 the two-year-old Bengal cat snuck out of their home in the middle of the night. Ozzy's owners, Amanda Casella and Brandon Duxbury, said he's mostly an indoor cat and rarely ventures outdoors. "He's never been unsupervised outside," she explained. "He's always been with us and only in our backyard." The couple noticed Ozzy was missing the following morning. They began canvassing the neighbourhood every day, putting up posters and asking for the public's help on social media groups.
