The Coalition is not considering placing a cap on the number of refugees arriving into Ireland, but has warned those fleeing war that they may be left homeless as the State has run out of space.Officials in the Department of Children are this weekend finalising plans to use a building in Dublin Airport to process any new arrivals, with the facility expected to be ready by Monday. This comes after the Government announced a pause on arrivals to the Citywest reception facility in Dublin as it had reached capacity.
