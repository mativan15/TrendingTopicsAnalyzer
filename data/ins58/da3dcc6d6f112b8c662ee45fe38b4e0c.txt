Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has rejected claims that he inflamed tensions at Anfield on Sunday and said he was ‘misunderstood' when making comments about the spending power of Manchester City, Newcastle United and Paris St-Germain.
Klopp irked City and Newcastle by suggesting they ‘can do what they want financially'. Eddie Howe followed City by taking exception to the Liverpool manager's comments on Tuesday, saying Klopp did not know what he was talking about.
The Liverpool coach stood by his remarks, suggesting he was making an observation rather than criticism.
