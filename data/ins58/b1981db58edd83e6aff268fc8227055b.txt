Shutterstock.comRepresentative ImageNEW DELHI: After reported a soft Q2 September quarter earnings, investors were left disappointed with lower-than-expected growth in revenue and margin pangs. The consistent compounder stock, which has been under pressure in the last few months amid a spike in crude oil rates and entry of new players, fell almost 2% to hit day's low at Rs 3,080.05 on BSE on Friday. 'Results were well below estimates as realizations and gross margins were severely impacted, primarily led by product mix deterioration caused by (a) slower growth in high margin urban sales unlike the preceding couple of quarters and (b) the adverse impact of downtrading,' domestic brokerage said.
