Actress Selma Blair has announced her departure from the US competition show Dancing With The Stars over health concerns related to multiple sclerosis (MS). On Monday night's episode, the star tearfully told her competition partner Sasha Farber that she would have to bow out of the show, but was determined to perform one last ballroom dance before leaving.
Diagnosed with the lifelong condition that affects the brain and nerves in 2018, the 50-year-old said it was her most memorable year, having been ill for "so many years" before her diagnosis.
