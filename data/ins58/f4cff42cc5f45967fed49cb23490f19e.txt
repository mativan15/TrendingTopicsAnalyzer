Elon Musk's foray into the Russia-Ukraine war is being guided by Putin, according to Fiona Hill.

The Russia expert told Politico that Putin frequently uses prominent people as intermediaries.

"Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role," Hill said.

Elon Musk's recent efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have almost certainly been puppeteered by Vladimir Putin, according to top Russia expert Fiona Hill.
