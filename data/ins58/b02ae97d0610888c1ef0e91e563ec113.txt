Mayor Adams railed against 'professional naysayers' in Albany on Wednesday for delivering a legislative proposal he claims will 'water down' his authority over city schools.Adams made the comments at a Manhattan breakfast for city business leaders, in reference to a bill introduced Tuesday in Albany to extend mayoral control of city schools by two years, instead of the four Adams asked for, and dilutes mayoral influence on the oversight panel that monitors the city Education Department.'If you water it down, if you take away the tools that we need, if you don't give us the opportunity to do so then we are failing our children again,' Adams said.
