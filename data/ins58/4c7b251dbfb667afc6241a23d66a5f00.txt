The by-election to Munugode assembly constituency in Telangana's Nalgonda district, scheduled to be held on November 3, may as well turn out to be the costliest by-election ever witnessed in the state, if one were to go by the money being splurged by the contestants of three major political parties: Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress.The by-election, necessitated by the resignation of sitting MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy, who defected from the Congress to the BJP, has become a matter of prestige for all the three parties.
