Every journalist who covered Hollywood in the Golden Era that stretched roughly from Risky Business (1983) through Top Gun: Maverick (now) has had a Tom Cruise moment. I had mine in 2002.
My father had just died. It was a rough death, not quick, and as I was driving back for the last time from attending him in Sacramento, I made myself a promise: I would be at peace with everyone for a while. No fighting. No arguments. What anyone asked, insofar as I could, I would just do.
As luck would have it, the first test occurred somewhere around Bakersfield.
