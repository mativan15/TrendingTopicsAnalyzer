Netflix has given Anishinaabe filmmaker Jaime Wescoup $25,000 in film development financing to mark the U.S. video streamer passing the milestone of 1000 creators completing Netflix-supported film training programs in Canada. 'There's no one telling these stories. And these stories need to be told,' Wescoup tells The Hollywood Reporter about his documentary in the works about two female First Nations reserve chiefs — chief Kyra Wilson of Long Plain First Nation and chief Angela Levasseur of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation.
