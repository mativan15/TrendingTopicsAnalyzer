Pharr Mill Brewing Co. is now dishing up hickory-smoked barbecue in Concord.

The Harrisburg brewery has expanded its footprint with a second taproom and its first bricks-and-mortar restaurant. Pharr Mill Brewing & BBQ offers everything from Carolina-style pulled pork to Texas-inspired brisket.

Owner Alston Richardson says expansion — and a permanent restaurant — was a natural next chapter.

Pharr opened its first 1,800-square-foot brewery in Harrisburg in March 2019. It wasn't long before Richardson realized food was key to boosting the brewery's bottom line and attracting customers.
