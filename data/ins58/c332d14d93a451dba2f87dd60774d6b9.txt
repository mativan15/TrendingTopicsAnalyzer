Holidaymakers hoping to fly over the Bank Holiday weekend should only take cabin bags to avoid delays as the chaos continues at UK airports, a travel union boss has said.Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB union, suggested check-in queues are one of the main hold-ups at airports and that by avoiding big suitcases passengers have a better chance of taking off on time.
"If people can check in online and do not take bags, that limits the disruption," he said."It's not a magic bullet, but it's one less thing to worry about and it does reduce the chance of there being problems.
