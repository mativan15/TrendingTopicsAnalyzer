US officials have threatened to limit defence cooperation with Britain in a row about the takeover of a supplier of secret tech to nuclear submarines.
Intelligence sources said that Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, will jeopardise future partnerships between the two countries if he blocks the £2.6bn sale of Ultra Electronics to Boston-based private equity business Advent International.
They accused Mr Kwarteng of unfairly discriminating against US companies after he ordered a national security investigation into the takeover of Ultra, which makes military communications equipment including highly classified kit for Trident nuclear submarines.
