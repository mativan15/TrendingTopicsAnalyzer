The Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), Ukraine's military intelligence service, claimed last Tuesday in a post on its official website that it had obtained evidence that invading Russian forces are using microchips made in the United States.

According to the post, US-made electronics were found in Russian Pantsir air defense systems, Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters and Kh-101 cruise missiles.

According to Howard Altman of The War Zone, who received component lists from the GUR, Ukrainians found microchips manufactured by AMD, Rochester Electronics, Texas Instruments and Linear Technology in a Pantsir air defense system and at least 35 additional US-made chips were found in a Kh-101 cruise missile.
