Mr Cleverly claimed that Mr Robinson's criticisms were not valid as other countries around the world were experiencing higher levels of inflation and energy pricing. The BBC host went on to explain what the Bank of England had been saying this week about the 30-year inflation gilt and the mini-budget correlation. The Foreign Secretary claimed that inflation in the British economy would be higher if the Government had not stepped in and intervened when that had done, citing a report from the BBC itself as making a similar assessment.
