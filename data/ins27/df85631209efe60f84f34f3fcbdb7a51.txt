SISTER, SISTER: 'You are the sister I've always wanted, and I am so lucky to be able to play a sister on ‘Euphoria' with you and for you to be able to be my best friend,' Sydney Sweeney told Maude Apatow. 'It's such an amazing feeling, because I always had a hard time having girlfriends. You're just everything to me.'

Apatow had introduced her costar onstage at Elle's Women in Hollywood Celebration dinner. Sweeney was among eight women being honored, the others being Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Yeoh, Ariana DeBose, Zoë Kravitz (who did not attend), Anne Hathaway, Issa Rae and Olivia Wilde.
