Currently the price cap is reviewed twice a year, in April and October. It's usually announced two months before what the cap will be. 
That means that prices will change again on October 1. 
At present, industry analysts and Ofgem have predicted that bills will rise by £1,971 a year to £2,800 a year on average.
