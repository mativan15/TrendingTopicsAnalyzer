In 2013, Chris Tarbell became part of one of the most notorious episodes in Bitcoin history when he led an FBI investigation that helped identify and arrest Dread Pirate Roberts, the mastermind behind the notorious online drug and weapons marketplace Silk Road. The investigation, described in Nick Bilton's excellent American Kingpin, involved tracing and seizing huge amounts of crypto now worth billions of dollars. Today, Tarbell is still working with crypto but in a new capacity. He and cryptographer Matt Edman, who helped locate and extract thousands of Bitcoins from the Dread Pirate's wallet, have just launched a company called Naxo that helps law enforcement, law firms, and others locate missing crypto.
