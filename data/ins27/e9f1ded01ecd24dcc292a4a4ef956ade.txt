'I support her 100 percent and I'd like to think I can speak on behalf of most of the athletes,' she added. 'I've reached out to her, just asking if there is anything we can do to help, to support. I know that she's fighting a really hard battle and doing what she can to represent the women in her country.'

Raboutou said she had not received a reply.

Rekabi, 33, competed Sunday without her headscarf, or hijab, in Seoul during the finals of the International Federation of Sport Climbing's Asia Championship.
