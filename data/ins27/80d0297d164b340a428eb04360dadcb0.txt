Pastor and activist John Amanchukwu torched a North Carolina school board's equity initiative during a meeting earlier this month, arguing that the district's priorities are misplaced as he pointed to declining performance across the spectrum."We're wasting taxpayer dollars putting money toward this diversity office that's not benefiting those who need it the most," he said. Amanchukwu slammed the office by pointing to a majority of Wake County's Black students in grades 3 through 8 who are "not proficient" in mathematics and alluding to a bigger problem, citing statistics from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
