Thankfully, her husband had arrived by the time Ware had brought out the evening's extra special guest: fellow disco diva Kylie Minogue. The pair performed their euphoric hit Kiss of Life from Minogue's own 2020 album Disco, before Ware surprised Minogue – who had turned 54 that day – with a rendition of Happy Birthday and an enormous cake. It was a surreal moment, and Ware – grinning from ear to ear as she hugged her friend – couldn't have looked happier. 
What's Your Pleasure? seems to be a sparkling new era for Ware, whom most will know from confessional pop songs such as Say You Love Me, the breakthrough hit she made with Ed Sheeran in 2014.
