DUBLIN – Dublin continues to experience a surge in economic activity, and as one of the state's fastest-growing cities, many eyes are on its Nov 8. municipal race.
Three candidates are running for the two City Council positions up for election, including incumbent Vice Mayor Jean Josey.
Josey, a mother of two, has lived in Dublin since 2000 and runs the tutoring program at Dublin High School. Before serving as a council member, she served on the city's Fiscal Sustainability Task Force and was named Dublin Citizen of the Year.
