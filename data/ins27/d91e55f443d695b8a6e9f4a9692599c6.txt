(RTTNews) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged New York-based SCWorx Corp. (WORX) and its former Chief Executive Officer, Marc Schessel, with making false and misleading statements about the company's plans to distribute COVID-19 rapid test kits in April 2020. SCWorx has agreed to settle the SEC's charges and will pay a $125,000 civil penalty. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Schessel. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, alleged that Schessel and SCWorx issued a press release on April 13, 2020, falsely stating that SCWorx had a "committed purchase order" from a purported buyer to purchase two million COVID-19 rapid test kits.
