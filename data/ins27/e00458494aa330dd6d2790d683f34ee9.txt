Chelsea defender Reece James could discover his World Cup fate over the weekend as he prepares to find out the extent of his damaged knee ligament.

James will now see a specialist in the next 24 hours to assess the situation and consider his options. There are fears the player may need surgery, which could rule the 22-year-old out of the World Cup in Qatar.

The Blues wing-back picked up the injury during a 2-0 victory over AC Milan in the Champions League earlier this week.
