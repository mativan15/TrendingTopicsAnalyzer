Justin Sullivan Nike (NYSE:NKE) shares slid about 2% in a matter of minutes, dipping into the red, after Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) offered a pessimistic preliminary Q3 report. The German footwear and apparel giant warned of lighter full-year revenue than previously forecast and tighter margins. Greater China was cited as a particular sore spot with sales declining at a 'strong double-digit rate' during the third quarter. 'The company's new outlook takes into account a further deterioration of traffic trends in Greater China as well as a significant inventory build-up as a result of lower consumer demand in major Western markets since the beginning of September, which is expected to lead to higher promotional activity during the remainder of the year,' Adidas said.
