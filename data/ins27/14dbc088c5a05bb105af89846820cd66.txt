THE GUJARAT government told the Supreme Court on Monday that it decided to release the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case as they had 'completed 14 years and above in prison… their behaviour was found to be good' and the Centre had also 'conveyed (its) concurrence/ approval'.
In an affidavit filed in response to the petitions challenging the remission granted to the prisoners, the state also said that the 'Superintendent of Police, CBI, Special Crime Branch, Mumbai' and 'the Special Civil Judge (CBI), City Civil and Sessions Court, Greater Bombay', had, in March last year, opposed the early release of the prisoners.
