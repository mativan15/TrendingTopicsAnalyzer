Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is holding talks with counterparts from 10 Pacific island nations in Fiji as part of a diplomatic tour that has stirred deep Western concern.
The meeting on Monday will discuss proposals for Beijing to radically increase its involvement in the security, economy and politics of the South Pacific.
With borders closed across the region because of the COVID-19 pandemic, most foreign ministers are attending the Fiji meeting by video link. In several Pacific countries, the foreign minister is also prime minister.
