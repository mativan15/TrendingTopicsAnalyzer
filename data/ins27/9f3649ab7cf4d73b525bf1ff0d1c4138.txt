There are two great paradoxes about the Scottish government's drive for independence.First is the speed, allowing for the SNP position that undoing the Act of Union it is about 300 years overdue. Nicola Sturgeon's rhetoric is full of urgency about regaining sovereignty and freedom, and the next independence referendum will be held a year from today in only a year's time, on 19 October 2023. Few think a lawful plebiscite can be held then; Ms Sturgeon only offers an attempt to convert 'a' future election in Scotland into a de facto referendum, which would not be the same thing.
