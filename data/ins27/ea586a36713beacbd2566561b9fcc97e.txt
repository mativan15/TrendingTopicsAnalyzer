An officer who was working outside Cameo nightclub the night of the worst mass shooting in the city's history pleaded guilty to submitting false tax returns Wednesday.

Officer Diondre Winstead, a 17-year veteran of the Cincinnati Police Department, is now the third officer to plead guilty to failing to report tens of thousands of dollars earned working off-duty details.

At a hearing in federal court in Cincinnati, Winstead admitted filing three years of false tax returns and failing to report more than $50,000 in income earned from off-duty details.
