As GloRilla continues to shine in the limelight through hits like 'Blessed' and 'Tomorrow 2,' the 23-year-old rapper is engaging in a back-and-forth related to her breakout hit: 'F.N.F. (Let's Go).'

On Sunday evening, GloRilla (real name Gloria Hallelujah Woods) was slapped with some allegations by Hitkidd, the producer behind the 'Song of the Summer.'

Hitkidd specifically accused GloRilla and CMG Records — the record company she's signed to, which is owned by Yo Gotti — of essentially trying to go behind his back to secure the rights to the track.
