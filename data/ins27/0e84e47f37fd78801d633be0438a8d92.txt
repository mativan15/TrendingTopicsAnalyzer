Over the weekend, in a shocking series of videos shared on Twitter, Hellena Taylor, Bayonetta's original voice actor, shared that the reason she did not return for Bayonetta 3 was because of an 'insulting' offer for the role. As a result, she's asking fans to boycott the game, which releases on October 28th. On October 15th, the voice actor posted three videos on Twitter sharing her story, detailing her years of experience and training. 'And what did they think this was worth?' she said in the video.
