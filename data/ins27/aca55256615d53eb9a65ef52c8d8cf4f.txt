A Meta Platforms Inc. executive who played a key role in buying Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus is leaving the company after almost 12 years.

Amin Zoufonoun said in a post on Facebook Wednesday that he needs a break from his job as vice president of corporate development at Menlo Park-based Meta.

"Strategic technology deal work is pretty intense," he said in the post, adding that he isn't sure what he will do next. "Whatever that ends up being, it is hard right now to imagine anything topping this journey, for which I will always have tremendous pride and gratitude.
