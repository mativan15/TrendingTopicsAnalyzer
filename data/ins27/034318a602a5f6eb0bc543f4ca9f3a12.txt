Thousands of people, including families and couples, young and old, packed downtown Morgan Hill this weekend for the 41st annual Mushroom Mardi Gras.
The festival had been shuttered for the last two years due to COVID-19. The event celebrates a major cash crop for Santa Clara County, while raising money for local schools.
A total of 17 scholarships, totaling $17,000, were awarded to local high school students for their continuing education. Since 1984 the festival has awarded 1,190 students scholarships worth $1.
