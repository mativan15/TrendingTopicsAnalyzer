More than two-thirds of parents have turned to voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa or Google Home because their child's homework is becoming more difficult, according to a new survey.Research from TalkTalk found that the use of smart plugs, typically used to connect voice assistants to a power source, has increased by 47% over the past year, with difficult homework being blamed for the surge.Three quarters of parents – 75% – said school work is more difficult now than when they were at school, while more than half – 52% – said they had given the wrong answers to their child's homework.
