Spencer Platt/Getty Images News After years of economic losses for shareholders, iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ) recorded operating profitability in Q1 2022 and the stock jumped more than 10% following the announcement. Given that the profitability was broadly taken as a surprise, many analysts adjusted their EPS expectations for the company and revised their price targets upwards. Investors might ask: Is iQIYI stock, which has lost >80% of its value since February 2021, now a buy? Although I advise to remain cautious with regards to iQIYI, given significant industry competition, I assign a Buy/High risk recommendation.
