In his Money Saving Expert newsletter, Mr Lewis highlighted a problem that unmarried couples who live together could face. Mr Lewis highlighted that those who are not married or in a civil partnership have 'no status under inheritance law'. This means that a partner could be at risk of losing an asset they assumed they would naturally inherit.One example the Money Saving Expert highlighted was if a couple live together and one partner dies, then the other may not get the house even if they've lived in it for years.
