It may be too early to dispense with old-school currencies to pay legal bills, but one City firm has expanded its digital law course to include lessons on how to 'mint' a non-fungible token (NFT).The course was launched by Herbert Smith Freehills last year for 1,000 students. It is essentially a series of free workshops about how lawyers help clients to navigate novel legal and regulatory issues relating to technology, including the metaverse, NFTs, blockchains (the digital ledgers that underpin NFTs and cryptocurrencies), robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).
