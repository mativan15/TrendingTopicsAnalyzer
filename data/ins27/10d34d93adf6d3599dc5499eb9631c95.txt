Shares of Darling Ingredients Inc. DAR, +3.80% fell 0.9% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the producer of natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients announced a deal to buy collagen producer Gelnex for $1.2 billion in cash. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. Brazil-based Gelnex produces about 46,000 metric tons of collagen products a year, and exports them to more than 60 countries. ""Collagen is the most abundant protein naturally found in the body, and it plays an increasing role in the health and nutrition market by consumers seeking benefits to their hair, nails, skin, joints, bones and muscles," said Darling Chief Executive Randall Stuewe.
