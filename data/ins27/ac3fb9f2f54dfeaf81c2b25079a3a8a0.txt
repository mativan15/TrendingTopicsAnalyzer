 Remember when hearing your tech talk to you was actually novel and desirable? I do, it was 2004 and it was a phone I'd seen Paris Hilton use (although I couldn't get my hands on the pink version) called the Motorola Razr.If you're too young to remember what it said when you powered up, listen to this (opens in new tab). For the rest of us (and for any of the 130 million people who owned that phone following its release), it might be something of a revelation to know that Motorola also sells earbuds that take you right back to that very moment!The Razr's hugely popular clamshell or 'flip' design phone is now 18 years old – but the company responsible for it (which sadly accounts for only a small chunk of the smartphone market these days, having been acquired by Chinese giant Lenovo – from previous owner Google – back in 2014) did revive it a few years back with the Motorola Razr 2019 and Razr 2020.
