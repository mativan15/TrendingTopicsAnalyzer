Back in July Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez approved a bill that would allow passengers of public transportation free-of-charge rides on select routes. The transportation discount had gone into effect on September 1st and will go until December 31st of this year.

How it works:

This concept will be applied to routes on 'cercanias' (commuter services/short routes) as well as 'media distancia' (routes just under 300km). All the routes will be taken on their national rail operator service called Renfe.
