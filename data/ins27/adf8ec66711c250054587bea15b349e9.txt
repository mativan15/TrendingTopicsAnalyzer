24K-Production The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter. Polaris Renewable Energy (TSX:PIF:CA) Roughly 11% of the portfolio is allocated to U.S. utility AES (AES) and Canadian independent power producer Polaris Renewable Energy.

We are thrilled with management's performance over the last 12 months.
