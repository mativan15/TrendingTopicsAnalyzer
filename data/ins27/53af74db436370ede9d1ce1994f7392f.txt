Evan Engram played five seasons with the New York Giants, scoring 17 touchdowns with the team and earning one trip to the Pro Bowl. But at the end of his rookie contract, the Giants allowed their 2017 first-round pick to walk in free agency.
In March, the tight end joined the Jacksonville Jaguars on a one-year deal and — while his tenure in New York was largely defined by drops — he's been a reliable target in the Jacksonville offense.

On Thursday, Engram told reporters that he's excited to play against the Giants, but also said he isn't putting too much energy into proving anything to the team that let him walk.
