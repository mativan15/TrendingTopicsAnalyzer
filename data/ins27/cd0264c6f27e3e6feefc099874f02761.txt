Published: 21:40 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 21:40 EDT, 16 October 2022 Fred Couples birdied his final seven holes Sunday to shoot a 12-under-par 60 and run away with the SAS Championship in Cary, N.C. Couples, 63, came up just shy of shooting only the second round of 59 in PGA Tour Champions history. Kevin Sutherland (2014 Dick's Sporting Goods Open) remains the only player to shoot 59 on the 50-and-older circuit. Couples -- who entered the day tied for the lead with South Korea's Y.E. Yang -- wrapped up the event at 20-under 196, beating New Zealand's Steven Alker by six strokes.
