Hong Kong's government will introduce a new visa scheme to woo foreign talent as the Chinese special administrative region fights to retain its status as an international financial hub, its chief executive, John Lee, said on Wednesday. The announcement in Lee's long maiden policy address comes as hundreds of thousands of residents have left the Chinese-ruled city in recent years, driven away partly by the prospect of ever-diminishing freedoms under a Beijing-imposed national security law. What did Lee say? "We must be more proactive and aggressive in competing for enterprises and competing for talent,'' Lee said.
