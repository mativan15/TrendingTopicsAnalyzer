A report backed by 18 countries asks that loot boxes either face stricter regulations or be banned altogether.
Despite their widespread use, loot boxes remain a highly controversial element of modern video game design. To the point where simply not having them is considered a selling point and worthy of praise.
There have been efforts to recognise them as a form of gambling here in the UK and some countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have outright banned them. Recently, this led to Activision cancelling the release of Diablo Immortal in those countries, so as not to break any laws.
