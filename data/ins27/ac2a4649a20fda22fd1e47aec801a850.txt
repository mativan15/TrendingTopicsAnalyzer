Almost 11 million UK households could be in fuel poverty next year to rising energy prices, campaigners warned.
It comes after Liz Truss said the energy price guarantee limiting the average cost for all households would end from April, rather than lasting two years as originally planned. 
The End Fuel Poverty Coalition described the outlook as ‘frankly terrifying' and urged the Government to take action.
They want to see more direct support for people as well as market reforms and investment in home insulation and renewable energy.
