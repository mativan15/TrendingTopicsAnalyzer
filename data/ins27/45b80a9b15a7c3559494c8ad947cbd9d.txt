The stock market has been struggling all year, and investors have done their best to remain patient while waiting for a rebound. Despite having faced numerous head-fakes recently, markets made another attempt to start the week on a positive note. In the premarket session before regular trading began, futures contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 2.24%), S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.09%), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 3.31%) were up roughly 1%.
Mondays often bring big moves for individual stocks, as news from the weekend makes investors more or less excited about the prospects for fundamental businesses.
