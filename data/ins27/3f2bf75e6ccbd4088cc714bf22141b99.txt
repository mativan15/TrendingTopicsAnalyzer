AgenciesVK Saxena (left) and Arvind KejriwalDelhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena has flagged that he has received Lokayukta reports from the city government after an "inordinate delay" of three years, and said being the custodian of public trust, it should display appropriate alertness. Saxena has written to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over the matter. "I would like to advise that the minister concerned may please be guided appropriately to dispose such important matters of public interest within reasonable period, so that the statutory purpose of laying it before the legislative assembly is not defeated and Delhi is not deprived of its wisdom," the lieutenant governor (L-G) said in his letter.
