The suspect who was booked Thursday in the shooting death of Central District business owner D'Vonne Pickett, Jr. made his first appearance in court Friday, the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office announced.

Prosecutors argued that the 31-year-old suspect was 'incredibly dangerous' and should be held without bail.

The judge ordered the suspect to be held without bail and found probable cause for first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault, first-degree robbery, and second-degree unlawful possession of a firearm.
