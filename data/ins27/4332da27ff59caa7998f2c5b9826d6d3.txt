GoI is facing a rough patch in reducing its role in business. Private investors are lukewarm to its disinvestment plans and some of the interest being shown is of suspect provenance. Since the beginning of this year, the government has sold Air India to the Tatas after writing off most of the airline's accumulated debt and losses. It had to reduce the size of Life Insurance Corporation's () initial public offering (IPO) as portfolio investors became skittish in a volatile financial market. It has called off the sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd () after failing to find a strategic investor.
