Microsoft shares fell Thursday after the software heavyweight slashed its financial guidance because of foreign currency fluctuations, a move that comes as multinational companies flag this year's ascent of the dollar to 20-year highs. The maker of Office, Excel and other software products in a PowerPoint presentation cited the "unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate movement" as the reason for revising its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings outlook.The stock fell as much as 4% to $261.60, a one-week low, a decline that weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
