NPC final: Canterbury v Wellington. Where: Orangetheory Stadium, Christchurch. When: Saturday, 7.05pm. Live coverage: Sky Sport, live updates on Stuff. John 'Foxy' Miles stopped at each of the 14 championship banners hanging at Canterbury's Rugby Park headquarters in Christchurch this week. Canterbury's long-time logistics manager was taking this year's squad on a trip down memory lane, recalling tales at each banner signifying a national provincial title. It started with their 1977 triumph against Counties Manukau, featured plenty of nuggets from the six straight tiles won between 2008 and 2013, and concluded with the championship they won after beating Tasman in 2017, when Richie Mo'unga scored a NPC finals record 25 points.
