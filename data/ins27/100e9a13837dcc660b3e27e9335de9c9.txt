Midway through the second period on Tuesday night, Islanders coach Lane Lambert sought a spark with his team down a goal. He changed up his top three forward lines, hoping it would do something.
Mission accomplished.
On the back of three goals in the last 10 minutes of the second period, the Islanders defeated the Sharks, 5-2, to win back-to-back games at UBS Arena for the first time this season — a feat that took them until the new year to accomplish last season — and move to 2-1 on the current campaign.
