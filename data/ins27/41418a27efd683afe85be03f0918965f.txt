The simplest way to invest in stocks is to buy exchange traded funds. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the APA Group (ASX:APA) share price is up 22% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 2.5% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 4.9% in the last three years.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
