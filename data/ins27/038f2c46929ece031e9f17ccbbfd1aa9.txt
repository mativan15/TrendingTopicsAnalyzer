TORONTO - After the digital asset market plummeted in May, Toronto business owner and crypto investor Francine Gerstein said she felt a little uneasy while considering her next moves.'The panic seller in me wants to sell everything and forget about the entire industry,' she said. 'However, the other part of me is trying to follow Nathan Rothschild's line, ‘the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets' and right now it's very bloody.'The digital asset market lost US$300 billion in early May and has seen nearly US$2 trillion in value wiped out since reaching an all-time high back in November.
