Sales at Tesla hit a fresh high in the latest quarter but still fell short of market expectations after surging inflation and logistical issues blighted the electric car company.Tesla, led by Elon Musk, blamed higher raw material costs and the impact of a stronger dollar as its latest earnings report disappointed Wall Street. Shares in the business dropped by 5.1 per cent, or $11.21, to $210.83 during out-of-hours trading in New York last night. The stock had already been under pressure in recent weeks and had fallen by 28 per cent in the past month.
