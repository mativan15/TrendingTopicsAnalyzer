Spencer Platt Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock has been under significant pressure given the Fed's hawkish posture. As a result, the market has astutely used buying spikes in PM to digest its gains further. As such, buying the dips has not worked out for investors in 2022, as the market took out its lows going all the way back to February 2021 at its recent September 2022 lows. We had postulated in our previous article (Hold rating) in August that PM's July 2022 lows could hold. However, the market action over the past three weeks suggests that PM has been de-rated further.
