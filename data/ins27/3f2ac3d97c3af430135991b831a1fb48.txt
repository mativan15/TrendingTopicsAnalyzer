American Eagle Outfitters' fiscal 2022 guidance is out of reach, and the retailer needs to lower its outlook for the following year as well, according to Morgan Stanley.

Analyst Kimberly Greenberger dropped her rating for the retailer's stock to Underweight from Equal-Weight on Tuesday. She slashed her price target to $8 from $22.

The stock (ticker: AEO ) slid 7.7% to $12.08 on Tuesday and has more than halved its value this year.

Greenberger is the latest analyst to express a downbeat view on the company.
