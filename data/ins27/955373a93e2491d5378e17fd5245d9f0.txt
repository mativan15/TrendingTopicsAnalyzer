June 1, 2022 First-generation transfer student Ludwig Lopez credits his family for inspiring him to further his academic pursuits upon completion of high school. 'My motivation in pursuing higher education comes from my family. They have worked so hard to get me to this point, and it's my job to continue fighting. I also want to inspire my niece and nephew, who are still young, to learn about the amazing opportunities pursuing higher education has and what it could offer them in the future,' Lopez said.
