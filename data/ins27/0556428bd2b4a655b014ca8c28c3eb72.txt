(Reuters) - Netflix Inc's subscriber growth forecast will be in focus when it reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, with the streaming pioneer set to launch an ad-supported plan to better compete with rivals such as Disney+ and HBO Max.

Last week, Netflix said it would launch the plan in November at $6.99 a month, much before its previous estimate of early 2023 and Disney+'s December rollout.

Analysts have said the long-resisted move will boost growth at a time when the market for connected TV advertising is booming.
