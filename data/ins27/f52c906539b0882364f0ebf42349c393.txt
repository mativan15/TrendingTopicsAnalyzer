The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made a move this week to clarify at least one question for crypto investors: how taxpayers account for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The tax division of the Treasury Department released an updated draft for its 2022 instructions for form 1040 filers that swaps the old category for 'virtual currency' with broader new language on 'digital assets,' including an explicit recognition of NFTs.

'Digital assets are any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology,' according to the draft instructions.
