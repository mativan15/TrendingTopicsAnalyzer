A pair of muggers beat and dragged a 66-year-old man kicking and screaming across a concrete sidewalk in Queens as they robbed him of $17,000 in a wild caught-on-camera robbery, police said Saturday.

Police released the frightening video, as well as images of the two crooks in the hopes they are brought to justice before they harm anyone else.

The victim was walking along 71st St. towards Juniper Valley Road in Middle Village about 1:20 p.m. on Thursday when one of the two thieves crept up to him from behind and knocked him onto the pavement, cops said.
