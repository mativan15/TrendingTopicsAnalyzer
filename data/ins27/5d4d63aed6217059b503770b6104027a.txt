Three of the men who took down the infamous dark web drug marketplace Silk Road have launched a company helping cops trace cryptocurrency and do complex dark web investigations. 
 Called Naxo Labs, it officially launches on Thursday and is helmed by former FBI agents Chris Tarbell and Tom Kiernan, alongside Matt Edman, an ex-FBI contractor. They all were instrumental in finding Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, closing the site and seizing its $1 billion in bitcoin.
