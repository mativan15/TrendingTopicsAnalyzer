The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) wants to finalize its treatment of digital assets including cryptocurrencies by the end of the year and has planned to produce a second consultation paper on the same.
The BCBS was established decades ago as a global standard-setter for banking regulation. The recent surge in the popularity of digital assets did not go unnoticed when BCBS met on May 27 to discuss multiple topics including crypto assets and it has decided to issue a second consultation paper on the "prudential treatment of banks' crypto asset exposures.
