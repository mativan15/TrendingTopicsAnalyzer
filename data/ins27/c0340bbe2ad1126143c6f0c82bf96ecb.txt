"We would like to thank all of the bidders for their engagement, effort and participation in this process," an official club statement read. "We would also like to thank our men and women footballers, the staff of both teams, everyone in our Academy, and in particular Thomas Tuchel and Emma Hayes for their patience and support during this process. And, of course, thank you to all our partners, staff and fans during this difficult phase for the Club."Chelsea's transfer business this summer can now commence following the acquisition being finalised, and they are expected to move quickly for Sevilla defender Jules Kounde.
