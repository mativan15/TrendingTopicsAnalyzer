The legend of Klay Thompson has so many nicknames amongst the Dub Nation faithful, it has become something that fans and media seek out to coin the next Klay iteration.

So after the Splash Brother's fantastic 32-point performance in the Warriors 120-110 victory to close out the Dallas Mavericks, including eight 3-pointers that put him in a club that doesn't even include Steph Curry, Thompson was asked if this warrants a new nickname.
