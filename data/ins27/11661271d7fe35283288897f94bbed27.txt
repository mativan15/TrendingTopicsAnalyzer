US President Joe Biden has announced the release of 15 million barrels of oil from the United States strategic reserve, a move that follows contentious OPEC+ production cuts that have drawn scorn in Washington in advance of next month's midterm elections.
Biden said on Wednesday afternoon that the drawdown will complete the release of 180 million barrels that his administration approved in March amid global energy concerns linked to Russia's war in Ukraine.
The 15 million barrels are set to be delivered in December, the White House said earlier.
