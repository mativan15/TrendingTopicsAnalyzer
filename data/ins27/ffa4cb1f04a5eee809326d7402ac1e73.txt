The familiar faces of March 2022 are the same in October 2022 in college basketball.

The first Associated Press Poll of the 2022-23 season was released Monday. Few surprises were within, as defending national champion North Carolina was ranked No. 1, followed by Gonzaga, Houston and Kentucky.

Arkansas rounded out the Top 10 as the Razorbacks head into coach Eric Musselman's fourth year. He has led the team to two straight Elite Eight apperances in the NCAA Tournament, though Arkansas has only two rotational players back from last year's team.
