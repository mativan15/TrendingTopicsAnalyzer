Amid growing lobbying influence, a group of renowned technology experts have warned about the rising impact of the cryptocurrency industry. 
According to the Financial Times, 26 computer scientists and academics, including Harvard lecturer Bruce Schneier, former Microsoft engineer Miguel de Icaza and principal engineer at Google Cloud, Kelsey Hightower, wrote to U.S. lawmakers terming cryptocurrencies as 'risky, flawed, and unproven digital financial instruments.'
They also criticized cryptocurrency investments and blockchain technology.
