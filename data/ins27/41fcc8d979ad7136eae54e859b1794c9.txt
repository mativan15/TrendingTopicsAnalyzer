Amid the festivities of Queen Elizabeth II's platinum jubilee in the United Kingdom, misleading social media posts have been circulating concerning the cost of the event.The UK government has promised to host a 'once-in-a-generation show' to celebrate the occasion, but hundreds of social media users have asked the question: How much does the celebration of the Queen's 70 years on the throne really cost taxpayers?Some have expressed anger and disdain that taxpayer money is being spent on the celebration, especially after the UK economy has suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.
