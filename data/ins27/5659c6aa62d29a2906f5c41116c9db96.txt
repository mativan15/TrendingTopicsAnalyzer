(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. may have at least one more shock in store for investors before the social-media company closes out its year to forget. The Snapchat owner reports third-quarter earnings late Thursday and, based on option volatilities, traders are pricing in a 23% stock move in either direction on Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Over the past five years, the average move up or down in Snap shares has been 20% the day after earnings, the data show. Snap shares have tumbled 87% from their record close in September 2021.
