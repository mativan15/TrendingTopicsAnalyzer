DENVER — Senate candidate Joe O'Dea rolled the dice when he publicly defied former President Donald Trump, but a high-risk, high-reward wager may also represent the only play for the Republican newcomer to win on Nov. 8.

Mr. O'Dea pledged to 'actively campaign' against Mr. Trump in 2024, prompting the ex-president to swing back by calling him 'this RINO character.'

The move undoubtedly alienated some Trump supporters, but Mr. O'Dea, who has already staked out a moderate stance on abortion, is betting that any Republican votes he loses will be more than augmented by the unaffiliated voters who now make up 46% of the blue state's electorate.
