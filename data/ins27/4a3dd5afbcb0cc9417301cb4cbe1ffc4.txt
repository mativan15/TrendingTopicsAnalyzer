Jahanvi and Hitaashee Bakshi: Sisters with golfing ambitionsSpending too much time in a bunker isn't normally conducive to a starting a golf career, but for sisters Jahanvi and Hitaashee Bakshi, it was the perfect beginning."I played in the sand for two years when I started going to the golf course" says 18-year-old Hitaashee, "but then, I was only six years old."The Indian professionals were introduced to golf by their parents, in a country, where before 2005, there was no avenue for women to earn money from the game.
