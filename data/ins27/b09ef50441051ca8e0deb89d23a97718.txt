A converted Victorian chapel has gone on the market – and it comes with some very interesting rooms.
Going for £460,000, the property comes with a man cave and two bars.
Having formerly been a Methodist Church, the home located in Grasby, Lincolnshire, was built in 1893 and still has many of its original features.
Now a luxury four-bedroom family home, the vestry and church hall have been turned into a huge open-plan kitchen diner.
The ‘man cave' fits in a pool table and fully stocked bar – making it all the better.
