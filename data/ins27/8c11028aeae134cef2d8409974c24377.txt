Travis Barker's ex-wife Shanna Moakler has shared her disappointment after auctioning off her engagement ring from her marriage to the rocker. The 47-year-old model and the Blink-182 star were married for four years between 2004 and 2008, with the duo sharing two children together - Alabama, 16, and Landon, 18. However, now that Travis tied the knot with reality star and socialite Kourtney Kardashian, Shanna removed the last few connections she had to their marriage. The American model auctioned off the ring to the highest bidder via Worthy.
