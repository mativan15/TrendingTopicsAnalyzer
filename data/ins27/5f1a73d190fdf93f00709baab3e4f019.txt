CLEVELAND -- There were questions about whether the Yankees should start Gerrit Cole in Game 1 of their best-of-five games American League Division Series, but Aaron Boone went with the man to whom they gave a historic contract to pitch big games. It's paid off twice. Cole fended off the scrappy Guardians Sunday night and kept the Bombers' season alive with a 4-2 win at Progressive Field.

With the Yankees facing elimination, Cole gave the Yankees seven strong innings, holding the Guardians to two runs on six hits.
