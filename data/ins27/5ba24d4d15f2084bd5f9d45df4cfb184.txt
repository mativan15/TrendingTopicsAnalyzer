SAN FRANCISCO, June 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In September 2021, a woman filed suit against Zendesk, alleging that Matt Ingebrigtsen, Director of Enterprise Sales-West, announced on a videoconference, that she would lose over a million dollars because of her choice to have a baby.
On May 27, 2022, three more women filed a lawsuit under pseudonyms against Zendesk, alleging they were harassed and discriminated against on the basis of gender, pregnancy, and disability. One of them, Jane Doe I, was lying in a hospital bed after emergency surgery for a stress-induced stomach abscess when the same supervisor, Matt Ingebrigtsen, threatened to fire her if she didn't immediately return to work.
