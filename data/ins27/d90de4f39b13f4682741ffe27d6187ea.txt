The Grammy-winning artist shared a video on Instagram on Monday showing him standing in front of security guards trying to explain who he was because his name wasn't on the list and they didn't recognise his face. Alongside the footage, Diplo wrote text to explain the situation, "I was booked to DJ a yacht party in Cannes but security wouldn't let me in. The yacht was empty so I was about to take the L (loss) and go get food.
