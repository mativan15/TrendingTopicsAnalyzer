A mother has spoken of her shock after spotting this eerie sight of web-covered railings and bushes near her local garden.

Arachnophobe Sarah Longfellow, 34, was greeted with metres of spooky giant cobwebs which completely covered trees and bushes overnight in Castleford, West Yorkshire.

She initially thought the railings and bushes had been vandalised with silly string or fake snow, but a closer inspection revealed it was actually silken nests for thousands of insects.
