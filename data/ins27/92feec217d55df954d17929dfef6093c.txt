SAN DIEGO – After thrilling Padres fans with his latest October heroics, Trent Grisham delivered the ultimate parting message to the sellout crowd of 45,137 at Petco Park. 
'San Diego, y'all showed out tonight,' Grisham said in a postgame interview with FS1's Tom Verducci. 'It was surreal being out there. Let's [expletive] go, San Diego.' 
Equally surreal is Grisham's unlikely rise from a light-hitting center fielder to a surprise offensive star this postseason. His third home run of the playoffs proved to be the difference in the Padres' 2-1 win over the Dodgers in Game 3 of the National League Division Series on Friday night, leaving San Diego one win away from its first NL Championship Series appearance since 1998.
