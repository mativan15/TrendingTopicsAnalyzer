The leader of Wiltshire Council has refused to commit to banning fracking in the county.

Richard Clewer was urged by a Liberal Democrat councillor to register the council's opposition in the local plan, after the government sought to lift the fracking moratorium imposed in 2019.

Mr Clewer said it would not be "sensible" to make such a pledge as it could be overruled by the government.

But he emphasised there were currently no fracking licences in Wiltshire.

The council leader was called to commitment to blocking fracking in Wiltshire's local plan by councillor Ian Thorn at a meeting on 11 October.
