The rough first half of 2022 has brought most stocks down at least a peg or two, but some names look cheaper than others. The S & P 500 is now trading at around 19 times earnings per share, according to FactSet. In 2020 and 2021, the price-to-earnings ratio soared well above 20-times for the index. However, there is wide dispersion on that valuation metric. Typically, growth oriented stocks trade at higher P/E ratios, and then fall further when market sentiment sours. But in broad sell-offs, like Wall Street saw in April and much of May, sometimes even companies with solid fundamentals can get dragged down.
