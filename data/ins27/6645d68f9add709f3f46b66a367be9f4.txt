June 2 (Reuters) - Euro zone government bond yields rose to fresh multi-year highs on Thursday after inflation data released earlier this week boosted expectations that the European Central Bank might accelerate its tightening path.

Investors will focus on U.S. labour data releases, which may shape markets over the next two days, with potential upward pressure on real and nominal yields.

Possible robust data from the U.S. "will most likely be flanked by ongoing hawkish central bank rhetoric", Unicredit strategists said in a note to clients.
