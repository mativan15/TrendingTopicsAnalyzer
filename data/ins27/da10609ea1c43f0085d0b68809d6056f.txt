Each week of the NFL season, The Baltimore Sun will rank all 32 NFL teams. The rankings will take into account not just weekly performance, injuries and roster depth, but how well each team measures up as Super Bowl contenders.

Here are the rankings heading into Week 7:

Super Bowl favorites

1. Buffalo Bills (5-1, No. 1 last week)

2. Philadelphia Eagles (6-0, No. 2)

3. Kansas City Chiefs (4-2, No. 3)

Round 1 in the AFC title fight goes to Buffalo. The Bills got some measure of revenge after last season's divisional-round overtime loss, beating Kansas City, 24-20, on Josh Allen's 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dawson Knox with 1:04 left.
