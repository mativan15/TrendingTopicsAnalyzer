(Bloomberg) -- Credit Suisse Group AG is considering the issuance of convertible bonds or preferred shares among options to help pay for its overhaul and strengthen its balance sheet, people familiar with the matter said.A convertible bond would allow the bank to potentially limit the sale of shares at depressed current prices after the stock lost about half its value this year. The Swiss firm used mandatory convertible notes to raise about $2 billion to mend its balance sheet after the collapse of Archegos Capital Management in 2021.
