Ben Simmons made his regular-season debut in a Brooklyn Nets uniform Wednesday night, and the results were not ideal for either Simmons or the team. Brooklyn lost 130-108 to the New Orleans Pelicans, and Simmons scored just four points in 23 minutes played, fouling out early in the fourth quarter.  Kyrie Irving, #11 of the Brooklyn Nets, looks on during the game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Oct. 19, 2022 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.  (Jesse D.
