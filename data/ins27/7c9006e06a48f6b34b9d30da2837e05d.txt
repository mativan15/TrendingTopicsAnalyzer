Chilling surveillance video captures a well-dressed man wielding a machete knocking on the door of a Florida family's home – and it is just one in a series of creepy appearances in the area.
The bald, bespectacled man is seen tapping the door of the Lauderhill home in Broward County at about 5:30 a.m. Monday wearing a tie and a tucked-in dress shirt — and the weapon in hand, the unsettling video published by WSVN shows.
'I see some random dude knocking on the door with the back of a machete,' a male resident who asked not to be named told the news station.
