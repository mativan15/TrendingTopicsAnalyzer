At the age of 68, Siale Faitotonu must have a shout at being the country's oldest first home buyer. In July, Faitotonu, his wife Milika, 51, and two of their adult children, bought a home near Christchurch together, pooling their savings for a deposit, and using their combined incomes to qualify for a Kiwibank's co-own home loan. Now they want other Pacific families to hear about how the banking system is starting to learn how it can better serve them, and lift Pacific home ownership rates. Te Ara Ahunga Ora The Retirement Commission says homeownership among Pacific peoples in New Zealand is the lowest among the recorded ethnicities, with just 21% owning, or partly owning, a home as of 2018, compared to 52% of the entire population.
