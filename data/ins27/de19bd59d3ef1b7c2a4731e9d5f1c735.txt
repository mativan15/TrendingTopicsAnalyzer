Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) on Tuesday raised concerns that the United States is falling behind adversaries China and Russia in manufacturing and testing hypersonic missiles.

'As a country, we are behind China, and even Russia for that matter, and this is not a good situation,' Lamborn said, adding hypersonics are 'a whole new type of offensive capability, and we are behind, no doubt about it.'

Lamborn's concerns were echoed by academics and weapons experts who joined The Hill's Tuesday event, 'National Security at the Speed of Sound: Hypersonics in American Defense,' sponsored by Raytheon Industries.
