Spirit Airlines shareholders have approved a takeover by JetBlue Airways after a six-month battle to create the country's fifth-largest carrier, a deal that now faces a high hurdle with federal regulators.

Spirit announced the results of the vote after a special shareholder meeting on Wednesday. In April, JetBlue made a $3.8 billion all-cash offer for Spirit, derailing Spirit's plan for a cash-and-stock deal to merge with Frontier Airlines.

The airlines said they expect to close the transaction no later than the first half of 2024.
