In March, the federal Treasury estimated the floods that hit northern NSW and Queensland would reduce national GDP by 0.5 percentage points in the short term before being offset as communities were rebuilt.The most obvious impact outside of the affected communities was on the price of fruit and vegetables. Iceberg lettuce hit $11 a head as vegetable prices jumped by almost 8 per cent through the June quarter.The Reserve Bank's most recent forecast predicted inflation will peak at 7.75 per cent in the December quarter, before starting to fall through 2023.
