With weeks of relentless selling finally starting to break in the market, we searched for stocks that may be overdue for a short-term pop. Traders typically find stocks that may be "oversold" by looking at their current price versus the average price of the last 200 days. Using that metric, CNBC PRO screened for the names that are the most beaten up in the S & P 500 and then added a few other criteria to find possible pop candidates for a trade. Along with being deeply oversold, the shares in our search also have high short interest relative to their shares available for trading.
