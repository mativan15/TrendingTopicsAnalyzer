PackersBy Doug RussellOct 19, 2022GREEN BAY – Aaron Rodgers did not practice on Wednesday. But that does not mean he wasn't working. Two hours, Rodgers reported back to the media assembled at his usual midweek media availability with reporters at his locker. When asked how his thumb, injured on the last play of Green Bay's loss in London to the New York Giants, Rodgers said, 'it was sore after the game. It progressively gets better throughout the week.' Rodgers indicated he expects to practice the rest of the week, rest during the team's trip to Washington on Saturday and be ready to play Sunday.
