Amazon customers could be owed compensation (Image: GETTY)UK shoppers who have bought items from Amazon over the past few years may soon find they get some money back in their pockets. A huge £900million legal claim has been submitted against the retail giant which alleges that Amazon breached strict competition laws. This meant many users ended up paying higher prices for products when cheaper deals were readily available.The claim is being led by consumer-rights champion Julie Hunter, who says items sold on Amazon's UK store sometimes hid prices that were actually better.
