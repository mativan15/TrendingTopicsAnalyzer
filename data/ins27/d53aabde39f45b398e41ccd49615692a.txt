The UK has begun a fast-track visa scheme for tech workers graduating from a list of top 50 universities worldwide.
Critics, however, maintain the scheme will fail to compensate for the barriers erected to tech recruitment from the EU as a result of Brexit.
Announcing the "high-potential individual route", which started from 30 May, the British government said it wants to attract the world's top graduates in subjects such as science, engineering and medical research. Sought-after skills also include cybersecurity in a plan to support both economic growth as well as technological and medical advances.
