Markets these days "lack any sense at all," and that won't change until the inflation picture becomes clearer, Wells Fargo said in a note Thursday. The bank pointed to the recent volatility in the stock market, which has rebounded on positive earnings reports after plunging earlier this month when inflation clocked in above expectations. Those swings have Wall Street divided over the what the future holds, with some bulls calling for a 37% rally by year-end, and others ringing alarms for an imminent financial disaster.
