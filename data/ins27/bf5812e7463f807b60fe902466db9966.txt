About seven minutes into my second conversation with the actor, writer, and director Taika Waititi, he confessed, somewhat abruptly, that he doesn't like being around people. There was 'absolutely nothing loaded' about the remark, he assured me—but he also seemed to mean it. 'It's just really draining,' he said. 'With whoever—it doesn't matter who. Even my family. But definitely people I've never met before.'It was a hard claim to believe. Outwardly, Waititi can seem extroverted in the extreme. He's goofy and antic, with an easygoing familiarity and a seemingly bottomless amount of energy.
