(Bloomberg) -- Chinese startups will struggle to attract investment throughout 2022 and possibly beyond, one of the country's most successful dealmakers said, adding to a chorus of warnings about a reckoning for global tech firms after years of easy money.Investors in private equity and venture capital funds, known as limited partners, are becoming a lot more selective before committing capital, Bao Fan, founder of China Renaissance Holdings, told Bloomberg News in Hong Kong.
