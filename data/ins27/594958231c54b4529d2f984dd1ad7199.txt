By Joe Hoppe MetalNRG PLC said Monday that the English High Court has granted its application for summary judgment against former joint-venture partner BritEnergy Holdings LLP and BritNRG Ltd., for the recovery of money paid in 2021. The investment company said it has been advised that its claims against former director Pierpaolo Rocco required the court to hear oral evidence, and so weren't yet suitable for summary judgment. The judge also refused an application for leave to appeal made on the day by the defendants, and dismissed an application for a stay of execution.
