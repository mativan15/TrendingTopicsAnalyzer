Experts have cautioned against letting the guard down and called for maintaining strict vigil after the country detected a new Omicron subvariant BQ.1. They said Covid-19 cases could rise in the coming days due to festivals including Diwali next week. BQ.1 is an offshoot of the Omicron variant related to the BA.5 version that drove the surge in the US. "The discovery of BQ.1 is not unexpected," said Rajeev Jayadevan, co-chairman of Indian Medical Association's (IMA) National Task Force on Covid. "Continued precautions will need to be kept, especially because older people or those with comorbidities can occasionally suffer severe outcomes even with Omicron, even if vaccinated.
