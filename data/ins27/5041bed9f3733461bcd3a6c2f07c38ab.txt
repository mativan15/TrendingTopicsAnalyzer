In 2018, Crown and its development partner Lendlease launched legal action against the former state-run Barangaroo Delivery Authority in a bid to protect 'sight lines' from their developments at Barangaroo South. The costly courtroom showdown exposed more than two years of backroom discussions between then Crown chairman James Packer's advisers at the big end of town and the highest levels of the state government.At the heart of the dispute was whether the 'sight lines' from Crown's casino, and Lendlease's apartments, towards the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge would be blocked by the developments at Central Barangaroo.
