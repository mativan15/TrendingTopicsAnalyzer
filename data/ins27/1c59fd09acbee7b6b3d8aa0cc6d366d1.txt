That was fast.

The Carolina Panthers traded wide receiver Robbie Anderson to the Arizona Cardinals less than 24 hours after he was sent to the locker room in the middle of the team's Week 6 loss, the team confirmed. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but the Cardinals website said the team received "undisclosed draft compensation" and NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Arizona will pay the $690,000 prorated portion of Anderson's base salary.

Anderson's exit quickly ends one of the bigger non-football sagas from Week 6.
