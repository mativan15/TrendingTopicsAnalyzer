 Manitoba is looking to update the province's building, plumbing, fire and energy codes to the latest national model 'as soon as practically possible.'
The aim is to transition to the new codes six months earlier than what's required.'Following feedback from industry and other stakeholders, our government has chosen to adopt the 2020 national standards, thereby bypassing the 2015 editions, to give those professionals sufficient time to gain familiarity with the 2020 codes,' said Labour, Consumer Protection and Government Services Minister Reg Helwer.
