Sjo/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Shell (NYSE:SHEL) has resumed export operations from the Forcados oil terminal in Nigeria after a 10-week interruption, the company said late Thursday. Shell (SHEL) said shipments restarted following the completion of repair work at the facility in the country's Niger Delta region and the removal and clamping theft points along the pipeline to ensure full crude oil receipt at the terminal. Nigeria's government has blamed rampant theft on the pipelines for shutting down wells and hurting investment.
