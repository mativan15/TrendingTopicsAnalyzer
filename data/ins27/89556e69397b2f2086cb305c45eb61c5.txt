For over three decades, Rev. Charles Southall III has led the First Emanuel Baptist Church. Under his leadership, the church's ministry has grown to include multiple locations in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He also created the Spirit of Excellence Academy, a charter school serving both cities. Unfortunately, on Oct. 18, the congregation's leader admitted to money laundering.

According to FOX 8 Live, the 64-year-old pastor came clean after FBI charges were pressed last month. Their investigation determined that Southall laundered almost $900,000 from donations, congregants' tithes and church-owned real estate assets for his personal use.
