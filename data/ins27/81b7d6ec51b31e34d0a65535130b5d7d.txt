NSW's casino regulator has defended his decision to allow Star Entertainment to keep its licence, despite finding it wasn't fit to hold it due to breaches including facilitating money laundering by customers and allowing a junket operator linked to organised crime to bring in high-rolling gamblers.The NSW Independent Casino Commission on Monday fined Star $100m and appointed a manager, Nick Weeks of Wexsted Advisors, to take control of the company's Pyrmont casino for at least 90 days.NSICC's chair, Philip Crawford, said the regulator decided not to revoke Star's licence because the company had shown contrition and a willingness to reform under the new chief executive, Robbie Cook, and because taking away the casino licence would have meant 'thousands of Star employees would have lost their jobs overnight'.
