After a year of global growth that included their first top 10 album on the Billboard 200, ITZY take their next step to larger pop prominence with the release of their first original English single 'Boys Like You.' See latest videos, charts and news 
 Like many of ITZY's K-pop singles, the new pop track is an empowerment anthem. This time, the girls realize their worth and refuse to take back a two-timing boyfriend with a mix of sassy, catchy rap rhymes ('Boy, gonna diss me? Boy, I'm so pissed/ Boy, gonna miss me/ Boy, you are dismissed') and a smooth, kiss-off hook sung by Chaeryeong (who croons, 'I don't fall for boys like you' in the most addictive part of the track).
