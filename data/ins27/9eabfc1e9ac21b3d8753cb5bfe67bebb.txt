One of Calgary's most prominent shooting ranges sold out of inventory following the Trudeau government's proposal to freeze handgun sales this week, but that hasn't stopped them from celebrating National Range Day on Saturday. J.R. Cox, who owns and operates The Shooting Edge, says the open house event is meant to promote safe shooting sports and to extend further support to legal firearms owners. Calgarians of all ages, with or without a licence, also had the opportunity to learn how to safely and properly shoot and handle firearms.
