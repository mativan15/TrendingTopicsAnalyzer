Mike White has an advantage over about a third of the other men's basketball coaches in the SEC this season.

He may be in a new place, but the Georgia coach is at least in the same conference.

That should give White, who moved on from Florida after last season, a little bit more comfort than Lamont Paris, Dennis Gates, Chris Janes, Matt McMahon and Todd Golden. In a unique year of high turnover among the league's coaches, those five will be learning about the SEC on the fly when the season begins in a couple of weeks.
