Farewell National Electricity Market. Via the ABC. A leading Australian energy expert says the country's biggest electricity market is on life support as state and federal governments increasingly take control of the transition to renewable power.
Tony Wood from the Grattan Institute said yesterday's announcement by the Victorian government that it would renationalise part of the state's electricity system was the latest sign governments had 'given up' on the market.
Under the announcement, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said a re-elected Labor government would spend $1 billion on renewable energy assets and explore the possibility of selling electricity directly to consumers.
