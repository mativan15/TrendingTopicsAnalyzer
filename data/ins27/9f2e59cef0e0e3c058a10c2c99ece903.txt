Manchester City will beat Liverpool 'quite comfortably' at Anfield because of the gulf in class between both teams in midfield, says Stan Collymore.

The two sides have fought to the end for two Premier League titles in recent campaigns, City edging the contests by a point. But while Pep Guardiola's team have gone to another level this season, Liverpool have dropped off.

The Reds sat 10th in the Premier League heading into the weekend following just two wins in eight games.
