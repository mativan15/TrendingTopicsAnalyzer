Citigroup 's stock may struggle to break out until the bank completes its transformation under new CEO Jane Fraser, according to Credit Suisse. Analyst Susan Roth Katzke downgraded the bank to neutral from outperform, saying in a note to clients on Friday that there were better options for investors. "We realize that the downside to C shares may prove more limited given a valuation within reach of prior cyclical troughs; but we believe the upside, relative to peers, will also prove more limited given the long road ahead in Citi's transformation process, " Roth Katzke wrote.
