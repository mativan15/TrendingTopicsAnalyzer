How much longer will Los Angeles City Councilmembers Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo try to hang on to their jobs?

It's been more than a week since a leaked audio recording revealed deplorable and racially divisive comments from then-Council President Nury Martinez, De León, Cedillo and a top county labor official. Martinez and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera made the right decision last week and resigned.
