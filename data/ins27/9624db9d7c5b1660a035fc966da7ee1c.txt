May 26—WILLIMANTIC — During the month of June, community members can help families in need by purchasing floral bouquets at Stop and Shop stores in Willimantic and Killingly. Access Community Action Agency, which has offices in Willimantic and Danielson, is participating in " Bloomin' 4 Good."

Access is designated by the federal and state governments as the anti- poverty agency in northeast Connecticut.

" What a beautiful way to give back, help to fight hunger in our local community and make a room, or home, even brighter," Access Community Action Agency Senior Director of Community Engagement and Resource Management Kathleen Krider said in a press release.
