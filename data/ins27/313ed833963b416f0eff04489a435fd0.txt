Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra said on Tuesday that he, along with Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, would discuss with the Union government the issue related to the cancellation of allotment of 9,934.02 acres of de-notified forest land in Shivamogga district to the villagers displaced after the construction of Linganamakki dam.
The statement came on a day when locals in Shivamogga district staged a protest against the Karnataka government's decision to cancel the allotment.
'I will go to Delhi along with the CM to discuss the issue with the Union government,' Jnanendra said after chairing a meeting in Bengaluru along with Sagar district legislator Harthalu Halappa.
