VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 17, 2022 /CNW/ - Canfor Pulp Products Inc. (TSX: CFX) is announcing a temporary curtailment of its Intercontinental Pulp Mill due to the lack of available economic fibre. Following its annual turnaround maintenance that began on September 24, 2022 and lasted for two weeks, the facility has implemented a two-week curtailment. Regular operations are expected to resume on October 24, 2022. In total the four weeks of downtime is reducing Canfor Pulp's production output by approximately 28,000 tonnes of market kraft pulp.
