The country's largest gun safety group is turning its attention down ballot by pumping money into local sheriff races this election.

Everytown for Gun Safety, the massive gun control group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, told NBC News on Friday it's "leaving no stone unturned in the fight to end gun violence" and will spend $300,000 on digital ads in two sheriff races this year.

While that amount is just a fraction of the group's national budget — Everytown spent some $55 million on the 2020 election, and millions more this year on House and Senate races — it could prove consequential in these low-profile races.
