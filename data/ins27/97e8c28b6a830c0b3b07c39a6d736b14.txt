Kansas State Rep. Heather Meyer

One thing is clear when walking away from a conversation with Heather Meyer: She wants to "get shit done."

Meyer was born and raised in Kansas. She grew up in a single-father household, struggling, which she acknowledges is a story many across Kansas share. She is a person with type 1 diabetes who did not have insurance and grew up with a father who also had type 1 diabetes and was uninsured. She understands rationing insulin. Moreover, as a bisexual woman and member of the Kansas legislature, she understands LGBTQ+ issues.
