Consumer prices rose 8.2% in the last year, according to a September inflation report issued Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's near the highest levels since the early 1980s.
Given that inflation rate, consumers are paying $445 more per month to buy the same goods and services as they did a year ago, according to Moody's Analytics.
There aren't lots of great options to save money, financial advisors said. They largely include buying cheaper alternatives when possible and trimming discretionary expenses.
