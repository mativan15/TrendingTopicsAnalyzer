Around this time last year, Dasha Shipunova was busy celebrating her 18th birthday with her best friends from Kharkiv university, Vika Mankovska and Yarik Size.
Pictures from the day show Dasha holding her cake, covered with heart-shaped decorations and candles spelling out 18, with a sparkly backdrop and gold balloons hanging behind her.
Their only worries were about cooking lunch and whether it would rain. Yarik described it as 'one of the warmest days of my life'.
