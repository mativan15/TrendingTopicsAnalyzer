The Tamil Nadu Cashew Processors and Exporters Association (TNCPEA) has urged the Union government to restore the export incentive for cashew kernels to 5 per cent from the existing 2.5 per cent, as its exports have dropped. In a memorandum addressed to the Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, the secretary of the Association M. Ramakrishnan said the government of India had provided an incentive of 5 per cent for export of plain cashew kernels.
