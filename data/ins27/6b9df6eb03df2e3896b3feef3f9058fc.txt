CNN anchor Don Lemon revealed Thursday that he felt the political focus of his nixed primetime show had gotten stale prior to his move to the struggling cable network's revamped morning show.
Lemon, who is set to serve as co-host of the new 'CNN This Morning' beginning Nov. 1, said he grew 'tired' of the politically charged nature of primetime news. 
'I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was a factor,' Lemon told Semafor in an interview published Wednesday.
The left-leaning anchor was known for frequently targeting former President Donald Trump in nightly monologues.
