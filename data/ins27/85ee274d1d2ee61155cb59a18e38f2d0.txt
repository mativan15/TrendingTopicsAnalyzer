Oct. 15—TWINSBURG — Match complexion can change in an instant, as the Beachwood boys can attest after a trek Oct. 15 to Twinsburg for its regular-season finale.

In about a 13-second span in the opening 40, the tide turned decisively against the on-form Bison, and in the aftermath, they were swept out to the proverbial sea.

Evan Schneeman and Jarren Fuentes gave the Tigers a deserved halftime lead, and Alec Utrup and Trevor Dow contributed second-half strikes to blow it open as Twinsburg turned away Beachwood, 4-1, on a crisp fall afternoon.
