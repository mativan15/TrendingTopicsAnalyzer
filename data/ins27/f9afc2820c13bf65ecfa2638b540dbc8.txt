More than 100 small-aircraft pilots are prepared to begin flying people seeking abortions to states where the procedure remains legal if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. The service would expand on decades of experience for volunteer pilots who fly patients across the U.S. for other health care services they couldn't get closer to home — specialty cancer care and treatment for rare diseases, for example. An Illinois-based pilots group called Elevated Access is expecting an influx of patients looking for travel options in the wake of a leaked draft opinion that suggests a majority of the Supreme Court is ready to scrap Roe's abortion protections.
