Toronto cannabis shoppers will be able to request cannabis deliveries through Uber Eats starting Monday.

The food delivery platform owned by U.S. tech giant Uber Technologies Inc. announced a partnership with online marijuana marketplace Leafly on Sunday that will see it process pot orders for retailers Hidden Leaf Cannabis, Minerva Cannabis and Shivaa's Rose.

The partnership will mark the first time Uber has facilitated the delivery of marijuana anywhere in the world.

Consumers, who must be age 19 or older, will place orders on the Uber Eats app, which stores can receive and respond to through Leafly's software.
