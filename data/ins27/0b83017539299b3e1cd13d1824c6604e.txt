Corporate scorecards on everything from sustainability to racial justice and LGBTQ rights abound on the left, but now conservatives have launched their own index ranking businesses based on their commitment to free speech. The newly unveiled Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index is billed as the first comprehensive benchmark to measure 'corporate respect for religious and ideological diversity in the market, workplace and public square.' 'Ideologically charged business services are bad for everyone, no matter their religious or political views,' said Inspire Investing CEO Robert Netzly, a member of the Viewpoint Diversity Score advisory council.
