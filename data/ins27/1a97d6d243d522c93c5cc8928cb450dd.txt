The allocation of carbon is a reallocation of political power. Mirroring the estimates process that decides money budgets for departments, sectoral plans on emissions are collectively a national climate budget. From January 1st, 2023 there will be an allocation of money as usual, but additionally there will be a carbon allocation that sets emissions ceilings for all economic sectors. Government decisions of lasting consequence on the sectoral allocation of carbon are due before the summer recess in July.
