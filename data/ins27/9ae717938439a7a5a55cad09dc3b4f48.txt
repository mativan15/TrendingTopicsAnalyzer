You know it's getting close to college football season, and your opportunity to turn on the beautiful Picasso that is Ohio State football when the preseason magazines start to come out.

One of the preseason magazines that I used to religiously follow on a yearly basis is Athlon Sports. A lot of the content is online now, but there was just something about grabbing the print version and leafing through it that made me anticipate the start of some Buckeye football.

You can still do that at your local grocery store or another retail establishment of choice, but we are also here to inform you that Athlon Sports has released its 2022 college football top 25 for 2022 online.
