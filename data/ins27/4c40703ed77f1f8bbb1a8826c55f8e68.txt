Mayor Adams acknowledged Friday that his administration has admitted far fewer migrants than expected at its controversial tent camp on Randalls Island — but contended that's actually a sign of success.

The facility, which cost city taxpayers at least $650,000 just to build, has welcomed less than a dozen migrants since it opened Wednesday. The Daily News only spotted five migrants total going through intake at the tent on Wednesday and Thursday.

In a string of Friday morning radio appearances, Adams claimed the slow pace on Randalls indicates his migrant crisis response is going according to plan.
