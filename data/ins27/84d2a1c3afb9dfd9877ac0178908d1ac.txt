May 27—A man sporting a striped fedora and a pink, diamond-sparkled earring robbed two area stores, including one in Berks County, threatening the clerks with a long-barreled stainless steel revolver and injuring one, investigators said Friday.

The unidentified man held up the Turkey Hill Minit Market along Route 625 in Brecknock Township on May 18, township police said.

He held a silver-colored revolver with an 8- to 10-inch barrel in his right hand.

The robber was described as in his 20s, possibly with a tattoo on his right hand.
