1:00 PM ETLAKE FOREST, Ill. – The Chicago Bears have had a chance for an extended self-scout as a result of 11 days separating their last game from their road contest Monday against the New England Patriots (ESPN, 8:15 p.m. ET), but it's doubtful they needed much time to identify their problems.The storyline of their 2-4 start has been the struggles of second-year quarterback Justin Fields and the passing game.Fields has been pressured on 46% of his dropbacks, the highest rate a quarterback has faced in the first six games of a season since ESPN began tracking the stat in 2009.
