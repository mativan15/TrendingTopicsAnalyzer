Royal Antwerp star Radja Nainggolan has been suspended by the Belgian club after he was caught smoking on the subs' bench before a recent league fixture. The former Roma midfielder was named amongst the substitutes for Sunday's Belgian Pro League clash away at Standard Liege, which Antwerp eventually lost 3-0. And Nainggolan's efforts to sneak in a quick smoke of his e-cigarette before kick-off have also come unstuck as he was spotted by cameras and photographers and caught red-handed. He has only recently been in hot water with his club after being stopped by Belgian police for driving without a licence - an incident which Antwerp did not comment on publicly.
