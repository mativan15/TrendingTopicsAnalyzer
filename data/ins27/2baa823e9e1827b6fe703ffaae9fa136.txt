Software company Clio has announced a set of new features and updates to its centralized platform as it targets more action in the legal tech sector.
Founded in Vancouver, Canada, Clio employs over 500 staff across five global offices. Its name is a reference to Clio (Kleio), which in Greek mythology is one of the nine Muses, and patron of history. The tech company certainly has history as it was founded in 2008. It also has notable stats to share: According to Clio, it has the approval of over 65 bar associations and law societies around the world, and a global customer base of 150,000.
