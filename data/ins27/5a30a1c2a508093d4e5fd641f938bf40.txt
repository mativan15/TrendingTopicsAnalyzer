Microsoft, the third biggest company in the world, is laying off a lot of people, according to a report by Axios. Precisely how many people are being put out of work is unclear. Axios's source said the newly unemployed will number "under 1,000," which is an odd phrasing, since it could mean just about anything, but it's pretty clear that the total is significant. The Washington Post reports that there have been social media posts by disgruntled former employees. The Post also quotes Microsoft staffers who say the jobs being cut — particularly in the company's Xbox and military simulation divisions — seemed safe, and that the layoffs came as a surprise.
