A special NIA court in Kolkata on Friday sentenced Mohd Mosiuddin alias Musa, accused of plotting ISIS-style chilling execution of foreigners, to life imprisonment. Musa was arrested from a passenger train in West Bengal's Burdwan in July 2016 by the state CID, following which the NIA had taken over the probe into the matter. Chief Judge Siddhartha Kanjilal sentenced Musa to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of conspiring to wage war against the government of India and collecting men and weapons for the purpose.
