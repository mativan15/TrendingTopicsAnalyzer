Labour is calling on Tory MPs to seize an opportunity to end fracking "once and for all" by backing a move to pave the way for a vote on the issue.The party will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to put forward a motion which, if passed, would guarantee time in the Commons for a bill to ban the controversial gas extraction technique for good.
Fracking involves injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks and boreholes to force open existing cracks and extract oil or gas.In one of her first controversial acts as prime minister, Liz Truss overturned a manifesto pledge to pause it until it is proved safe.
