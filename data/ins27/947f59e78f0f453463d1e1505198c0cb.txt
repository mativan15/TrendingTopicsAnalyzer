The list of great pop songs inspired by Meghan Markle gained a new entry in July 2019 with the release of Magic of Meghan by London post-punk band Dry Cleaning. 'I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly,' declared frontwoman, Florence Shaw in a dispassionate murmur. 'This beautiful woman tripped and fell into my life.'Magic of Meghan is funny yet also chock-full of ambivalence — a signature of Dry Cleaning, who put out their second album, Stumpwork, this week (‘stump work' refers to a form of pleated embroidery).
