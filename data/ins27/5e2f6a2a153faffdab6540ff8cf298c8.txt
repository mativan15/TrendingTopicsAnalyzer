The UK fitness industry could be destroyed by the end of the year amid rising inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, the Financial Times reported this week.According to the publication, the rapid rise in electricity prices has been pushing fitness-club owners to save money by reducing opening hours, lowering temperatures in their pools and abandoning full lighting.Also, gym-goers have recently been advised to reduce the time they spend in club showers. Experts calculate that since 2019, electricity prices in the country have increased by 100% to 150%, which has led to mounting debt obligations from fitness centers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, and may lead to their closure by the end of 2022.
