The Government has been urged to bring forward increases to benefits rather than wait until next April to ensure the poorest families do not go hungry or cold this winter.Campaigners have warned leaders not to 'abandon children when they need support the most', with ministers facing calls to stick by the former chancellor's pledge to uprate welfare payments in line with inflation.In May, Rishi Sunak said benefits would be uprated by this September's Consumer Prices Index (CPI), subject to a review by the Work and Pensions Secretary.
