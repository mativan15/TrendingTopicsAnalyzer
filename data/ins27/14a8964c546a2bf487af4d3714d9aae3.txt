Oct. 16—Even under the rays of the sun, the Moonlight Festival was in full swing Saturday.

Starting at 11 a.m., food trucks, artists, vendors and of course musicians performing live on the big stage took over downtown Somerset for the fourth edition of the fall-themed community event.

And for Somerset Tourism Director Leslie Ikerd, who works with a dedicated team of City of Somerset employees to pull it all together, that's really what it's all about — community.

"There's different events that you're going to pay to go to and that has definitely got its place; I feel like our (strength) is, it's a community event," she said.
