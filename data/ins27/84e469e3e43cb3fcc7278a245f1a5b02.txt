(Bloomberg) -- Kenyan President William Ruto wants 15 billion trees planted in his country over the next decade as part of a program to stop the cycle of recurring droughts.The plan involves growing five billion trees in five years and an additional 10 billion by 2032, Ruto said at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, on Thursday. 'This will eventually lead to the rehabilitation and restoration of 10.6 million hectares,' he said.Ruto, who took office last month, joins global and regional campaigns to curb climate change through planting trees, including the African Union-led $8 billion Great Green Wall Initiative to restore the degraded landscapes mainly in the Sahel and Ethiopia's proposal to plant 4 billion trees.
