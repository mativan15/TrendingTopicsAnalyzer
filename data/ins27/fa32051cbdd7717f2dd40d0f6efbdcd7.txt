Mounting your TV over the mantel may seem like a logical position, but it's actually a really bad idea. Not only can it potentially reduce your TV's picture quality, it could shorten your TV's life. Worst case, it could even cause you repeated physical pain. Yes, really. We know it seems like the ideal place to stick a TV, but there are serious issues with such placement. Mounting a TV in the bathroom isn't much better, but it's doable.If you are considering it, have you figured out how you'll send power and signal (HDMI or wireless) to the TV, or how you're mounting it to the brick or stone? These are concerns too, but easily fixable.
