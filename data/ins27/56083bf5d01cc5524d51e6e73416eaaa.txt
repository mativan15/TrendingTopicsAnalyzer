Beijing residents were stunned earlier this month when a brave activist carried out a powerful – and rare – protest against Xi Jinping's leadership.
Peng Lifa was arrested soon after he took to the city's prominent Sitong Bridge disguised as a construction worker and lit a fire to attract attention before hanging two banners and playing a prerecorded protest chant through a loudspeaker.
The banners displayed a daring message in bold red letters, branding Xi a dictator and criticizing a string of his policies which Peng claimed left citizens 'enslaved people,' with the protest occurring just days before the Communist Party's congress, which is expected to grant the President a historic third term.
