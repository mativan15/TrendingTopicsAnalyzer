The FBI has identified a suspect in Fresno's wire fraud case and expects to interview the woman within 60 days, Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer told The Bee on Thursday.

Dyer said he spoke with an FBI agent earlier this week by phone and learned new details about the case.

Three suspects who defrauded other government agencies around the country have been arrested. The FBI agent told Dyer the woman suspected of defrauding Fresno of more than $600,000 likely will be interviewed by agents out of a Philadelphia office once an indictment is unsealed.
