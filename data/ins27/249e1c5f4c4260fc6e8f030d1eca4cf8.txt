CNN anchor Don Lemon this week took a shot at former President Trump ahead of his new role anchoring CNN's morning program, saying that while he looks forward to starting the next chapter in his career — he hopes it will go beyond 'tribal politics.'

'I would be lying to you if I didn't say that was a factor,' Lemon said of his move to mornings in an interview with news startup Semafor. 'I never really butted heads with the last president. He didn't have the courage to come on and take hard questions from CNN and me and my show.
