AP Entertainment Writer Not long into 'Black Adam,' a preteen boy looks up at the muscled hulk of Dwayne Johnson and begs for his help: 'We could use a superhero right now.'Do we need another superhero with another convoluted origin story that stretches back thousands of years and fulfills a whacko destiny? Do we really need another clutch of secondary level heroes to muddy focus? We're almost 40 deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a dozen in the DC universe. You can almost smell the fumes now, can't you?'Black Adam' isn't bad, it's just predictable and color-by-numbers, stealing from other films like an intellectual property super-villain.
