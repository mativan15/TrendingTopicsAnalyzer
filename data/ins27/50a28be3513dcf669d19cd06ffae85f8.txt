Olympic Games bronze medallist David Nyika has knocked out Titi Motusaga in an all-Kiwi professional cruiserweight boxing fight in Melbourne but Hemi Ahio has suffered his first pro boxing defeat. Hamilton-based Nyika, 27, felled Auckland-domiciled Motusaga in the second round while Ahio lost in a big upset in the heayvweight decision to a technical knockout against Faiga Opelu. It was the fourth knockout win of Nyika's promising pro career, which began in 2021 after he left the amateur ranks following his Tokyo Olympic bronze and Commonwealth Games gold medals in 2014 and 2018.
