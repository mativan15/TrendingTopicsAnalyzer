The European Union has imposed sanctions on Iran's morality police and information minister over their alleged roles in the security crackdown against anti-government protests that erupted after the death of a 22-year-old woman in government custody.
Two leading morality police officials, Mohammad Rostami and Hajahmad Mirzaei, are among 11 people whose assets were frozen by the 27-nation bloc on Monday. They are also banned from travelling in Europe.
The Iranian Law Enforcement Forces and a number of local police chiefs were also targeted 'for their role in the brutal repression of the protests', said a statement released after EU foreign ministers endorsed the sanctions at a meeting in Luxembourg.
