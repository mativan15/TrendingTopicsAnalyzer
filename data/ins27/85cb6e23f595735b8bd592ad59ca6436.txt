The government has been told it must act urgently on a 'national epidemic' of child sex abuse that has been enabled by institutional failures for decades.After more than seven years of work, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) called for significant changes including laws making failing to report abuse a criminal offence, the creation of a Child Protection Authority and a minister dedicated to the issue.Professor Alexis Jay, chair of the inquiry, told a press conference that the abuse was 'not just a historical aberration which happened decades ago, it is an ever-increasing problem and a national epidemic'.
