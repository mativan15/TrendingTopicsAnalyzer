[JOONGANG PHOTO] The pandemic brought death, illness, economic dislocation and an entirely new class of "coronavirus criminals," people caught violating quarantine or social distancing restrictions. The cases are still piled up, and police don't know what to do with them. From January 2020, when Korea's first Covid-19 case was reported, through March, 28,011 people were charged with violating the Infectious Disease Prevention Act. By charge, 24,696 were accused of violating the business curfew or restrictions on the number of people who could gather, 2,474 of breaking quarantine, 453 for other violations, and 388 for interfering with epidemiological investigations.
