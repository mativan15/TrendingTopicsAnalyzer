When New York-born TikTok comedian Adam Waheed moved to Los Angeles to act, he wasn't planning on running a comedy empire on social media. But roles were hard to come by — so he took to Instagram. Hundreds, if not thousands, of videos later, he's a star.On Thursday, he launched a comedy network called WAHAHA with Fireside, a startup and Clubhouse competitor co-founded by Dallas Mavericks owner and "Shark Tank" judge Mark Cuban. Fireside helps performers like Waheed do live performances while interacting virtually with their audiences.
