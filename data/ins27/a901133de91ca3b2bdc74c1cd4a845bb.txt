The Dow soared more than 500 points on Friday after a report said the Federal Reserve will likely debate on signaling plans for a smaller interest rate hike in December, while declines in social media firms capped gains on the Nasdaq.
In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 534 points, or 1.9%, at 30,872, while the S&P 500 was up 1.6%.
The Nasdaq climbed 1.3%.
Some Fed officials have begun sounding out their desire to slow down the pace of increases soon, according to the Wall Street Journal, and how to signal plans to approve a smaller increase in December.
