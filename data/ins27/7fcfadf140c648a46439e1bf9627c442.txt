The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was hovering below 101.5 on Monday morning. The index earlier notched a five-week low as fears of further aggressive interest rate hikes from the Fed, beyond those expected in June and July, eased over the past week.Earnings in Europe on Monday are set to come from S4 Capital, while data releases will include Spanish and German preliminary inflation prints for May, along with euro area economic sentiment and consumer confidence surveys.
