Joe Biden has been missing in action on the midterm campaign trail amid dismal approval ratings. 
The US president has not held a campaign rally since the beginning of September with less than three weeks to go until voting begins. 
The race is tightening in key states, reflecting sinking Democratic hopes of maintaining the party's already fragile control of Congress. 
Mr Biden's approval rating sits at just 42.3 per cent.
Mr Biden's approval ratings are reflected in his push to keep a low profile, with observers arguing that his decision to avoid public rallies during the midterms campaign shows how little he can do to help running Democrats.
