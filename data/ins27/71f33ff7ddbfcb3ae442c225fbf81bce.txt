The 2022 races for the Illinois Supreme Court have been far from supreme. The candidates aspire to the state's high court, but their campaigns are wallowing in the mud.

In the final weeks of the election season, the contests for two Supreme Court seats are getting welcome attention. Judicial races usually fly way below the radar. They are last on the ballot, and most voters go to the polls not even knowing the candidates' names, much less their credentials.

These campaigns have been dominated by partisan politics and charges of bias, fueled by tumultuous times.
