Arkady Volozh, CEO of Russia's biggest internet company Yandex, has resigned after being added to the European Union's list of individuals sanctioned as part of its response to the illegal invasion of Ukraine.
Yandex is an analogue of Google, having started as a search engine and then added numerous productivity, cloud, and social services. The company has since expanded into ride-sharing and e-commerce.
The European Union (EU) last Friday named Volozh and many others as part of its sixth round of sanctions against Russia.
