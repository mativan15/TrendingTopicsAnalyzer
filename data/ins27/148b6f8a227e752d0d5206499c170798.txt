Some fake GoFundMe campaigns claiming to help Amber Heard pay Johnny Depp $10.35 million after he won his defamation lawsuit have sprung up in the wake of Heard's attorney saying her client could not afford to pay him.

The contentious court battle over Heard's Washington Post op-ed about experiencing domestic abuse came to an end Wednesday with Depp emerging victorious. Heard was ordered to pay her ex-husband $15 million in damages, although state rules limited it to $10.35 million. Depp was ordered to pay Heard $2 million for her claim of defamation against his lawyer.
