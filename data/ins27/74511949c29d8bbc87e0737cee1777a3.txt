Ahlgren Law is staying at 33 N. LaSalle after completing a 15,000-square-foot-lease renewal this week.

In the current volatile leasing markets, with many companies, especially law firms, choosing to downsize their spaces and move out of the Loop entirely, the deal illustrates how some landlords are using concessions to keep their tenants.

Ben Azulay, principal at Bradford Allen and the broker on the deal, said Ahlgren Law had been at 33 N. LaSalle for almost 10 years and were looking for an upgraded space.
