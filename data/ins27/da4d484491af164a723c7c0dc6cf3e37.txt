Actor James Nesbitt has said he is 'saddened' after being targeted in menacing graffiti.The message threatening the Cold Feet actor, which was daubed on a wall in the predominantly unionist town of Portrush in Co Antrim, is being treated by police as a hate crime.It appeared weeks after Nesbitt was the keynote speaker at an event in Dublin organised by a campaign group advocating for a united Ireland.It's a bit unnerving of course … it really saddens me because I am just sorry this has been brought to Portrush, brought to my neighbours, brought to a community I loveThe threat to the Northern Ireland-born actor referenced the King and Crown and also included a hostile reference to the Pope.
