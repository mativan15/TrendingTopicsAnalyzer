Sugaree Baking Co. in St. Louis' Dogtown neighborhood has had a long success in selling lots and selling quickly.

After 26 years, co-owners Pat Rutherford-Pettine and her husband, Jimmy Pettine, are selling the business.

The couple has had their fair share of challenges. And even still, their toughest day will be when they close the doors to the love they share.

"The last three years have been the best three years of Sugaree," Rutherford-Pettine said. But even booming business is not enough to stay open.
