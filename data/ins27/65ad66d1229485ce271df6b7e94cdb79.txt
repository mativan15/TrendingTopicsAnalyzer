More homes, more people and a growing economic clout. A snapshot of Hamilton's economy shows the city in rude health, especially when compared to the country's other large centres. Hamilton's gross domestic product (GDP) climbed to $12 billion in 2021 – a 4.3% increase since 2019. The increase outstrips the growth rates of Auckland (0.4%), Christchurch (3.1%) and Wellington (3.3%) during the same period. And it's not just Hamilton's economy on the rise, with the city building a record 1497 new homes in 2021 – up 6% on 2020.
