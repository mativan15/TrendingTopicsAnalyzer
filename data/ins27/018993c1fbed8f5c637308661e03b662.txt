Sam Faiers has showed off her sprawling back garden of her £2.25million Surrey mansion. The mum-of-three, 31, regularly gives fans glimpses of her massive home that she shares with Paul Knightley and their three children. The Mummy Diaries star shared a snap of herself lounging in the family's Jacuzzi in her garden - which is so big it could be mistaken a park. Another snap shows the family all sat around a large eight-seater rattan table with a fire pit in the middle. Behind them were four sun loungers and matching tables, adorned with blue striped cushions.
