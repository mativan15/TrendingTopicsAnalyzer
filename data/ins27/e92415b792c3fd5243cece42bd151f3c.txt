What Is the October Effect?

What goes bump in the night? According to some investors, it's the stock market in October.

As early as the 19th century, author Mark Twain took note of the October Effect, writing in his novel, Pudd'nhead Wilson, 'October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks,' before humorously adding, 'The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.'

While many investors fear October as a time of roller coaster-like volatility, grim investor sentiment, and precipitous declines—things might not be as scary as they think.
