I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! casting Mike Tindall has been labelled a smart move by a royal expert, who reckons he has been ‘underused' by the monarchy. 
Rumours have been swirling that the former England rugby player, who is married to the late Queen's grand-daughter Zara Tindall, is set to jet off to the Australian jungle to take part in the reality show.
If true, he would become the first royal family member to take part in the hugely popular series, but The Times is reporting that he ‘did not seek' permission from the new king.
