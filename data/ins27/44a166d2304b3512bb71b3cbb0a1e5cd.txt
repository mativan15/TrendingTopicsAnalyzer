Peter Dutton says Labor's handling of Australia's recognition of West Jerusalem was 'ham-fisted' and undermines trust in the Albanese government.Diplomatic tensions have erupted after Labor reversed a 2018 Morrison government policy recognising West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reverting to Tel Aviv.The decision has been welcomed by Palestinian advocates in Australia.But it blindsided leaders of the local Jewish community and was announced on a religious holy day when the Israeli embassy in Canberra was closed.
