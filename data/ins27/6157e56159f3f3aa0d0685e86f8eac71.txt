Dan Walker has revealed he will be marking the first day of his new TV life on Channel 5, where he moved in a lucrative new deal from BBC Breakfast, with an appearance on rival Good Morning Britain on Monday.
He announced the slightly unexpected news on Twitter on Sunday, with his usual trademark humour, even giving a shoutout to his longstanding presenter ‘wife' at the Beeb, Sally Nugent.
‘First day of my new TV life tomorrow and it will start in a very strange way… on @GMB,' he wrote, with a blushing and laugh-cry emoji.
