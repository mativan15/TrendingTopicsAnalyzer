The country's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in 11 years in May on strong demand and new orders despite inflationary pressures touching new highs, according to a survey.
The S&P Global India Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.9 in May from 57.9 in April, its highest since April 2011. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction. The growth was led by substantial pick-up in new business growth amid demand recovering following the reopening of the economy after the Covid lockdowns.
