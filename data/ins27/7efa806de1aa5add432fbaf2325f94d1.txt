By Michael D. Shear and Julie Creswell, New York TimesWASHINGTON — The nationwide shortage of baby formula is getting worse, with an increasing number of retailers and online sellers posting out-of-stock notices even as President Joe Biden met Wednesday with executives of five baby food companies and announced new shipments of formula from Europe to help restock American shelves.
Baby formula has been in short supply across the United States for weeks, the result of the shutdown in February of the leading infant formula manufacturing plant, operated by Abbott Laboratories, because of contamination concerns.
