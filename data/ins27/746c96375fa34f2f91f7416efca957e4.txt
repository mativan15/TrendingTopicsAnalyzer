Tampa Bay will be without one of its top safeties for the immediate future.

Injuries have prevented the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from reaching their full potential six games through the 2022 campaign. It was painfully obvious once again during the team's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday afternoon, who hadn't won a game in over a month.

The defense was decimated in the fourth quarter by backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky with the Buccaneers missing cornerback Sean Murphy-Bunting, safety Logan Ryan, and safety Mike Edwards.
