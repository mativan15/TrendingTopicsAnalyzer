Donald Trump is set to appear at a deposition hearing as part of a long-running defamation case relating to a woman who alleges the former president raped her in the 1990s.Earlier this month, New York District judge Lewis Kaplan ordered Trump to answer questions under oath in relation to the claims made by magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.Carroll said that the former president smeared her character when he denied allegations he raped her at a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s. Carroll filed her suit in 2019, with Trump's legal team spending three years fighting the case.
