The Yankees come home now after scoring just two earned runs in two games at Minute Maid Park, then talking afterward about the roof being open and a mean old wind blowing through there on Thursday night, allegedly helping the Astros and hurting them because Aaron Judge's ball wasn't a Yankee Stadium home run in the 8th inning. It was determined afterward that Judge's ball would have been a homer at the Stadium, and only at the Stadium. Maybe so. Maybe he'll hit them far enough at the Stadium this weekend and look like the home run king of baseball and keep the Yankees from getting rolled by the Astros again.
