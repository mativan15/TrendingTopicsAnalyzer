Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has strongly refuted suggestions his comments about Manchester City's spending power were xenophobic.In his press conference prior to Sunday's 1-0 victory over the Premier League champions the Reds boss said no-one could compete with their north-west rival's financial might.'There are three clubs (the Gulf state-owned City, Newcastle and Paris St Germain) in world football who can do what they want financially. It's legal and everything, fine, but they can do what they want,' was his assessment of the current balance of power.
