June 03, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medidata, a Dassault Systèmes company, presented new research on predicting cytokine release syndrome (CRS) resulting from longitudinal CAR T-cell therapy (CAR T) at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting being held June 3-7 in Chicago.

'CAR T therapy has been a significant innovation in cancer care – but as with any new and complex therapy, it has brought its own challenges and problems to solve. CRS – a life-threatening toxic immune reaction to CAR T therapy – has been seen in a meaningful number of patients and has led to at least 15 clinical trial failures for new therapies since 2016,' said Jacob Aptekar, MD, vice president at Medidata.
