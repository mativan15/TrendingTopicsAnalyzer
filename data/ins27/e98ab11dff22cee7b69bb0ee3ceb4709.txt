HYDERABAD: Despite a surge in cashless payments triggering India's digital leap, the modest Rs 100 note remains the most preferred denomination for cash transactions . And the high-value Rs 2000 note is least preferred by citizens, though the 500-rupee denomination remains the most widely-used currency. These and other interesting findings were part of Reserve Bank of India 's (2021-2022) report released on Friday.The survey, which was carried out in rural, semi-urban, urban, and metropolitan areas across 28 states and three Union Territories, also found only 3% citizens do not recognize security features on bank notes , including the Mahatma Gandhi image watermark or the windowed security thread.
