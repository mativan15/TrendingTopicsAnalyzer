CNN — Economic factors, not just lockdown-induced forced proximity, played a key role in last year's "baby bump," according to the economists behind a new working paper released earlier this week.Economists from UCLA, Northwestern and Princeton universities found that pandemic trends, such as increased work flexibility, helped push up US birth rates last year to 6.2% from pre-pandemic levels, marking the first major reversal in declining fertility rates since 2007 and counteracting a longstanding economic certainty: Birth rates don't increase during economic downturns.
