The University of Calicut is planning to hold an adalat involving aided college managements ahead of preparing reservation rosters for appointment of differently abled applicants as teachers in such institutions. According to sources, the decisions taken at the adalat will be forwarded to the Syndicate for approval. Tom K. Thomas, head of the Syndicate standing committee on legal affairs, told The Hindu on Tuesday that the university would have to take into account certain issues while filling backlog posts.
