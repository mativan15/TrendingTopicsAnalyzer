Gear: PXG 0211 drivers, fairway woods and hybrids
Price: $299 (drivers), $249 (fairway woods and hybrids)
Who It's For: Golfers who love classic-looking equipment and simple designs made to provide more distance on a budget.
The Skinny: With the price of many new woods having climbed in recent years, PXG designed the 0211 drivers, fairway woods and hybrids to be high-performing alternatives at a lower price.
The Deep Dive: In July, PXG released the newest version of its 0211 irons, the 0211 XCON, designed to utilize several technologies and features originally added to the brand's top-shelf 0311 family but at a more budget-friendly price.
