Househunters searching for a bargain should look to Ohai, in the deep south, which currently has the cheapest house in the country for sale. The two-bedroom cottage is on the market for offers over $135,000, and – excluding leasehold properties and houses for removal – that makes it the listing with the lowest price nationwide, according to Trade Me Property. That asking price was less than the 20% deposit required for a house going for the national median price of $811,000 in September. Built in the 1930s, the 107m² house is on a 1012m² section, which is north-facing with rural and town views, and has a two-car garage.
