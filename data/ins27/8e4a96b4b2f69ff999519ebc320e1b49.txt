The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a controversial Texas law that would've banned social media platforms from restricting user posts based on their views.

CNN reports the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling arrives after the tech industry argued in a petition that the Texas law would violate companies' First Amendment rights to control what content they display on their platforms. The law, known as HB 20, would've banned all social media platforms with 50 million or more active users from censoring content based on people's viewpoints.
