Streaming giant Netflix has postponed the documentary about Prince Harry and Princess Meghan to 2023. The postponement comes on the back of severe backlash Netflix received for season 5 of the popular show The Crown, which is supposed to premiere on November 9, according to reports. The Harry and Meghan show was scheduled to be aired in December. However, several reports suggest that it was nonsensical to stream the show just a month after The Crown's season 5, which explores the rumored relationship between Prince Philip and Penny Knatchbull.
