DENVER — For much of her first reelection campaign, U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert enjoyed a wide financial lead ahead of her Republican and Democratic challengers — often holding more money than all of them combined — but her margin is shrinking.The most recent batch of campaign finance reports, filed Friday, show that Boebert's Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, raised nearly twice as much money as the incumbent congresswoman.Between July and September Frisch raised nearly $1.7 million to Boebert's $936,000, Federal Election Commission data shows.
