When billionaire Ken Griffin announced in June that he planned to move the headquarters of his Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel to Miami, he cited the Windy City's high crime rate as a key factor.

'Chicago is like Afghanistan, on a good day,' he said during a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago in 2021.

The move highlights a growing trend of corporate relocations nationwide. This comes as violent crime has increased in most U.S. cities since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.
