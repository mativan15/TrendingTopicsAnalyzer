Consider this a public service announcement. Arkane Studios is having a rip-roaring good sale on Steam right now to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the launch of Dishonored. Oh man, just typing that makes me feel old. Has it really been ten years? Dishonored is a wonderful game that I still enjoy coming back to from time to time. It's on sale for the ridiculously awesome price of $2.49. The game's excellent DLC is also on sale. I was less fond of Dishonored 2 (which is also on sale) but very much enjoyed Death Of The Outsider, a stand-alone DLC that's well worth your time and money.
