You've heard of Taco Tuesday, but what about new Star Wars toy Tuesday? No, it doesn't have the same ring, but that's what's currently happening. We're currently in the midst of a 'nine-week gift giving celebration' called Star Wars Bring Home the Galaxy. The program includes weekly reveals of all sorts of brand-new Star Wars products from every area: toys, games, books, you name it. And the subjects are spread across the galaxy too, from the original trilogy and Clone Wars TV show, all the way up to newer shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
