Despite the midterm election season looking increasingly grim for Democrats, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) says his focus on the empowerment of individual voters has him in a good spot in a notoriously 'purplish' state.
'Colorado is a very independently minded, freedom-oriented state, and they don't want Republicans or Democrats telling them what to do,' Polis told The Hill.
'They value accurate information, they value facts, and people should be empowered to make their own decisions, whether that's marijuana, whether it's wearing a mask — we're a state that values freedom.
