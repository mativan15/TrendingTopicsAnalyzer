D.A. Davidson on Thursday cut its rating on financial-services firm Comerica Inc. to neutral from buy, while Citigroup reiterated a buy rating and said the stock's drop on its results may be overblown. Both analysts, however, reduced their 2022 earnings targets for Comerica CMA, +0.16%, which is a component of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.76%. D.A. Davidson's Peter Winter said one key factor in his downgrade is that Comerica's net interest income may peak in the fourth quarter, with some downside risk. He also cited deposit outflows that are 'more than expected and will likely continue.
