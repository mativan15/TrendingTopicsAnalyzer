HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings plans to invest more than 3 billion yuan($448 million) in its China operations, Chief Executive Noel Quinn told state news agency Xinhua, saying he sees challenges for the economy but also opportunities for investment.

Quinn said the investment would be carried out over a five-year period running until 2025 without specifying the divisions that would receive the cash.

While COVID-19 cases in Shanghai had started to fall after a two-month lockdown, Quinn said the challenges confronting the Chinese economy should not be "understated".
