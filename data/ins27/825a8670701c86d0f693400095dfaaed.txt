By Clarence Leong Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. said it is on course to offer to fly to nearly 60 destinations by the end of the year, as Hong Kong's recent removal of hotel-quarantine requirements for arrivals helped boost travel sentiment. The airline said Monday that it carried 265,845 passengers in September, just about double the amount from a year earlier, though the figure is still down 89% compared with prepandemic levels in September 2019. Its passenger load factor improved 26.7 percentage points to 72.
