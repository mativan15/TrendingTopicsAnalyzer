Taylor Heinicke will make his first start of the season for Washington against the Packers.

After a four-game losing streak, the Washington Commanders finally got off the schneid with a 12-7 win over the Chicago Bears on Thursday night.

Now, they'll look to continue their winning ways on Sunday when they host the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.

SI Sportsbook lists the Packers as a 5.5-point favorite over Washington, but a multitude of factors could cause the odds to swing either way.

Carson Wentz is expected to miss four to six weeks due to a fractured ring finger on his throwing hand.
