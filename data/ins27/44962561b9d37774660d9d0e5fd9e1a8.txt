After hearing from local environmental groups objecting to its construction, the Coastal Commission on Friday approved an application submitted by the city of Newport Beach for construction of a confined aquatic disposal site, known as a CAD, in Newport Harbor.

The purpose of the CAD is to contain sediment that is not safe for ocean release. The city had been considering locating it in lower Newport Harbor since 2019.

Commissioner Matt O'Malley was the lone dissenting vote on the project, which was considered on the final day of the Coastal Commission's October meetings in San Diego.
