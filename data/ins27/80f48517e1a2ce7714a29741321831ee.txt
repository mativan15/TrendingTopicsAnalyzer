Food hygiene rating.

Six restaurants, cafes, and takeaways in Oxfordshire have been handed new food hygiene ratings following council inspections, but only one of them has been given five stars.

The hygiene rating system is used by local authorities to determine how food outlets store, handle and prepare the food they distribute to the public.

Restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, supermarkets and any other food shops are also included in the scheme.
