A churro caterer is accused of sexually assaulting teens hoping to get a job at his California business, media reports say.

A 17-year-old girl reported being sexually assaulted by a Riverside man after meeting with him 'at his business being run out of his apartment' in late August, according to a Thursday, Oct. 20, Facebook post from the Riverside Police Department.

The 24-year-old man owns Billions Mobile Inc., which also operates as Cali Catering or Churros-N-Cream Catering.

Churros-N-Cream did not return McClatchy News' request for comment on Friday, Oct.
