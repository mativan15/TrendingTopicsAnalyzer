The 21-year-old was bailed following his arrest in January on suspicion of rape, assault and making threats to kill.  Officers arrived at his mansion this morning and arrested him on suspicion of contacting his alleged victim in a breach of the conditions set out. Greenwood was initially bailed on February 2, and was due to answer the bail on April 30, but this was pushed back following a court hearing in June.
