AFPEven as applications for adoptions are increasing year-on-year, most Indians look for 0-2 years old ‘healthy child'.Even as Indians are opening up to the idea of adoption by single parents or adopting a sibling for their biological child, they remain averse to accepting children with special needs. Fewer than 50 children with special needs found a home within India in the past three financial years, accounting for less than 1% of the total 9,443 in-country adoptions between 2019-20 and 2021-22.
