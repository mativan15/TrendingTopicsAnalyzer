The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) expressed relief and happiness on Tuesday at a Delhi court order that rejected the CBI's plea to cancel the bail of its leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav in a case related to the alleged IRCTC scam. RJD spokesperson and MP Manoj Jha said the decision vindicates his party's faith in the judiciary. "This is a moment of a lot of relief and happiness. Tejashwi Yadav always expressed his complete faith in the judiciary and it has been vindicated," Jha told reporters soon after the judge rejected the federal probe agency's application.
