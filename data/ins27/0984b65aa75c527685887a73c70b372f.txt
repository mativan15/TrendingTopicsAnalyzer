Chelsea hero Cesc Fabregas has urged Barcelona to avoid selling Gavi to Liverpool despite the Reds having been linked with a move for his services ahead of the summer transfer window. The 17-year-old has emerged as one of Europe's hottest talents since breaking through at Barcelona and is thought to be on Liverpool's radar as the Merseyside giants weigh up a move for his signature in advance of next season.Gavi has been locked in talks with Barcelona over a new and improved contract in recent months but reports have claimed that both parties have reached an impasse and could fail to agree terms in a major boost to Liverpool's hopes of bringing the midfielder to Anfield.
