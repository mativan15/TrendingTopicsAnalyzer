The UK's annual inflation rate was 10.1 per cent in September, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said on Wednesday, October 19 that the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 per cent last month. Food prices increased by an annual rate of 14.6 per cent and the cost of going out by 9.7 per cent.The 10.1 per cent rate was the same level as last July and a peak not otherwise seen since 1982. The July increase was mainly due to surging fuel and food prices.The rise will put pressure on the Bank of England to further increase interest rates next month, and some analysts expect as much as a full percentage point increase.
