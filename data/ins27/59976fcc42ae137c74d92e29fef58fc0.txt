CLEVELAND (AP) — Gerrit Cole brought the Yankees back from the brink. They're Bronx bound, still chasing a championship.

Cole gave New York what it needed, seven solid innings and Harrison Bader hit a two-run homer as the Yankees forced a decisive fifth game in the AL Division Series with a 4-2 win over the Cleveland Guardians in Game 4 on Sunday night.

There was no margin for error, no second chances. Cole, who failed in a similar spot last October, had the weight of New York's season, the one Aaron Judge's home-run swing made historic, on his shoulders.
