Variety - Film News 'Halloween Ends' slayed the box office competition, collecting 41.25 million from 3,901 North American theaters in its opening weekend.The movie had a softer start than expected (projections were closer to 50 million to 55 million) but it's still impressive considering its simultaneous release on Peacock likely cut into ticket sales. It's the first movie to open above 40 million since Jordan Peele's 'Nope' kicked off in late July to 44 million.
