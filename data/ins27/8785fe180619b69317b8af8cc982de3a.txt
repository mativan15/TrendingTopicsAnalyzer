Two men are now in jail after they were shot by El Paso police while allegedly attacking officers with a knife and rocks in separate confrontations recently.

Jonathan Michael Aguilar Kurzenberger, 22, of Northeast El Paso, was booked into jail on Friday after being released from a hospital after he was wounded in a police shooting on Sept. 2 after allegedly shoplifting. A jail booking photo shows him wearing a head bandage and a protective white helmet, the kind worn by patients recovering from a head injury.
