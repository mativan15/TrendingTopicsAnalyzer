Most Indian farmers begin planting cotton at the onset of monsoon rains in June, although some with irrigated fields start as early as May.MUMBAI/ AHMEDABAD: Cotton planting in India, the world's biggest producer of the fibre, could jump as much as 15% in 2022 to an all-time high, as strong prices prompt farmers to switch away from other crops, an industry association said. Higher output could help cool the rally in global and local cotton prices, which is hurting Asian apparel makers. Area planted to cotton in India could rise as much as 15% from last year because the crop is providing far better returns than alternatives, said Atul Ganatra, president of the Cotton Association of India.
