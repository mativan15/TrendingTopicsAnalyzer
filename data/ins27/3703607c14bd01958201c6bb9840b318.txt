Commencing an investigation, the Kerala Lokayukta has issued a notice to former state health minister K K Shailaja and seven others, including IAS officials and private firms, in connection with the alleged corruption in the purchase of PPE kits and other surgical equipment amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The CPI(M) leader, however, said the decision to buy PPE kits at a higher price was taken with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's knowledge.
The anti-corruption body on Friday issued the notice based on a complaint filed by Congress leader Veena S Nair, who had arraigned 13 persons as respondents in her complaint.
