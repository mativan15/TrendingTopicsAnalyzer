 Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he supports the measures taken by the federal government to end the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protests last winter.
Ford says he worked with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several mayors after hundreds gathered in downtown Ottawa in January in what local officials called an occupation that lasted several weeks.
