The Punjab Vigilance Bureau has shot off a fresh letter to Ludhiana police commissioner demanding an 'action taken report' in a complaint it had filed against the Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu for allegedly 'threatening vigilance sleuths and creating obstruction in public duty' during the arrest of former Congress minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in grain-lifting transport tenders case.
The letter from SSP (vigilance), Ludhiana range, Ravinderpal Singh Sandhu comes after Bittu went live on Facebook Thursday, and vented against vigilance and AAP government 'for taking Ashu on police remand to Nawanshahr (SBS Nagar) for questioning in another case ahead of decision on his bail' and arresting another Congress leader Gagandeep Sunny Bhalla.
