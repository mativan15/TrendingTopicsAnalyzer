President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced that his administration would sell off 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an attempt to bring down prices at the pump ahead of the midterm elections in November.

'With my announcement today, we're going to continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices at a time when the actions of other countries cause such volatility,' Biden said in a speech at the White House.

The move completes the 180-million-barrel release plan first outlined in March.
