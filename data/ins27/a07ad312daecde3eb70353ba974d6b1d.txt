The current system, in place for a decade and costing about $2.6 billion a year, offers 18 weeks of leave to the primary carer and another two weeks in 'dad and partner pay' for the secondary carer regardless of whether they are men or women.Grattan Institute chief Danielle Wood, a member of the taskforce, called for the expansion of the scheme to 26 weeks last year on the grounds the $600 million additional cost would lead to stronger economic growth from greater participation in the workforce by women.
