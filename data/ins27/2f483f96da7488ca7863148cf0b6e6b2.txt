Broncos linebacker Aaron Patrick suffered a season-ending knee injury during Monday night's loss to the Chargers.

Patrick was chasing Chargers punt returner DeAndre Carter near the sideline on an overtime punt. Carter went out of bounds and Patrick's momentum carried him into a collision with a staff member on the sideline. Patrick tried to slow himself before making contact and his left leg came down awkwardly on a black mat.
