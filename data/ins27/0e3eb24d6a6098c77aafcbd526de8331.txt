It was a reunion of police officers with a difference. Nearly 270 Sub-Inspectors of Police of 1991 batch from the two Telugu States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh assembled here at RBVRR Telangana State Police Academy on Sunday to express their gratitude to their selector and retired IPS officer K. Vijaya Rama Rao.
'After our parents, he is the god-given family head for all the 421 SIs selected by him in 1991 by purely selecting us on merit basis,' said the 1991 batch SIs speaking at a function felicitating the octogenarian retired police officer.
