NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Billionaire Jim Irsay's private collection of American history artifacts is on display to the public for free for just one day in New York on Friday.

"I want no money," said Irsay, who is owner of the National Football League's Indianapolis Colts team. "This is my effort to make the world a better place... It's to allow people to see it and share these things."

Irsay, 62, amassed the collection over about 25 years. It features instruments of rock n' roll legends, American literature manuscripts, and the first national Thanksgiving declaration in 1777.
