Jackson underwent surgery on his right ankle in late August, two weeks before the start of the regular season, and missed two of the first three games. He has played the past two weeks, but has struggled most of the time.

Jackson isn't using the ankle surgery as an excuse for his inconsistent play.

'My ankle is alright. I'm back practicing and playing with my team,' Jackson said Friday as the Chargers continued preparations for Monday night's game against the Denver Broncos. 'I'm playing through it, still rehabbing and treating it.
