While a high-profile Netflix docuseries and the glitzy Miami Grand Prix have helped Formula One attract a significant amount of media attention recently, IndyCar is quietly finding its own footing ahead of its most high-profile race, the Indianapolis 500.

Mark Miles—the president and CEO of Penske Entertainment Corporation, which owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500 race—said IndyCar's total media audience has increased in the high single digits over each of the last few years, TV viewership this season is up 34% YoY (through May 15) and the racing circuit is close to operating in the black–noteworthy for a sport that required ‘significant annual investments' a decade ago.
