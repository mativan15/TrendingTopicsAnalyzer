Arsenal have joined fellow London club West Ham United in being linked with a summer swoop for Lille midfielder Amadou Onana.

The duo finished fifth and seventh respectively in 2021-2022 and both will play European football next term. The Gunners just missed out on a place in the Champions League and will have to make do with the Europa League. And, having reached the semi-finals of Europe's second-tier competition last season, the Hammers will operate in the Europa Conference League.
