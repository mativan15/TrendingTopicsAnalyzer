NFTs and tattoo culture are two hot markets—but there isn't typically a significant overlap between them. Indelible, a new startup launched by Mike Amoia, is merging the two worlds together. Indelible is a community-centered NFT company bridging the gap between tattoo culture and Web3. The company is the first of its kind to help NFT owners utilize their IP rights by adding tattoos to their profile pics, or PFPs.
