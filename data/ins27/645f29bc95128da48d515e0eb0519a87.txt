June 03, 2022 07:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The CBIZ Small Business Employment Index ('SBEI') reported a seasonally adjusted decrease of 1.91% in May, a stark change from the unseasonably strong hiring growth found in the April report. The CBIZ SBEI tracks payroll and hiring trends for over 3,600 companies that have 300 or fewer employees, providing broad insight into small business trends.



'The weakness in employment reflects growing uncertainties for companies, as the cost of running a business increases and consumers react to larger economic pressures,' said Anna Rathbun, CFA, Chief Investment Officer, CBIZ, Inc.
