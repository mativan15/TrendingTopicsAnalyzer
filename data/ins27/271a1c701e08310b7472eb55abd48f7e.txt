The Nasdaq Composite witnessed a brutal sell-off so far in 2022. The index lost 31% of its value so far as investors decided to dump high-growth companies, in part because the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to curb the surging inflation. On a positive note, the correction also opened an opportunity for investors to buy some great companies at attractive valuations.
The stocks for electric vehicle (EV) specialist Tesla (TSLA 0.38%) and chipmaker Marvell Technology Group (MRVL -0.34%) are down 38% and 56%, respectively, so far this year.
