WINNIPEG - The Manitoba government is starting a review of personal and business taxes with the aim of becoming more competitive with other provinces.While Manitoba has been recording annual deficits almost every year since 2009 and is facing demands to spend more money on health care, the Progressive Conservative government said a more competitive tax regime would attract more businesses and boost provincial coffers.'The way we will improve education and social services, health care, is by growing our economy,' Premier Heather Stefanson said Wednesday.
