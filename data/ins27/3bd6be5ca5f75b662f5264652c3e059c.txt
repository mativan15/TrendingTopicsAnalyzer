(Reuters) - Sanctioned Russian lender VTB Bank, which is fighting claims in U.S. court that it helped fund the downing of an international passenger plane eight years ago, has reached an agreement to bring on new lawyers after the global law firm representing it bowed out over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.New York-based criminal defense lawyer and ex-federal prosecutor Marc Agnifilo, whose past clients have included former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, convicted NXIVM cult founder Keith Raniere and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, is poised to take over the case from Latham & Watkins, VTB said in a filing Thursday in Manhattan federal court.
