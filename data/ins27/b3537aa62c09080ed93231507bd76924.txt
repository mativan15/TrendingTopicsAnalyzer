Kirloskar Brothers Limited (KBL) on Sunday refuted allegations that it had spent Rs 274 crore towards payment of professional legal expenses and consultancy charges in the personal dispute of its Chairman and Managing Director Sanjay Kirloskar against his brothers Rahul and Atul. Kirloskar Pneumatic Co Ltd Executive Chairman Rahul Kirloskar and Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd Executive Chairman Atul Kirloskar had on Saturday accused KBL of "mis-utilising shareholder resources of a publicly listed company and misusing regulatory machinery" after being cleared of insider trading charges by the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).
