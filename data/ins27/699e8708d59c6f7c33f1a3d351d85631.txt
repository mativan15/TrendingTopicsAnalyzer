The running game of the Los Angeles Rams has been nonexistent this season as the duo of Darrell Henderson JR. and Cam Akers has been largely ineffective. Sean McVay and Les Snead have revealed that the Rams are fielding trade offers for Akers to incite a fresh start for both sides, so Los Angeles could be in the market for adding a running back.

The Rams are high on Kyren Williams, but the rookie running back is on injured reserve, though he could be activated to the 21-day return window sometime soon.
