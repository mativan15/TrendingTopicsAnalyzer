Another developer has hit out at the Xbox Series S and suggests studios are petitioning Microsoft to stop them having to support it.
Earlier in the week a developer at Batman: Arkham creator Rocksteady made the claim that the Xbox Series S has ‘hamstrung' the entire generation of console, because all multiformat titles have to be able to work on the less powerful version of the Xbox Series X.
This caused considerable debate in fan and development circles, with the dev that started it all quickly deleting his Twitter account.
