By selling US$25m worth of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock at an average sell price of US$610 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. After the stock price dropped 7.2% last week, the company's market value declined by US$14b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
