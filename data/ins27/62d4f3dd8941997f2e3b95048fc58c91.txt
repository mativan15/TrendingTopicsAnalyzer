Penn State is back home to take on Minnesota in what should be another highly anticipated matchup for them.

The Nittany Lions have struggled a bit against Big Ten opponents this season. They are currently 2-1, losing to just Michigan. However, they were blown out by Michigan and they barely beat a struggling Northwestern team.

As for Minnesota, last week was their first real test of the season against perhaps one of the most surprising teams in college football in the Illinois Fighting Illini. They are supposed to be in year two of a rebuild, and they beat Minnesota last week 26-14.
