Australian tech billionaire Scott Farquhar started a war of words with Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the latter's return-to-work policies. But a Twitter feud with Musk might need to wait, as Farquhar's $48 billion software company is dealing with a serious hacker problem.

Musk, the world's richest man, made waves earlier this week when a leaked email he sent to Tesla employees on Tuesday revealed how the CEO really feels about working from home.

'Remote work is no longer acceptable,' the subject of the email read, as Musk announced that white-collar Tesla employees who do not report to the office at least 40 hours a week can start looking for a new job.
