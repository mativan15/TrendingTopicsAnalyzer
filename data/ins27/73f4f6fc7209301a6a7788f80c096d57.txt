Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has revealed footage from the game's original N64 prototype - and it shows a surprisingly fully-formed version of the game.A new video unveils footage from Dragon King: The Fighting Game – the original game that formed the basis for Super Smash Bros.'There were no special moves, dodges, or even items yet,' explained Sakurai. 'But the game's rules were basically the same as Smash Bros.''It had smash attacks, mid-air jumps, shields, dashes, and five-direction aerial attacks,' he added.
