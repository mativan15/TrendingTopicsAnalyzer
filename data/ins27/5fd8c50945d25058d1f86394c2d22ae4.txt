LAGOS (Reuters) - Police fired several rounds of tear gas at demonstrators marching at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos on Thursday to mark the second anniversary of peaceful protests against police brutality that ended in a hail of gunfire.

Reuters witnesses saw police fire five rounds of tear gas in an effort to disperse around 200 people marching at the gate, some waving Nigerian flags and singing "solidarity forever." Police also arrested two people, according to a Reuters witness.
