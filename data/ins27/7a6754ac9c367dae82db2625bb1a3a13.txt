Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying 'the aggressive attempts of the Union government' to impose Hindi are 'impractical and divisive in character', and puts non-Hindi-speaking people in a very disadvantageous position in many respects.A parliamentary panel has recently recommended that the medium of instruction in technical and non-technical higher education institutes such as the IITs in Hindi-speaking states should be Hindi and in other parts of the country, the respective regional languages.
