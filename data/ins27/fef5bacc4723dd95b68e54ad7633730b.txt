Cedar Point doesn't owe its 2020 season pass holders refunds for two months of closures in 2020, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled Thursday.

Cedar Point customers who purchased 2020 season passes aren't entitled to a refund for the two months the park was closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled Thursday.

In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that Cedar Fair L.P., the owner of Cedar Point, Kings Island and other amusement parks, did not breach its contract when Cedar Point remained closed in May and June 2020 because of the global pandemic.
