Matisse Thybulle and the Sixers are reportedly discussing a possible contract extension.

The Philadelphia 76ers have an important decision to make regarding their young veteran wing, Matisse Thybulle. By Monday night, Thybulle and the Sixers have to reach an extension agreement, or else the 25-year-old will become a free agent at the end of the 2022-2023 season.

Over the offseason, there wasn't much traction on a possible Thybulle extension. When asked about the situation during media day two weeks back, Sixers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey wasn't open to publicly discussing the state of a possible extension for Thybulle.
