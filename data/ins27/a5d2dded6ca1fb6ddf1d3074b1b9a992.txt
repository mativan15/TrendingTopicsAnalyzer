The US secretary of state visited Silicon Valley this week, on a trip that experts say highlights the Biden administration's growing concerns over cybersecurity and officials' push to collaborate more closely with the US's powerful tech industry.
Antony Blinken on Monday spoke at Stanford University and was scheduled to meet with tech executives to 'highlight the key role for technology diplomacy in advancing US economic and national security', according to the state department.

The department shared few other details about the visit, and did not respond to a request for comment.
