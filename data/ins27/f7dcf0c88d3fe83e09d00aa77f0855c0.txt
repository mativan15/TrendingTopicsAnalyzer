Senior U.S. military officials have worried in recent months that a Chinese military invasion of Taiwan could be just a few years away.

The Navy's senior officer warned Wednesday that it may come even sooner than that.

Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday, Chief of Naval Operations, said a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan could occur in 2023 or even before the end of the year.

'I can't rule that out. I don't mean at all to be alarmist by saying that, it's just that we can't wish that away,' Adm.
