OTTAWA - Google is raising 'serious' concerns about a Liberal bill that seeks to require tech giants to negotiate deals to pay media outlets for making news content available online.

Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy and government relations, told a House of Commons committee today that the bill could unintentionally elevate misinformation and propaganda.

McKay says a provision in the bill that would keep platforms from giving 'undue preference' to certain news outlets would prevent Google from elevating 'trusted information sources' over lower-quality content.
