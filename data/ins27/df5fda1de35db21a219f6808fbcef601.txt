Minneapolis is moving forward with plans to create a new community safety office after the City Council approved the change on Thursday.

The split vote came two months after the city hired a new commissioner to coordinate safety services and nearly a year after voters rejected a measure to create a similar agency.

Supporters described it as a historic moment saying it could dramatically improve the quality of safety services, while opponents said they feared it would do the opposite.

The creation of a new safety office has featured prominently in debates about how the city should seek to fulfill a promise to transform public safety in response to George Floyd's murder two years ago.
