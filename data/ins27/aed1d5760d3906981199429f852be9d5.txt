By PA Media Published: 13:59 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 13:59 EDT, 18 October 2022 A court in Russia has rejected imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny's second appeal of a nine-year sentence. The 46-year-old dissident is serving the sentence, handed to him in March on charges of fraud and contempt of court, in a high-security prison. Mr Navalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin's fiercest foe, was arrested in January 2021 after returning from Germany, where he had been recuperating from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin.
