Jun. 2—Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center has carved out drawings, details and space for a new cancer center on its main campus, the hospital said Wednesday.

It released drawings of the two-level,

$80 million facility that it plans to build along St. Michael's Drive, just east of the hospital complex. The project is expected to be completed in spring 2024, with a groundbreaking in the fall. The plans reflect the hospital's desire to take ownership of its cancer care. For about 11 years, it has contracted much of that work to New Mexico Cancer Care Associates, but its contract with the independent group expires at the end of the year.
