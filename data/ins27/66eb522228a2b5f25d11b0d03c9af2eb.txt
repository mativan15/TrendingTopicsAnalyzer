JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: 
 Ted's Restaurant in Birmingham, Ala., has been serving cafeteria-style Southern cooking for almost 50 years. But when the pandemic hit, it could only sell takeout orders.
BEBA TOULOUPIS: Our business went from, like, 200-plus people a day to 30; actually, the worst of it, probably 10.
SUMMERS: Beba Touloupis is the owner of Ted's. She received a $45,000 loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. Overall, the PPP issued about $800 billion in potentially forgivable government loans to small businesses to keep their workers employed during COVID shutdowns.
