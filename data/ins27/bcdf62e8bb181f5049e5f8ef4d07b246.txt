Chinese funded overseas projects have hugely benefited the political supporters of incumbent presidents or prime ministers of those countries, including Sri Lanka, that receive the funds, reveals a new book. 'Banking on Beijing', published by Cambridge University Press, found that in those countries that receive Chinese financial support, funding for the political leader's home province increased by 52% during the years when the leader was in power. 
In the run-up to the elections, constituencies of key leaders often saw sharp increases in Chinese government-backed funding.
