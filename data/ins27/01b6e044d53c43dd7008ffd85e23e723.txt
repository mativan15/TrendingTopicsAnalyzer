Q: I recently reserved an Airbnb rental in Tallahassee, Fla. A few hours after I arrived, I was in the kitchen and saw the biggest roach I've ever seen in my life. There was no bug spray, and my boyfriend couldn't kill it. It ran under the island.

I didn't feel safe and was afraid that the roaches would get into my things. The host offered me a different rental, but I didn't hear from her for four hours. So, we left and checked into a hotel.

I contacted Airbnb, which offered to refund the cleaning fee.
