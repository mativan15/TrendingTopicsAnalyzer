The drug company Pfizer will make all of its patented medicines available at a not-for-profit price to 45 of the poorest countries.
The company announced the effort at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Pfizer is calling it "An Accord for a Healthier World." It said new medicines and vaccines would be added to the list at not-for-profit prices when they are launched.
The drugs include COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid and breast cancer drug Ibrance, the drugmaker said on Wednesday.
