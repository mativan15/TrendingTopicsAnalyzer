Have you ever wondered what happened to the sweater you bought that turned out to be too small, or the kitchen gadget you were gifted but didn't have use for? Few of us think about where products go after we return them, but, collectively, our unwanted goods have a massive business and environmental impact.Processing the average return costs companies 59% of the original sales price of the item.
