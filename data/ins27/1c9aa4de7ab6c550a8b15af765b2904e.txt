Mercedes-Benz hadn't introduced a single electric car a little over a year ago. As of Monday it now has five including a medium and large electric sedan in the EQE and EQS, a medium and large SUVs in the EQE SUV and EQS SUV and a compact SUV in the EQB SUV. It seems like a fast turnaround, but with the company promising to build only new electric platforms by 2025 and only sell electric vehicles by 2030, it just a necessary step in the right direction."The EV shift is picking up speed - especially in the luxury segment, where Mercedes-Benz belongs.
