Blockchain has merits as a technology but 'gambling' with crypto should be avoided, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Friday.

Appearing before students at Istanbul University during the Blockchain Istanbul Programme organized by his Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdoğan said he wants to see Turkey be a producer, not a consumer, in the digital assets world, according to a report by Alp Börü for CoinDesk Turkey.

Despite Turkey being a fast-growing crypto market, the Erdoğan administration is not known to be friendly towards the industry.
