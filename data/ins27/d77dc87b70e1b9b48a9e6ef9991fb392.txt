Queen Elizabeth II may have turned 96 in April, but Her Majesty will celebrate another major milestone through the weekend. 
The Platinum Jubilee marks Her Majesty's 70 years on the throne — a big tribute for the longest-serving monarch. The UK will host several activities for royal supporters and her famous family to celebrate. 
Royal Communications confirmed that Prince Harry and Duchess Megan Markle will be in attendance at the queen's birthday parade on Thursday. However, Prince Andrew will not be there.
