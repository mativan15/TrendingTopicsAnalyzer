TL;DR: A lifetime subscription to Ivacy VPN with NAT Firewall is on sale for £47.71, saving you 95% on list price.Public WiFi, although free, poses a risk for users. While public WiFi networks have gotten safer overall, they still open you up to the risk of being hacked. The wise thing to do is connect to a VPN if you're working with private information. If you plan on clocking in from a café anytime soon and don't have a VPN, this lifetime deal on Ivacy VPN should do the trick (and save you money in the process).
