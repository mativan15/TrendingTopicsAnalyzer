Kanye West's antisemitic, anti-Black, misogynistic dribble is exhausting. Or, as writer Damon Young pointed out, ' it's boring.' That doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed, but it's also nothing new. He is a Black man who believes himself a prophet. He mistakes his master craftsmanship for that of a genius and uses his platform to espouse his hate. We've seen this before. This hate is not new. It's a well-worn, tired and beaten path. At this point, the Chicago rapper is a Pentecostal preacher who lost his way or a Black Israelite with a self-written, heat-filled Bible.
