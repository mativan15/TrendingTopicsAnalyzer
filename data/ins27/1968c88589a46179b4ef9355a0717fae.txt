As announced by the team on Thursday afternoon, linebacker Joel Iyiegbuniwe has been signed to the Carolina Panthers' practice squad.

Iyiegbuniwe was a fourth-round pick of the Chicago Bears in 2018 out of Western Kentucky University. In four years as a Hilltopper, he totaled 201 tackles (22.5 for a loss), 5.5 sacks, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery.

Then, over the next four seasons of his career, Iyiegbuniwe appeared in 58 games for the Bears—collecting 29 tackles and a forced fumble between 2018 and 2021.
