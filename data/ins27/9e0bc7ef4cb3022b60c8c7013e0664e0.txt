Pep Guardiola claimed that coins were thrown at him by Liverpool fans during Manchester City's defeat at a febrile Anfield which also saw Jurgen Klopp sent off for haranguing the match officials.
The coin allegation is likely to lead to an investigation by the Football Association.
At the same time Liverpool issued a statement condemning abusive chants from City fans and damage caused to the stadium.
'We are deeply disappointed to hear vile chants relating to football-stadium tragedies from the away section during today's game at Anfield,' the statement read.
