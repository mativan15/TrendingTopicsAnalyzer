London's Grand Theatre is looking inward as part of a new ghostly production taking the stage this week diving into the local landmark's history, and the century-old mystery surrounding its founder.
The production, Grand Ghosts, written by Trina Davies and directed by Jillian Keiley, runs until Nov. 5, and centres around the disappearance of theatre magnate Ambrose Small in 1919, a day after he sold his theatre holdings.'In his wake, Ambrose left behind his enormous fortune, a jealous wife, a disgruntled employee, gambling buddies, a mistress, and a ghostly mystery waiting to be solved,' a description of the show reads.
