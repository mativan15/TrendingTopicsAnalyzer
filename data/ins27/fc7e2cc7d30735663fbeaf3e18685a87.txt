Former President Donald Trump is facing backlash over comments he made disparaging American Jews, while also flaunting his popularity in Israel.On Sunday, Trump posted to his Truth Social platform, taking aim at American Jews."No President has done more for Israel than I have," Trump wrote. "...U.S. Jews have to get their act together and appreciate what they have in Israel - Before it's too late!"These seemingly unprovoked comments are not unusual for Trump, as he has long promoted the anti-Semitic trope that alludes to American Jews having a stronger, secret, loyalty to Israel.
