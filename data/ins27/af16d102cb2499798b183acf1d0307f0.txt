A UK charity championed by Sophie, Countess of Wessex, has been handed more than £5m from a Qatar state body despite human rights concerns in the Gulf country, it can be revealed.Eyecare charity Orbis UK has been given just over £5.8m in grants by Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD) in six years, according to an analysis of the charity's accounts. QFFD describes itself as 'a public development institution committed, on behalf of the State of Qatar, to implement external aid projects'.The charity's own aim as an employer that 'everyone is treated fairly and with respect' contrasts with the situation in oil-rich Qatar where human rights concerns have been brought into sharp focus ahead of the country hosting the World Cup next month.
