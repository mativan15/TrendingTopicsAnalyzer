It was a wild celebration in Knoxville — victory cigars all around, memes of Nick Saban throwing a tantrum, and a packed Neyland Stadium tearing down the goalposts and tossing them in the Tennessee River.
The photos and videos of those goalposts enveloped in a sea of orange were everywhere, the kind of marketing for a program and university you can't buy.
