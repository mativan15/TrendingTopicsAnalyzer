Prince Harry's upcoming memoir promises to be "quite revealing" if it ever hits shelves because his publishers won't want a "resurgence of old news" they've already read in the tabloids, a prominent British author recently told Newsweek.Lord Jeffrey Archer, the bestselling novelist and long-standing member of the Conservative party, has expressed his belief that the prince's book stands a "50/50" chance of being "scrapped" as reports of tensions with the royal family over the project circulate.Harry announced his autobiographical project with Random House publishers in July 2021.
