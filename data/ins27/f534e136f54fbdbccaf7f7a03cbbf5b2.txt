The City of Edmonton has launched a new pilot to help prevent and respond to drug poisonings in the city's downtown core.The program, operated by Boyle Street Community Services, sends teams of medical professionals and outreach workers — called overdose prevention and response teams — to the pedway system and downtown streets. The pilot program officially launched earlier this month. The new initiative comes as the city is tasked with coming up with a safety plan for transit and the city's downtown core, due to an increase in crime and disorder.
