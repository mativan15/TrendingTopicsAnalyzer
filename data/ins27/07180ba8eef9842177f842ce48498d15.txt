The AAII A+ Stock Grades system is a research and evaluation tool that seeks to grade companies within five investment key factors: value, growth, momentum, earnings estimate revisions and quality. The grades measure key metrics within each factor and determine a relative score that seeks to separate the strong versus the weak candidates. These grades are part of AAII's online investment discovery, analysis and tracking service. The grades were designed to be an educational and insightful research tool for the individual investor.
