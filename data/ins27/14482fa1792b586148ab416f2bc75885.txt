A mom shared what brotherly love between her two sons is really like.

TikToker @theunexpectedgift knows exactly who her toddler son Luke's person is. Whenever Luke's older brother Dane enters a room, Luke can't help but show his excitement. When the mom picked Dane up for school, it was as though Luke hadn't seen him in years.

'When you see your person,' the mom wrote in the video caption.

She recorded Luke, who was sitting in his car seat watching cartoons. The boy's face lit up when something caught his eye.
