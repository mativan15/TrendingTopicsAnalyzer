WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Wednesday lambasted a bill in Congress barring tech giants from giving preference to their own businesses on their websites, saying it unfairly singles the retailer out while not subjecting rivals to similar regulations.The Senate could vote on the bill as early as this month, media outlets have reported. The measure passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, despite hefty lobbying from top executives like Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook.
