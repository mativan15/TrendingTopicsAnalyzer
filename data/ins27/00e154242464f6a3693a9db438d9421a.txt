Ford CEO Jim Farley said Wednesday that consumers should plan to see dramatic changes as companies compete amid the shift to electric vehicles."We've got to go to nonnegotiated price. We've got to go to 100% online. There's no inventory (at dealerships), it goes directly to the customer. And 100% remote pick up and delivery," he said in New York during Bernstein's 38th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference streamed live."Then we have this opportunity to use our physical presence to outperform" competitors, Farley said.
