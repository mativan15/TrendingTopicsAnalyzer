INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) Justin Herbert didn't throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 27 games. Dustin Hopkins kicked four field goals, including a 39-yarder with 2:38 remaining in overtime, as the Chargers rallied for a 19-16 victory over the Denver Broncos. Hopkins, who injured a hamstring during the first half, grimaced as he kicked the ball and fell to the ground before being picked up by teammates.
