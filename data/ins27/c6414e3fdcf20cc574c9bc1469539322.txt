Liz Truss will receive a yearly £115,000 allowance for the rest of her life despite her short stint as Prime Minister.

The allowance from the government will reimburse Truss for expenses spent while maintaining public duties.

Enacted in 1991, Truss becomes only the sixth Prime Minister to receive the lifelong allowance.

Even though her short, six-week stint as the UK's prime minister came crashing down on Thursday, Liz Truss will still get to claim a yearly £115,000 allowance reserved for former prime ministers.
