Bill GeorgeBy Bill GeorgeOct 18, 2022The Celtics open the season tonight at TD Garden against the Philadelphia 76ers. Opening ceremonies tonight will include a tribute Celtics great Bill Russell who won a record 11 championships with the team and passed away earlier this year.   There are high expectations for the team this year after getting all the way to the NBA Finals and losing to the Warriors in 7 games last season.   And… of course we're rooting for our local guy. Celtics Interim Head Coach Joe Mazzulla is from Johnston, RI.
