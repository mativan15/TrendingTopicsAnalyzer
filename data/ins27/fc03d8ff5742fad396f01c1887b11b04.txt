Explaining the changes, Gaby Wood, director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: 'Our sense is that the Booker Prize is a living thing, and while not every book will be for everyone, any of these books will be for anyone.
'In order to say that, you really need to try and make sure people do think it's for them - books and reading. So it's an attempt to show people that they're welcome.'
A spokesperson for the prize said that 'the ambition is to create a vibrant evening with entertainment from across the cultural spectrum'.
