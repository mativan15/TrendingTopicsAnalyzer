A woman was forced to switch off her life-saving ventilator machine to 'make cuts' to her soaring energy bill. Charity Hope2Sleep revealed sufferers of sleep apnoea who use such machines while they sleep, are fearful of the potential cost of keeping the machines on the entire night. CPAP machines regulate breathing during sleep by pumping air into a mask to prevent airways from restricting. There are also non-invasive ventilators, which are more costly to run with most people ineligible for financial support.
