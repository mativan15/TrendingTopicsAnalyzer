Melbourne's West Gate Tunnel project has until now been plagued by toxic soil, commercial disputes, lengthy delays and a $4.5 billion cost blowout. Now it faces another, albeit smaller, headache: a squabble over an advertising billboard that was knocked down to make way for the new road.

Advertising giant oOh!media is demanding $8.7 million for the loss of its billboard in Spotswood, in a dispute that has landed in the Victorian Supreme Court.

Melbourne's West Gate Tunnel motorway won't be finished until late 2025.
