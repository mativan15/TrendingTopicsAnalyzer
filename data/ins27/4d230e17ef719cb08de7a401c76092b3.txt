Stock traders balked at any rebound attempt on Wednesday, with Treasury yields creeping back to multiyear highs and mounting concern that a hawkish Federal Reserve will raise the odds of a hard landing. The day that marked the 35th anniversary of the equity crash saw the market halting a back-to-back rally, making any calls for an imminent bottom look elusive.
