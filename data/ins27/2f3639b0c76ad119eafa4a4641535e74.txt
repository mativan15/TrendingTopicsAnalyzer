The upcoming election on November 1 will decide the country's future, between "politics that are corrupt, violent, and irresponsible" versus "choosing the future of our children," Prime Minister Yair Lapid said on Tuesday at the beginning of a faction meeting of his party, Yesh Atid.

" Today the elections begin – we have under two weeks to decide where Israel is headed," Lapid said.

"We offer to the State of Israel leadership, we offer values, we offer hope, we offer mutual respect and the common good.
