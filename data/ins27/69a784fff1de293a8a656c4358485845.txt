As the IPL 2022 has come to an end, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has brought up an interesting point about players suffering from the 'second-season' syndrome. The term is used to describe a player who fails to repeat his exploits from the last season such as Venkatesh Iyer, Ruturaj Gaikwad and Varun Chakravarthy. All three of these players played out a remarkable IPL 2022 but couldn't quite produce a repeat this season as all three of their franchises failed to qualify for the Playoffs. Weighing in on the same, Gavaskar mentioned that in order to pass a true verdict about a player, it is always advised to gauge the cricketer's performances at least across two IPL seasons before coming up with a concrete judgment.
