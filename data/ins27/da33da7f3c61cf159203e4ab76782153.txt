Inflation is hitting hardest in states with key Senate races such as Georgia, Arizona and Florida, giving Republicans broad appeal in the final weeks of the campaign while Democrats cling to a narrower abortion-rights message.

The Phoenix metropolitan area has the highest inflation rate in the nation at 13%, the worst of any U.S. city in more than 20 years and twice as high as the rate in San Francisco. It's a high hurdle for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona as he tries to fend off a challenge from Republican Blake Masters.
