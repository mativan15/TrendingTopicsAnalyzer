The next few days are being seen as crucial as a rise in Covid-19 infections is expected due to increased social interactions around Diwali, experts said. It is still not the right time to declare victory over the pandemic as the virus is still causing infections, they said. "I don't think much will happen in India but there are too many new variants circulating to declare victory," said Anurag Agrawal, former head of the Insacog laboratory consortium and chair of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution.
