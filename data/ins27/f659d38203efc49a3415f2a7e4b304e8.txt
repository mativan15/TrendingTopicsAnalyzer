Zach's back! No, really. Not quite yet with the Bulls in Washington Friday. But Saturday, home opener; Zach Attack!'Yeah, he should play (Saturday),' Bulls coach Billy Donovan said prior to Friday's game with the Wizards. 'I think it was after the last game with Miami, sitting down and talking and looking at the schedule, (we) felt like it was good to give him another game (off) here. Then he'll be available (Saturday) against Cleveland provided that everything else goes well, which it should. He worked out (Thursday), and he'll get some work in (Saturday) as well.
