(Bloomberg) -- The yen took a further step toward the closely watched 150 per dollar level, keeping investors on high alert for possible intervention to support the currency. Japan's currency fluctuated around 149 per dollar in Tokyo on Tuesday, as the country's prime minister and central bank chief insisted they would stick with their current policy mix amid criticism that it is contributing to the yen's slide. The currency slipped again Monday even as the greenback lost ground against all other Group-of-10 peers.
