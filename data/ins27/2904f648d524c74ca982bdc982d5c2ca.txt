Russian forces Saturday announced a latest successful test of their Zircon hypersonic cruise missile as Moscow steps up its Ukraine offensive. The missile was fired from the Admiral Gorshkov frigate stationed in the Barents Sea and "successfully hit" a target stationed 1,000 kilometres (625 miles) away in the White Sea in the Arctic, the defence ministry said.
 The ministry added the test was undertaken as part of ongoing "testing of new weapons". The first official Zircon test, which President Vladimir Putin described as a "great event," came in October 2020.
