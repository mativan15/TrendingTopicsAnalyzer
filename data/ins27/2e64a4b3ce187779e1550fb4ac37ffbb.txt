Today is the BBC's 100th birthday. But after a century on air, its next few years are likely to determine whether the BBC survives in a recognisable form by the end of the decade.When the BBC came into being in the aftermath of the first world war, it was to solve a commercial problem. British industrialists were trying to sell radio receivers to the general public, but no one wanted to hand over money for an expensive piece of kit if there wasn't anything to listen to. A group of manufacturers led by Marconi came together to seek approval from the government and created the private British Broadcasting Company – later reformed as a less overtly commercial Corporation – to produce suitable content.
