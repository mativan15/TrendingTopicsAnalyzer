A national bird flu "prevention zone" has been declared by the UK government as the country continues to grapple with the worst outbreak of the disease ever recorded.At least three million birds have already been culled by farmers and landowners due to the spread of the disease, which has also taken a heavy toll on populations of endangered wild birds.The government said new Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) rules will come into force from midday on Monday requiring all bird keepers in Great Britain to follow "strict biosecurity measures help protect their flocks from the threat of avian flu".
