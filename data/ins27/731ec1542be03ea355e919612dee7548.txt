Source: N.Y. Post: Charles WenzelbergAaron Judge is a pleasure to watch. Much like Derek Jeter, he has a presence about him. He is a team player first, he is a leader and he should be a Yankee for life. Everyone has beef with their boss, and if you don't, you are kidding yourself, because it is never a perfect work environment...never. So if there is some other reason rather than money that Judge decides to fly across the country, back to his home state of California, then he's kidding himself if he thinks things will be rosier somewhere else.
