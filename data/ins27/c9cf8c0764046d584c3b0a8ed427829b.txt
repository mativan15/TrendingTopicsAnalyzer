LIVE – Updated at 03 Jun 2022 00:57 Biden has called for the age requirements to be raised and for the gun lobby to be reeled in. As Biden addressed the nation, the House Judiciary Committe passed H.R. 7910 — the so-called 'Protecting Our Kids Act'— a package that includes many of the proposals the president laid out. The bill includes provisions to increase the age limit for purchasing semi-automatic rifles to 21, and places restrictions on high-capacity magazine sales, among others. Still, it is unlikely for the bill to get through the Senate.
