Jay-Z wants to sell his stake in D'Usse Cognac, and says that Bacardi – which owns the other half of the business – is legally required to buy it. But in a new lawsuit, the superstar claims the liquor giant is 'lowballing' and 'stonewalling' him to get a cheaper price. In a complaint filed in Delaware court, Jay-Z's SCLiquor LLC says that it exercised a contractual option to sell its 50 percent stake in D'Usse to Empire Investments, the Bacardi unit that owns the other half and runs the company's day-to-day operations.
