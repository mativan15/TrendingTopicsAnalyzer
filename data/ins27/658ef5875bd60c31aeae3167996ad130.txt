The final report from British Columbia's public inquiry into money laundering has been submitted to the government, with officials set to review the Cullen Commission's report before it's released to the public.The New Democrat government appointed B.C. Supreme Court Justice Austin Cullen in May 2019 to lead the inquiry after several official reports concluded that hundreds of millions of dollars linked to organized crime and the drug trade had affected the province's real estate, luxury vehicle and gaming sectors.
