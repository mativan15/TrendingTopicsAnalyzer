21 Oct 2022, 04:21 PM ISTThe earnings per share (EPS) is a widely-used metric for estimating a company's value. It shows how much money a company makes for each share, i.e. net profit divided by the number of shares. ETMarkets analysed stocks whose EPS has been consistently rising each fiscal. Further, we shortlisted stocks whose EPS doubled in the last three years. We considered companies with a market cap of over Rs 10,000 crore. About 27 companies have made the cut. From the list, 9 stocks have gained anywhere between 300% and 2000% (Data Source: ACE Equity).
