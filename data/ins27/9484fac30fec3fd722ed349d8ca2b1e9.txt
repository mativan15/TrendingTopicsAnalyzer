Unpaid tax owing to the NSW government has skyrocketed by 171 per cent to more than $1 billion as internal government documents reveal there is 'no current strategy' to correct the debt.

Outstanding land, payroll, stamp duty and gaming machine taxes are contributing to $1.13 billion weighing on the state's debt book, up from $477 million in July 2019.

The figures are contained in a briefing document, seen by the Herald, presented to a meeting of senior compliance leaders at Revenue NSW earlier this month.
