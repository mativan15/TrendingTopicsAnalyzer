The 81-year-old billionaire Robert Kraft, Chairman and CEO of The Kraft Group, whose holdings include the New England Patriots, threw a 'Kickoff and a Touchdown' party for himself and Dr. Dana Blumberg, the 47-year-old ophthalmologist he has been dating since 2019. What most revelers at Friday night's affair didn't know until they showed up at Hall des Lumières, a Beaux-Arts style bank converted into exhibit hall and event space in Lower Manhattan, was that the invite was actually for a wedding. Voice of the NFL Al Michaels introduced the couple as husband and wife to what PageSix estimated was 250 guests.
