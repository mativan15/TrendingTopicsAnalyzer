Following a sudden rise in the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) in Bengaluru, Karnataka's Covid Technical Advisory Committee has recommended the Health Department to take up more genome sequencing to identify if any new variants were the cause of the sudden spike, although hospital admission numbers are stable. After a minor spike last month, the TPR hit a new low of 1.13 per cent on October 2. However, since then, the TPR has been fluctuating. The TPR reached 3.1 per cent on October 12 and by October 18, it was as high as 6.
