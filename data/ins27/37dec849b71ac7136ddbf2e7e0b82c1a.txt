Published: 16:59 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 16:59 EDT, 15 October 2022 Tottenham boss Antonio Conte admits the team's growing list of injuries is a genuine concern ahead of a packed stretch of matches. Spurs sealed their 10th consecutive home victory with a 2-0 win over Everton thanks to second-half goals from Harry Kane and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. But it was not all good news for Conte, who was forced to substitute Richarlison in the 52nd minute, the striker later appearing in the mixed zone on crutches and fighting back tears.
