The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped close to 350 points on Friday, despite a better-than-expected jobs report. For the week, however, the Dow Jones finished higher by nearly 165 points as volatile trading continued.
No stock in the Dow saw a bigger percentage drop than Apple (AAPL -3.86%), which fell nearly 4% today after several analysts warned about slowing App Store revenue growth. Intel (INTC -3.23%) was the day's second-biggest loser on a percentage basis, finishing the day more than 3% down.
