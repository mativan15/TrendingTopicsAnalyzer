The Indianapolis Colts know going into the rest of the offseason that they will need to figure out a way to get a contract extension done with left guard Quenton Nelson.
Expected to be the highest-paid guard in the NFL by a wide margin, Nelson will reset the market at the position for interior offensive linemen. The four-time Pro Bowler and three-time All-Pro is likely to approach the $20 million mark when it comes to average annual value.
While this deal reportedly remains a priority for the Colts, Jeremy Fowler of ESPN reported in May that the deal could take time because of how big the contract will be.
