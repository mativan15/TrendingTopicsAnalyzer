Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Bitcoin (BTC) temporarily lost, then recovered above, the $29,000 support level in European hours on Thursday, setting the tone for other major cryptocurrencies, data showed.

The price dip followed a relatively positive market response to Wednesday's release of minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting held on May 3-4. The S&P 500 added nearly 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day 1.
