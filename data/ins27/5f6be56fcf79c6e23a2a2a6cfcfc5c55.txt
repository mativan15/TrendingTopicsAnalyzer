Liverpool and Manchester City go head to head on Sunday in a game that may lacks its usual recent importance - with 13 points separating the sides.The Reds are in 11th with only two wins from eight games and boss Jurgen Klopp has already said they are "not in the title race".Defending champions City - on the other hand - are unbeaten after nine games.This game could prove to be a turning point, though, if the Reds can rip up the form book at Anfield.Klopp's side come into the game on the back of a remarkable 7-1 win at Rangers in the Champions League.
