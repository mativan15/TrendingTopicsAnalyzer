Oct. 19—PLATTSBURGH — Nova Bus in Plattsburgh has won a new contract to produce five all-electric buses here.

The company, a member of the Volvo Group and a leading North American transit bus manufacturer, has been awarded a contract for five LFSe+, the 40' long-range 100% battery electric bus model of Nova Bus, by the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

North Country Chamber of Commerce President Garry Douglas said this is welcoming news for the region on many fronts.

"While small in number, this is a strategically important step by the MTA as it begins its eventual full transition to electric buses," Douglas said.
