shaunl Article Thesis ZIM Integrated Shipping (NYSE:ZIM) is a battleground stock right now.

Two container shipping companies with a different business model, Global Ship Lease (GSL) and Danaos (DAC), offer a very low valuation as well, could generate strong rewards, and their risk levels are much lower.
