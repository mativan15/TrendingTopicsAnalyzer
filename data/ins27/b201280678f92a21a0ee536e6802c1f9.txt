Following Liz Truss's resignation, the celebs are throwing their hats into the ring to take her place, with the likes of Phillip Schofield and Emma Bunton both making bids for PM.
Truss announced that she would be stepping down as leader of the Conservative Party this week, after just 44 days in office.
Her resignation followed a disastrous short term, which included crashing the economy and the departure of both her chancellor of the exchequer and home secretary.
So, a new race to Number 10 has begun, with names including Rishi Sunak and even former PM Boris Johnson in the mix, despite the former London Mayor leaving office after a string of scandals just six weeks ago.
