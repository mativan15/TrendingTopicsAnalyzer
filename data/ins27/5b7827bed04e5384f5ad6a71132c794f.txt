Mid-tier IT services provider Mindtree's clients are handing out more deals aimed at saving costs that can be rerouted to focus on business expansion, its top executive said. 'Earlier, we called out that some of the clients have started discussing cost takeout rather than just talking about transformation deals. The order book that we closed (in Q2) has a good portion of core managed services deals which is aimed at cost takeout. If you can take some cost out of the system, then you can put that money back into transformation,' chief executive Debashis Chatterjee told ET.
