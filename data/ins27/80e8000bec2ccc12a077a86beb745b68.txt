GAINESVILLE, Fla., May 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- With the launch of Tower Hill Insurance Exchange (Exchange) in January 2022 and the subsequent transfer of renewals this spring, Tower Hill Preferred and Tower Hill Signature Insurance Companies ceased accepting new business mid-February. As of May 16th, our renewals for these two carriers are rolling into Exchange.
With the cessation of business flowing into Tower Hill Preferred and Tower Hill Signature, the next step in our strategic plan is to voluntarily withdraw the Financial Stability Ratings® of A, Exceptional, assigned by Demotech, Inc.
