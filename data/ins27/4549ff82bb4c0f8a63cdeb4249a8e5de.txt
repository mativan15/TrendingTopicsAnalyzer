A 20-year-old woman from Mexico has become the first patient to receive a 3D-printed ear that was made from her own cells. Why would anyone do this, you wonder? Many people around the world are born with a condition called microtia, a rare birth defect that causes deformities of the outer ear.The feat was achieved by 3DBio Therapeutics, a regenerative medicine company. This marks the first time a 3D-printed implant made from living tissue was used to replace a patient's body part. This transplant is part of the company's clinical trials that aim to revolutionise the repair and replacement of tissue organs.
