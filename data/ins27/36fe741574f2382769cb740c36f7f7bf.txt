The atmosphere in the Drive-In Arena was absolutely electric.

Hapoel Tel Aviv fans packed the northern Tel Aviv facility to the rafters and sang to the top of their lungs, cheering on their heroes who graced the floor and defeated the London Lions 76-59 to record their first ever EuroCup victory.

Dear @LondonLions fans! This is what the atmosphere was like tonight in Tel Aviv this is what we should aspire to be in the British Basketball League. Credit the videos to my haver @yossi_samira a fan of @HapoelTLVBC #BritisbBasketball #KnowOurName pic.
