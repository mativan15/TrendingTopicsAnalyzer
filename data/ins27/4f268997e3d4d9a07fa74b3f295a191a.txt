Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the latest escalation of his war in Ukraine on Wednesday, declaring martial law in occupied areas of Ukraine and wartime measures throughout much of Russia.

Ukrainian officials said the order would not deter their efforts to retake occupied territory, but warned it could mean mass deportations of Ukrainians out of the occupied regions, and harsher treatment for those that remain.

Experts said the order could also be a 'back door' to pull more of Russian society into the war effort, strengthening Putin's footing for future offensives but weakening his claim that the 'special military operation' in Ukraine is not a full-fledged war.
