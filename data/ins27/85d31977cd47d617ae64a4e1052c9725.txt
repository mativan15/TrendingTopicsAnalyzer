If there are significant shake-ups to the Yankees' Game 3 lineup on Saturday, they would not involve third base. 
Aaron Boone said there are 'no plans' to sit Josh Donaldson, who is merely one scuffling bat on a team filled with them. 
'It's interesting that everyone jumps on him. I mean, he's got on at a 40 percent clip in the postseason so far for all his struggles — his, quote, ‘struggles,'' the Yankees manager said Friday over Zoom of Donaldson, whose .393 on-base percentage only trails Anthony Rizzo's among Yankees in the playoffs.
