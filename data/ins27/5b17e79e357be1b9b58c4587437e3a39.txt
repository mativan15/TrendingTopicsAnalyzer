Michael Vi LendingClub (NYSE:LC) has the best of both worlds.

There are several advantages to this dual business model (bank and marketplace): The bank provides the company with cheap and stable sources of capital (customer deposits), rather than having to rely entirely on the funding market's ups and downs.
