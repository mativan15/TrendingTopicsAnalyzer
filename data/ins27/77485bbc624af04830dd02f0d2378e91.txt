A giant flower, made out of solar panels, has bloomed on the lawn of Bishop James Mahoney Catholic High School. 'There's been a lot of curiosity from staff and students alike,' said Andrea Regier, the science department head at the school. It's called a Smartflower. Its petals are made of solar panels. They draw energy from the sun and supply it into the school through a microgrid, which runs alongside the main power grid of the school. The flower is able to power lights and a set of outlets to one classroom.
