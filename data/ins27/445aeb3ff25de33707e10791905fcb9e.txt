That won't fix all of the problems for the Cardinals, but it's certainly a good start. Arizona's in the midst of a midseason offensive makeover, celebrating the return of Hopkins while also adding receiver Robbie Anderson in a Monday trade with the Panthers. The Cardinals hope the Hopkins-Anderson combo can make up for the loss of leading receiver Marquise Brown, who has a foot injury and will likely miss several weeks.
