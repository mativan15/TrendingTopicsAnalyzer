The Centre appeared to pull a draft proposal to set up a grievance appellate panel to take final calls on content on social media, hours after it was disclosed on Thursday, when it triggered a pushback from experts who said the plan was aimed at 'bringing social media companies under direct government control'. The plan -- officials said it is now being reviewed -- was in the form of proposed amendments to the Information Technology Rules, 2021, which in itself has been controversial and suspended by several high courts in the country.
