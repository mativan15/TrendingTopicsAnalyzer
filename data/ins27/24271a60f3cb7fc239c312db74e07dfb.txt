An efficiency strategy for cobalt recovery from simulated wastewater by biphasic system with polyethylene glycol and ammonium sulfate Today, biphasic aqueous systems have received more attention than conventional separation methods due to their advantages, such as biocompatibility, low cost, and easy operation. The extraction of cobalt ions from the aqueous phase with the absence and the presence of other ions was investigated using polyethylene glycol, and ammonium sulfate salt without using an extractant.
