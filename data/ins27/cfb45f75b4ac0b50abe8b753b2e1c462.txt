Compared to their popularity in the car world, restomods—restored classics modified with the latest tech and trim—have arrived late to yachting. 'Ten years ago, most boaters didn't even recognize the term, but we've seen it gain legs,' says Bill Morong, owner of Yachting Solutions, a boatyard in Rockport, Maine, which has completed more than a dozen such transformations.

The restoration of older boats typically involves salvaging as many original parts as possible, including engines, for historical accuracy.
