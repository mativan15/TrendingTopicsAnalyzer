Skip to content      During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate our Nation's vast array of parks, wildlife refuges, forests, monuments, marine sanctuaries, waters, national conservation lands, and other natural treasures.  Every day, Americans across the country draw inspiration and pride from the beauty of our magnificent outdoor spaces.  From lush forests in Washington State and coral reefs in the Virgin Islands to snow-capped mountains in Alaska and rolling hills in Vermont — the grandeur of the American landscape fills our souls and fuels our spirit of adventure.
