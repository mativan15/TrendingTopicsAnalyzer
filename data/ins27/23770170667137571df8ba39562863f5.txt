Dominic Perrottet knows his plan to raise the Warragamba Dam wall will go nowhere before the state election, but he does not care. It is one of the few infrastructure projects the premier has to sell to western Sydney voters and he will pursue it, even in vain, as a point of difference between the Coalition and Labor.There is nothing new about a debate over Sydney's main dam, other than Perrottet's sudden interest in it. After it was discussed for many years as a flood-mitigation strategy for the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley, former premier Mike Baird announced in 2016 that his government would raise the Warragamba Dam wall by 14 metres, at a cost of $690 million.
