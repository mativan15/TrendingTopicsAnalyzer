First thing in the morning. Miami Beach. I walk up 14 blocks and make a left on 71st instead of a right to the beach. Find my way to a bridge over the canal to the other side.

Early morning temperature. Humid. 80°. People in cars going to work. Or to wherever. Feels like Tel Aviv.

Just turning 22, more than 40 years ago, I stopped by the Kotel (the Western Wall) asking for a blessing. Is it OK that I go to medical school in Tel Aviv and not in New York?

Mom is pissed.
