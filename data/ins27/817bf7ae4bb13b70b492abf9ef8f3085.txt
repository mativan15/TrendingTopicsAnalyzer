The members of K-pop band BTS will serve their required military service under South Korean law. The band's management company made the announcement Monday.
There had been debate over whether the group members could be given an exemption from service because of their artistic success.
Big Hit Music said the band's oldest member, Jin, will cancel his request to delay his service. The six other BTS members also plan to serve in the military.
The group is looking forward to joining together again 'around 2025 following their service commitment,' the company said in a statement.
