Police are rounding up young offenders but one Waikato business owner believes the carnage will get worse before Christmas. Ash Parmer owns bottle stores in Ngāruawāhia and Huntly which have been targeted by ramraiders, and while he never had any doubt police were doing their job, he questions what happens to the youth offenders once they're in custody. Waikato police said on Thursday that 205 offenders have been arrested a total of 307 times for ramraid and smash and grab style offending between February 1 to the end of September.
