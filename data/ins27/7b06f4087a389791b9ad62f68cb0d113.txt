Mark Walchirk, chief executive of Patterson Cos., resigned from the company after a board investigation determined he "violated company policy and demonstrated poor judgment regarding an encounter with an employee."

The resignation, announced last week, was effective immediately. Don Zurbay, the company's chief financial officer, was named president and CEO.

"Patterson is committed to cultivating a people-first culture where every employee is treated with respect and those standards apply to every member of the organization," said John Buck, Patterson's board chairman, in a release on the news.
