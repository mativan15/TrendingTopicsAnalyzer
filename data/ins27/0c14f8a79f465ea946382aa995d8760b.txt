The New York State Senate on Friday approved a 2-year moratorium on certain kinds of new crypto mining operations in an effort to address some of the environmental issues related to the activities.The 36-27 vote, which came in the early morning hours as the Senate wrapped up its legislative session, was previously approved by the New York State Assembly and now goes to Gov. Kathy Hochul for her potential signature.The first-in-the-nation partial ban targets proof-of-work mining that utilizes behind-the-meter electricity from fossil fuel plants, Politico reported.
