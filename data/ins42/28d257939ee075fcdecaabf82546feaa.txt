Kadisha Kaur-Singh, 22, from Enfield, has had five jobs since she graduated last June. 'My older friends are just working to get money, but my goal is to be extra passionate about what I do,' she says. 'I like working and having my own income, but I also want free time to dabble and experiment. I don't want to just work to live or whatever the saying is. That concept is outdated.' After stints in various customer service and copywriting roles, next week Kaur-Singh starts a new job at TikTok. On her Insta bio, she calls herself a 'Digital Creator'.
