Kolkata: Aviom India Housing Finance, a New Delhi-based lender focused on financing small dwelling units, is in the process of raising $30 million through share sales. Japan's Gojo-backed Aviom, with Rs 990 crore in loan assets, is in talks with a global pension fund and a domestic private equity fund for fresh capital infusion, founder-cum-managing director Kajal Ilmi told ET.

The new investor would get a 30% stake for a $30 million investment, valuing the six-year-old lender around Rs 800 crore.
