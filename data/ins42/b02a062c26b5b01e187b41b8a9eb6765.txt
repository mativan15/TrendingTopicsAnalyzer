The Bears have waived wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette and signed wide receiver Isaiah Coulter to the active roster, the team announced Tuesday.

Smith-Marsette was claimed off waivers by Chicago ahead of the start of the regular season, and there was optimism about his potential on offense. But Smith-Marsette has had a number of dropped passes and a costly fumble that cost the Bears a chance at victory against the Minnesota Vikings back in Week 5.
