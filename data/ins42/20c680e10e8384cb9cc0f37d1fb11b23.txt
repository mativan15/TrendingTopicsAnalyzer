The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) campaign arm, Bold PAC, is spending big on its endorsed candidates, breaking from a past practice of coordinating its general election spending with Democratic leadership.

Bold PAC is sending a $2.4 million independent expenditure windfall to support its endorsees in the final stretch of the race, upping the group's outside spending to a record $5.7 million.

Bold PAC historically has used its muscle to support Hispanic candidates in Democratic primaries, donating a large chunk of its general election funds to House Majority PAC (HMP), the campaign arm for Democratic House leadership.
