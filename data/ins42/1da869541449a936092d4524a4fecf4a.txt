The UAE will allocate $10 billion in an investment fund linked to Egypt and Jordan in an important development that was unveiled on Sunday.

According to Khaleej Times, the investment fund will be called the Industrial Partnership for Sustainable Economic Growth. The fund matters because regional investment linking these countries together also relates to the larger context of peace and security in the region because Egypt, the UAE and Jordan all have peace with Israel. Insofar as those countries work together it matters because they share interests in the region.
