Chegg (CHGG 5.68%) is an education technology company that primarily serves college students. As a result, it is dependent on the total enrollment levels at colleges. With fewer students, it leaves a smaller market for Chegg to capture. 
That is precisely what has happened in the U.S. since the pandemic's onset. That's understandable. Shooting for a college degree is challenging already, but even more so during a pandemic. Given that backdrop, it's not surprising that in the U.S., one million students have forgone or postponed a college education over the last two years.
