Korea's presidents are to get a new official jet in order to save money on a more elaborate scheme, the government said Tuesday.But while the jet, which will serve as the leader's second official plane, may be chosen during President Yoon Suk-yeol's five-year term in office, the purchase may be left to the next administration.It is to replace an aging Boeing B-737, which has been in use since 1985 for domestic and regional trips.According to the Defense Ministry, the National Security Council decided in July 2018 that the president needs a new official plane.
