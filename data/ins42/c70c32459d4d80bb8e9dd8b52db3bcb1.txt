The days of sharing a Netflix account for free seem to be coming to an end. Netflix said during its latest earnings report that, starting in early 2023, sharing a Netflix account will incur an additional fee. Netflix management said it came up with a "thoughtful approach to monetize account-sharing," and this will roll out to more users next year following its pilot test phase in some regions.The full details of this plan are unknown at this stage, so there is no word yet on what it will cost or other particulars.
