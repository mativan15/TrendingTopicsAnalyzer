Oct. 18—Aaron Civale didn't last long enough as the Guardians' Game 5 ALDS starter to need a shower, and so their season of overachieving has come to an end.

Civale gave up a three-run home run to clean-up hitter Giancarlo Stanton in the bottom of the first inning Oct. 18, and the Yankees rode the blast to a 5-1 nine-inning knockout of the G-men at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won't have much time to savor their triumph because Game 1 of the American League Championship Series begins at 7:30 p.m.
