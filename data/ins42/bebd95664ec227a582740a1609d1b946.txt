Oct. 20—An unidentified suspect faces felony marijuana charges following two searches this week at a Williams-area property that yielded large quantities of what's alleged to be illicit cannabis drying and being processed inside a home.

The multiagency Josephine Marijuana Enforcement Team and Rogue Area Drug Enforcement teams found at least seven large plastic totes filled with allegedly illicit marijuana inside a bathroom during a Tuesday search of a residence in the 1600 block of Cedar Flat Road in Williams, according to photos and a news advisory issued by the Josephine County Sheriff's Office.
