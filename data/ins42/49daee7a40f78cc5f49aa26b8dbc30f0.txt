The Supreme Court of Canada will announce today whether it plans to hear a case of residential school survivors who have fought a years-long battle against Ottawa to release thousands of records.
The group of survivors from St. Anne's residential school in northern Ontario is looking to the country's highest court after spending the last decade fighting the federal government to hand over documents.The survivors say that the government is in breach of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement because it withheld documentation of abuse when deciding upon their compensation.
