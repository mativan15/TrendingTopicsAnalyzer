Russell Wilson stepped up to the podium Wednesday without the noticeable limp he had after pulling a hamstring in the Broncos' 19-16 overtime loss to the Chargers less than 48 hours earlier and declared himself a quick healer. "It's feeling better every day," Wilson said. "Day by day. Obviously it happened Monday night, but I heal quick. I don't know if it's Wolverine's blood or what. But I feel better."The Broncos (2-4) will try to snap a three-game skid Sunday when they host the surging New York Jets (4-2).
