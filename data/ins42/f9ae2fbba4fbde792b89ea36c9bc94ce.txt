The upcoming season of 'The Good Fight' will be its last. Showrunners Robert and Michelle King will bring a 13-year journey with Christine Baranski's Diane Lockhart to a close when Season 6 premieres Sept. 8 on Paramount+. For the Kings, the decision to call it a wrap with a final 10-episode season is a matter of not wanting to 'overstay your welcome,' as Robert King told Variety. The husband-and-wife showrunner duo want to take 'Good Fight' out on a high note. The series debuted in February 2017 as a spinoff of the Emmy-winning CBS legal drama 'The Good Wife,' which ran from 2009-2016.
