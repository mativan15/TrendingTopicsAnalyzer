The cybersecurity industry is poised to enter a period of rapid consolidation, analysts say, as private-equity firms and established companies seek to offer one-stop shops for cyber chiefs, compliance requirements drive spending and company valuations moderate from last year's highs. Both private-equity companies and software providers are working from the same playbook with their acquisitions, said Shaul Eyal, a managing director and senior analyst at investment bank Cowen Inc. They aim to offer suites of services to chief information security officers and other clients, rather than individual products that address one specific need.
