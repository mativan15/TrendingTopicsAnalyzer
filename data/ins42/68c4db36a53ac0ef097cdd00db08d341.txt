Cristiano Ronaldo has issued a touching message to Sir Alex Ferguson after his former manager presented him with an award to recognise his recent achievement. The Manchester United star, who wanted to quit the club in the summer, has spent much of the season on the bench but was introduced early in his side's 2-1 win at Everton eight days ago. Ronaldo scored what would prove to be his team's winner and, in the process, notched the 700th club goal of his career. Ronaldo becomes the first player in history to complete the feat and his achievement was recognised on Sunday before the clash with Newcastle United.
