Scott Olson/Getty Images News American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock has slid 5.2% in Friday premarket trading as the credit card company boosted its provision for credit losses amid the uncertain economic outlook. In addition, the company kept its 2022 revenue guidance unchanged. Based on the company's results to date, AXP has increased its guidance for 2022 EPS to above its original guidance rage of $9.25-$9.65. That could still be a disappointment to investors as the consensus estimate is $9.84. It still expects revenue growth of 23%-25%.
