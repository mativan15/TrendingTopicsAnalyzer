Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brentford have condemned racist abuse directed at striker Ivan Toney via a direct message on social media following the side's 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League.

Toney shared images of the messages he received on Instagram, with the caption: "I wasn't even going to post this but I woke up angry".

Brentford said the abusive message was sent on Friday, after Toney scored twice in the match in West London.

"We condemn this discriminatory behaviour in the strongest possible terms.
