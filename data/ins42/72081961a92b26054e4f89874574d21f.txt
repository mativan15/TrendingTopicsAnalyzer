US Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Thursday declined to block President Joe Biden's plan to cancel billions of dollars in student debt in a challenge to the policy's legality by a Wisconsin taxpayers organization represented by a conservative legal group.
Barrett denied without explanation an emergency request to put on hold the debt forgiveness plan for people who had taken out loans to pay for college announced by Biden in August in the challenge brought by the Brown County Taxpayers Association.
