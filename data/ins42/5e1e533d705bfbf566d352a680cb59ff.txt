Union Minister Giriraj Singh Wednesday said the proposed caste census in Bihar must exclude infiltrators like Bangladeshis and Rohingyas, who are not acknowledged to be so because of "politics of appeasement". The BJP leader, who was here to take part in saffron party's state executive meeting, said there is need for a strong anti-conversion law, dropping the use of the term 'minorities' and erasing all "symbols of oppression by foreign invaders" like the Gyanvapi mosque, a religious structure in Varanasi.
