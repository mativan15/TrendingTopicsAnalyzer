For those worried that the flagging economy, the bear stock market and rising interest rates will soften the valuations that songwriting catalogs have been trading at, Hipgnosis Songs Capital's Blackstone-backed acquisition of the Justin Timberlake music publishing catalog might look like good news.
The deal went for a little more than $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. But sources tell Billboard that while Timberlake's camp was seeking an amount in that area, they see that price tag as extremely expensive.
