Chief White House officials are warning that the coming fall and winter seasons could bring along a devastating Covid surge that the country will not be prepared to handle. Meanwhile, the number of Americans reporting that they are still worried about the virus is reaching lows, and the virus is less deadly than ever, according to official figures.
Dr Ashish Jha, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, pushed congress to provide the administration with more Covid relief funding during a White House press briefing on Thursday.
