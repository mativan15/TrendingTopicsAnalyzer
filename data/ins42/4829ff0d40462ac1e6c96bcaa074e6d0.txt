Scott Olson Altria (NYSE:MO) has seen its stock pressured this year despite boasting healthy cash flows and an outsized dividend yield. That pressure intensified in recent weeks as JUUL announced intentions to declare bankruptcy. While that risk has moderated at least for now, I continue to question whether investing in MO is the best use of capital. The valuation is admittedly more attractive than it has been in quite some time and my bearish case may still take many years to take place. Yet, in this case, it is the difficulty of material upside which makes the potential downside all too important.
