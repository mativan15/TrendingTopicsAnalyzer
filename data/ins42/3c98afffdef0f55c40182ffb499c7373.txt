Kanye West, the superstar rapper who has made several inflammatory and antisemitic comments in recent weeks, has agreed in principle to buy conservative social media platform Parler, the app's parent company said in a statement Monday.

"In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves," said West, who now goes by Ye, in a statement released by Parler.

The move comes after Ye was locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts for making antisemitic remarks.
