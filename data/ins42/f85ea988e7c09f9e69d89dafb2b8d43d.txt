Partridge and pheasant shoots, which begin in September and October, make preparations - such as planting cover for the benefit of game birds and other wildlife - now. They face losing that money if they later have to cancel.
Mr Breitmeyer said: 'If we could get the eggs into the country now, then people could start the season later. They might be able to get two-thirds of a season.
'But people are having to make decisions now and there is a cost attached. They might think they are not going to make the expenditure if they are not going to have any birds.
