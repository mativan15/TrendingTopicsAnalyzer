From recovery to green economy World Environment Day 2022 marks 50 years since the landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. It's an occasion to celebrate progress on global environmental action and take stock of what still needs to be done to achieve 'a healthy planet for the prosperity of all'. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have committed to different kinds of 'green recovery'. The world's leading economies have delivered over US$20 trillion in COVID-19 recovery investments over the past 18 months, designed to re-boot economies and address the root causes of the nature-climate crises.
