The first stage of the UK's new HS2 high-speed railway is running 'many billions' of pounds over its £40.3bn budget and the Treasury has asked for further potential cuts to the project, according to an internal review.Europe's biggest infrastructure scheme has already more than tripled in price since it was approved a decade ago. Since construction started on the first phase of the line between London and Birmingham in 2020 the cost looks set to increase further, according to a report presented to HS2's board by Jon Thompson, the former head of HM Revenue & Customs, who became deputy chair of the project in April last year.
