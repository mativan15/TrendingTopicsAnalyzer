Australian software developer and co-creator Jackson Palmer has some scathing words against crypto promoters and journalists. He also doubles down on his earlier claim that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a "grifter."
"He's a grifter, he sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he's promising, but he doesn't know that. He's just really good at pretending he knows. That's very evident with the Tesla full-self-driving promise," Palmer said in an interview with Cricket when asked about the tech billionaire.
