Emily Ratajkowski's new mystery man has been identified.

The model's handsome suitor – with whom she was spotted making out in New York City on Friday – is named Orazio Rispo.

Rispo, 35, is a DJ who has been spinning tunes for Manhattan's elite for years.

Page Six reported more than a decade ago that Rispo mixed tunes for stars like Stavros Niarchos, Charlotte Casiraghi, Mark Getty and Uma Thurman at art dealer Gerard Faggionato's 50th birthday.
