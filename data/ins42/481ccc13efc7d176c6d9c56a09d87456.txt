Former Aston Villa striker Dion Dublin has backed Rafa Benitez as a potential option to replace Steven Gerrard as manager amid growing pressure on his job. Gerrard is firmly the favourite next Premier League boss to get the sack, and Benitez is one of two candidates Dublin would love to take the reins if he does depart.Villa are slumped just above the relegation zone after picking up nine points from their opening 10 league games this season and winning just one of their last eight outings. And results against Fulham and Brentford this week could be decisive for Gerrard's future at Villa Park.
