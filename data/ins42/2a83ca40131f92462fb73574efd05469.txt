The White House said Russia is likely on the verge of default Friday after the US allowed a key payment waiver to expire – a development that a top Biden official hailed as an indication of the Kremlin's increasing isolation from the global economy following its invasion of Ukraine.
The likelihood of a Russian default increased this week after the waiver expired, ensuring that US banks and individuals could no longer accept bond payments from the Russian government. Russia faced a Friday deadline to make $100 million in bond payments on foreign debt or risk default.
