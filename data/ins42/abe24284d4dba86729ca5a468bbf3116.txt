Lycopene, which makes fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes red, improves the efficiency of perovskite solar cells Chemistry 30 May 2022 By Alex Wilkins A tomatoD and S Food Photography / Alamy Stock Photo
The chemical that makes tomatoes red could also improve the efficiency and stability of solar panels.
Most commercial solar cells are silicon-based, but a new generation of solar cells made from thin films of perovskite, a titanium and calcium crystal, promise greater efficiencies and are easier to work with.
