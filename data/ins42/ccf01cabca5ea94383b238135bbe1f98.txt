Washington — The House Judiciary Committee is convening Thursday to consider a package of bills that would harden the nation's gun laws as lawmakers search for a legislative solution to a pair of mass shootings in a 10-day span that shocked the nation.The Democratic-led panel is expected to advance the legislation, called the "Protecting Our Kids Act," with action from the full House coming as soon as next week. But the package faces steep odds to passing the Senate, where Democrats and Republicans each control 50 seats and bills require 60 votes to advance.
