The City of Mississauga is turning 50 years old in two years. Created in 1974, the city west of Toronto has gradually evolved into a bustling metropolitan – the third largest in Ontario. "We are not farmland and fruit trees as we were 50 years ago," says mayoral incumbent Bonnie Crombie. "We are the economic engine of Ontario." And that's why Crombie wants out of Peel Region, which was also established the same year Mississauga and Brampton were incorporated as cities. It's a proposal that has been brought up frequently over the years, including by Crombie's predecessor Hazel McCallion.
