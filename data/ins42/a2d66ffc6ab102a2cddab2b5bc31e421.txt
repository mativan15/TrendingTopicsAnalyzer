The CTA is planning no changes to base fares or pass prices in 2023, as ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels and the agency continues to rely on federal pandemic relief money.

The transit agency's 2023 budget proposal also focuses on hiring and retention efforts and boosts funding for security contractors amid persistent service and safety concerns.

The CTA unveiled its $1.8 billion operating budget proposal Thursday, marking a 4.6% increase over the $1.75 billion 2022 budget.

The proposal comes as the CTA has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels of riders, recently reaching an average of more than 900,000 riders on weekdays, down from about 1.
