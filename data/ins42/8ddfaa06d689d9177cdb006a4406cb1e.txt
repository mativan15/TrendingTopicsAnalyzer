A bipartisan antitrust bill to crack down on large tech companies is facing new attacks as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, revises the proposal in hopes of winning broader support needed to ensure a vote on the Senate floor. Ms. Klobuchar co-sponsored the American Innovation and Choice Online Act with Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, to stop dominant platforms from favoring their own products and discriminating against alternatives on the platforms' services. Apple and Google have vigorously argued against such antitrust legislation.
