Microsoft has cut some jobs after it faced slower revenue growth last quarter.

According to Axios, the tech giant slashed around 1,000 jobs across a variety of sectors.

A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Hill that 'like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly.'

'We will continue to invest in our business and hire in key growth areas in the year ahead,' the spokesperson said.

Microsoft had employed about 220,000 people at the end of June.
