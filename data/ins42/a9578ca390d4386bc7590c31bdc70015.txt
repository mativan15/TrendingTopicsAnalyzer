Tesla's car plant in Fremont, California transformed from making gas-guzzling vehicles under General Motors to now manufacturing for the world's largest electric car maker in a short 50 years.
Since 2010 it has manufactured Elon Musk's electric cars, having started life in 1962 producing Chevrolet El Caminos. Its path symbolises the industry's fast shifting demands: firstly efficient cars, and then electric. 
Now it faces another shift as carmakers such as Mercedes and Volkswagen rush to push luxury car lines that reaped in extravagant profits through the pandemic.
