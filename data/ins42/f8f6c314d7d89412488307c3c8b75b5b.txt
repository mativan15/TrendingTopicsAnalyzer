Assam government has suspended state civil service officer Barbie Hazarika, who was attached with the Department of Act East, following complaints by the Singapore delegation over her rude and inappropriate behavior. The other members of ASEAN delegation too had expressed their displeasure over her behaviour. The suspension order, issues by Personnel Department Secretary T P Borgohain, stated: "Such irresponsible behaviour has caused a serious dent in the diplomatic relation of India and other ASEAN countries and has wasted the sincere efforts of the state government for economic involvement with ASEAN in general and Singapore in particular.
