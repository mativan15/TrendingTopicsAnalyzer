GEMINI (May 21-Jun 21) Your financial situation appears to be strong. A side business could help you make a lot of money. You might also be able to spoil your family members. This may not only bring you joy at home, but it may also strengthen your interpersonal ties. Your romantic life is likely to grow. You could be able to spend enough time with your partner, which would be a beneficial experience for you both. Your work life, on the other hand, may require your complete focus. Better job prospects may slip through your fingers due to lack of focus.
