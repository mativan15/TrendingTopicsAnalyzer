The first El Clasico of the season is one of those rare fixtures in the world of football that can wipe the slate clean.

Near-perfect starts to the league
While Real Madrid's injury-time equaliser against a spirited Shakhtar Donetsk side in the Champions League on Wednesday sealed their qualification to the knockouts for a record 31st time, Barcelona's 3-3 draw against Inter Milan left them on the brink of a group-stage exit for the second successive season.
