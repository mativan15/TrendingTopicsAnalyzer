A $5 million interest-free loan the Biden family received from a Chinese energy conglomerate in 2017 should have been probed by the FBI as part of a possible 'pay-to-play' plan, Sen. Chuck Grassley told top law enforcement officials last week. 
In an Oct. 13 letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Delaware US Attorney David Weiss, Grassley (R-Iowa) questioned whether the bureau is fully investigating corruption allegations against first son Hunter Biden and demanded a 'full and unredacted FBI summary' of Hunter business partner Tony Bobulinski's October 2020 FBI interview.
