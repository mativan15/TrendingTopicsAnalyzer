Famous investor and author Richard Koch says investors should select an investment approach that they like the most and that is suited to their personality and skills, and stick consistently to it for all their stock market investments. "There are many routes to success and any one of them can work if it suits you. The road to hell, in contrast, is well sign-posted and well travelled. The ways to win are many and unpredictable, but the ways to lose are fewer and entirely predictable. Whichever ladder you climb, you will need to steer clear of the same snakes," he wrote in his book Selecting shares that perform.
