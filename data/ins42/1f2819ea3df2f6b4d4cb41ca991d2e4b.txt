After Gabby (Rosie Bentham) accidentally shot Will (Dean Andrews) in Emmerdale recently, she was forced to explain why she was so jumpy that she was prowling around the grounds with a gun. She shared with him her theory that Jamie Tate is still alive and is plotting to take Thomas from her.
An initially sceptical Will said he'd help her find out the truth and he was shocked when Harriet (Katherine Dow Blyton) made some informal enquiries and discovered that a man fitting Jamie's description had been seen at Andrea's mother Hazel's house.
