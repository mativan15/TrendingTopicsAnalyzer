The travel industry should have been better prepared for a surge in post-pandemic holidays, a government minister has said, after scenes of travel chaos in airports ahead of the half-term break.The arts minister, Stephen Parkinson, a former adviser to Theresa May, said that disruption was causing 'a lot of distress' for people who had not been able to get away for several years because of the pandemic.Flight cancellations have led many passengers facing long delays to their half-term breaks, including easyJet, which has cancelled more than 200 flights to and from Gatwick between 28 May and 6 June.
