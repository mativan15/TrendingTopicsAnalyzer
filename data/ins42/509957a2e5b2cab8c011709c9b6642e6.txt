SIphotography/iStock via Getty Images AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) continues to be a name we own, most recently buying heavily as the stock breeched $15, as the stock had been obliterated. Despite having long owned the stock, it continues to surprise us. Management has surprised us as well, generally in negative ways. But did we catch a bottom, or just a short-covering rally after AT&T just reported earnings? Folks, we just have not seen something like this before. AT&T actually saw a huge 10% rally on earnings.
