"After that Totino-Grace game, we knew anything was possible. We knew we could make some plays." — Damario Armstrong, Osseo safety and receiver.

Osseo put an exclamation point on the best season in team history.

The Orioles, accustomed to comebacks, won again in dramatic fashion, defeating East Ridge 14-13 in the Class 6A championship. They rallied from a two-touchdown fourth-quarter deficit to beat Totino-Grace in the semifinals.

Prince Kruah scored on a 4-yard sweep, his 43rd carry of the night, with 24 seconds remaining to give Osseo the victory.
