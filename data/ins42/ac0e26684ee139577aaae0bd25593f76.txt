Annabelle Chih Investment Thesis Due to the macro environment (and previously worries about a Taiwan invasion), TMSC (NYSE:TSM) stock has been in decline. Nevertheless, the business itself is actually still growing and is expected to continue to do so with above-market growth. As such, TSMC could be a compelling and relatively low risk investment at the current levels, since semiconductors will remain important (and only become more so) as the world continues to become more digital, with TSMC manufacturing chips for pretty much all important chip companies.
