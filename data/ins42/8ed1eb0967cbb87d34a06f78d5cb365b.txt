HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty Images A bearish outlook painted by Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) last week has led to a downgrade on Wall Street as Jefferies lowered its recommendation on the Dutch healthcare company to Underperform from Hold on Tuesday. Issuing an update on its Q3 2022 performance, PHG said on Wednesday that the company expects its comparable sales to decline ~5% YoY during the quarter with a €1.3B non-cash charge for goodwill impairment impacting the bottom line. Citing the profit warning and ongoing macro concerns, Jefferies analysts led by James Vane-Tempest lowered the company's 2022 – 25 earnings per share estimates by as much as ~15 – 30%.
