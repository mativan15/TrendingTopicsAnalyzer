Oct. 20—A 33-year-old Humble man caught on videotape savagely beating a 64-year-old massage parlor owner changed his guilty plea to not guilty in the middle of what was supposed to be the punishment phase of his trial Wednesday.

It took his jury a little over an hour to find him guilty.

According to Assistant Ector County District Attorneys Melissa Williams and Elizabeth Howard, Isaac Jerald Jackson walked into the Garden Rose Spa on East Seventh Street on March 21 after driving past it a few times and surveilling it from a business across the street.
