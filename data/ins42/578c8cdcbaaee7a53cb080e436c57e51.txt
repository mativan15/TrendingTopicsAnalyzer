US President Joe Biden voiced his support for "the brave women of Iran," and asked Iran to end the brutal crackdown against its own citizens.

Biden said the protests had awoken something that won't be quieted 'for a long, long time'

Activists in Iran on Saturday called for a fresh wave of nationwide protests over custodial death of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, Jina Mahsa Amini.
The call for launching new mass protests came after US President Joe Biden reiterated his support for the protesters and said he was "stunned" by the protests.
