Real Madrid were frustrated to miss out on signing Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe in the summer but it may have proved a blessing in disguise.The Spanish and European champions have utilised Federico Valverde in a right wing role for much of the season and the Uruguayan midfielder has gone from strength to strength."Fede Valverde, top three in the world right now," wrote Los Blancos midfielder Toni Kroos on Twitter on Sunday, after Madrid swept Barcelona aside in the Clasico.Valverde scored the hosts' second goal at the Santiago Bernabeu and followed it up with an even better strike against Elche in midweek to ensure Madrid stayed top of La Liga, ahead of Saturday's clash with Sevilla.
