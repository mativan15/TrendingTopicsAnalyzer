Tenants in London have never paid so much for a place to live, with the average weekly rent soaring to £553 per week in September.

Figures from estate agent Foxtons show that landlords are taking advantage of a lack of supply to push prices, with 29 renters on average competing for every new property last month.

As demand remains high, there were only 23,000 listings in September, the lowest monthly volume this year.
