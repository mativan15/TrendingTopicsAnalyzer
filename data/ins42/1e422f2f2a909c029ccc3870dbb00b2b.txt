Kiwi golfer Ryan Fox is in a good position to land a third DP World Tour win of the season and close the gap on Rory McIlroy at the top of the money list as he sits just one off the lead at halfway in the Mallorca Open. England's Dale Whitnell equalled the course record on Friday (Saturday NZT) to claim a one-shot lead at the halfway stage. After carding a three-under 68 in the opening round, world No 25 Fox shot a superb bogey-free 64 to sit in second place on 10 under par.
