Security footage has captured the moment a 12-year-old boy allegedly robbed a petrol station at gunpoint, and he told police it wasn't for the money.

Security footage has captured the strangely calm way a 12-year-old boy has allegedly robbed an American petrol station at gunpoint.

The video, dated the afternoon of June 1, showed the boy waiting with a backpack while another man was served by a worker.

When it was the boy's turn, he pulled out a gun and said, 'Put the money in the bag.'

The worker could be heard asking 'what?' and the boy repeated his demand, putting the bag on the counter.
