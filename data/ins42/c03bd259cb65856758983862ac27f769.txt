Israel's Ministry of Finance and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) are preparing to issue a blockchain-based digital state bond.

The Israeli government and TASE are partnering with digital asset infrastructure firms Fireblocks and VMWare to perform live testing of a new platform using smart contracts and tokenization for the trading and clearing of digital bonds.

The live test will see units of the digital bond issued to e-wallets of the acquiring participants, paid for in digital currency which will be transferred to the Israeli government's e-wallet.
