WINNIPEG, Manitoba — After five seasons with the Rangers, something clicked for Filip Chytil during the run to the Eastern Conference final in 2021-22.
That's how the Rangers center put it when thinking back on the seven goals and two assists he contributed in the 20 playoff games. Those were not the statistics that Chytil is most proud of, but his overall impact game in and game out made him feel he was finally an integral part of the team that drafted him 21st overall in 2017.
'Finally' was the word that Chytil breathed out as if a weight had been lifted off his chest, which has allowed him to skate lighter and freer than he ever has before.
