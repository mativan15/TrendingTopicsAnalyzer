AgenciesToni Nadal (L) stepped down as Rafa Nadal's coach in 2017The presence of Toni Nadal in the coaching team of Felix AugerAliassime will not be a distraction in the French Open fourth round clash with 13-time champion Rafael Nadal on Sunday, the players said. Toni Nadal masterminded nephew Rafa's incredible career from well before he broke into the big time by winning the French Open as a teenager in 2005, steering him towards a record 21 Grand Slam victories. The 61-year-old stepped down as Rafa's coach in 2017 and concentrated on running the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca before agreeing to work with world number nine Auger-Aliassime last year.
