Democrats are hoping that they can pull off a secret victory in North Carolina. They just need to get the national Democratic Party on board. Former Senator Richard Burr is retiring at the end of this year. A former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he served three terms and last year voted to convict former president Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. The party nominated Cheri Beasley, the former chief justice of North Carolina's Supreme Court, to be its nominee in a largely conflict-free primary after state senator Jeff Jackson dropped out of the race.
