Forbes Global Media, the publisher of Forbes magazine, said it's doing an about-face on its plans to go public through a merger with a blank-check acquisition firm.
The deal, which was announced in August, would have taken the 104-year-old magazine and digital publisher public at a $630 million valuation via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Magnum Opus Acquisition.
Forbes CEO Mike Federle did not give a specific reason why his company pulled the plug when he delivered the news on Wednesday.
