Twitch streamer Kaitlyn 'Amouranth' Siragusa has appeared in a heartbreaking video making allegations of abuse about her husband.
A clip circulating on social media shows the top female Twitch streamer in tears during a phone call with her husband. Previously, she had never disclosed she was married.
She alleged he threatened to kill her dogs, controls their finances, and that he forced her to stream.
Amouranth alleges her husband told her not to publicly admit she was married in order to make more money from the 'hot tub' meta on Twitch.
