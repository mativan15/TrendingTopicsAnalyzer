OPINION:

If you want to disrupt the status quo, vote for Republican reformer David Krucoff to be Washington's next Ward 3 councilman.

In 2022, the very notion of American citizenship is threatened by the Democratic Socialists of America. On the D.C. Council's Judiciary and Public Safety Committee, the far-left voting bloc passed a 12-1 measure that allows undocumented people to vote in our local elections. At a time of skyrocketing crime and corruption, we cannot allow government to diminish the sacred power of voting rights that belong to the American people.
