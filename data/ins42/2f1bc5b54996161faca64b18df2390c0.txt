Chinese tech giant Tencent's value has dropped to the worth of a local Chinese liquor giant.

Kweichow Moutai overtook what was once China's most valued company in September.

It's a further sign of Tencent's fall from dominance and the result of curbs on the tech industry.

Tencent's nearly six-year reign as China's most valued company may be over.
