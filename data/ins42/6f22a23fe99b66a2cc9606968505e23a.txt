As Netflix's true crime series Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story continues to trend high on the streaming platform, eBay is cracking down on sellers attempting to make a quick buck with costumes inspired by the serial killer on its website.

In the lead-up to Halloween, the e-commerce site has removed any and all costume listings related to Dahmer — who murdered 17 men and boys in Milwaukee from 1978 until his arrest in 1991 — and his likeness online.

"I can confirm that these items are banned on eBay and are being removed under our 'Violence and Violent Criminal Policy,'" an eBay spokesperson told EW.
