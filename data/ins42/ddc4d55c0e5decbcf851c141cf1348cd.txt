Albuquerque is already saturated with cannabis dispensaries and licensees often face compliance issues. But a new partnership between Green Thumb Industries Inc. and Circle K convenience stores could eventually usher in a whole new wave of dispensaries.

On Wednesday, the Chicago-based cannabis producer unveiled plans to open dispensaries adjacent to Circle K stores throughout Florida.

The exclusive agreement allows Green Thumb to lease space from Circle K. The test-and-learn phase of the rollout will begin next year with 10 "RISE Express" stores.
