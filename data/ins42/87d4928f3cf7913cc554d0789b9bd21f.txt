The path was all laid out for Frank Ladson Jr. when he officially became a Clemson Tiger in 2019: He was, at one point, a five-star wide receiver; at the time, no one was better at getting wide receivers to the NFL than Clemson; Ladson had all the makings of the next.

It didn't work out quite so smoothly. After a promising debut season with three touchdowns in limited action, Ladson missed most of training camp in Year 2 because of COVID-19, then hurt his hip, and then needed two surgeries for sports hernias in 2020 and 2021.
