Delivery drivers say they are being 'harassed' and 'shamed' by customers who have Ring doorbells — and use the gadgets to heckle workers and even embarrass them publicly by posting videos on social media, according to a report. 
Ring owners are using the high-tech Amazon doorbells to indulge in 'boss behavior,' using their speech feature to barrage delivery drivers with instructions and complaints — whether they're from FedEx, UPS, DoorDash, UberEats — or Amazon itself, according to a report by the research firm Data & Society.
