An astronaut onboard the International Space Station took this photograph of the northern section of Japan's Miura Peninsula, which separates Tokyo Bay from Sagami Bay. An expressway runs through the center of the image and connects Yokosuka and Yokohama, two cities within the Greater Tokyo Area. Inlets along Sagami Bay are tinged with brown-hued sediment as waves break near the shore. Darker regions near the center of the Miura Peninsula are heavily forested. Mount Ogusu (Ogusuyama), one of the highest points on the peninsula, is neighbored by parks, trails, a golf course, and solar power plants.
