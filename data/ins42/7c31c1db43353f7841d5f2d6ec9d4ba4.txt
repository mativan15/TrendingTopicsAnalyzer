Pfizer Inc. (PFE) announced on June 1 that it plans to sell its 32% ownership interest in Haleon PLC once Haleon begins to trade on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in July. Haleon is a newly independent company that includes the consumer healthcare businesses of GSK plc (GSK), formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, and of Pfizer.
 
Pfizer and GSK entered into a joint venture in July 2019 to combine their consumer healthcare divisions. In the process, Pfizer received a 32% ownership interest in the venture, with the remainder going to GSK.
