A proposed surf and water park with a hotel district, retail, restaurants and entertainment options is one step closer to being developed in the city of Maricopa just south of the Phoenix metro.

The 71-acre park with two, 5-acre surf lagoons, a water park and a surf center and academy will be developed on a vacant site that's bound by Loma and Green roads and State Route 238 and Garvey Avenue adjacent to a cattle farm.

In documents submitted to the city, the developer says SR 238 is a major connection between communities west of the project location, the city of Maricopa and north to the Phoenix metro.
