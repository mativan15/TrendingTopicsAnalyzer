Jonathan Schoop has been here before with nothing to show.

As recently as 2020, he was a finalist for the American League Gold Glove Award as a second baseman. Once again, in 2022, the Detroit Tigers infielder is among the three top candidates vying for the award.

The 10-year MLB veteran, who has a $7.5 million player option on the table, is joined by Andrés Giménez (Cleveland Guardians) and Marcus Semien (Texas Rangers) as a finalist, announced Thursday by Rawlings Baseball.
