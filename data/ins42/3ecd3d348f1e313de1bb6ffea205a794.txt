TORONTO - Canada's main stock index snapped a seven-day winning streak to close a volatile month slightly lower a day before an expected Bank of Canada interest rate hike.IG Wealth Management chief investment strategist Philip Petursson described it as a wishy-washy day, with the Toronto market being led by movements south of the border.He said Tuesday was a day of assessment following last week's strong rally in the U.S.'I think everyone is trying to gauge whether that is a bear market rally, like a head fake, or if it's something a little bit more sustainable,' he said in an interview.
