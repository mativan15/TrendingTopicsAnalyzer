simon2579/E+ via Getty Images Those who know me well know that, in addition to being a bit of a braggart, I've got a very fragile ego. While I titled my latest article on Farmer Brothers Co. (NASDAQ:FARM) 'Farmer Brothers is a Speculative Buy,' I do want to draw your attention to a sentence from my conclusion: 'Please also note that I think any money put into this stock should be considered 'gone.'' I took a small speculative position in the stock. Small. It was a small position only. I mention all of this because it falls to me now to point out that since I took this exceedingly small position in this stock, the shares have fallen exactly 50% against a gain of ~28.
