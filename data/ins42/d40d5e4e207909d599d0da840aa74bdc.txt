Today, President Biden will say in remarks scheduled for midday that, if Democrats expand their ranks in the midterm elections, the first bill he will send to the next Congress would enshrine into law Roe v. Wade protections that the Supreme Court struck down in June, according to a Democratic official familiar with Biden's planned remarks.Biden's pledge will raise the stakes for the midterms, now just three weeks off, with the Democrats' congressional majority in jeopardy. The president's plan is contingent on Democrats maintaining control of the House and expanding the party's presence in the evenly divided Senate.
