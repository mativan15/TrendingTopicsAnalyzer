everythingpossible/iStock via Getty Images I believe FiscalNote (NYSE:NOTE) is worth $15, representing ~181% upside from the date of writing (Oct 19, 2022). NOTE rides on a strong secular tailwind that provides it with a long runway of growth. My view is that NOTE has been sold off together in a basket of SPACs that are poor businesses, and this gives investors an opportunity to own this asset at a cheap valuation. Company overview NOTE is a technology and data company that provides critical legal data and insights in a rapidly evolving economic, political, and regulatory world.
