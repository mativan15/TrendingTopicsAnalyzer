INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich trusted Matt Ryan to make the right calls Sunday.In the waning moments, the 15-year veteran delivered again.Ryan read Jacksonville's defense, relied on his instincts and then lobbed a 32-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Alec Pierce, who caught it just over the hands of a defender with 17 seconds left to give the Colts a 34-27 victory. 'Alec is so good on those kinds of routes and I think in that situation throwing the ball past the sticks and taking a shot, you can't play scared,' Ryan said.
