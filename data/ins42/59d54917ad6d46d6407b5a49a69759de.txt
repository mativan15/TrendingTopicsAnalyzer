Prada is deep into the metaverse with its second NFT launch. The luxury brand plans to launch 100 NFTs on the Ethereum network this Thursday as part of its Cassius Hirst Timecapsule apparel drop. The Prada x Cassius Hirst drop will feature unisex button-down shirts in black or white. The corresponding digital collectibles are a GIF of the black or white pill capsule. The NFTs will also refer to the drop's serial number as well as include a unique number associated with each physical shirt. The price won't be announced until the day of the drop but will be in fiat currency as opposed to crypto.
