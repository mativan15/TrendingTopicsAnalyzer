Rights groups are calling for a swift investigation

Malawi's government has vowed to act after the discovery of a mass grave where the bodies of 25 immigrants thought to be Ethiopians were found.

The bodies were exhumed in a Mzimba district forest after young boys reportedly detected a foul smell.

The next day four more bodies were found 5 km (3 miles) from the grave.

"It is a sorry state," Homeland Security Minister Jean Sendeza told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme."It is a pathetic situation," she said.
