Barf. Thursday night's prime-time game between the New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals is looking more like a war of attrition than a matchup featuring heavyweight talents. Neither team practiced on Monday given the short turnaround between their Week 6 games on Sunday and Week 7's upcoming tilt on Thursday, so they offered only estimates from the training staff on the initial injury report.

And it's a doozy. The Saints estimated that 14 different players would have either sat out on Monday or only practiced on a limited basis due to injuries.
