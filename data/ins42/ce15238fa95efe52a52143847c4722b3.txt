Probably built in the 1930s, the building was first a fire station then a residential home and a rental.Jake Palmer lived two blocks away from it as a kid, and has always admired itThis year he stopped just admiring and bought the place."I'd always tried to sit on one side of the school bus just so I could look at this building as we drove past," Palmer told Information Morning Saint John.
