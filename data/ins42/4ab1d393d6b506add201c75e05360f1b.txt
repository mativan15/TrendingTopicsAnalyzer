Italy's LaPresse news agency published what it said were comments by Berlusconi, 86, to his center-right Forza Italia lawmakers during a meeting this week in the lower Chamber of Deputies.

'I have reconnected with President Putin,' Berlusconi was heard saying. 'He sent me 20 bottles of vodka and a really sweet letter. I responded with 20 bottles of Lambrusco (a sparkling red wine) and a similarly sweet letter.' The occasion was Berlusconi's 86th birthday on Sept. 29, LaPresse said, four days after the right won the most votes in Italy's national election.
