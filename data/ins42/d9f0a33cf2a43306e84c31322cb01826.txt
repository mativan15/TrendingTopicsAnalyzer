By documenting the history of the abortion dispute in the country, the exhibit seeks to remind people that the politics around women's reproductive rights has always been complicated, but there are lessons to learn from past struggles.
'We tend to feel helplessness and inevitability when we think about contemporary abortion politics; helplessness in the sense that the Supreme Court has done what it has done, and people feel, regardless of their views on the issue, that they don't have a whole lot to say about the matter; and inevitability in the sense that people feel that there's not much politically they can do,' said Ziegler.
