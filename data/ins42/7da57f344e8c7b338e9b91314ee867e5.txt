Mallikarjun Kharge was elected Congress president on Wednesday, defeating the party's Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor in a hard-fought contest for leadership but the euphoria in the party — its proclamations of inner-party democracy and digs at the opponents — will soon give way to the reality of the challenges that lie ahead for the 80-year-old veteran leader.
Barring once in 2019, Kharge has not lost any election, earning him the Kannada sobriquet 'solillada sardara (a leader without defeat)'.
