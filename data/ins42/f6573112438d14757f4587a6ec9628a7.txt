Just not up for cooking your own Thanksgiving turkey this year or looking for something a bit outside of the usual centerpiece? Popeye's is offering an alternative.

The fast food chain, whose chicken sandwich caused a stampede in the pre-pandemic days, is offering deliveries of its Cajun-fried turkey for the first time nationwide (though not in Hawaii or Alaska). Previously, the birds were only available via in-store pickup.

The turkeys will run you $94.99 plus tax where applicable. Shipping is included in the price.
