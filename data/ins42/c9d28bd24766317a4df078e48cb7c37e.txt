In 1977, Britain was broke. The year before, prime minister James Callaghan had been forced to borrow $3.9 billion (about £2.2 billion then) from the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the pound. By the time of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in June, consumer price inflation was at 16.1 per cent.Reading the economic pulse of the nation, it was the Queen's 'express wish' that there should be 'no undue expenditure' on jubilee celebrations, according to Callaghan. Money would be spent within 'existing expenditure limits'.
