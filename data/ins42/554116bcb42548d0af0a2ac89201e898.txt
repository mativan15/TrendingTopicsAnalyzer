By Joshua Kirby Adidas AG on Thursday lowered its outlook for 2022 for the third time this year, warning that its earnings will be dragged by one-off costs relating to its exit from Russia, continued restrictions in China, and a build-up of inventory. Setting out third-quarter results ahead of schedule, the German sportswear major said net income from continuing operations fell significantly to 179 million euros ($175 million) in the quarter from EUR479 million in the same period last year. The hit was largely due to one-off costs relating to its decision to wind down its operations in Russia, the company said, though it said its operating margin also declined to 8.
