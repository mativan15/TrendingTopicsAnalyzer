A Rockland, Ont. bank teller is being praised for stopping a customer from withdrawing a large amount of money in a potential 'grandparent scam." The Ontario Provincial Police East Region Frontline Support Unit received a report of a fraud on Oct. 12. Police say the fraudster called the victim stating he was a friend of hers and that he needed money right away.  The victim was instructed to attend her local bank to withdraw a large amount of cash. As the woman went to withdraw a "large sum" of money, the teller quickly realized what was happening and educated the victim about the grandparent scam, police said in a media release.
