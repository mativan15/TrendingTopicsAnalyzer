Family members of Leroy Nelson, Bernell Juluke, and Kunta Gable smile as they stand outside Orleans Parish Criminal District Court in New Orleans after the three men, convicted for a 1990s crime, were ordered freed on Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2022, in part because of the role former officer and convicted killer Len Davis played in the investigation. Prosecutors joined defense lawyers in seeking to have their convictions thrown out. The women said they were going straight from the courthouse to Angola Penitentiary for the men's release today.
