Rishi Sunak's new tax relief on investment in oil and gas extraction in the UK will cost the taxpayer around £1.9 billion a year, it's claimed.The tax relief that has been widely criticised by green groups, opposition politicians and even oil executives also risks short-changing the taxpayer further down the road, according to the think tank the New Economics Foundation (NEF).By the time the investments start returning profits, the 25 per cent temporary windfall tax on oil and gas profits announced by the chancellor on Thursday could no longer be in place as it is set to end in 2025.
