"Teen Wolf" star Colton Haynes recalled a manager dropping him as a client during the early stages of his acting career and suggesting he take on a job as a sex worker to earn money. The actor opened up about his life and career as an actor-turned-model in his new memoir, "Miss Memory Lane," released on Tuesday. In the book, Haynes, who publicly came out as gay in 2016, detailed the hardships he faced in trying to break into Hollywood. In chapter eight of his memoir, which chronicled his time in LA in 2007, Haynes recalled landing a manager named Brad, who represented actors on The WB, the previous name of the network now known as The CW.
