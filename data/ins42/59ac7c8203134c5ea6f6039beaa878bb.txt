The stock market has been on a roll to begin the week, but it appeared that Wall Street might take a pause on Wednesday from its recent bull run. An hour before the opening bell, futures on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) had fallen more than half a percent.
Yet even though the broader market indexes looked poised to start out the day on Wednesday lower, several stocks were sharply higher on company-specific news. In particular, both United Airlines Holdings (UAL 3.19%) and ASML Holding (ASML 1.73%) saw their stock prices rise following their latest financial reports, as shareholders gained confidence in the two companies' ability to weather an economic downturn and emerge stronger.
