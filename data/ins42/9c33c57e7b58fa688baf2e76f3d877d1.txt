The Albanese government's new infrastructure minister says Melbourne's contentious East West Link project is 'dead' and won't receive any federal funding under Labor.

The confirmation by Ballarat MP Catherine King, who was sworn in on Wednesday, that federal Labor would not put any money into the project is a blow to the Victorian Liberals' plans to campaign on building the road at the November state election.

The Victorian opposition has vowed to revive the East West Link project, which has been rejected twice in the past.
