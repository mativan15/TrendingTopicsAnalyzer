The sharp declines on Wall Street in the past year have hit many Israeli technology and biomed companies traded in Israel hard. While the Nasdaq index has fallen 33% since last November, some of these companies have lost 90% or more.

The result is that more than 20 Israeli companies are now traded in New York at less than $1 per share, and are in danger of being delisted. A similar number of companies are traded at between $1 and $2, and if they weaken could find themselves in similar danger, Globes finds.
