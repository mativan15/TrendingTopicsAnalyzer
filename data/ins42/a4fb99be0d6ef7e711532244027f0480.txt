A jury has convicted Nikola founder Trevor Milton in his federal fraud trial. To better understand what led up to this moment, we hear from some of the engineers Nikola hired to help make Trevor's idea of a zero-emissions semi truck a reality. In this episode, they tell us how Trevor's statements about the Nikola One increasingly outpaced what they had actually managed to build.  Ben Foldy is the host of this season of Bad Bets. Bad Bets is a production of The Wall Street Journal. This season is produced with Jigsaw Productions, in collaboration with Story Force Entertainment.
