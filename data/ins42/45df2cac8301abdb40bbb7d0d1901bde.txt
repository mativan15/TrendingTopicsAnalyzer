May 28—Students spent a good portion of the school year learning how to give.

Youth Philanthropy groups from 10 different Ashtabula County high schools received money from the Ashtabula Foundation and the Conneaut Foundation and researched area non-profits before deciding how to allocate the money.

More than 45 non-profit organizations received grants after the students researched the groups, and in some cases, visited them and assisted in their mission.

All 10 Ashtabula County high schools participated in the program and nine are funded by receiving $5,000 each from the Ashtabula Foundation and the Conneaut program is funded by the Conneaut Foundation.
