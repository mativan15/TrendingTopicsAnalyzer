Stocks slipped Thursday for the second consecutive trading day even as better-than-expected corporate earnings continued to roll in this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91.01 points, or 0.30%, to 30,332.80. The S&P 500 dropped 29.58 points, or 0.80%, to 3,665.58, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 65.66 points, or 0.61%, to 10,614.84.
AT&T (T) and American Airlines (AAL) each beat analysts' expectations when they released earnings Thursday. Earlier in the week, Bank of America (BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also each exceeded forecasts along with defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT).
