Putting lives at risk and blatantly flouting safety norms, the temporary fire cracker markets established at six locations across the city are running with little or inadequate fire safety arrangements.Even as a large quantity of stock has been kept in the open and a short circuit or a spark from a cracker may lead to a mishap, the administration is turning a blind eye towards the violations.The markets have been established at grain market near Jalandhar Bypass; Cremation Ground Road in Model Town Extension; Dugri Phase 2; GLADA ground on Chandigarh Road; Haibowal and Lodhi Club Road.
