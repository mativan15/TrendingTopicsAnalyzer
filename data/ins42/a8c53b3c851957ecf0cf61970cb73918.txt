June 30, 2020. That's when Daniel Leung knew he had to go.On that day, the Chinese government enacted the Hong Kong national security law, criminalizing secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion in the former British colony. Essentially, it made it easier for the mainland government to crack down on dissent following the riots and protests that shut down the semi-autonomous territory for over a year starting in 2019.Leung, a Hong Konger, said he had been participating in pro-democracy marches every July 1 since he was a university student, and that it was no different during the years leading up to the law's enactment.
