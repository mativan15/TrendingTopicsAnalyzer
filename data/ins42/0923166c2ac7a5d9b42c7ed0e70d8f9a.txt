Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize their three-dose vaccine for children aged six months to five years, in a move that could add roughly 19 million young children to the program.The companies PFE, -2.15% BNTX, -1.42% said last month that three doses of their shot were 80% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and generated a robust immune response in children in that cohort, while also appearing safe and well-tolerated, as the Wall Street Journal reported.
