Islanders who had their blood tested for PFAS chemicals are expected to receive their results this week. The Government of Jersey said the results show some of those tested have higher levels of PFAS in their blood than normal.PFAS stands for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances. The chemicals are found in hundreds of everyday items, but there is concern about the health effects of high levels of exposure.After years of lobbying, the government announced in February that blood tests would be made available for residents affected by contamination in an area near Jersey Airport.
