HOW TO BE A CHICK Saroj has been on the phone with me every day for the past week. She sounds desperate. Saroj needs money. Urgently. She has six mouths to feed. Who is Saroj? Good question.

Ever since she started coming home carrying heavy cloth bundles and Rexine bags of old textiles (one of my passions), sari borders, embroideries, pichwais, antique lehengas, Parsee sadris and so much more.
