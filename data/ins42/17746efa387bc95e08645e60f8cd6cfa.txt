This column is an opinion by Rain Hye, a former student trustee. It is part of a special municipal election project by CBC Hamilton, featuring voices from the community. Find all our election coverage here. I can't remember the last time this many activists, community organizers and changemakers were running in an election. Unlike several other municipalities in Ontario, where some candidates have no competition whatsoever, this year Hamilton has seen many new candidates sign up for the task of running for office, giving the city the chance it deserves to have truly representational elected leadership.
