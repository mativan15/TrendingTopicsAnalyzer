A government led by opposition leader MK Benjamin Netanyahu that includes far-right Otzma Yehudit MK Itamar Ben-Gvir could damage Israel's relationship with the US, former chief of staff and number three on the National Unity party list, Gadi Eisenkot, said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post.

'Netanyahu may have a chance of reaching 61 [seats], but this will be a negative development for the State of Israel,' Eisenkot said.

"Such a government will have difficulty receiving internal and international legitimacy.
