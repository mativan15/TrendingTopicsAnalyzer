The FTSE 100 index dipped below 6,800 last week. But it's moved higher since and sits just above 6,900 as I write.

To put those levels in context, the index was around 7,250 a year ago. So, it's still well down. And I'm still finding a lot of good value among the stocks making up the index.

I'm inclined to hunt in the lower reaches of the index for smaller companies. There's a fair chance that businesses with a lower market capitalisation will have a longer growth runway ahead of them.
