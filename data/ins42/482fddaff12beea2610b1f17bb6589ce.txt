Google is facing the heat in India. The country's antitrust regulator has imposed a penalty of approximately 13.4 billion rupees (C$222 million) on Alphabet Inc's Google for abusing its "dominant position in multiple markets in the Android mobile device ecosystem." The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has asked Google to modify its conduct in relation to anti-competitive practices. In its inquiry, the commission concluded that Google has an unfair competitive edge in the market because it owns the Android operating software and allows some of its own products —such as YouTube and Google search—to come pre-installed on all Android-run devices.
