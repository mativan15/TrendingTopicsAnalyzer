He's not an in-your-face kind of guy — unless you're on the opposing team.

But soft-spoken University of Miami edge rusher Akheem Mesidor has gained national attention as an on-field terror.

Mesidor, a 6-3, 280-pound starting defensive end from Canada, was named the Walter Camp National Defensive Player of the Week on Sunday after totaling eight tackles, including 3 1/2 sacks, in Miami's 20-14 win Saturday at Virginia Tech.

A third-year sophomore and West Virginia transfer, Mesidor is the third Atlantic Coast Conference player in the past three seasons to have 3 1/2 sacks in one game, and the first since Virginia's Charles Snowden did it in October 2020 against North Carolina.
