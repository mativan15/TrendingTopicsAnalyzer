Commuters should expect more disruption on Wellington roads, as the group responsible for three protests that blocked highways last week say more action is on the way. Several protesters from climate change activism group Restore Passenger Rail were arrested and appeared in court last week after three separate protest actions on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 'There has been no response from the Government, so we do expect to be doing more,' protest group spokesperson Michael Apathy said. Commuters had little patience for the demonstrations last week, with drivers heard yelling abuse and honking horns calling for the protesters to move.
