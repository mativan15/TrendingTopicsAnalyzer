Elijah Moore wants off of Gang Green.
The wide receiver has requested a trade, The Post's Mark Cannizaro confirmed, adding the team is considering it. 
The trade request was first reported by Ian Rapoport of NFL Media. 
Moore was held without a catch in the Jets' win over the Packers on Sunday, and had just one reception for 11 yards in the 40-17 victory over Miami in Week 5.
Earlier Thursday, Moore was excused from practice for what head coach Robert Saleh deemed 'a personal reason.'
Before that, Moore had sent some cryptic tweets.
