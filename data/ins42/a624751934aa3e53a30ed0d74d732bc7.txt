Hip-hop heads are in disbelief that music icon Grandmaster Flash is coming to Delaware next month to deliver a lecture and a turntable demonstration.

The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer will deliver a free, one-hour audiovisual lecture at the Wilmington Public Library on Wednesday, Nov. 16.

Tickets to RSVP will become available at 9:15 a.m. Monday, Oct. 17. Guests are required to reserve tickets in advance. This event will likely sell out the same day tickets go live, so fans won't want to sleep on this.
