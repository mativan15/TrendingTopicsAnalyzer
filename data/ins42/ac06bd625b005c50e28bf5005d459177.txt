By Joe Hoppe The U.K. competition regulator said Wednesday that it will require CHC Group LLC to sell the offshore oil-and-gas helicopter services business it purchased from Babcock International Group PLC over competition concerns. The Competition and Markets Authority said the decision follows an in-depth Phase 2 investigation into the deal. Prior to the acquisition, CHC and Babcock were just two of four providers of helicopter transport services for the offshore oil and gas sector, and the acquisition led to a loss of an important competitive constraint, the CMA said.
