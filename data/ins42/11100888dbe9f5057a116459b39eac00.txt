After an internet-dominating first season, The White Lotus is back for season two, now set in Sicily with a whole new cast — and the return of Jennifer Coolidge. 'Jennifer is my friend, we've been friends for a long time — 15, 17 years — and we always talked about working together. Then the last season happened, she was so well received on the show, and so I was just like we can't go to Italy and not bring Jennifer, she'll kill me,' creator Mike White told The Hollywood Reporter at the show's Los Angeles premiere on Thursday of the decision to bring back Coolidge's clueless millionaire Tanya McQuoid.
