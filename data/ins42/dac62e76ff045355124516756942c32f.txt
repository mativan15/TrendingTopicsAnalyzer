Shehan Karunatilaka only got three hours sleep after the Booker Prize ceremony - Andrew Crowley

It's customary for Booker winners not to get much sleep the night after the ceremony, but Shehan Karunatilaka appears to have had even less than most. 'I tried not to go too wild and have an early night, but I made the mistake of going on Twitter instead. A thousand people were congratulating me. And of course my phone didn't stop ringing. I got about three hours.' People are ringing him still: throughout our chat, his phone vibrates like an angry grasshopper.
