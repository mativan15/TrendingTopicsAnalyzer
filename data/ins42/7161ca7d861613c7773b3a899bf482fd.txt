Former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike Holmgren will join Democratic Senate candidate Mandela Barnes on the campaign trail later this month, the Democrat's campaign announced Sunday.

Barnes is seeking to unseat incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson (R).

In a tweet on Sunday, Barnes shared a video of the 74-year-old former NFL coach, who won the Super Bowl with Green Bay in 1996, urging Wisconsin residents to contribute to Barnes' campaign, noting Johnson's slew of political ads attacking his Democratic challenger.
