Insiders who bought US$882k worth of Akoya Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKYA) stock in the last year recovered part of their losses as the stock rose by 16% last week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling US$69k.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
