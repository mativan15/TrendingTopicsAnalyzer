Alistair Berg/DigitalVision via Getty Images Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MIRM) was one of the better investments in my portfolio from the past couple of years. They have a pair of drugs, maralixibat and volixibat, targeting a set of rare liver diseases. These diseases involve cholestasis, which is where the flow of bile to the small intestine is blocked, causing pruritus and liver damage. The entire process is mediated by an enzyme, which these molecules inhibit. Maralixibat is a broad spectrum inhibitor while second-generation volixibat is more selective.
