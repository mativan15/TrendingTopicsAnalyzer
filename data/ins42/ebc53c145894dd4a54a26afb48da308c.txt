Former bank lobbyist Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani has been cleared to head up France's financial markets regulator, after lawmakers voted 55-28 in favor of her appointment on Wednesday.

Barbat-Layani, currently Secretary-General at the French economics and finance ministry, is now set to take over from Robert Ophèle as chair of the Financial Markets Authority (AMF), responsible for registering crypto companies as well as traditional financial institutions.

The French government, which is keen to see the country become a crypto hub, has set up one of the first crypto licensing regimes in the European Union.
