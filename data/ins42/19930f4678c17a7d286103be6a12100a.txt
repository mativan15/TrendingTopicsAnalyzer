The death toll from Saturday's fire at Evin prison in Tehran has risen to eight, after four injured people died in hospital. That's according to Iranian authorities who are yet to disclose the official cause of the deaths.

The prison houses hundreds of protesters who were arrested during recent anti-government demonstrations. It remains unclear whether the fire is related to the ongoing unrest across the country.

Authorities in Iran said the fire began in a prison workshop after a fight broke out between inmates, and that the situation has now "returned to normal".
