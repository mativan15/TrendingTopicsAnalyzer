Renters, look no further, The Parker by Fitzrovia really does have it all.

Not only is The Parker located in one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in midtown Toronto at Yonge-Eglinton, it is one of the only luxury rental buildings in the city currently offering highly coveted leasing incentives.

New residents get one month free, plus $1,700 in welcome bonuses. Bonuses include a year of complimentary Rogers High-Speed 1 Gig Wi-Fi (a value of $1,200), and a $500 Structube gift card.

While the welcome incentives are certainly enticing, the seemingly endless list of luxury amenities The Parker offers is reason enough to make the move.
