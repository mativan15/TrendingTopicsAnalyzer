JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s chief markets strategist Marko Kolanovic is trimming risk in the bank's model portfolio this month in the wake of questionable central bank policy and rising geopolitical tensions.  Kolanovic, who has been Wall Street's most vocal bull this year, cut the size of both the company's equity overweight allocations, or the expectation of the stock to outperform its industry in the market, and bond underweight allocations, or the outlook of the bond to underperform.  'Recent developments on these fronts – namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine – are likely to delay the economic and market recovery,' wrote JPMorgan strategists led by Kolanovic in a Monday note.
