An effort to curtail the plummeting population of snow crabs in Alaska will mean hundreds of crabbers could be sidelined for at least a year as state and federal agencies work to understand what is behind the dramatic decrease.

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game announced Monday that the Bering Sea snow crab season will remain closed through the spring of 2023.

The season was expected to kick off in just days, but a survey by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries found a lack of adult crabs available for harvest.
