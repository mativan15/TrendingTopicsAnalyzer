Ryan Fletcher While Boeing (NYSE:BA) is not quite meeting expectations for single aisle deliveries. I remain upbeat about their recovery trajectory. Most importantly, that is driven by the return of the Boeing 787 in the delivery mix, which is priced roughly three times higher than a single aisle jet. In this report, I will have a look at the orders, deliveries and other backlog mutations for Boeing in September. For this report, I will be using the evoX order and delivery monitor developed by The Aerospace Forum.
