Michelle Bachelet, the UN human rights chief, said she had been 'unable to assess the full scale' of the notorious system of so-called education and training centres in Xinjiang, undermining her landmark investigation of China's crimes against Uyghur Muslims.The former Chilean president spent two days in the north-western Chinese region where 1mn Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been subjected to mass internments, forced labour and re-education camps, as well as draconian tech-based surveillance and police persecution.
