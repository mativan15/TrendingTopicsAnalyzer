Elon Musk said he will continue to fund Starlink satellites in Ukraine after a recent standoff with the US Department of Defense over the cost of their deployment. The shift comes a day after Musk threatened to cut financial support for SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service in Ukraine, having claimed that the operation had cost his company $80 million so far. The Pentagon had responded by confirming it's in talks with SpaceX, while adding that the US is looking at other options.  'The hell with it,' Musk tweeted Saturday.
