STORY: A ban on exports of all chicken in Malaysia is threatening a dish central to the identity of its neighbor Singapore.Steamed rice, a side of greens, and some poached chicken make chicken rice, sold all over the city for cheap at its famous hawker stalls.Daniel Tan owns several stalls across the island nation.He says fresh meat from over the border is optimal for poached chicken, with frozen meat from further abroad a poor substitute.But without a clear end to the ban in sight, Tan is preparing for the worst as customers react to the change.
