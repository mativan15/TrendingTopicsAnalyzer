For Dave Wilkin, a cofounder and the CEO of 10KC, mentorship has been one of the foundations of his professional career. Wilkin grew up a self-proclaimed "science-and-math nerd" in a small town in Canada, and found that the teachers he had in his small school gave him the first real encouragement he had to pursue his professional career in tech. "I realized that if you don't have mentors and networks, you don't have opportunity," he said.Once in the working world, he found that strong networks and relationships make up the major parts of company success, but that organizations could often struggle to make them happen.
