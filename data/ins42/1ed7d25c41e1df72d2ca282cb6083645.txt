Similarly, plant-based materials are being trialled, with cactus and waste fishing nets are also being used, although as a former professional fisherman I found BMW's assertion that the fishing industry was deliberately discarding nets and ropes at sea fairly insulting. The modern fishing industry carefully nurtures fish stocks and resources, and old nets have a value; there are plenty of industries anxious to buy scrap nets for the fashion industry and bags. 
BMW is dealing with Danish firm Plastix to supply a pellet material based on recycled nets, currently at only 4,000 tonnes a year but with a contract for up to 40,000 tonnes annually.
