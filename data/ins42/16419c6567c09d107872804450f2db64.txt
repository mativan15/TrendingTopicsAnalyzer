The Arizona Cardinals have agreed to trade "undisclosed draft compensation" to the Carolina Panthers for wide receiver Robbie Anderson, the team announced Monday.

Anderson, 29, has 13 catches for 206 yards and one touchdown this season. He was removed from the Panthers' loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday by interim coach Steve Wilks after getting into a verbal spat with an assistant coach.

Wilks called it a "sideline situation" and that "no one is bigger than the team."

Anderson told his version of the story postgame.
