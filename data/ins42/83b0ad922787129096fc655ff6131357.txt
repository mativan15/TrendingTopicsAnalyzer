Stephen Stanley, chief economist for broker-dealer Amherst Pierpont, told business and policy leaders gathered at the Massachusetts Export Center in Newton Thursday that the U.S. may indeed be headed toward a recession, but not as quickly as Wall Street chatter may suggest.

The nation faces a 'very unusual set of circumstances,' with the Covid-19 pandemic undercutting businesses for at least two years, and an overload of stimulus funds and policies now overheating the economy, which the '(Federal Reserve) is trying to reverse,' said Stanley, whose New York-based firm was acquired by Santander Holdings USA last year.
