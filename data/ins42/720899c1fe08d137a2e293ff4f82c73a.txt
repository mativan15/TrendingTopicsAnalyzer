This Morning fans have criticised ITV guest Matthew Wright after the broadcaster launched a scathing attack on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations on Friday. The former The Wright Stuff host, 56, did not hold back as he discussed the ongoing celebrations for Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne with This Morning hosts Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary, as well as journalist Gyles Brandreth. The Jubilee celebrations are being spread over four days of events, and began with Trooping the Colour on Thursday, with a four-day weekend to mark the monarch's 70 year reign.
