Elon Musk delivered an ultimatum to Tesla and Space X's corporate workforces: Spend a minimum of 40 hours a week in the office, or leave the company. Musk today confirmed in a tweet that screenshots of an email sent to workers was real. According to The New York Times, workers at both companies received similar memos from Musk that made clear that all workers must report to a main office for 40 hours a week. Musk also wrote that employees would no longer be allowed to work from 'remote branch' offices not related to their job duties, giving the example of an HR worker for the Fremont factory who works out-of-state.
