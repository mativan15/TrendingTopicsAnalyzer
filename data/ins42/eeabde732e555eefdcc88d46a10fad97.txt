Suella Braverman, until Wednesday afternoon the British Home Secretary, resigned from her post, ostensibly on security grounds. The former Home Secretary had sent a sensitive email to a non-government Tory MP via her private email account. However, there appeared to be more to the story, with Ms. Braverman writing that she had 'concerns' with the embattled Liz Truss government, which is hanging on by a thread after announcing (and then reversing) tax cuts that were deeply unpopular with the markets.
