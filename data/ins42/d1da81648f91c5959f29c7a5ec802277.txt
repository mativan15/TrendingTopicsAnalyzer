Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday bemoaned the growing intolerance for opposing views in U.S. politics as a few dozen students walked out on his speech at Georgetown University.

'It seems like every day a new story breaks that says big media, big government, big tech or big biz have locked arms to advance a woke agenda designed to advance the policies and beliefs of the American left, and show intolerance to people that have divergent views,' Pence said in prepared remarks at an event at Georgetown in Washington, D.
