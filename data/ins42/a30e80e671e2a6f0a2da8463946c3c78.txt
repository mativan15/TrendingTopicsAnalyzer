Bosch's venture arm just announced its fifth fund, saying it's on the lookout for startups with the 'potential to improve quality of life and conserve natural resources.' The new, $295 million (€250 million) investment vehicle ups the stakes from Bosch VC‘s prior fund by about $53 million, yet the German firm's global focus on deep tech remains much the same. For Bosch VC, that nebulous category includes everything from autonomous vehicles to internet-of-things platforms. Climate tech is also on the firm's radar—including solar, carbon capture and alternative fuels, managing director Ingo Ramesohl said in a call with TechCrunch.
