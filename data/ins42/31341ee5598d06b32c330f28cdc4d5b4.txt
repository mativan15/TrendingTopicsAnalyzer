A Constitutional amendment transferring the subject of ‘education' from the State list to the concurrent list in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution was carried out during the 21-month Emergency period without any proper debate in Parliament and such a transfer has resulted in upsetting the federal structure envisaged by the framers of the Constitution, the State government has told the Madras High Court.In a counter affidavit filed before a Full Bench of Justices R. Mahadevan, M. Sundar and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, the State government supported the Chennai-based Aram Seyya Virumbu (ASV) Trust that had challenged Section 57 of the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act of 1976 through which the transfer took place, enabling both the Centre as well as the States to enact laws on the subject.
