The king is dead. Long live the king! In the small hours of the night, a young servant makes his way through the halls and corridors of the Red Keep. Down he goes from the upper floors of the castle to the kitchens below and the servants quarters, where he finds a young woman—handmaiden to the Queen. He whispers in her ear. She, in turn, makes her way to the chambers of Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) daughter of the Hand, Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) now Queen Dowager.
