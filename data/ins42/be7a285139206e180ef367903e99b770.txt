Dear Readers,
Last week, Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe released the latest edition of the Global Hunger Index report. It ranked India 107th out of 121 countries that could be ranked and 136 countries that were assessed; for 15 countries, individual scores could not be calculated and ranks could not be determined owing to lack of data.
The Indian government responded by summarily dismissing the report, going so far as to claim that it was done to 'taint India's image'.
