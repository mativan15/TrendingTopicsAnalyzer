A $7 million building serving as a community hub for the arts was recently named the Metal Building Contractors & Erectors Association's (MBCEA) 2022 National Building of the Year. The award comes as the center is approaching one year of having its doors open to the public.

The Arbogast Performing Arts Center, located in Troy, was recognized as MBCEA's 2022 National Building of the Year with the award being named to Foundation Steel LLC, a Toledo-based company with offices in Dayton and Columbus, for its involvement in the construction of the center.
