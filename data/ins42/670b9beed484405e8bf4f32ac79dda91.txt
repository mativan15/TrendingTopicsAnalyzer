I recently proposed the idea to my employees of working four days a week with three days off. Each employee would work two extra hours per shift, so they'd still have a 40-hour week. This will require some juggling because not everyone can have the same three-day weekend, but we can rotate. It was well-received by the employees. Will I run into any NYC labor laws that might prevent this concept?

You are smart. Most people crave flexibility and with the labor market as tight as it is, employers need to be creative and flexible in order to win the talent war.
