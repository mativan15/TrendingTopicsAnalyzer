Olivia Wilde was honored as one of Elle‘s Women in Hollywood at the magazine's celebration in Los Angeles on Monday night, and during her speech opened up about some of what she experienced during the Don't Worry Darling press tour and its aftermath. The Warner Bros. film, of course, was at the center of many stories about the complicated relationships between Wilde, her stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, and Shia LaBeouf, who originally held Styles' role. The drama came to a head during Don't Worry Darling's premiere in Venice, where the internet was convinced Styles spit on costar Chris Pine.
