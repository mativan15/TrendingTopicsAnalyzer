Keir Starmer has criticised the 'grotesque chaos' of recent weeks and said the government 'no longer has a mandate from the British people'.The Labour leader said there were no historical precedents for the ongoing economic turmoil and that the prime minister, Liz Truss, would not be able to 'fix the mess she has created'.It comes after Truss was forced to sack Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor after his mini-budget sparked panic in UK markets, causing the pound to plummet and the cost of government borrowing to soar.
