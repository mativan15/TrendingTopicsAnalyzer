A man in New York City was arrested after he was caught on camera setting a Bangladeshi restaurant on fire after they botched up his order of chicken biryani. Choephel Norbu, 49, was held after CCTV footage purportedly showed him emptying a can of gasoline just outside the Ittadi Garden and Grill in Queens and setting it ablaze.

'I was very drunk. I bought chicken biryani. They didn't give me chicken biryani. I was mad, and I threw it out,' Norbu was quoted by the New York Post as saying. The surveillance video from early morning of next day, October 2, showed the man wait outside till nobody was passing by before splashing the liquid and lighting the place up.
