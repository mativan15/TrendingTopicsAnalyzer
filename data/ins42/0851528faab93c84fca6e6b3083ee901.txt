The most accurate analyst tracking Alibaba Group Holding over the past year has maintained his bearish call on the e-commerce juggernaut and other Chinese tech stocks, arguing that their better-than-estimated recent results were simply due to base effect and cost savings.

Manuel Muehl, a Frankfurt-based analyst at DZ Bank, cut the price target of Alibaba's American depositary shares by 15 per cent to US$85 even after the Chinese company last week posted revenue growth for the March quarter that exceeded analysts' projections.
