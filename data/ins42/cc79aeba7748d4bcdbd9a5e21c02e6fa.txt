Tell almost anyone that you're off to visit the workshop of a man whose innovations included a new kind of rabbit bait cutter and a revolutionary fencing wire strainer and questioning looks are inevitable. Almost anyone that is, unless they are a keen biker who has cycled the Otago Central Rail Trail.
