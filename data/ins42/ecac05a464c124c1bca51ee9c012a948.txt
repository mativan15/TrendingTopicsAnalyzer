Boulder's Flatiron Park near 55th Street and Arapahoe Avenue was at the center of a historic $625 million purchase that counted as the largest single-asset sale in Colorado's history, according to multiple real estate sources.
BioMed Realty, a San Diego-based real estate investment trust company, announced its acquisition of the business park from JLL's Capital Markets group, which worked on behalf of Crescent Real Estate LLC, the Real Estate business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Lionstone Investments, in April.
