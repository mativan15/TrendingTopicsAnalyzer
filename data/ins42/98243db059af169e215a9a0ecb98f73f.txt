Depp sued Heard, his ex-wife, for defamation over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in which she described herself as a "public figure representing domestic abuse." Though Depp was not named in the article, he claims it cost him lucrative acting roles. Heard countersued her ex-husband for defamation over statements Depp's attorney made about her abuse claims. Weighing the claims, a jury found that both of the exes defamed each other. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million dollars in punitive damages.
