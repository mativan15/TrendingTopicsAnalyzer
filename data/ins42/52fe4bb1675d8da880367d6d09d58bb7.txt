(Bloomberg) -- Sweden's new government has scrapped the ministry for the environment in a move that critics say is indicative of policies that threaten the country's climate targets.The largest Nordic nation is widely seen as a front-runner on climate matters, and since 1987 it has had a separate ministry for environmental issues. That legacy is now coming under question, after Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson decided the new minister in charge of climate and environment policies will work under the ministry for enterprise and energy, as one of his first moves after assuming power on Tuesday.
