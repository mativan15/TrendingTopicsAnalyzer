Oct. 21—The Cass County Commissioners and the Cass County Redevelopment Commission issued an open letter this week to respond to a judge's recent dismissal of the last of five lawsuits filed by citizens against the county.

"Throughout the course of the past two plus years, the Cass County Commissioners, the Cass County Council, and County Redevelopment Commission has had to defend these lawsuits, all which were summarily dismissed with prejudice in favor of Cass County," the Cass County Commissioners and the Cass County Redevelopment Commission wrote in the letter to county residents.
