A 40-year-old man presented with a loss of his peripheral vision. A severe headache three days earlier had woken him, but his pain improved with ibuprofen. His headache had completely resolved, but he continued to have vision loss and was bumping into things on his right side.

His only symptom was the vision loss on the right, and he had no current headache, weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or fever.

The patient said he had been punched in the face 10 years earlier, and he had fallen backward and hit his head, causing a subdural hematoma that required a craniotomy.
