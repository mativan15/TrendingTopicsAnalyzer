Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said that the Government is concerned at continuing political instability in the UK, but hopes a successor to Liz Truss can be elected soon and that he will have an early engagement with them about Northern Ireland.Mr Martin said that 'on a personal level', he sympathised with Ms Truss, but said that as Britain's closest neighbour Ireland wanted to see 'stability' in the UK, and that he hoped that a successor could be selected as soon as possible.'It's a matter for Britain and for the British political system, but stability is important during these times when a major war is underway on the continent of Europe,' Mr Martin told journalists in Brussels as he entered the venue for the first day of a two-day summit of EU leaders.
