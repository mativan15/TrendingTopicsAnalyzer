Thing Sai Manrhing enjoyed farming the lush, green hillsides of Myanmar before being forced to flee his home country. He and his wife Zilhing Takluem arrived in Australia in 2013 and ever since, they have been longing to get back on the land. Mr Manrhing secured work as a picker on a blueberry farm in Coffs Harbour, on the NSW Mid North Coast, but he's always wanted to have his own farm."I enjoy farming … I wanted to start a business, my own business," he said.He also found foods like okra and rosella leaf, which are popular in Myanmar, were impossible to find or too expensive to buy from local shops.
