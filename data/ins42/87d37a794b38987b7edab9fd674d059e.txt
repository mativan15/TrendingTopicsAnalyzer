Market indices fought back from an early give-back after its mini-rally this week, but ultimately wound up closing in the red today. Perhaps the roar ahead of 3-4% going back from five trading days ago was due for a trim. The Dow closed -0.32%, the S&P 500 was -0.61% and the Nasdaq -0.85%. The Russell 2000 saw a more significant sell-off on the day, -1.72%.Quickly, the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which breached 4% yesterday, ramped up to +4.127% today. The 2-year, which had already surpassed this psychological level weeks ago, accelerated to +4.
