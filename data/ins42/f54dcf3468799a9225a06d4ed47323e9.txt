Current Notre Dame commitment, five-star safety Peyton Bowen has seen his stock rise in the recruiting ranks in recent months. He was ranked as a four-star talent when he announced his commitment on New Year's Day and has only enhanced his ranking since.

If he ends up with Notre Dame remains to be seen as Oklahoma and Texas A&M are both charging hard for his talents and his commitment hasn't been the strongest in public.

Thursday night saw Bowen and his Denton (Guyer) teammates playing on a national stage as ESPN2 showed their contest against in-state Allen.
