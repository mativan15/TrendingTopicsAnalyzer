A teenage boy was saved by bystanders on a beach when a hole he was digging in the sand suddenly collapsed on him.

Holidaymakers reportedly used children's spades to help lifeguards try to save the schoolboy as he sunk into the sand up to his neck.

He was eventually freed from the sand at Dolwen Beach in Aberporth, west Wales, on Friday (3 June).

The RNLI confirmed that two lifeguards patrolling the beach had been alerted to the drama by a member of the public who told them that a young boy had fallen into a hole.
