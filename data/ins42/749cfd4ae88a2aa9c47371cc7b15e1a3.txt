ReutersRepresentative imageAround one-third of air passengers had to pay extra money for seats on a flight in the last 12 months as free seat option was not available, according to a survey. The survey, conducted by online platform LocalCircles, was based on 30,000 responses from individuals across 351 districts. As per the survey, some 60 per cent of the respondents also batted for capping the number of paid seats at 30 per cent of the total seats. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had in 2015 announced unbundling of services, allowing Indian airlines to charge all of their fliers extra for choice of specific seats, luggage and use of airline lounges, among other facilities.
