Oct. 15—A group of Monadnock Region activists and officials have banded together and are working on a proposal to create a housing development trust fund to help combat the crippling scarcity of affordable housing in the Granite State.

The research team, comprising representatives of local housing authorities, elected officials, people who have experienced housing insecurity and members of the Monadnock Interfaith Project, formed about a year and a half ago. They began drafting a concept for a fund that would incentivize housing developers to build and price units at rates affordable for people earning less than 60 percent of the area median income.
