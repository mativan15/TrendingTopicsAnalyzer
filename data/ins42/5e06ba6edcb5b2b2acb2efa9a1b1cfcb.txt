In the previous four sessions, the stock climbed a total of 36%. A similar dynamic occurred earlier last month. From May 17 to 19, the stock fell 36% then gained 28% from May 20 to 25. The volatile nature of the stock isn't helped by general concerns over tightening of financial conditions as the Federal Reserve starts to shrink its balance sheet, a move called quantitative tightening.
