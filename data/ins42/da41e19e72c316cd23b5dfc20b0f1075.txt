But when he changed schools and his new school didn't have a program like that, the 11-year-old was upset that he couldn't continue to help others. That's when Isaac decided to start his own food bank. He used money he received for his birthday to get it started and since it opened in 2020, the service has grown so much that his family bought a shed to store the food in their backyard.
