The Warriors will pay about $170 million in luxury tax this year – an NBA record by about $73 million.

And that's with Jordan Poole making just $2,161,440 on his relatively cheap rookie-scale contract.

Poole will be eligible this offseason for a lucrative contract extension that'd take effect in 2023. That season, Stephen Curry will likely still be the NBA's highest-paid player with a salary of $51,915,615. Klay Thompson will be due $43,219,440 on the final year of his max deal. Draymond Green holds a $27,586,225 player option.
