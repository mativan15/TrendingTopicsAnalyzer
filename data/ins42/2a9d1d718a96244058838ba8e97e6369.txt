The sell-off in Datadog 's stock creates an attractive buying opportunity for investors looking to take advantage of the crippled software sector, Canaccord Genuity said. "With shares down nearly 30% since early July (vs. QQQ down ~7%), we now view DDOG as one of the best stocks to play a beaten-down software tape," wrote analyst Kingsley Crane as he upgraded shares to buy from hold. Shares of the cloud software company have plummeted nearly 56% this year, with the new price target suggesting shares can jump 39% from Wednesday's close.
