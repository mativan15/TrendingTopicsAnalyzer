Being granted access to the Ealing Comedy vaults to bring a classic from the golden age of British cinema to the stage is akin to hitting the jackpot, though it inevitably comes with a heavy payload of expectation.  
You can't say that the producers behind this touring incarnation of The Lavender Hill Mob, Charles Crichton's 1951 masterpiece, haven't tried their damnedest to remint the bank-heist caper as a theatrical delight.
Noted director Jeremy Sams heads the creative team. And comic talents Miles Jupp and Justin Edwards, darlings of Radio 4, step into Alec Guinness's mighty shoes as Holland and those of Stanley Holloway as Pendlebury.
