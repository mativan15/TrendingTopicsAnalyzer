Pennsylvania Former President Barack Obama praised Pennsylvania senatorial candidate John Fetterman in a political podcast teaser Friday, adding a jab at Republicans during the two-minute clip.In the video snippet for the next episode of Pod Save America, a political commentary series hosted by four former aides to Obama, the 44th president discussed why he thought Fetterman, the Democrat in a key Senate race, was a great candidate."The thing I love about Fetterman, and you see it in a lot of our other candidates, is you feel as if when you're talking to them that you're having a normal conversation and they have some sense of how the rest of America lives," Obama said.
