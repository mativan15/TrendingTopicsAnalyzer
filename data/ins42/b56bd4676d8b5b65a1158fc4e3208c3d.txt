In December 2021, Poland's ultraconservative, nationalist government hosted some of the biggest names in European far-right politics, including France's Marine Le Pen and Hungary's Viktor Orbán. At the close of the Warsaw gathering, the group issued a declaration against 'social engineering' aimed at creating 'a new European nation' and made promises, largely unfulfilled, to work together in the European parliament.Only a few months after the Warsaw summit, the governments of Poland and Hungary, who have been ideological soul mates in the EU for years, fell out over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
