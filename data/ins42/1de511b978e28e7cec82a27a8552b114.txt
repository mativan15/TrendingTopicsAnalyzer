Blackburn went top of the Championship as they beat former manager Tony Mowbray's Sunderland on his first return to Ewood Park.Ben Brereton Díaz put Rovers ahead when he superbly curled a left-footed effort into the top corner from the edge of the box, seconds after Sunderland had seen a penalty appeal turned down.Scott Wharton's close-range header soon after half-time put Rovers in control despite a hint of offside.Sunderland pushed to try and get back into the game but they could not find a way past a resolute home defence as Ryan Hedges' effort from almost halfway with the final kick of the game glanced the Sunderland post.
