Lululemon Athletica (LULU 4.35%) stock popped 2.2% in Thursday's after-hours trading session after the athletic wear retailer released a robust report for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 (which ended May 1). 
The market's positive reaction is attributable to the quarter's revenue and earnings both coming in higher than Wall Street had expected, second-quarter guidance exceeding the analyst consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, and management raising its full-year outlook for revenue and earnings.
