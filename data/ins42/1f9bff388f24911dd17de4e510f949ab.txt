Mel Gibson can be called upon to testify in Harvey Weinstein's Los Angeles rape and sexual assault trial, a judge ruled on Friday, reports the Associated Press.

The controversial actor's name was among those revealed as potential witnesses in Los Angeles Superior Court. Judge Lisa B. Lench said Gibson could testify about what he says he learned from one of Weinstein's accusers, known as Jane Doe No. 3, about her alleged encounter with the disgraced movie producer.

Prosecutors claimed that in May 2010 a naked Weinstein followed the woman into a Beverly Hills hotel bathroom after receiving a massage from her and masturbated.
