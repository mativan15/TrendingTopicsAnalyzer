A behemoth sunfish found dead in the Azores has broken the record for the heaviest bony fish ever recorded.According to a paper published in the Journal of Fish Biology, the enormous bump-head sunfish (Mola alexandrini), was discovered on December 9, 2021 in the waters off the Portuguese Azore islands in the North Atlantic Ocean, and measured 12 feet high, 11 feet long, and weighing 6,049 pounds. For comparison, that's about the same weight as a white rhino.This smashes the record of the previous largest bony fish, which was that of another giant sunfish from Japan in 1996, which weighed around 5,070 pounds.
