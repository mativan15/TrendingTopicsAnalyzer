CHRISTIANSBURG, Va (AP) — Jurors began deliberations Friday afternoon in the murder trial of a former college football player accused of fatally beating a man he says he initially believed from a Tinder match to be a woman.Former Virginia Tech football player Isimemen Etute, 19, is charged with second-degree murder in the 2021 death of Jerry Smith, 40, of Blacksburg.Prosecutors have told the jury that Etute, then 18, became enraged and fatally beat Smith when he discovered Smith was a man. One of the prosecutors said at closing arguments Friday that Etute gave different versions of events to police and the jury, and that the charge he faces may have been enough for him to change his testimony.
