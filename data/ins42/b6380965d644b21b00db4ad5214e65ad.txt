If you thought a recent alert about higher food, energy and production costs would turn up the heat, or at least the pressure, on Greggs, then think again. HSBC laid out its investment case for the FTSE 250 bakery business yesterday, arguing that the high street chain was in a strong position to manage costs and prompting an orderly queue for its shares.According to the bank's analysis, Greggs would need like-for-like sales to grow by more than 10.5 per cent on a volume basis for it to offset costs and hit its profit forecasts of £160 million next year.
