Arch Manning takes the field for Newman and another record falls.

The heralded Texas recruit has accounted for 129 touchdowns, setting a mark at his Louisiana high school. Manning moved ahead of Jay Tyler, a 2015 graduate who had 127.

If you are wondering what became of Tyler, he went on to play at and attend Stanford.

'I was at all of Jay's games,' Manning told Nola.com. 'He was a playmaker everywhere. It's fun to be in the same conversation with him.'
