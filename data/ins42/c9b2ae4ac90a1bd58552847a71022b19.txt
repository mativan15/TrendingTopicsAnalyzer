Scottish Labour is ready for a general election, leader Anas Sarwar has said.

Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme on Saturday, Mr Sarwar said the party is 'not afraid' of an election, and the UK Government led by Liz Truss is at 'the end of the road'.

His comments came as UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK needs a general election.

Backing his calls, Mr Sarwar said: 'I think it's clear Liz Truss is a lame duck Prime Minister. She's Prime Minister just in name.
