Howard Stern didn't mince words when talking about Kanye West and his anti-Semitic comments on his SiriusXM radio show.
 
"I almost don't want to give any energy to this Kanye West character," Stern, 68, said on Wednesday's show, per audio published on Mediaite. "I don't know much about Kanye West. I'm not big into the rap scene, but he is... I'm really tired of people excusing his behavior by saying, 'Well, he's just mentally ill.' "
 
Stern then began talking about West's recent appearance on Chris Cuomo's self-titled show.
