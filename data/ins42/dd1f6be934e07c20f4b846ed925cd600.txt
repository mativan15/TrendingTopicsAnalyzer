In Charles Perrault's telling of the tale of Puss in Boots, in his 1697 Histoires ou contes du temps passé, the moral is clear enough: hard work and knowhow – the cat's – are worth more than any inheritance. It was also clear to the Catalan composer Xavier Montsalvatge that this super-savvy puss – who ensures wealth and happiness for his master – would make a delightful operatic hero. The resulting one-act opera, El Gato Con Botas, was first staged in Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu in 1948, but a relative rarity since then.
