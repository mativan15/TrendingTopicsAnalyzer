June brings warmer weather, the anticipation of summer fun, and usually, good deals. Last year, Amazon Prime Day took place in June, meaning the month saw huge deals on big ticket items. Prime Day is set to take place in July this year, meaning you'll have to wait for those major sales, but June will still offer discounts on a range of products like tools, apparel and more.That said, not everyone seems eager to spend.
