Former President Donald Trump's real estate company dramatically overcharged the Secret Service, charging agents up to $1,185 a night for rooms at his own hotel.

A report from the House of Representatives Oversight Committee accused Trump of 'self-dealing' by soaking the taxpayer for about five times the government's normal per diem rate ranging from $195 to $240.

'The exorbitant rates ... raise significant concerns about the former President's self-dealing and may have resulted in a taxpayer-funded windfall for former President Trump's struggling businesses,' wrote the committee chair, Democratic Rep.
