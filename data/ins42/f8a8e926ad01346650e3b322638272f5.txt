3. Pharoah's Reign bumped into what looks a promising galloper when tipped out over this course a couple of weeks back. Was freshened up going into that race so fitter here and should enjoy a nice run again. Only has to hold form to go close.Dangers: 2. Miss Madison backed up a handy run here first-up with a win over 1400m on October 3. She did have a nice run behind them there and got the gap at the right time but she can only have upside and drawn to get a sweet run again. 7. Starstruck Barbie hasn't done a lot wrong this time around and was run down by a smart one in Roots at Canterbury a month ago.
