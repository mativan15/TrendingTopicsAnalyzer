Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) notably said earlier in 2022 that it would tackle incremental revenue gains by adding an advertising-supported service level, and finding ways to draw some revenue from those who shared passwords to access content on the service. And while it's tackling the ad plan part in a couple of weeks, Monday brought action on the passwords front. The streamer launched Profile Transfer, allowing users to easily move such things as personalized recommendations, viewing history, watch lists, saved games and other settings into a new account, making it easier for those users to start their own membership.
