ATLANTA

The city of Atlanta will spend $39 million to buy a 41-story downtown office tower from Georgia's state government, saying the city will redevelop the aging building to include mixed-income housing and other uses.

The state has owned the 2 Peachtree Street building for about 30 years. It was the tallest building in Atlanta when it was built in 1968 for the First National Bank of Atlanta, which eventually became part of Wells Fargo & Co.

The state has been emptying the tower of government tenants, moving some into vacant offices around the state capitol.
