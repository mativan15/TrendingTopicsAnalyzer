Prem Kumar Dhumal made his political debut in 1984 when the Hamirpur MLA at the time, Thakur Jagdev Chand, refused to contest from the constituency. Though Dhumal's beginning in electoral politics started on a rough note — he lost two elections in a row — he went on to become a central figure in Himachal Pradesh politics for the next three decades. But now, it seems, the two-time chief minister's time in state politics is drawing to a close.
The BJP did not name Dhumal, 78, in its first list of 62 candidates for the November 12 Assembly elections issued on Wednesday.
