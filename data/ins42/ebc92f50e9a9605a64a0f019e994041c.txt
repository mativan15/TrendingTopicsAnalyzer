GATINEAU, Que. — The Competition Bureau says Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. have agreed to a preliminary injunction that prevents them from closing their proposed $26-billion merger until the Competition Tribunal hears a challenge from the commissioner.

The regulatory agency says Rogers and Shaw have also agreed to the commissioner of competition's request for an expedited hearing process before the Tribunal.

Rogers has also agreed to not limit Shaw's ability to operate, maintain, enhance or expand its wireless business.
