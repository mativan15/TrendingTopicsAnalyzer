The Narendra Modi government has raised the minimum support price (MSP) of the 2022-23 wheat crop by Rs 110 to Rs 2,125 per quintal. This increase is more than the Rs 40 and Rs 50/quintal hikes of the preceding two years, but justifiable for three reasons. The first is that public wheat stocks, at 22.75 million tonnes (mt) as on October 1, are only below last year's 46.85 mt, but close to the 20.52 mt required buffer for this date. Farmers, therefore, need to be paid enough for refilling the Food Corporation of India's warehouses.
