New office with decorative links to city to open in Glasgow

A NEW office which features decorative links to Glasgow will be opening in the city this week.

Technology and engineering consultancy BJSS will be based at the office on West George Street from Wednesday.

Despite many businesses choosing to abandon offices in the wake of the pandemic, BJSS has continued to invest in spaces to allow their staff to work, collaborate, and socialise, while also giving new recruits a place to learn and grow.
