Last year, the Trust for Public Land announced that it struck an exclusive agreement to purchase Banning Ranch. As part of that agreement, the nonprofit was given one year to raise the $47 million remaining of the $97-million purchase price to secure the old oil field on the border of Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. On Thursday, the Trust for Public Land announced it had secured the final piece of funding needed to purchase the 384-acre parcel of land with a vote by the California's Wildlife Conservation Board, which promised a grant of up to $15.
