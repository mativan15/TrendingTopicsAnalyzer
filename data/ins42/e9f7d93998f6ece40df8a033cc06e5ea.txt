But Bolduc's position on leadership in Washington is unlikely to hurt him with voters, as McConnell remains unpopular in both parties. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, whom Bolduc is challenging this fall, has sought to tie Bolduc to McConnell, noting that the leader has floated a national abortion ban and suggested Bolduc would support it.

Bolduc, who ran as a 'pro-life' candidate in the primary and said he wouldn't vote otherwise, in the general election has emphasized that he would not support a federal abortion ban and believes the law should be set at the state level.
