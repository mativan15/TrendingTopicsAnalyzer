Having built, bought and partnered its way into the textbook distribution business, Chegg is launching a long-promised mobile web version today that lets readers easily read and mark up their textbooks. Of course the move is timed with Apple's forthcoming announcement event (like Kno's was), which based on everything everyone is hearing, has something to do with offering and/or creating digital textbooks.
But regardless of any potentially competitive plans, Chegg's eTextbook Reader has been in the works since August, back when Leena wrote a preview of it.
