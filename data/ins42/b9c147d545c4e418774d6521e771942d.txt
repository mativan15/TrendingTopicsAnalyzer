Almost a million NHS workers could go on strike this winter as Unison announced it is to ballot its members on industrial action.The trade union, which represents staff including nurses, ambulance crews, hospital porters and cleaners, said its 400,000 members would start voting on October 27.It joins other unions for nurses, midwives, ambulance crews and physiotherapists which are also holding ballots, driven by a government proposal for a below-inflation pay rise. In the summer the government announced that most staff on non-doctor contracts could expect a £1,400 pay increase.
