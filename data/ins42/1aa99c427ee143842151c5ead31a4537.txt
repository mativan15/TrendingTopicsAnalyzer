Russia's Ministry of Finance is reportedly considering accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for international trade to soften the effects of the growing lists of sanctions imposed by different countries.
"The issue of using such digital currencies as barter transactions for international settlements is being actively discussed. If the digital currency is recognized as property, in principle, within the framework of barter transactions with such digital currency, it will be possible to carry out operations on foreign economic activity," financial policy department head Ivan Chebeskov said as reported by Interfax.
