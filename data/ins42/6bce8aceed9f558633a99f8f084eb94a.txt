Neil Hudson, MP for Penrith and The Border, said Ms Mordaunt has the 'experience, empathy and compassion to unite our country', while West Bromwich East MP Nicola Richards said she will be 'the stabilising, calm and collected figure we need'.
Keighley MP Robbie Moor said he believes in Ms Mordaunt's ability to 'interact with colleagues' and that she is the 'unifying character' and is able to go forward with 'calmness'.
Before politics, Ms Mordaunt worked as a magician's assistant as well as in Romanian orphanages.
