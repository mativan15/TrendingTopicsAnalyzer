Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree stating that certain foreign copyright holders may be paid in rubles, expanding on previous counter-measures against companies based in ‘unfriendly countries' that are currently imposing sanctions on Moscow. Published on a government website on Friday, the executive order extends the existing special ruble-based payment mechanism to include the fulfillment of financial obligations to some intellectual property owners, including those that are 'associated with unfriendly countries,' have 'supported anti-Russian sanctions,' or ceased business activity in Russia under the pretext of penalties and pressure from their own governments.
