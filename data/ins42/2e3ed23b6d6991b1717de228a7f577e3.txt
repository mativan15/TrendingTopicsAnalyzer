The Reserve Bank of India is committed to containing inflation while keeping growth in mind, governor Shaktikanta Das told MC Govardhana Rangan and Bodhisatva Ganguli in an interview, during which he also spoke about borrowing, crypto and the reform agenda. Edited excerpts: 
You had said that the May 4 interest rate hike was the beginning of reversal of the cuts. The next meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC) is due on June 6-8. Is there a temptation to do the remaining 75 basis points in one shot?

I can't say what the next MPC will decide.
