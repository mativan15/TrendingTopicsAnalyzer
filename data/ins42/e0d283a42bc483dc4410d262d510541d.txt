Blisters, a broken conversation, a selfie
It is about 4.30 am. Rahul Rao, the national chairman of the media wing of the Indian Youth Congress, is feverish and his body is hurting all over. The Bharat Jodo Yatra has spent overnight in containers near Halakundi Mutt, Ballari, and is to cover 24 km to Rampur, just a breath short of the 1,000-km mark of the 3,500-km march.
Rao, 38, who belongs to Haryana and was the state president of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI), is among the more than 117 people walking with Rahul for the entire length of the Yatra.
