As a dividend investor I've made it a mission to boost my holdings of real estate investment trusts (or REITs). I think they're a great way for me to give my long-term passive income a shot in the arm.

Benefits of these kinds of shares include:

They pay 90% of annual profits out in the form of dividends.

REITs are popular with international investors, a quality that gives them more cash to put to work.

They offer me a wide range of property sectors to invest in, thus reducing my risk through diversification.
