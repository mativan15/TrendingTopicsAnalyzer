A legal battle could halt the National Lottery for the first time in 30 years, depriving good causes and players of millions of pounds, the regulator has warned.
In court submissions seen by The Telegraph, the Gambling Commission said a legal challenge by Camelot against its loss of the lottery licence could delay the handover to its rival Allwyn on February 1 2024.
In evidence to the High Court, John Tanner, the Commission's executive director, warned it could cause the Czech-based operator Allwyn to have insufficient 'implementation' time, resulting in a 'real risk that there will be a period when the National Lottery does not operate at all.
