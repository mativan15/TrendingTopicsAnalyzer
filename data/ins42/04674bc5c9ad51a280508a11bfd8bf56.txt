As the host venue for the China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo, Hunan will build six functional centers and hubs, including a trade center for non-resource products, a China-Africa cross-border renminbi settlement center and a logistics hub to broaden channels for African products to enter China in the coming years, said Shen Yumou, a delegate to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and also director-general of Hunan's provincial department of commerce.
