Former president Barack Obama said Friday that he is open to reforming the Supreme Court to increase Americans' confidence in the Court, but warned against playing 'explicit political games.'

Asked during an appearance on Pod Save America whether he would consider reforms to regain voters trust in the Court, Obama said: 'I'm open to it.'

'I think it has to be thought through,' he said. 'One of the arguments we made at the time when [Mitch] McConnell decided that … [Merrick Garland] wouldn't even get a hearing or a vote, is that if you start playing such explicit political games in the appointment process, it's hard for people not to feel as if this is just an extension of day-to-day congressional politics as opposed to — the Supreme Court stands above, to some degree, those politics.
