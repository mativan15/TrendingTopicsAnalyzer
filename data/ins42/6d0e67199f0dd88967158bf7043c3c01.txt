It is no secret that injuries have ravaged Los Angeles Lakers superstar big man Anthony Davis over the last two years.
There has been a calf strain, Achilles tendonosis, a groin injury, a sprained MCL and a sprained foot, all of which have prevented him from appearing in more than 40 games in either of the last two seasons.
It caused former NBA superstar and 'Inside the NBA' analyst Charles Barkley to nickname Davis 'Street Clothes.'
The big man insisted that he disregards Barkley's criticism of his inability to remain healthy.
