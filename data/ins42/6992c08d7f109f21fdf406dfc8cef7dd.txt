Oct. 21—Seafoodie founder and owner Kendale Robinson did a lot of things before starting his seafood food truck.

He joined the US Army, attended college and became a nationally trained pharmacy technician and worked for some of the largest healthcare systems in the country, including UNC.

But it was his time in Maryland that changed his career trajectory. While working at John Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland, Robinson was introduced to the Maryland style of seafood, which is different from what the Richmond County native grew up eating.
