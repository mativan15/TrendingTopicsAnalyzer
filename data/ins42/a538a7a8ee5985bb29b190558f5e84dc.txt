Steve Spurrier hasn't coached in a college football game since 2015, but the 'Head Ball Coach' still has strong feelings about the sport where he found success at three schools.

Spurrier, who coached at Duke, Florida and South Carolina, was among the game's most colorful characters as well as an innovator with his 'Fun-N-Gun' offense. But he didn't think he'd enjoy coaching college football today as much as he used to.

Prior to receiving the AutoZone Liberty Bowl's Distinguished Citizen Award on Sunday, Spurrier said he supported players receiving name, image and likeness deals but favored a different approach to what's in play now.
