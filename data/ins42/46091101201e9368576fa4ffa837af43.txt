TAMPA — The 'Summer of Gronk' will continue, uninterrupted by the Bucs' mandatory minicamp.

Tight end Rob Gronkowski remains unsigned and won't be part of the team's full squad workouts June 7-9.

Officially, he's undecided about this NFL future. Unofficially, the Bucs are optimistic he will re-sign with the team sometime before it reports to training camp in late July.

A couple of weeks ago, Tom Brady posted video of Gronkowski, 33, shagging fly balls while Brady took batting practice at the New York Yankees training facility off Himes Avenue in Tampa.
