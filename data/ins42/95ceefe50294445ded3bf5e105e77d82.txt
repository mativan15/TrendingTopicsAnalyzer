Canton-based contractor Barletta Heavy Division Inc. will pay a $500,000 criminal fine and an additional $1 million to resolve a federal investigation into false statements made to government officials in connection with a highway interchange reconstruction project in Providence.

Barletta is majority owner of the joint venture awarded a contract by the Rhode Island government in 2017 to rebuild the Route 6-Route 10 interchange. In the summer of 2020, Barletta trucked in thousands of tons of stone from another of its projects, an MBTA project in Jamaica Plain, without notifying government officials or testing the stone for contamination, according to prosecutors.
