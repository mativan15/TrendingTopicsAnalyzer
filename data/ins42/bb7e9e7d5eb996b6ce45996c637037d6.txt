This past week, a local coffee and chocolate business celebrated the grand opening of two new buildings in Piqua that doubled its production space. The roughly $1 million investment is the latest in a projected plan of expansions for the business.

Winans Chocolates + Coffees latest expansion has brought a dedicated coffee roasting and storage facility to 222 Spring St. in their home base of downtown Piqua. The new facility, known as 'The Roastery at Winan's', is located in a former auto repair shop that has been updated to focus solely on coffee production.
