Published: 06:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 06:25 EDT, 19 October 2022 Pakistani officials have said the World Bank estimates this summer's record-breaking floods have caused the country 40 billion US dollars (£35 billion) of damage. The figure is 10 billion dollars (£8.8 billion) more than an earlier estimate by the Pakistani government. Cash-strapped Pakistan was already facing a serious financial crisis before the heavy monsoon rains hit in mid-June. The rains triggered unprecedented floods that at one point left a third of the country's territory submerged, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move to safer places.
