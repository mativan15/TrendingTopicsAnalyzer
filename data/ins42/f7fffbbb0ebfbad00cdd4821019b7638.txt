GREEN BAY — The Jets came into their game against the Packers trying to do something they haven't done in seven seasons.

The last time Gang Green was at least two games over .500, Adele's 'Hello' was the number of song in America.

A week after winning their first AFC East game since 2019, the Jets were looking for another monumental victory, this time against the Packers at Lambeau Field.

After a low-scoring affair in the first half, the Jets prevailed in the second.

The Jets (4-2) scored three second half touchdowns to cruise past the Packers (3-3) 27-10 on a cloudy, chilly day at Lambeau Field in front of 78,343 in attendance.
