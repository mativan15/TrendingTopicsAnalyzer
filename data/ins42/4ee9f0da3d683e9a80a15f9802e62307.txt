Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said a law to check superstitions and archaic practices in the state will be brought soon after two alleged human sacrifice cases in Pathanamthitta in a span of three months. Addressing a function in Alappuzha, Vijayan said in the wake of some of the shocking incidents there was a demand for a stringent law to curb blind beliefs and customs and the government will bring it soon.
