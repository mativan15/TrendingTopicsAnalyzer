Joe Lycett has lead the responses to the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss after just 44 days in office.

During her resignation speech to the nation yesterday at 1:30pm, Truss also announced that the Conservative Party's next leader will be chosen in a week's time.

Comedian Lycett, in his typically tongue in cheek manor, then tweeted at Truss: 'Omg just heard there's a leadership election nxt week????? U shud run babe youd be perfect!!!'

The comment is part of a long-running gag ever since Lycett appeared on the premiere episode of Laura Kuenssberg's politics talk show last month.
