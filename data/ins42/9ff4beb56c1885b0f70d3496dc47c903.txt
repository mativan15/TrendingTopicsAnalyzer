Cara Delevingne made some realizations about herself while filming "Planet Sex" and attending a "masturbation seminar."

The former Victoria's Secret model explained that she "didn't realize" she was "a prude" until she embarked on the personal journey.

"I went into the masturbation seminar thinking it was going to be a classroom and I'd have a notepad, and instead it was a pink, leather gym mat on the floor, with six people going, ‘Well, take your underwear off. This is the lube,'" Delevingne explained at the international TV market Mipcom, according to Variety.
