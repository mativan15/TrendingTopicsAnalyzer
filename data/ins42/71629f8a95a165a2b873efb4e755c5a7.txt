Helios Dayspring, a cannabis entrepreneur, was sentenced Friday to 22 months in prison for bribing a public official and filing a false tax return. (Associated Press)Helios Dayspring had one goal: build a cannabis empire that, in his words, would be 'too big to fail.'But as he acquired hundreds of acres of land to grow the product and opened storefronts along California's Central Coast to sell it, Dayspring's ambition led him to bribery.His target was a county supervisor who, in exchange for cash and other perks, pushed measures that advanced the interests of his secret benefactor and tried to stifle those that didn't.
