A GoFundMe campaign started in honor of Irma Garcia, one of the two teachers killed in the Texas school shooting, and her husband, Joe, who died Thursday, has raised more than $2.6 million in just four days. Debra Austin, Irma's cousin, apparently started the campaign, which has also been covered by other national outlets including CNN and the Washington Post. NBC News was not able to independently confirm Austin's identity by press time. The Detroit Free Press reported that it confirmed that the account has been verified by the site.
