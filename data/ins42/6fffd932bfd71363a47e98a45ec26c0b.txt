Fayetteville city staff aren't proposing any tax or fee increases for residents and business owners, but there's still a chance that could change.

Based on guidance from elected officials and city staff, Fayetteville City Manager Doug Hewett has proposed increasing the city's budget for the upcoming year — but not at a cost to residents.

The proposed budget was the last item on the agenda for the Fayetteville City Council meeting on May 23. After the council had been discussing city business for more than three hours, Hewett asked for everyone's attention.
