In the fall of 1965, Queen Elizabeth's younger sister, Princess Margaret, embarked on a charm offensive in a former—and now long-lost—British colony. Landing in San Francisco with some 50 pieces of luggage and her husband, Lord Snowden, the Princess wowed the nation, touring American cities and visiting President Lyndon B. Johnson and the First Lady 'Lady Bird' in the White House. She then came to the United Nations for a series of meetings and a luncheon. Standing out in large cylindrical wool hat, pink dress, and long gloves, the princess mingled with diplomats at a reception hosted by the UK's ambassador.
