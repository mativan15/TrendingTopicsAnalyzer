Khattar asks public to alert agencies about adulterated food items

 

Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday called upon public to immediately alert police, CM flying squad or food supplies department if they get any information about anyone involved in the production and sale of adulterated food items. 'Apart from CM flying squad, special teams of different departments are conducting raids to catch those producing, manufacturing and selling adulterated food items,' Khattar said in a statement, assuring that those playing with the health of people by selling adulterated food items, especially sweets will not be spared.
