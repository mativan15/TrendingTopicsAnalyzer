The last three months have been tough on BioLife Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLFS) shareholders, who have seen the share price decline a rather worrying 46%. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been spectacular. To be precise, the stock price is 496% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain.
