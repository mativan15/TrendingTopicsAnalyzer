Home prices surged 20.6% annually in March, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index, and marked the strongest annual gain in the history of the report. The bump was an increase from the 20% annual gain seen in February, and prices jumped 2.1% from February to March on a monthly basis.  "Those of us who have been anticipating a deceleration in the growth rate of U.S. home prices will have to wait at least a month longer," S&P Dow Jones Indices Managing Director Craig Lazzara said.
