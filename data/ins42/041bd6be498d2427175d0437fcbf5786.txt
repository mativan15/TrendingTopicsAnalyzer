Both sides had early chances, with Cheick Doucoure hitting the post with a bouncing pile-driver for Palace in the fifth minute before Diego Costa scuffed a close-range shot for the visitors that was deflected wide for a corner at the other end.Known more for his tricky dribbling and powerful shooting than his aerial ability, Wolves winger Adama Traore opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a superb downward header from Hugo Bueno's cross to give his side the lead.Palace levelled early in the second half with a goal that bore more than a passing resemblance to Traore's, with Eberechi Eze ghosting in at the far post before firing a downward header back across the goal and in.
