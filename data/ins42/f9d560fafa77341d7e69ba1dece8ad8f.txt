CNN  —  
 The son of an American citizen imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for criticizing the Saudi government said Tuesday evening that his father is 'nowhere near being a dissident.' 'My father is a senior American citizen who just wants to live freely and happy in the United States where he got his education,' Saad Ibrahim Almadi's son, Ibrahim Almadi, told CNN's Erin Burnett on 'OutFront.' The US State Department confirmed earlier Tuesday that 72-year-old Saad Ibrahim Almadi has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia after being given a 16-year sentence for tweets critical of the Saudi government.
