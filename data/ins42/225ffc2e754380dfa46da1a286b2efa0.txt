The first crop of earnings reports was a disappointment, but most of the early bank reports on Friday were decent, and Bank of America also reported earnings above expectations Monday morning.

Thirty- five companies have reported third-quarter earnings so far. Of that group, 68.5% have beaten estimates, lower than the prior four-quarter average of 78.1% but higher than the historic average of 66.2%, according to Refinitiv.

Like the second quarter, many have been anticipating an earnings apocalypse — a dramatic collapse in earnings.
