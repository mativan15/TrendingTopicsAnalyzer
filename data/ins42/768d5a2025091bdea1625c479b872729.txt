Xi Jinping is ready for self-anointment as the uncrowned king of China for life. His merry band of Communists will sound the fanfare during the forthcoming 20th Party Congress. Much ado will be made of revenge on the 'century of humiliation' through the 'rejuvenation of the Chinese nation' to achieve the 'Chinese Dream' as enunciated in Xi Jinping Thought. Major achievements under his exalted leadership will be showcased. He will shout from the rooftop that the People's Republic of China (PRC) will be a strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and modern socialist country and the foremost global power which dominates great power relations by 2049.
