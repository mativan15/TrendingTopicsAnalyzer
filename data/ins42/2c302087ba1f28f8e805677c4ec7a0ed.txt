The 2022 Tribeca Festival said OKX will become its first cryptocurrency partner and sponsor as it prepares to unspool in NYC June 8-19.
The fest over the years has added podcasting, gaming, music and VR/AR experiences to its core in film, television and robust lecture series. A cryptocurrency partner supports an 'exploration into new frontiers of artistic expression,' Tribeca said.
'Cryptocurrency is opening up new doors for artists to explore the boundaries of storytelling, and the Tribeca Festival is proud to be at the forefront of this evolution.
