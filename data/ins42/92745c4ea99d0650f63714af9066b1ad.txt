(Bloomberg) -- Toronto-Dominion Bank's US commercial lending chief sees loan demand growing even as the Federal Reserve aggressively hikes rates that are already at the highest since 2008. 'Depending on where rates end up leveling off, in certain sectors, you may see flat to low growth, but in others you'll still see growth,' said Chris Giamo, in an interview Tuesday. 'So I would say it'd be moderate growth.'The business-loan book at Toronto-Dominion's US business grew about 2% in the three months through July when compared with a year earlier and excluding the effect of the government's forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans.
