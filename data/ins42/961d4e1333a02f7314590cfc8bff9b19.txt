She was working for a mortgage company in Kissimmee, at the time, and later started her own business.

Court records show she is also accused of stealing the identities of judges.

According to the federal indictment, she is accused of making fake divorce documents, including forging judges' signatures in the 9th judicial circuit, and making fake child support documents to make it seem as though the borrowers had more money coming in than they really did.
