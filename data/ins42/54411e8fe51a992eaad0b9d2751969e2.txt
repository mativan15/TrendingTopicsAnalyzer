Published: 20:16 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 20:18 EDT, 31 May 2022 A simple and little-known tax deduction could see Aussies receive a bonus $2,000 this financial year. New data has revealed at least 30 per cent of Australians are spending up to $1,936 on employment-related learning every year, a cost that is tax deductible. Accounting for the other 70 per cent of Aussies who don't spend any of their money on personal education, the average spent each year is about $587. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) states that any self-education expenses are deductible if the course has 'sufficient' connection to your current employment.
