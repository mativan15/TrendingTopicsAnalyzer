Still waiting for a dramatic earnings decline, but what if it happened? Approaching 20% of the S & P 500 reporting, and so far companies are not slashing estimates. Third-quarter blended earnings for the S & P 500 are still at 3.0%, slightly higher than a few days earlier, while fourth-quarter estimates are at 4.7%, only slightly below the 5.8% expected on Oct. 1.
