Leon Neal/Getty Images News Markets are reacting positively to another major U-turn for the new U.K. government Monday. Newly-installed Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt announced scrapping nearly all new tax-cut plans that were in the mini-budget that sent yields soaring. The government will also shorten energy cost support to April 2023. 'We will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago that have not started parliamentary legislation," Hunt said, adding that the drastic move was needed for economic stability.
