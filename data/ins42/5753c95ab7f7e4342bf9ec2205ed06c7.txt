I doubt that even Razer realized how popular its 'Kitty Edition' of the Kraken headset would become when it released the first version a few years ago. Chalk it up to the popularity of blinged-out gamer streams, or maybe people just like looking adorable while racking up kills in CS:GO. Whatever the reason, Razer isn't going to argue with success. The latest version, christened the Kraken Kitty V2 Pro, features interchangeable kitty, bear, and bunny ears. And before you ask, yes, they all light up with Razer's Chroma RGB lighting system.
