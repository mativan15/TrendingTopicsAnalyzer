TOKYO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Japan is still checking details of a Russian decree on the giant Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project and will continue talks with stakeholders in the previous operating consortium to decide whether to invest in a new Russian operator.

"We have repeatedly said Sakhalin-1 is a very important project for Japan," Japan's industry minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told a news conference on Tuesday.
