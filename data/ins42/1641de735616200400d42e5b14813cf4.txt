The government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the August release of 11 men convicted and sentenced to life in prison for gang-raping a Muslim woman and murdering members of her family during the 2002 Gujarat religious riots, according to court documents.
The approval letter from India's home ministry, headed by Modi's close aide Amit Shah, was uploaded on social media by legal site The Leaflet.
The release of the convicts in August and their subsequent felicitation by right-wing activists had caused outrage.
