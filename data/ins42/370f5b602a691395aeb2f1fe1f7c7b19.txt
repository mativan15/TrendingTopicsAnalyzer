AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — A legislative committee is going to sue the Maine Department of Health and Human Services for access to full investigative files on child murders.

The Government Oversight Committee took action Tuesday with an 8-1 vote after the agency failed to comply with a subpoena requesting the files.

The DHHS shared the files with the Legislature's watchdog, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability. But it did not share them with committee members.

Committee members said the refusal of the DHHS to comply with the subpoena violated the separation of powers.
