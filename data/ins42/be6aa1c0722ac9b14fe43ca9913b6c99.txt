Watcher is part of our Overlook Film Festival coverage, and is now available to stream on Shudder.According to the New York State Attorney General, 1 in 12 women will be stalked in their lifetime. Which is to say that it makes sense that stalking was a bit of a theme at Overlook Film Festival. Jethica and Shudder's Watcher both played in the 4-day festival's truncated lineup of films. Though the first introduces a spectral element, Chloe Okuno's Watcher grounds itself in hard, cold reality. Maika Monroe plays Julia — an American woman who has followed her husband to Bucharest, Romania.
