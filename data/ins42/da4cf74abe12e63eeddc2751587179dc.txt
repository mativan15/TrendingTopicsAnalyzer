Formal appeals were filed Wednesday by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and the RI Turnpike and Bridge Authority over a ruling against the state's truck-toll system. A federal judge ordered the state to stop collections last month. The American Trucking Association filed a lawsuit after the tolls went online in 2018, arguing it was unconstitutional to toll one class of vehicles and exempt others. Rhode Island legislative leaders have said there will be no tolling of passenger cars. The money stream created has been earmarked for road infrastructure improvements.
