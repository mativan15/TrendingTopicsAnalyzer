A high-profile coterie of former US military and intelligence officials who tried to discredit The Post's reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop are now being accused of taking money from Big Tech to spread 'misinformation' about antitrust legislation, The Post has learned.
In an open letter circulated to members of Congress last month, former US security brass, including Leon Panetta and James Clapper — who served as defense secretary and director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, respectively — warned that several proposed bills to rein in Big Tech could carry unintended consequences.
