Out of every piece of wearable technology I've ever owned or reviewed, the Oura Ring has been the one I have worn most consistently. In fact, I have almost a year's worth of unbroken historical data logged in the app, and that's more than I have for the Apple Watch, my other preferred piece of wearable tech.
While I have a year's worth of data, six months of this has been with the most recent third-generation version of the ring, making it a good time to revisit why I've barely taken it off. However, while I love the Oura Ring now, I don't know how much longer that will continue.
