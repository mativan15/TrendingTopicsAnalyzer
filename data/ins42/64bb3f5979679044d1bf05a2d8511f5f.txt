UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is now effectively prime minister, according to former government adviser Alex Dawson, as calls for Liz Truss to quit grow. "He calls the shots on this number one issue, which is about how the UK restores its fiscal credibility. And all the sort of discretionary stuff that Liz Truss wants to do, it's not really in her power anymore," Dawson said on "Bloomberg Daybreak: Europe." (Source: Bloomberg)
