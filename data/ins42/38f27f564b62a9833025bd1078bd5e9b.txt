A Ukrainian parliamentary delegation visiting Japan is calling on countries to put more pressure on Russia. This is the first time that a delegation from Kyiv has visited Japan since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began in February. The group consists of five members of the Ukrainian parliament. It arrived at Narita Airport near Tokyo on Saturday. Among the lawmakers are an economic expert and a former soldier, who fought against pro-Russian armed groups. The lawmakers are scheduled to stay in Japan until October 26.
