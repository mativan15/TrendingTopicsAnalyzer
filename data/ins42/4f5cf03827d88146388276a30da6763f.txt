May 28—BREMEN — On the first Monday of every month, a dozen or so people in the Cold Springs community file into the small garage response center that serves as the headquarters for the area's volunteer firefighting department. Some of them are retired; some of them have day jobs, and one or two — still in their teens — may even be full-time students at the county school just a stone's throw away.

But one thing they all have in common is a shared belief in being there for the unincorporated community they call home — even though none of them makes a dime of money in compensation for their service.
