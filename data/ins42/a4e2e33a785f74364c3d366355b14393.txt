FRANFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -Merck KGaA does not anticipate that a projected decline in smartphone sales this year will weigh on its semiconductor chemicals business, CEO Belen Garijo told Reuters on Thursday, insisting the market remained attractive.

Sales of mobile phones, the biggest driver of the microchip market, are forecast to fall 7.1% this year amid economic uncertainty and a cost of living crisis.

Besides making pharmaceuticals and lab equipment, family-controlled German conglomerate Merck supplies chemicals and materials used in making semiconductors.
