Steve Pope/Getty Images News Article Thesis STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) is a triple-net leased REIT that primarily invests in single-tenant operational real estate. The REIT offers an attractive yield of close to 6%, trades at an inexpensive valuation, is partially owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), and offers solid inflation protection through the real-asset nature of its business. All in all, STORE Capital looks like an attractive choice at current prices. Overview Triple-net leased REITs have the advantage of very low ongoing expenses, as the tenant is responsible for almost all costs, including maintenance, insurance, and taxes.
