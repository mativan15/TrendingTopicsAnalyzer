A viral clip shows an activist berate Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over his gun views in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas school massacre.
The confrontation, filmed Friday, came hours after the conservative lawmaker delivered a speech at a National Rifle Association convention in Houston.
'Why does this keep happening?' an irate man yells, accusing Cruz of 'taking blood money' by giving the speech days after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School that killed 19 children and two adults.
The activist, identified as Benjamin Hernandez with the liberal-leaning group Indivisible Houston, yells as security pushes him out of the eatery.
