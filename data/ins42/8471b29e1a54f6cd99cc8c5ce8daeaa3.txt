The row over Kylian Mbappé's decision to stay at Paris Saint-Germain has become so bitter that the French league president has warned of possible legal action against his Spanish counterpart Javier Tebas.Mbappé rejected a move to Real Madrid prompting Tebas, who had hoped La Liga would land football's brightest young star, to say it was 'an insult to football' that oil money — PSG is owned by Qatar — had triumphed.Vincent Labrune has written to Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, to complain about Tebas — who is also a Uefa executive committee member.
