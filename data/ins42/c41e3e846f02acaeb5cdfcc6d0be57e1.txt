ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A federal jury acquitted Russian analyst Igor Danchenko on Tuesday on four counts of lying to the FBI in what is expected to be the final case stemming from special counsel John Durham's three-year probe into the origins of the agency's investigation into alleged ties between former President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia.The jury deliberated for more than 10 hours before reaching a verdict.Prosecutors alleged Danchenko provided false information to the FBI in 2017 when the agency was trying to verify information in a dossier detailing Trump's alleged ties to Russia that was compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.
