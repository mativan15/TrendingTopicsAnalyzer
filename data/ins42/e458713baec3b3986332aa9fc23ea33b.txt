NEW YORK, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- PensionInspector™ (www.pensioninspector.com), the brainchild of long-time Enrolled Actuary David Tananbaum, has a new app. The PensionInspector™ is an extensive, user-friendly program for the general public that simplifies research and reduces it to minutes instead of hours.

And now Tananbaum has introduced an app to the PensionInspector's™ website – the "Retirement Plan Inflation Eraser."

The Inflation Eraser separates a retirement plan's Form 5500 accumulated average earnings and an inflation factor to show the plan's net intrinsic value for that year.
