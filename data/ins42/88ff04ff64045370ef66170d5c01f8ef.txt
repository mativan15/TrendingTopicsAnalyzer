A new do-it-yourself (DIY) home design show set in Milwaukee is scheduled to premiere in November on cable's Magnolia Network, owned by popular television stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.

The show, "Makeover by Monday," will feature Milwaukee home DIY designer Jenni Yolo of the website and social media brand I Spy DIY LLC. In the show, filmed this summer in the Milwaukee area, Yolo and her team go into clients' homes to lead three-day DIY room makeovers. Each episode also features a visit to a local business, she said.
