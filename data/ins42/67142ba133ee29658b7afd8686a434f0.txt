The majority of the NBA tips off the 2022-23 regular season on Wednesday as the Dallas Mavericks travel to face the Phoenix Suns in a rematch of the Western Conference semifinals.
Of course, the Mavericks defeated the Suns in Game 7 to advance to the Western Conference Finals. Dallas led by as many as 46 points in that contest and completely dominated Phoenix from start to finish to send the top-seeded Suns home.
They meet again having made some changes over the offseason.
The Mavericks added Christian Wood, JaVale McGee, Theo Pinson, Facundo Campazzo and Jaden Hardy to the roster over the offseason.
