Working as a design director for multinational brands, Kim Chin (@_kim.chin) travelled worldwide and handled huge projects. But it took returning to her childhood bedroom in the Queensway/Bayswater area – and being stuck there by the pandemic – for her to rediscover her creative mojo.Chin now lives in south-east London and uses two workspaces - creating moodboards and sketches at V.O Studios in central London, before printing her designs at Bainbridge Studios.'I was working for major brands, so when I moved to do my own practice, it was a shock,' she says.
