ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopian authorities said Monday they are aiming to get immediate control of airports and other infrastructure in Tigray, a statement of their war intentions that was followed by the capture of a town in the embattled northern region.

Shire, a major northwestern town in Tigray, was captured Monday afternoon by Ethiopia's federal military and allied forces, according to four humanitarian aid sources who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns.
