The organizer of an outdoor screening of Batman movie 'The Dark Knight' has cancelled the projection after being warned by the Hong Kong government against going ahead, according to reports. The Christopher Nolan-directed movie was partially filmed in the city in 2007. It was released in Hong Kong theaters in 2008. But it was not able to be released in mainland China. Financial news publisher Bloomberg reported on Friday that a planned screening of 'The Dark Knight' on Oct. 27, 2022, has been cancelled.
