Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers on whether they distrusted billionaires or politicians more.

He then asked AOC to do the same: "I dare you to run the same poll with your followers."

Musk and AOC have previously clashed on topics such as unionization and free speech.

On Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dared Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to poll her Twitter followers on whether they distrusted billionaires or politicians more.
