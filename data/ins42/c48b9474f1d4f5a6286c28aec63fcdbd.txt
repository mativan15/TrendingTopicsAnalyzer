Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world's largest electric vehicle maker and an absolute powerhouse when it comes to innovation, AI and execution. The company recently announced mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2022, as Tesla missed revenue estimates. However, the company still generated record sales across all segments and the long-term story is still strong. In fact, Elon Musk believes Tesla could be "worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined". Now of course, we should take Musk's exuberance with a "pinch of salt" but the financials and order volume don't lie.
