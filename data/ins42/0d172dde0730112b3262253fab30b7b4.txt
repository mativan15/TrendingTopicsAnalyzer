Nicaragua has switched diplomatic allegiance to China, leaving Taiwan with just 14 governments around the world that formally recognise it as a country.The announcement by the Central American country's foreign ministry also recognised Beijing's claim over Taiwan as a Chinese province, a dispute that is at the heart of escalating tensions in the region.'The government of the Republic of Nicaragua today breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan and ceases to have any contact or official relationship,' said the statement issued in Spanish and English.
