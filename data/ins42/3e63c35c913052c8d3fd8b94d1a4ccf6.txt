Nineteen percent of registered voters said recent disagreements with family or friends over political issues have hurt their relationship, according to a new Siena College-The New York Times poll.

Independents and Democrats were more likely to say so — at 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively — compared to just 14 percent of Republicans.

The poll found political disagreements more often hurt relationships for women and white registered voters with a college degree, although solid majorities across all demographics said their relationships had not been hurt.
