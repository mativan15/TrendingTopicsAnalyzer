Kilmarnock manager Derek McInnes: "Special night for everyone that turned up of a Kilmanork persuasion. It was an opportunity for us to take a step forward and get to a semi-final."We set out from the start of the group stage at Fraserborough - which seems an eternity ago now when we were trying to put a squad together - to see the bigger picture that if you get through the group stages you're a couple of games from Hampden and that's how it's played out."I think we got the reward for winning at Tynecastle with a home tie against Dundee United, they've been in good form the past few games and they've been doing a lot of good; counter attacking threat and good players at the top of the pitch.
