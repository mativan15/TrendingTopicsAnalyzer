Jimmy Carr made a savage quip at co-star Amanda Holden's expense on BBC show I Can See Your Voice on Saturday night.
The comic, who is known for his brutal jokes, was firing on all cylinders during Saturday's episode of the show, hosted by Paddy McGuinness, during which a panel of celebrities along with a guest singer have to suss out whether somebody is a good or bad singer, solely based on their looks and before they've opened their mouth.
