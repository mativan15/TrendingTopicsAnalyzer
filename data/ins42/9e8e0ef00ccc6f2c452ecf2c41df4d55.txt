Amazon.com Inc. has launched an invite-only shopping program designed to prevent 'bad actors' from buying large quantities of in-demand items and reselling them at a steep markup. The program doesn't require a Prime membership or a fee to participate. It launches in the U.S. with  PlayStation5 and Xbox Series X game consoles that are sold and fulfilled by the e-commerce giant. Customers select the 'Request Invitation' option on the product information page to purchase. The number of invitations will be determined by the inventory available for the item.
