The world could be facing the longest recession it has seen since the Global Financial Crisis over a decade ago, according to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Asked to predict the length of a contraction in economic activity, the world's richest and most successful entrepreneur responded on Thursday 'probably until spring of '24.'

This would set the U.S. gross domestic product on course to shrink for a period longer than the 18-month recession of the Global Financial Crisis, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.
