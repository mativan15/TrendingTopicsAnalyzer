Auburn's new football training facility will be called the Woltosz Football Performance Center and the weight room will be named the Creel Family Player Development Lab, Auburn announced Thursday afternoon.
The move comes in recognition of leadership gifts by the families that Auburn University's Board of Trustees approved on Sept. 16.
The names honor Walt and Ginger Woltosz, and Keith and Ginger Creel, members of Tigers Unlimited Foundation's Pat Dye Society, Auburn Athletics' highest level of giving.
