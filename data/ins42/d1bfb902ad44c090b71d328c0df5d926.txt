Faux's 30 per cent estimate has been corroborated by Dr Tony Webber, a GP and former head of Medicare watchdog the Professional Services Review. While running the regulator for six years until late 2011, he estimated misuse of Medicare was costing Australians up to $3 billion a year. 'I've read [Faux's] PhD, and I'd have to agree with what she's said,' he said.Webber said that he saw egregious misconduct from within his profession, including the ordering of pathology tests which were inappropriate for the clinical condition and had a huge impact on the health budget.
