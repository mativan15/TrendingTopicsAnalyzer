Although the Gotham Knights release time hasn't been officially confirmed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, by comparing various sources it appears to be set to midnight local time on October 21. Pre-loading is already available across PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, so if you've pre-ordered Gotham Knights then you can get it downloaded now ready for launch, with file sizes ranging from 41-45GB across those formats. If you want to know more about the Gotham Knights release time and date, including details of how you can potentially start playing early (on Xbox at least), then we've got you covered.
