Bitcoin is hovering over its 52-week lows as the cryptocurrency markets continue their bearish posture. But some longtime market participants, like Dan Held, director of growth marketing at crypto exchange Kraken, aren't worried.

Held got into Bitcoin in 2012, which is about 100 years ago in crypto time (because time moves so quickly but also feels so, so long in crypto).

'Back in the early era, it was just Bitcoin — there weren't even [alternative] coins, or there were very, very few,' Held said during a fireside chat with Decrypt editor-in-chief Daniel Roberts at CoinMarketCap's The Capital conference.
