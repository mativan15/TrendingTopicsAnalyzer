As the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine works to make Winston-Salem the global hub of the field, it has made another important step in that direction with a new degree offering at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine.

The Translational Biotechnology Master of Science program will prepare the next and future generations of STEM professionals and business leaders in the regenerative medicine field who can move novel therapies from laboratories to clinics.

Working closely with WFIRM, the Translational Biotechnology MS program features a research pathway and a business pathway.
