After losing his wallet containing $500 for over a week, a British man in Singapore was relieved when he received a letter that a good Samaritan had found and returned the wallet to police.

The man, Chris Henderson, believed he had lost his wallet for good until a letter from Singapore police informed him that his wallet had been found 10 days later. He was shocked, however, after discovering that most of his cash had been left untouched.

Henderson posted about the experience to TikTok on Thursday, where he begins the video by explaining the letter he had received and expresses that he is 'really hopeful' that his wallet has been safely returned with the cash intact.
