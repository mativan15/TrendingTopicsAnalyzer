From established lenders to virtual banks, financial institutions in Hong Kong are trying to entice young investors away from meme stocks and crypto and toward more disciplined wealth management.

For WeLab founder Simon Loong, whose group runs a virtual bank in Hong Kong, the demographic presents a potentially lucrative opportunity. He estimates about 1.8 million people with HK$800 billion ($102 billion) of liquid assets are in need of wealth services in Hong Kong, the majority of whom are under 40.
