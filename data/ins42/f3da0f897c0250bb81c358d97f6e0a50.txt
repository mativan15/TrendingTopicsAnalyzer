In the desert on the edges of the industrial Saudi Arabian town of Ras Al-Khair, a sprawling section of sand will eventually be filled with dozens of greenhouses. The greenhouses—covering 7 square kilometers, or an area larger than London's Gatwick Airport—aren't for growing food. Instead, they'll help decarbonize the energy-intensive process of making aluminum.Right now, the industry runs on fossil fuels. 'Coal is being burned to make aluminum which is going to wind up in your cell phone and your computer and your car,' says Rod MacGregor, CEO and founder of GlassPoint, the company that plans to build the new system, which will use solar thermal technology in greenhouses to make sunlight-powered steam.
