French cement company Lafarge pleaded guilty in the United States to paying millions of dollars to the so-called Islamic State jihadist group in exchange for permission to keep open a plant in Syria.

The company also agreed on Tuesday to penalties totalling roughly $778 million (€790m), in a case the US Justice Department described as the first of its kind.

Prosecutors accused Lafarge of turning a blind eye to the conduct of the jihadist militants, making payments to it in 2013 and 2014 as it occupied a broad swath of Syria -- and while some of its members were involved in torturing or beheading kidnapped Westerners.
