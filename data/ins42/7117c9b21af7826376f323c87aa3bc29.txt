The ‘mole' who has been leaking the Strictly Come Dancing elimination believes he's done nothing wrong, despite spoiling the result ahead of broadcast.
On Monday, it was reported BBC executives were looking into shifting the typically pre-recorded results show from Saturday night to Sunday in a bid to stop viewers finding out who's been voted off.
As it stands, the results show which airs every Sunday night is actually filmed right after the live show the night before.
Naturally, the studio audience – made up of family and friends of the celebrities and other members of the public – are sworn to secrecy, and have their phones taken off them during filming.
