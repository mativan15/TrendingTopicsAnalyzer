'I continue to maintain a bullish stance on M&M and expect that this stock would continue to march and be the leader from the entire auto pack,' says Kunal Bothra, kunalbothra.co.in 
What are the picks that you would suggest to our viewers this Diwali?I would suggest a couple of buy calls and my focus is two important sectors over the last couple of days; one is of course financials and the other is auto. From the financials, I would pick a PSU banking name, something which has been off radar for many investors but the rally into these stocks has been quite strong.
