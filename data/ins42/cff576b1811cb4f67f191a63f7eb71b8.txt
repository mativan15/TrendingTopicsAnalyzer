HOUSTON — The Rockets finished their preseason with a 3-1 record, and as they prepare to open their season against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday at State Farm Arena, head coach Stephen Silas has been very impressed with what his team has done on the offensive end of the court. That especially applies to his backcourt duo of point guard Kevin Porter Jr. and shooting guard Jalen Green.
After an offseason that consisted of vigorous workouts with personal trainers and teammates at the Rockets practice facility, Porter and Green displayed some of the maturity and growth that both players have discussed at length during training camp and the preseason.
