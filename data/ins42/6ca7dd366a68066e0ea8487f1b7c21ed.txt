Published: 12:42 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 12:47 EDT, 31 May 2022 Goldman Sachs' recent decision to allow its senior staffers unlimited time off is being panned by critics who say the big bank has a hidden agenda with the policy. The guideline shift, announced May 16, came on the heels of several complaints over the bank's long-hours and work-intensive culture.The new guidance no longer requires Goldman brass to compensate senior bankers for unused vacation time below the 15-day threshold - due to the fact that those workers are technically no longer accruing vacation days.
