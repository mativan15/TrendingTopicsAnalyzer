SAN JOSE — Preservationists have appealed their loss in a court case that had aimed to rescue a 'brutalist' building in downtown San Jose from the wrecking ball — even though the structure has already been bulldozed.
The structure at the center of a legal case that's been filed with the state Court of Appeal is a downtown San Jose building that was located at 199 Park Ave. until it was demolished last November.
The Preservation Action Council filed the appeal in November 2021, about two months after the group lost a Santa Clara County Superior Court lawsuit connected to the building.
