Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to kickoff its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday and expectations are that it will be a jam-packed affair, with a number of software updates and perhaps one or two surprises, including new services and hardware. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who has an outperform rating and $200-a-share price target on Apple's (AAPL) stock, noted that iOS 16 updates, some of which include changes to the lock screen, messaging and health features, are likely to capture significant interest, as are changes to the Apple Watch.
