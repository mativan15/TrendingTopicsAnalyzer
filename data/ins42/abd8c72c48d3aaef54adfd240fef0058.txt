Businessman John Bolton is shocked at how far the value of the conservative KiwiSaver fund he is invested in has fallen compared to the performance of growth funds. 'My conservative fund has gone backward faster than I can contribute to it. It ate all of last year's contributions, and I paid for the privilege,' he said. Bolton's shock is mirrored by many other investors in conservative funds, which were sold as lower-risk funds heavily invested in 'investment grade' fixed interest bonds issued by the likes of governments, local authorities and larger companies.
