Denver Broncos rookie Damarri Mathis couldn't stop being flagged against the Los Angeles Chargers, and it cost his side as they lost 19-16 as SoFi Stadium. In a close game that went the distance, first downs were a struggle as both Russell Wilson and Justin Herbert were far from their best. But Mathis gifted the Chargers a first down and significant yardage of four seperate occasions, beginning with the very first play of the game. In what turned out to be one of the most penalised games in Broncos history, Mathis was adjudged to have committed pass interference of four occasions, as the rookie desperately looked to make his mark.
