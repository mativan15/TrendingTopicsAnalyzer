The Buccaneers placed safety Logan Ryan on injured reserve Tuesday, the team announced.

Ryan, who has missed the past two games, will undergo foot surgery Wednesday to repair a Jones fracture. He will not return until late this season.

He appeared in four games for Tampa Bay, making two starts, and totaled nine tackles, two passes defensed, one interception, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.
