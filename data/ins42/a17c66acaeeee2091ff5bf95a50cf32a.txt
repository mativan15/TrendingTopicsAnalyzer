The U.S. attorney's office alleged the threats and harassment continued for years and were part of what the FBI has dubbed 'Operation Fox Hunt" and characterized as an illegal global effort by China to locate and repatriate alleged fugitives who flee to foreign countries.

In a statement Thursday, U.S. Attorney Breon Peace called it an 'outrageous violation of national sovereignty."

According to an indictment, the defendants forced a relative of the unidentified man to travel from China to the U.
