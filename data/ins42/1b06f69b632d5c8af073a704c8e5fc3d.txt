Andrii Yalanskyi/iStock via Getty Images Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC) recently announced a significant increase in production, and most analysts are expecting significant free cash flow. Ramaco's reserves also offer a cost of production that is significantly below most U.S. metallurgical coal producers. Under several financial models that include the acquisition of new reserves and more relationships with independent producers, METC turns out to be very undervalued. Even considering risks from tariffs imposed by foreign nations or new competitive technologies, the current market price seems too low.
