Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first appearance in Britain together since giving up their official royal duties, and were not met with the warmest reception. Having flown in with their children to take part in Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebration, Harry and Meghan were separated from other members of the royal family at today's Service of Thanksgiving, and were booed while exiting the festivities, held at St. Paul's Cathedral; a slight which Fox News devoted several articles to rehashing.
