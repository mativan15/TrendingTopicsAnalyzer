Tryaging/iStock via Getty Images Investors in Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) have taken a pummeling in 2022. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is down a bit over 23% while shares of Prologis have fallen by over 38%. Management provided an upbeat earnings call, and the company beat on the top and bottom line, yet the stock fell over 3% in the day after Q3 results were released. Undoubtedly, investors question whether warehouse demand will suffer in this economic environment. Those fears were buttressed when Amazon (AMZN) and FedEx (FDX) announced their intent to shutter some existing facilities and to abandon plans to open new warehouses.
