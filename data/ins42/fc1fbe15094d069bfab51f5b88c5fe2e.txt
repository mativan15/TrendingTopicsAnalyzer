AUSTIN, Texas - Attorney General Ken Paxton has been under criminal indictment for more than seven years and under investigation by the FBI for two years — legal trouble that has complicated his quest for a third term as the state's top legal officer.

Paxton also has been sued by the State Bar of Texas, which is seeking court-ordered sanctions over allegations that he misled the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020 by saying Texas had proof of significant election fraud when he sought to overturn President Joe Biden's election victory.
