Silverwater, New South Wales, Oct. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whether at work or out shopping, returning to a sweltering hot car is an unpleasant experience. While there is a wide range of UV protection products on the market, local company Snap Shades came up with an innovative solution. Their new custom front windscreen sunshades help to reduce the heat in parked cars, whilst their rear window snap shades offer protection from harmful UV rays. Having a love for the outdoors and being so close to the equator means exposure to high UV levels.
