The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday arrested Delhi Power Minister Satyendar Jain in a money-laundering case. The case is based on a CBI first information report lodged against the AAP leader in 2017 under the Prevention of Corruption Act where he was accused of having laundered money through four companies allegedly linked to him.
Last month, the ED provisionally attached immovable properties worth Rs 4.81 crore belonging to these companies and a fifth one—viz Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd, Indo Metal Impex Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions Pvt Ltd, Manglayatan Projects Pvt Ltd, and JJ Ideal Estate Pvt Ltd.
