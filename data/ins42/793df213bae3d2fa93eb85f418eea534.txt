It wasn't until she was in her teens and came across her mother opening an eBay package containing an original 1970s Laura Ashley dress that Lily Ashley registered that her grandmother had been a big deal. 'It was this old Victorian-style long dress and it had the original big square label inside. I loved it,' she recalls. 'I don't think Edie and I really knew the depth of our heritage until then.' These days Lily, 30, a performance artist and writer and Edie, 25, a fashion designer and artist, are fully fledged Laura Ashley fans.
