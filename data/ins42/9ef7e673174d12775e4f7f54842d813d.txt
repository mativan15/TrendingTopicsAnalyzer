Complex problems usually require complex solutions and apparently simple antidotes seldom have the desired effect. This thought should be on the minds of Conservative MPs as we consider how to get out of the deepest political hole that we have experienced in a generation. 
Some believe 'a spell in opposition would do us good'. 
As someone who served the party for our entire, excruciating 13 long years on the opposition front bench, I can think of a no more stupid argument. MPs don't run to be second in their own constituencies, so why would they want to do so across the country? 
Then there is changing leader.
