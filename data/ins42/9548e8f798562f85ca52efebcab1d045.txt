The first lady, who grew up just outside of Philadelphia and has referred to herself a 'Philly girl,' attended the game as the Eagles' honorary captain to promote the Biden Administration's Cancer Moonshot initiative.  But as Dr. Biden, 71, took to the Lincoln Financial Field with cancer survivors and their families for the coin toss, she was met with boos and chants of 'let's go Brandon' — a phrase that has been used to mock the president.
