The iDprt SP310 ($109.99 MSRP) looks like, and mostly is, the kind of compact label printer you'd want sitting on your desk for tasks like addressing envelopes, labeling file folders, or printing price labels or barcodes. Unlike the Brother QL-800, which is our current top pick for entry-level printers for paper labels, it's limited to printing in black only, and its software can be perplexing. But it also costs less in places, selling for example on Amazon at this writing for $89.99 after clipping a $20 coupon.
