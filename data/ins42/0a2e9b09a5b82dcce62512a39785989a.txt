An Independent candidate, with the support of a former long-time Progressive Conservative MPP, has won the riding of Haldimand-Norfolk. Bobbi Ann Brady is now the province's only Independent MPP-elect. The riding was previously held by PC Toby Barrett who announced he would not be seeking an eighth term in April. Instead of backing new PC candidate and Haldimand mayor, Ken Hewitt, Barrett threw his support to Brady, who was his former executive assistant while he was MPP. 'I've given 23 years of my life to the party and I've worked for MPP Toby Barrett for 23 years and we weren't afforded a nomination night,' Brady told CTV News following her victory.
