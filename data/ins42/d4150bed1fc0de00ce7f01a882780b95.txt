The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed that only ICMR-accredited labs can collect COVID-19 samples. In an order issued on May 31, the DDMA also said all labs should ensure that their own sample collectors or the entity collecting samples on their behalf must follow all bio-safety and bio-security precautions while collecting the samples, including the Bio-Medical Waste Management protocols. "The personnel being employed by labs should be adequately qualified as per the qualifications fixed by ICMR/NABL or any authorised agency of Governor of India," read the order.
