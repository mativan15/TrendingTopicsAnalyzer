Croupiers at the Montreal Casino have been on strike for a week, and their union says the employer "has lost in profit the equivalent of what the croupiers are demanding at the bargaining table." Represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the 521 unionized dealers at the Montreal Casino have been without a collective agreement since April 1, 2020. Believing they were at an impasse in negotiations for the renewal of their collective agreement, the dealers went on strike last Saturday.
