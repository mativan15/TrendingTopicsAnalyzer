European shares rose on Thursday after Liz Truss said she was resigning as the United Kingdom's prime minister, brought down by her economic programme that wrecked havoc on markets. The region-wide STOXX 600 closed 0.3% up after flirting between gains and losses right after the announcement in London. Appointed on September 6, Truss was forced last week to sack her finance minister and closest political ally, Kwasi Kwarteng, and abandon almost all of her economic programme after their plans for vast unfunded tax cuts crashed the pound and British bonds, forcing the Bank of England to intervene.
