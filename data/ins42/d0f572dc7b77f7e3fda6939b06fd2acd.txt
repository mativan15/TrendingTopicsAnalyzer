Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom co-stars Harrison Ford and Ke Huy Quan sent movie fans into a frenzy when they reunited last month for the first time in almost 40 years.
The pair starred alongside each other as unlikely duo Indiana Jones and Short Round in the blockbuster adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.
After more than three decades apart, the actors snapped a viral photo together at Disney's D23 convention.
And now, Quan has revealed how the emotional reunion took place and it's even more touching than we thought.
