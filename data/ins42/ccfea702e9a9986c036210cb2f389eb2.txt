NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, shaking off some of the weakness of the previous session, but a revival in risk appetite in global financial markets kept a lid on its gains.

"Yesterday's risk-on vibe looks to be continuing into today's session," said Michael Brown, head of market intelligence at payments firm Caxton in London.
