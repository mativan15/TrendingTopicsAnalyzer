As European businesses brace for energy shortages, workers at one plant in south-eastern France are getting a new winter wardrobe.Saint-Gobain, the French building materials group, has ordered extra warm coats and gloves for staff at its warehouse in the Alpine town of Chambéry, who have agreed to turn down the heat this winter. In order to cut gas consumption, temperatures will be closer to 8C, instead of the usual 15C. 'It will be just like working outside so we have to give them all the tools to work in an outside environment,' says Benoit d'Iribarne, senior vice-president of manufacturing.
