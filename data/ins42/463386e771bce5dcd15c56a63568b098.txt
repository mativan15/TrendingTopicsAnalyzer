Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) announced FQ1 2023 (ending Sept. 25, 2022) financials on October 19, 2022. CEO Tim Archer and CFO Doug Bettinger made several comments about Memory and China sanctions:

1. "We see memory bit shipments tracking below end demand for the next few quarters. In our normal cadence, we would provide our first view of 2023 WFE on our January earnings call." 2. "Deferred revenue was $2.8 billion and grew in the September quarter by approximately $550 million. With macro conditions weakening and wafer fab equipment spending declining, I expect deferred revenue and backlog levels will come down as we exit the December quarter.
