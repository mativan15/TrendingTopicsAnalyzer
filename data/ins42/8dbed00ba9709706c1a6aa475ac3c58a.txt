With few of us having money to spare at the moment, we can worry about what we'd do if the electronics which power our everyday lives broke. Microwaves, TVs, kettles, hoovers…it's long list of the electricals we depend on for food, drinks, cleaning, communication and entertainment.

In fact, European homes have an average of 74 electricals, according to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Forum (WEEE). Even just one item malfunctioning could be very costly.

But what if instead of replacing these items when they break, we could repair them for free? That's where repair cafes come in.
