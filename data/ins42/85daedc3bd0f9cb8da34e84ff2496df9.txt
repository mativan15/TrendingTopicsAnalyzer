The remains of the first known Neanderthal family have been discovered in a Siberian cave.
 
On Wednesday, scientists revealed that they found the fossilized bone fragments of a closely related Neanderthal clan, including a father and his teenage daughter, in a study published in Nature.
 
According to the scientific journal, the findings were part of one of the largest genetic studies of a Neanderthal population to date, and were carried out by a global team of scientists.
 
The group determined that the Neanderthals were living together on rocky clifftops more than 50,000 years ago, and likely died from starvation or during a violent storm.
