Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR) shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 26% after a shaky period beforehand. Unfortunately, the gains of the last month did little to right the losses of the last year with the stock still down 32% over that time.

Even after such a large jump in price, Immersion may still be sending bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 12.5x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 16x and even P/E's higher than 32x are not unusual.
