THE Borough of Stepney lies just beyond the boundaries of the old City of London. It is one of the largest boroughs, one of the poorest, and certainly one of the worst-bombed. To the north lies Shoreditch, where Shakespeare first appeared on any stage; on the south is the River Thames, with two miles of river frontage and four of the largest docks in the world. In Stepney is the Tower of London, the Mint where all the money comes from, and the London Hospital — perhaps the most important of London's hospitals.
