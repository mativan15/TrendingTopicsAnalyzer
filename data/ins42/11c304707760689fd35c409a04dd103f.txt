MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian government bond yields ended higher for the fourth straight session on Friday, with the benchmark yield posting its sixth consecutive weekly rise, tracking a fierce surge in U.S. yields and as the rupee hit record lows during the week.

The benchmark Indian 10-year government bond yield ended at 7.5121%, after closing at 7.4767% on Thursday. The yield has risen four basis points this week, after increasing an aggregate 30 bps in the last five weeks.
