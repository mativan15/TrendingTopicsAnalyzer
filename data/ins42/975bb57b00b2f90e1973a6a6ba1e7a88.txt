Two prominent NFL quarterbacks are preparing to return to their teams' lineups this week. Dak Prescott is set to play Sunday for the Dallas Cowboys at home against the Detroit Lions after missing five games because of a fractured right thumb. The Miami Dolphins are making plans for Tua Tagovailoa to play Sunday night at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers after he missed two games while in the NFL's concussion protocols.

Prescott returned to the practice field last week but was on the inactive list for the Cowboys' 26-17 loss Sunday night in Philadelphia.
