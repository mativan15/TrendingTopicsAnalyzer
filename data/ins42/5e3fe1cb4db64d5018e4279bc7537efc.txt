The Saints didn't hold a practice on Monday, but they play the Cardinals on Thursday so they had to turn in an estimated practice report and it showed both of their quarterbacks would have been limited participants.

Jameis Winston has missed the last three games with a back injury, so his presence on the report was no surprise. Andy Dalton also being listed with a back injury is more of a surprise and the next couple of days will show whether it's a major concern for the Saints.
