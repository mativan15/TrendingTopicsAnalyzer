Tucker Carlson on Monday suggested that Democrats who support abortion rights are preaching that 'childlessness is the cure for the economy.'

As a jumping-off point, the Fox News host referred to a report on anti-abortion nonprofits prioritizing marketing and outreach over family-care funds, leaving caregivers short of diapers and other necessities.

'So, really what you have here is a classic demand-side approach to the ongoing diaper and formula shortages: just don't have kids, dumbo, and then you won't need diapers,' Carlson opined.
