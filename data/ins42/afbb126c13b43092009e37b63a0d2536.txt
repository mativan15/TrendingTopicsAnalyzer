The Cleveland Browns have five more games with quarterback Jacoby Brissett under center before Deshaun Watson returns from his suspension. He has returned to the team, but cannot practice until the game between the Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers concludes. Despite a new case against him from 2020, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has stated that Watson has met all of the terms of his suspension thus far per Mike Garafolo of NFL Network.
The Browns were able to get the most out of Brissett early in the season, but as defensive coordinators get more tape on him, his success has started to dwindle.
