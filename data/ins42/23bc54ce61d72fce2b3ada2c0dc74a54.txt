By Stephen Nakrosis Liberty Energy Inc. said Tuesday its board authorized the reinstatement of a quarterly cash dividend. The company said the dividend of 5 cents per share of Class A common stock will be payable Dec. 20 to shareholders of record Dec. 6. Liberty also said a distribution of 5 cents per unit has been approved for holders of units in Liberty Oilfield Services New HoldCo LLC, which will use the same record and payment date. The energy services company suspended its quarterly cash dividend in April of 2020 as a result of uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.
