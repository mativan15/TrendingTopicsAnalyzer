The Berea Fire Department (BFD) held their annual fall fundraiser this weekend, but this year consisted of a "twist."

Local firefighters decided to make 2022's fundraiser a philanthropic tie dye event.

Participants paid $20 for a BFD t-shirt and had the opportunity to tie dye the shirt with one of Berea's firefighters.

Attendees also got to take pictures with one of the department's firetrucks.

The fundraiser was held at the Berea Skate Park on Oct. 13 from 1 to 4 p.m.
