After eliminating the Boston Celtics in six games to secure the 2022 NBA title, the Golden State Warriors return to the court as defending champs to open the 2022-23 season on Tuesday night at San Francisco's Chase Center against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
While the contest is expected to feature familiar names Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Jordan Poole, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Warriors will be without a key piece off the bench in the season opener. 
Andre Iguodala has been ruled out on Tuesday night due to left hip injury management.
