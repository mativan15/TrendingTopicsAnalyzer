The Philadelphia Eagles, who remain the NFL's lone undefeated team, are on a bye this week. The Buffalo Bills, Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants are the only three teams with just one loss. Ten teams have a winning record, and 10 teams are 3-3 entering Week 7, including the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams, last year's Super Bowl participants.

This week kicks off in Arizona as the Cardinals host the New Orleans Saints on Thursday night. The week concludes in New England when the Patriots battle the Chicago Bears on Monday night.
