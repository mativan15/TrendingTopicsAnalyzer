In recent times, South Indian films have found appeal among a wider audience. Shruti Haasan, who has been a part of the Hindi and South film industries, explaining this phenomenon says, 'The current trend shows that we have always had an audience because of dubbed movies. We had an audience interested in South Indian films, but that was never marketed this way before, and that has changed because of OTT and movies like 'Baahubali' that opened doors in a big way.'Shruti emphasizes that she does not favour one industry over another, and this is a win-win situation not just for actors, but also for the film industry as awhole.
