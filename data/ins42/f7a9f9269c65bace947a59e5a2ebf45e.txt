 Brian Schwemler from Keremeos, B.C., is taking the $500,000 he won from the Sept. 27 Lotto Max draw and heading for an adventure.
Schwemler, who shared a Maxmillions prize with another winner in Langley, said the experience is something that's 'too hard to describe,' according to the BC Lotto Corporation.
