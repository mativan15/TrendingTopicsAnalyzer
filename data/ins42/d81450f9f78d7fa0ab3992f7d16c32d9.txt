The Labour Chair of the Committees on Standards and Privileges denounced the scenes that unfolded ahead of a fracking vote in the Commons on Wednesday. Mr Bryant said the astonishing incident had left a Tory colleague "crying on my shoulder". Speaking to the Today programme, the Labour MP said: "I have never seen scenes like that, and lots of other MPs have said the same, including you know Charles Walker was saying pretty much the same last night."Honestly, this was the most extraordinary scene that I've seen in my time, and anyway, even if it has happened in the past, that is not how we should do our business - we are not the Italian parliament - and all of this is happening because there is complete chaos in Government.
