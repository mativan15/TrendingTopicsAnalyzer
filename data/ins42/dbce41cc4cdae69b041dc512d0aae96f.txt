An Indigenous-led safe space for sexually exploited women and girls is expecting to expand its reach in Winnipeg with funds from the federal government.
Ottawa says nearly $7 million is to help with operating costs at Velma's House.Patty Hajdu, the federal minister of Indigenous Services, says the money should allow the organization to increase capacity and deliver culturally appropriate programs.Part of the money is also to go toward purchasing a new building, so the group can offer ceremonies, counselling and meals to more people.
