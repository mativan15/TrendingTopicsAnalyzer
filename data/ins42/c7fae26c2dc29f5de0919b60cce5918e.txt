Brett_Hondow/iStock Editorial via Getty Images PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) -0.8% post-market Wednesday after posting roughly in-line Q3 adjusted earnings and revenues, while guiding Q4 earnings below expectations, as it expects softer demand in Europe and China will persist. PPG (PPG) said it achieved record sales in Q3 of $4.47B, driven by continued selling price realization, resulting in a 12%-plus increase in selling prices compared with the year-ago quarter and an 18% increase on a two-year stacked basis, aided by record sales in the PPG Comex and global automotive refinish businesses.
