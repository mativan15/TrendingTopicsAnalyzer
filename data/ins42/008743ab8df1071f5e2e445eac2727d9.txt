If you're someone who loves to drink cocktails, but doesn't know the first thing about making them at home, this one's for you. The Bartesian Duet(opens in a new tab) is a sleek machine designed to make bartending at home easier than ever. It's like having a Keurig that pours cosmopolitans instead of coffee. A 'Party Keurig', if you will. You can choose from more than 50 different capsules, including a spectrum of cocktails from an old fashioned to an amaretto sour. It retails for $279.99 and is on the market in November, but we got our hands on one early.
