Vivian Ketchum is counting down the days until June 30. The 58-year-old is set to receive her high school diploma at a graduation ceremony at the University of Winnipeg next month. It is a moment that is decades in the making. 'I'm looking forward to crossing that stage,' she said. Ketchum enrolled at the Winnipeg Adult Education Centre last fall. An assessment placed her in Grade 11 and less than a year later, she is set to graduate. While joyful, her graduation will also be bittersweet. Ketchum was inspired to return to school by her son Tyler.
