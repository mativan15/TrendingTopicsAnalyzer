The Golden State Warriors know what it takes to win a NBA title and they knew going into Sunday's Game 2 that they couldn't afford to lose a second straight game at home to the Celtics before the series shifts to Boston.
So they went out and took care of business in impressive fashion as they ran away from the Celtics in the second half and rolled to a 107-88 victory that was over before the fourth quarter.
Jordan Poole put an exclamation point on the night with a 39-footer at the end of the third quarter that just beat the buzzer and sent the Chase Center into hysterics.
