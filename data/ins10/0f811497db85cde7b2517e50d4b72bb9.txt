STORY: Elon Musk's stake in Twitter has caught the eye of the SEC.

The agency revealed it is looking into the Tesla CEO's disclosure last month that he had taken a 9.2.% stake in Twitter, making him the company's largest shareholder.

In a letter sent by the SEC to Musk in April – which the regulator made public on Friday – it asks the billionaire why it appears he did not file his paperwork within the required 10-day window.

The SEC is also looking into whether Musk accurately disclosed his intentions with the social media platform.
