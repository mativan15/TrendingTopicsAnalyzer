Charlotte will add a new publicly traded company on Nov. 1. That's when XPO Logistics Inc. spins off its proprietary tech-enabled truckload brokerage as a separate company named RXO Inc.

Last week, RXO priced a debt offering at $355 million in notes due in 2027 that will be used in the spinoff. RXO will use that money, $100 million in term loans and cash on hand to pay $554 million to XPO to repay existing indebtedness incurred while it was part of the original company.

RXO will be the fourth-largest broker of full-truckload freight in the United States and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'RXO.
