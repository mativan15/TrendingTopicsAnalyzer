The biggest lie of the midterm election, embraced by almost 300 Republican candidates, is that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

The runner-up is the lie, running on countless television commercials and campaign charges, that Democrats plan to send 87,000 armed IRS agents to harass middle-class Americans and mom and pop small businesses.

That's 180 degrees wrong. As part of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, $80 billion was authorized for the IRS over ten years. This is a resource-starved agency: there are 20 percent fewer personnel at the IRS than a decade ago, a sharp cutback in the ability to answer taxpayer questions, a general counsel's office that's smaller than any time in the last quarter century.
