RISHI Sunak was bragging yesterday that his energy support package was 'more generous' than anything Labour had proposed.The City would be fine with that as long as it was just politics, as long as in the private meetings where the real talk happens, there was at least a nod and a wink to show that his ambition remains to be less generous, not more.Instead, whatever his personal instincts, it seems clear to folk in the Square Mile that Sunak is going to remain the cheque-book Chancellor.The kind view is that, politically and economically, he has very little choice.
