A decentralized finance (DeFi) product that launched earlier this year to help investors profit from a sideways trending market is generating desired results.

The "Crab" strategy, designed by leading DeFi options platform Opyn, is built to make money during bouts of low ether (ETH) price volatility. It has earned 14% returns in U.S. dollar terms and 42% in ether terms since its v2 went live in late July. Ether has dropped 20% since the end of July, however, the cryptocurrency has primarily traded between $1,100 to $1,300 in the past four weeks.
