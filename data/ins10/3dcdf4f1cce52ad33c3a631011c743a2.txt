Three enlisted airmen recently received Bronze Star medals for valor, the fourth-highest U.S. military decoration, for defending their fellow Americans when their installation came under fire from militants in Kenya in 2020.

Tech. Sgt. Jordan Locke accepted the Bronze Star with 'V' device during a ceremony at Osan Air Base, South Korea, on Oct. 12. Master Sgt. Mathue Snow did the same at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, on Sept. 9, and Senior Master Sgt. Jeremy Mapalo received his on Aug. 29 at RAF Lakenheath, England.
