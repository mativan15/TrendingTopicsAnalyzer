Chinese smartphone makers in India are operating in an increasingly difficult business environment, punctuated by the legal woes market leader Xiaomi has encountered for much of this year. In April, the Enforcement Directorate, India's federal financial crime agency, seized $676 million (€690 million) in Xiaomi's India bank accounts, saying the company made illegal remittances abroad "in the guise of royalty" payments. Earlier this month, an Indian court refused to lift the freeze, even as the Chinese company said the seizure of assets had "effectively halted" its operations in the country.
