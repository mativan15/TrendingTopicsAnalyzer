The Jets believe. 
A stroll around their locker room and some conversations with their players and that belief is apparent. There's a sense they fear nothing, that they feel as if they're going to take this season deeper than a Jets season has been taken in recent years. 
The Jets are 3-2, above .500 for the first time since 2017. 
Of course that and about $50 will get you a parking spot in someone's backyard adjacent to Lambeau Field in Green Bay for the Jets-Packers game this Sunday. 
There's a long way to go.
