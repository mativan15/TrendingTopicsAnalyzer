I was just seventeen when I was embroiled in the greatest tragedy known to me. It started a year earlier when my parents, my brother and I went to a popular restaurant in Bangalore. During our meal, we met a man. It turned out that he owned the restaurant. He treated us with much kindness. Along with the kebabs and ghee rice we had ordered, he even gave us free bowls of gravy and dal. Of course, we had a great day. As time passed, he grew closer and closer to the family. It soon became customary for us to visit the restaurant once a week.
