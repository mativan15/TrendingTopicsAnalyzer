A man protesting President Xi Jinping's Hong Kong policies outside the Chinese consulate in Manchester, England, was dragged from the street into the building's grounds and beaten by consulate employees before a British police officer breached the grounds and helped usher him back to safety.
The man had gathered along with other demonstrators holding signs and posters, one of which depicted Xi standing in front of a mirror naked except for boxers and a crown.
