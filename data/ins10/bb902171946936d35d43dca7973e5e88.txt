MINNEAPOLIS — We are under no obligation to call sporting events or venues what their corporate overlords name them.The Minnesota Gophers football stadium is "The Bank.''The Metrodome was always "The Dome.''Williams Arena is, was and shall ever be "The Barn.''So when we refer to "The LIV Golf Invitational Series,'' we should just call it "Death Golf.''LIV Golf is a Saudi Arabian production, backed by the country's government, designed to bribe the world's best golfers, making it a threat to the PGA Tour.
