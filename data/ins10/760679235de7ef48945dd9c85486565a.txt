The 2022 NBA Draft is approaching, on June 23 in Brooklyn, and we will soon have a finalized list of the candidates hoping to hear their names called.
Although the early entry withdrawal deadline is June 13, the NCAA's deadline to retain collegiate eligibility is June 1. That means prospects who are testing the NBA draft waters and wish to play college basketball next season have until tomorrow to make their decision.
Many interesting prospects (Oscar Tshiebwe, Jaime Jaquez, Caleb Love, Tyrese Hunter, Alex Fudge) did not appear on the early-entry list when it was released in April.
