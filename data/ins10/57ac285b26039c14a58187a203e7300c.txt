Indiewire Television Disney+ is stuffed to the gills with content this November, both in terms of original programming and new movies. The season finale of 'Andor' drops toward the end of the month, and with filming already set to start this year it shouldn't be too long before fans are reunited with Diego Luna's Cassian Andor again. On top of that, the long-gestating sequel to the 2007 fairy tale feature 'Enchanted' hits the service this month. Amy Adams returns as Princess Giselle, now a mother and wife, who discovers that raising a family could set her up as a new evil stepmother.
