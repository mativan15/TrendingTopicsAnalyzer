MURFREESBORO — When Battle Ground Academy won its first volleyball state title last season, the Lady Wildcats knew that expectations would be raised for them entering this season with the core of that team returning.

Consider those expectations met.

In the class of Division II-A from the opening set of the season led by seven seniors, the Lady Wildcats repeated as state champions Thursday afternoon, beating Goodpasture 3-0 in front of a packed house at Middle Tennessee Christian School.

"At times it's surreal and then at times not a surprise at all watching them and knowing what they can do whenever they get out onto the court," BGA coach Tatiana Alvarez said.
