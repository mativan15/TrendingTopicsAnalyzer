What, then, is the problem?
Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Caltrider explains: 'What scared us the most was that while all these apps collect data, mental health apps tend to collect a lot more very personal, sensitive data than [others]. Privacy laws do protect some of the data these apps collect but there's a very grey, murky area that we found where these privacy laws end and the data economy begins.'
This means that, in some cases, data may be shared – for instance with Facebook and Google; data brokers who can sell it on for the purpose of targeted advertising; or even with employers.
