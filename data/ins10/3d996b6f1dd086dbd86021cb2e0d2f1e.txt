WITH assertive BJP Hindu nationalism on one side and the DMK's linguistic/regional politics on the other, the controversy over the ‘Dravidian' identity of Tamil Nadu continues. A few days ago, Governor R N Ravi, who has done his bit to keep the fires burning, added a new dimension to it, raising the question ‘Who is a Dravidian?'.
Does it only mean the people of Tamil Nadu , or does it also include Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala?
Speaking at the inaugural of a two-day programme on ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat — Connecting India' series on October 10, the Tamil Nadu Governor said the Dravidian identity had been adopted as a purely Tamil identity because of 'politics of division'.
