The Green Bay Packers will start a three-game road trip with a matchup against a backup quarterback on Sunday in Washington.

Commanders starting quarterback Carson Wentz had successful surgery on his finger on Monday and could miss 4-6 weeks, per NFL Network, leaving backup Taylor Heinicke as the expected starter at quarterback come Sunday. Rookie fifth-round pick Sam Howell is also on the roster.

Wentz injured his finger during Washington's win over the Chicago Bears last week.

The Packers have lost back-to-back games to Daniel Jones of the New York Giants and Zach Wilson of the New York Jets.
