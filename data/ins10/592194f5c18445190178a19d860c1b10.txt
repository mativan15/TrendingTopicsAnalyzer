The Platinum Jubilee weekend is set to provide billions to boost the UK economy as the nation comes together to celebrate the 70-year reign of Queen Elizabeth II.

However, finance expert Jasmine Birtles suggested the Platinum Jubilee ceremonies will support economic growth by encouraging tourism and hospitality spending.
