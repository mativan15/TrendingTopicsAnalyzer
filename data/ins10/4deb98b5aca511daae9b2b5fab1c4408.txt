ROME (Reuters) - The public official responsible for safeguarding prisoners rights in the Italian city of Naples was arrested on Tuesday on charges of smuggling drugs and mobile phones to inmates, police said in a statement.

Pietro Ioia was arrested along with seven other people. Under Italian law, prison ombudsmen have access to jails and can hold interviews with prisoners to check their conditions.

The police said Ioia exploited his position to bring the devices and drugs into Naples' Poggioreale prison, where they were traded among the prisoners.
