Russian oil behemoth Rosneft on Monday promised record dividends on the back of soaring prices, but some foreign investors may struggle to access the payout.The board recommended 23.63 roubles a share for the second half of 2021, bringing full-year dividends to an all-time high of 41.66 roubles. That follows an announcement last week by Russian gas giant Gazprom, which proposed its highest ever payout after benefiting from a supply crunch in Europe.The decisions of both companies will see the Russian state gaining the most, as it's the biggest shareholder.
