 Jio, after disrupting the telecom industry multiple times with its cost-efficient prices, has now unveiled three new plans for the JioFi device. All of the three plans are postpaid in nature and provide one-month validity along with 50GB of high-speed data. Furthermore, Jio is also giving free JioFi dongles with these plans on a use and return basis. One thing to keep in mind is that these plans are not for regular customers, instead, they are specifically meant for businesses and enterprises.
