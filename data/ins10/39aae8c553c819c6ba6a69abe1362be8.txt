Twitch streamer Amouranth has had a massive success with her first major production, Streamer Royale, and is now planning to do more.
Amouranth's first major production since leaving OnlyFans has been widely accepted as a success, so much so that she's already teasing her next event. 
The Streamer Royale brought in consistent viewership of around 25,000 Twitch users throughout the five-hour Wipeout/Gladiator knock-off. Streamers from across the internet dived through bubbles or hit each other with sticks to determine who was the winner.
