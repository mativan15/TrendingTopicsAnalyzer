New Delhi The government on Saturday raised the tax on windfall profits on locally produced crude oil by 37.5% to ₹11,000 per tonne and hiked the levy on diesel exports by 140% to ₹12 per litre, while reimposing it on exports of jet fuel at ₹3.50 per litre, as global oil prices surged this fortnight after the producers' cartel – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies – decided a steep cut in output.
