The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 138% in five years. It's even up 3.7% in the last week. But this might be partly because the broader market had a good week last week, gaining 3.5%.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
