The race to earn a coveted spot in the Socceroos' World Cup squad is heating up, but Melbourne City striker Jamie Maclaren is only focusing on what he can control as he battles for a spot on the plane next month.

Maclaren has been one of Graham Arnold's most trusted strikers throughout Australia's qualification campaign, scoring seven goals in their run to Qatar.

The reigning A-League Men's Golden Boot winner has scored three goals from his opening two games, taking red-hot form into this Saturday's blockbuster derby against Melbourne Victory.
