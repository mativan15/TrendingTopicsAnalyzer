Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson and sister Lauryn "Pumpkin" Shannon aren't holding back feelings about their mom, Mama June Shannon.
 
In a TikTok uploaded to Pumpkin's account on Monday, the sisters appeared to shade Mama June's parenting — which resulted in Pumpkin, 22, gaining custody of her 17-year-old younger sister.
 
The dance video shows Alana labeled the "sister who needed a momma," before turning the camera to Pumpkin. "The sister that came in clutch and raised her," the screen reads as Pumpkin is seen dancing.
