WASHINGTON - Prosecutors on Friday urged a jury to convict well-connected attorney Michael Sussmann, saying that he thought he had "a license to lie" to the FBI at the height of the 2016 presidential campaign. Sussman's defense lawyers countered that the case against Sussmann was built on a "political conspiracy theory."In a case that rehashed bitter controversies from the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton presidential contest, Sussmann is accused of lying to a senior FBI official when he delivered allegations of a secret communications channel between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, which is based in Russia.
