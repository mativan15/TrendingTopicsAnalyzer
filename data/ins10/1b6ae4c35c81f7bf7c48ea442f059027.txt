Real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran didn't mince words when asked about Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's recent behavior.

"I'd like to zip him in a Ziploc bag and try to get his ego stuffed inside and calm him down," the "Shark Tank" investor told Yahoo Finance in an interview (video above). "He's a bit much lately. I liked him better who he was than who he is lately."

Musk offer to buy Twitter (TWTR) for nearly $44 billion, or $54.20 per share, on April 14. The social media platform agreed to a deal on April 25th.
