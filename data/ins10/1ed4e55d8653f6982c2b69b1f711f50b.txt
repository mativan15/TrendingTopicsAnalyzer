Collider.com In the penultimate episode of House of the Dragon, the Green council has taken its stand. King Viserys is dead and in the aftermath of it, the Iron Throne is usurped by the Hightowers, as Alicent (Olivia Cooke) believes her husband's final wish was to see his son Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the throne. In a new featurette, co-showrunner, Ryan Condal reveals that they saw this episode as a 'real Hitchcockian suspense film.' He further explains that Alicent's horrified because she realizes not only her husband is dead, and she has to process that, but secretly, her council has been plotting for this very day to come.
