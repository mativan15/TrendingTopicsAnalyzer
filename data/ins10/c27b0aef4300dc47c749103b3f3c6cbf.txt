A Reddit user posted a photo to the "Mildly Infuriating" forum and said his boss prevented the window from being opened in the workplace."My boss screwed the only window at our office shut, so now it's impossible to get fresh air," read the title of u/SloBearZ's post, which received nearly 12,000 votes since it was published on Monday. "I'm boiling at work [right now]."In addition to the discomfort caused by a lack of airflow, some people questioned whether it was safe to keep the window screwed shut.
