Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Saturday said there is a "huge BJP wave" in Gujarat and the saffron party will break all records in 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections. He also said the BJP government at the Centre led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will "come back to power in 2024" by winning more than 400 parliamentary seats. 
 Addressing BJP's 'Gaurav Yatra' in Malvan village in Gujarat's Valsad district, Thakur said it was under the leadership of Modi that Hindu symbols were honoured and Ram temple in Ayodhya became a reality.
