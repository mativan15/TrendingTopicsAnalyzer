Mario Tama Shares of AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN) have lost about 13% of their value over the past year; not a great result, but certainly far better than competitors like CarMax, Inc. (KMX), which have been halved. Following that company's poor earnings report, investors may be worried about what AN will say when the company reports third quarter earnings on October 27th. However, given its more diversified revenue streams, I expect AN to fare well, and shares look attractive here. Seeking Alpha CarMax gets 77% of revenue from used car sales, and so the decline in used car prices we have seen in recent months was a particularly strong headwind.
