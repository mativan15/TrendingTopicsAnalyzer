The growth and vibrancy in downtown Winston-Salem in the past decade is easy to see. Former industrial buildings have been transformed into offices and upscale apartments. New upscale apartments surround several employment and entertainment hubs, keeping the city active at the end of the work day.

But the city endured some losses that created challenges for the future.

In 2014, GMAC Insurance changed its name to National General Insurance and moved its headquarters to Cleveland. In 2015, R.J. Reynolds closed its last downtown cigarette manufacturing plant, completing a gradual cigarette shutdown in the center city.
