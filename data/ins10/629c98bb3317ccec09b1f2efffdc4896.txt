The company announced the suspension in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. In the meantime, Nanjing Iron & Steel Co., also controlled by Guo, halted trading in Shanghai on Monday as well.

Investors have been closely watching how Fosun plans to meet its liquidity needs, including whether it's making progress in its asset disposal and other refinancing options, after Moody's Investors Services wrote about the company's funding pressure in June.
