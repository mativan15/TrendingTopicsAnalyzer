Cincinnati Bengals tight end Hayden Hurst already had one revenge game marked on his calendar this year against the Baltimore Ravens.

Now Hurst confronts another — a game against the Atlanta Falcons.

Those Falcons acquired Hurst after his two seasons in Baltimore and he spent as many years in Atlanta while receiving similar, small usage. Now he says Cincinnati has finally given him the chance to spread his wings as a weapon.

'I know what I'm capable of doing,' Hurst said, according to ESPN's Ben Baby.
