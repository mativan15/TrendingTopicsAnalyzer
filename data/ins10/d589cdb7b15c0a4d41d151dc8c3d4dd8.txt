Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is set to kick off the pharma earnings season with its Q3 earnings for 2022 on Tuesday before the market opens, while Wall Street focuses on its outlook amid a challenging macro environment. Despite rising interest rates, a slowing economy, and a strong dollar, JNJ has lost only ~3% in the year, compared to the ~24% decline in the S&P 500, as indicated in this graph. The shares have resisted the impact of two guidance cuts announced with previous earnings releases, including one in April when the company suspended its sales guidance for its FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine citing a supply glut and demand uncertainty.
