Nimble, lost off the Florida Keys in 1827 while chasing the illegal Spanish slaver the Guerrero. © Associated Producers Ltd. The Guerrero had made it all the way from Nigeria to the Bahamas. A Spanish slave ship bound for Cuba, it was veering south toward Havana when an English antislavery schooner, the Nimble, spotted its sail on December 17, 1827.
