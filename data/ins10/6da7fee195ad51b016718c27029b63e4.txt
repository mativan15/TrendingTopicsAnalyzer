ETtechKarnataka high courtThe Karnataka High Court, in an interim arrangement on Friday, capped the convenience fee chargeable by app-based aggregators for autorickshaw services in Bengaluru at 10% of fare. This is exclusive of the goods and services tax (GST) to be collected on the total fare, as before. Justice MG Shukure Kamal issued the interim direction after ride-hailing companies Uber and Ola failed to reach an understanding with the state transport department over fares. A meeting was held on Thursday in deference to the court's suggestion, but the two sides held their respective positions, sources told ET.
