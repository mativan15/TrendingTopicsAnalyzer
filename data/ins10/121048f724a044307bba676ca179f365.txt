LEEDS fans turned on manager Jesse Marsch as they lost 2-0 to Premier League strugglers Leicester.
The defeat leaves Leeds with just two wins in 10 games and only out of the relegation zone thanks to goal difference.

Marsch helped steer Leeds clear of relegation last season but there has been no notable improvements on the last campaign.
Another poor performance sparked backlash in the away end at the King Power stadium on Thursday with some fans making it clear their allegiances do not lie with the current manager.
