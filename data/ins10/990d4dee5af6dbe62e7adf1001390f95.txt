The blood was up this week. Hoo-boy, was it up. Jürgen Klopp got sent off for cursing a linesman in the Liverpool v Manchester City match. Pep Guardiola should have walked too, for his schoolgirl passive aggression towards the referee in the same game. Grown men, wealthy, decorated men, acting in a way that would get them grounded if they were teenagers.At least Klopp had the grace to hold his hands up afterwards and apologise. City, showing a characteristic inability to take their beating, instead decided put it about — uisce faoi thalamh, of course — that Klopp's prematch comments about there being three clubs in football with no ceiling were 'borderline xenophobic'.
