Plans have been drawn up to ration electricity in the UK if European supply issues continue to deteriorate this winter.
A ‘reasonable' worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages if Russia cuts off more supplies to the EU, the Times said.
Earlier this month, the Kremlin halted gas exports and electricity delivers to Finland, in response to Helsinki's bid to join Nato.
And Vladimir Putin was accused of using gas supplies as ‘blackmail' after abruptly turning off the taps on Poland and Bulgaria.
