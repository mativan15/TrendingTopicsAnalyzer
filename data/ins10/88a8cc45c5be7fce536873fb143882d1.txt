Oct. 21—ROCHESTER — A long-time downtown Rochester patio has a new name and purpose.

A new sign —

The Deck on 4th & Zumbro

— recently appeared painted on the side of the

former Legends bar/

AFL Labor Temple building at 11 Fourth St. SE. An arrow points to the patio tucked alongside the building overlooking the Zumbro River.

The property is owned by the City of Rochester and is slated to be part of a future redevelopment of the downtown riverfront.

The Rochester Downtown Alliance commissioned the sign with American Rescue Plan funds to promote The Deck for public events.
