Q We're fed up with high mortgage costs and would like to pay off our debts and the sooner the better. We are happy to downsize and simplify our life to make this possible.We have two properties, one flat without a mortgage which is valued at £43,500. We are not able to live in this property due to its location, in a different town, too far from our jobs. It also needs some renovating.The other property, which is where we live, has a mortgage and is valued at £174,000. We still have about £73,000 to pay off.
