Car companies are trying to fight progress by bringing a legal case against the Newtown cycleway, sustainable transport advocates say. Six businesses are seeking judicial review of the Wellington City Council project to build a cycleway between Newtown to Courtenay Place, which is already under construction. Their case is scheduled to be heard on Thursday morning. Four of them are car dealerships or repairers, prompting criticism that they are trying to keep Wellington beholden to cars. The four car-related companies are behemoth Gazley Motors, which has multiple dealerships along Kent and Cambridge Tces; Capital City Cars on Adelaide Road; the Novus Glass franchise on Adelaide Road; and the Midas franchises in Newtown and Te Aro.
