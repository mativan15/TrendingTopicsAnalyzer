Volume was 14 percent lower than the same week one year ago.Despite a slight decline, mortgage rates are significantly higher than they were at the start of this year.This comes as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) decreased to 5.
