After the extraordinary moment Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minister, is Twitter was a game Richard Osman won it with his hysterical Pointless gag.
Truss has sensationally thrown in the towel after just five weeks as Prime Minister, confirming a new election for the Conservative leader will conclude Friday October 28.
Naturally, celebrities have been flooding social media with reactions of disbelief but none were more delicious than Osman's post.
The best-selling author and presenter quit Pointless earlier this year with his final episodes airing just last month.
