Australia's largest fresh food producer Costa Group has downgraded the earnings guidance for its citrus business after excessive rainfall and lower temperatures, brought on by La Niña, damaged its orange and mandarin crops.

ASX-listed Costa Group's citrus is grown in three key regions: roughly 40 per cent in the Riverland area (South Australia), 40 per cent in Sunraysia (straddling the NSW-Victoria border), and 20 per cent in central Queensland.

The company said on Monday that adverse weather conditions had taken a heavy toll on its citrus crop across the country.
