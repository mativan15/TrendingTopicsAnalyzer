Guido Mieth/DigitalVision via Getty Images Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) +5.5% in Thursday's trading after UBS upgraded shares to Buy from Neutral with a $205 price target, raised from $186, at UBS, believing the company's earnings revisions have troughed and seeing upside potential to 2023 consensus estimates. "Price/cost challenges from higher inflation have been a major headwind over the last year, but ramp-up in Ecolab's pricing and the addition of variable rate surcharges (linked with energy) neutralize the risk of further price/raws issues," according to UBS' Joshua Spector.
