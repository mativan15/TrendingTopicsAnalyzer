Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers displayed the effects of the pressure mounting on his job after Saturday's uninspiring 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. Rodgers terminated a media huddle after labelling a question on his Foxes future 'disrespectful' and 'disgraceful'.Leicester are slumped in 19th in the Premier League, level with rock-bottom Nottingham Forest on five points after 10 games, and their only triumph so far came against Steve Cooper's side at the start of October. The lacklustre stalemate against Palace confirmed the club's worst points tally after 10 league outings since 1983/84.
