JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images JP Morgan analyst Matthew Boss added TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) to his 'analyst focus' list due to its expected resilience in the face of an economic slowdown. Boss cited recent fieldwork that suggested an improved inventory position and a 'more insulated' core customer as compared to other retailers as key growth drivers. Further, denim and Nike product exposure are expected to provide a shopping catalyst into the holiday season. 'TJX historically ranks within the top 10 percentile of consumer discretionary equity performance during an economic slowdown/contraction,' Boss added.
