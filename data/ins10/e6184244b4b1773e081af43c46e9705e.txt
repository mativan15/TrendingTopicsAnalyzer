AgenciesN Chandrababu Naidu. (File image)Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday tore into the YSR Congress regime in Andhra Pradesh over a host of issues and said an "inept" person like Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy was ineligible to continue as Chief Minister. "Is any one section of the society happy with Jagan's rule? Except unleashing vendetta, what has Jagan done for the people of Andhra Pradesh in the last three years," the former Chief Minister questioned. In his inaugural address at the TDP's annual conclave Mahanadu here, Naidu gave the call "Quit Jagan - Save Andhra Pradesh", exhorting people to vote out the "scandalous and ruinous" regime in the state.
