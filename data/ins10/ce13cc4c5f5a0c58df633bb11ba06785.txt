The Toronto Maple Leafs placed defenceman Jake Muzzin on injured reserve Wednesday due to a neck injury sustained during the team's controversial loss to the Arizona Coyotes on Monday.

Muzzin collided with Coyotes forward Clayton Keller during the second period of the contest and was slow to get up before eventually skating off the ice. He did not return to the game and a timeline for his return has not been announced.

Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner expressed concern for Muzzin's health after Monday's game, shedding light on how close the two players have become over the past several seasons.
