AgenciesThe son of renowned comedian Joe Pasquale, Joe Tracini, age 34, sat down with Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond to discuss his experience while living with a borderline personality disorder (BPD). He explained his issue by saying that people don't really know how to deal with it because it's in his head. He said that, basically, BPD is a voice in his head that hates everything he does, everything he has ever done, and everything he is ever going to be. He said that it was like living with a school bully in his head.
