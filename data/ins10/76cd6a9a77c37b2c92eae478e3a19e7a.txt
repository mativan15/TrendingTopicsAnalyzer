A good showerhead can help you start off your day on the right foot. A hot shower can help wake you in the morning, relax in the evening or give you a midday energy boost. On the other hand, a bad shower can leave you feeling grouchy, especially if the water pressure is weak or the spray pattern provides disappointing coverage. That's why it's important to choose a showerhead that suits your needs. The best showerheads will fulfill both of those needs, and some will come with even more bells and whistles.
