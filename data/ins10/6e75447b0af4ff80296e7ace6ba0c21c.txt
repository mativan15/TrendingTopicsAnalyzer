The PGA Tour Champions is in Richmond, Virginia, at the Country Club of Virginia for the Dominion Energy Charity Classic this week, with the opening round set to tee off Friday morning.
Before arriving, the players in the field were warned about potential flaws in the course's conditions, specifically on the back nine.
Last month, the greens of Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 were vandalized by a petroleum substance and what was left behind were trails of burnt grass.
The repair process was tedious and included replacing the burnt blades with fresh pieces of earth.
