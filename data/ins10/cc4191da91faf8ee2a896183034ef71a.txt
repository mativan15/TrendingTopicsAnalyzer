Spain's government will within days present a draft bill to regulate video game "loot boxes" for which users must pay, a minister said Friday, warning of the addiction risks for youngsters.An increasingly common feature in many video games, "loot boxes" are caches of virtual weapons and equipment which a player can buy to increase their prowess or status within the game.But not all boxes contain useful tools and gamers can only see what's inside after paying, prompting widespread criticism for encouraging behaviour similar to that associated with gambling.
