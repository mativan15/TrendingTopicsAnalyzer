Olivier Le Moal Here is our report that we publish daily on stocks reporting earnings and showing all our Buy/Hold/Sell signals for each stock before earnings. These are both fundamental and technical signals. Our most important signal is on the right side of the report, in the SID column, and we have circled all the scores in that column. At the top of this list are stocks that already reported earnings on Friday. This enables you to see what our signals were saying before earnings and how our signals were surprised, so we can make money going forward.
