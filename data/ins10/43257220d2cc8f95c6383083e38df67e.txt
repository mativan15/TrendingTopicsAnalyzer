After teasing its return during the Super Bowl back in February, DeLorean Motor Company debuted an illustration of the Alpha5 concept over Memorial Day weekend, an all-electric sports car that's on track for a public debut this fall.The company, a rebirth of the original DeLorean name that went bankrupt in the 80s, holds onto some of its past for design inspiration while leaning on its partnership with Italdesign to modernize it.Most notably, the blockiness of the original DMC DeLorean is gone, replaced with clean lines running from front to back for a more aerodynamic shape.
