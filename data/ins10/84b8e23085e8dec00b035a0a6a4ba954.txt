Britain's international environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, and celebrity anti-trophy campaigners like Ricky Gervais have been accused of neocolonialism by African community leaders, who warn they are ignoring the voices of people who live alongside elephants, lions and other wildlife.The UK government is expected to bring forward a ban on the import of hunting trophies during this parliament, arguing that the new law will strengthen the conservation of endangered species.With widespread support from the British public, and an anti-trophy hunting campaign backed by celebrities including Gervais, Brian May, Ed Sheeran and Joanna Lumley, a ban would be popular, and similar legislation is expected in other European countries.
