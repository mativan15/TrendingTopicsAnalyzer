Solar power has become increasingly common over the last two decades, with commercial solar capacity in the United States growing almost tenfold from 1,877 megawatts in 2011 to 15,390 megawatts in 2021, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

The growth in solar adoption has led to a boom in production of solar equipment around the world. Until recently, increased production has led to lower prices for the components related to solar energy, which has further accelerated the adoption and development of solar technology.
