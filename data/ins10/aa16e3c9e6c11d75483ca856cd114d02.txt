The Bears shuffled their wide receiver corps on Tuesday.

They announced that they have signed Isaiah Coulter to the active roster from the practice squad. They waived Ihmir Smith-Marsette in a corresponding move.

Coulter played in three games for the Bears last season, but only saw the field for 15 offensive snaps. He was targeted with one pass and did not catch it. Coulter also played in one game for the Texans in 2020.
