Liz Truss, the Conservative Party leader in the United Kingdom, has resigned her prime ministership barely a month into her tenure, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.

Addressing reporters outside No. 10 Downing Street on Thursday, Truss said that she came into office at a time of 'great economic and international instability' and that she was given a 'mandate to change this.'

'I recognize… given the situation I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party,' she said.
