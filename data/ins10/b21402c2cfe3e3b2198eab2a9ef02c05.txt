Massachusetts Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Maura Healey opened her second and final debate with Republican Geoff Diehl by pledging to make life more affordable for Bay Staters, including through tax cuts.

But Diehl, a former state representative, took issue with the claim, citing Healey's favorable view of ballot Question 1, which proposes to amend the constitution to bump the flat state income tax of 5% to 9% for all income over $1 million. The potential $1.3 billion to $2 billion in revenue, subject to appropriation by lawmakers, is intended to fund education and transportation priorities.
