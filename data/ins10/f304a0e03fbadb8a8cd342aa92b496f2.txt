\One of downtown Las Vegas' most legendary properties is in the midst of an extensive transformation that will soon give guests even more reasons to visit.

In June, Plaza Hotel & Casino unveiled the details of four large-scale projects that will reimagine its historic Main Street façade by the end of the year. The additions will join the property's recently opened live music and cocktail bar, The Sand Dollar Downtown – the larger sister location of Las Vegas' iconic Sand Dollar Lounge located on Spring Mountain Road.
