Updated: May 29, 2022 00:02 ISTDespite offering lucrative salaries and opportunists to new hires, Indian start-ups still struggle to retain talent, according to a study by Chennai based CIEL HR Services, a recruitment and staffing firm. The reasons are pay hikes from other start-ups, start-ups lacking in upskilling resources and talent being unprepared for such dynamic environment. 'Some of them go back to traditional companies for jobs. They are not able to handle the changes that happen in start-ups,' said Aditya Narayan Mishra, Director and CEO of CIEL HR Services.
