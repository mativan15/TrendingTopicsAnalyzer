Three days before Yom Kippur, 79 years ago, Rabbi Hillel Kook, the head of the 'Bergson Group,' organized a 400-strong 'Rabbi's March' to Washington, DC. Although the rabbis met the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and vice president Henry Wallace, their goal was to meet with President Franklin Roosevelt and ask him to use American military force to stop the Holocaust that Germany was perpetrating against their fellow Jews in Europe.

The Talmud quoted the teaching, 'All Jews are responsible for each other' ('kol Yisrael areivim zeh b'zeh').
