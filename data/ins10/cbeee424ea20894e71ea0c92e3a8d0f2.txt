Wall Street Published by Reuters By Stella Qiu and Kevin Buckland BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) – Asian shares on Friday extended overnight global gains thanks to strong results from regional tech firms and U.S. retailers, while investors also took comfort from Federal Reserve minutes suggesting it could pause its rapid rate hikes later this year. The swing in sentiment left the dollar wallowing at one-month lows, with the euro rising to its highest since April 25. However, the optimism is likely to fade when the European markets open.
