Justin Sullivan The reiteration of full-year guidance is enough to overshadow a somewhat disappointing third quarter earnings report, according to MKM Partners. Equity analyst Eric Handler indicated that the third quarter results were essentially in-line with his expectations, aside from a slightly light operating income figure. He added that difficult comparisons from 2021 likely accentuate the year over year declines. However, the reiteration of the full-year guidance and focus on 2023 encouraged Handler to maintain confidence in management.
