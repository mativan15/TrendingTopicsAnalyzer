Martin Lewis revealed that he urged the Chairman of the 1922 Committee Graham Brady to not "take so long" choosing a new Prime Minister at the beginning of the Tory leadership race due to the looming cost of living crisis. He warned that the party has now "paid for it" and so will the country.Speaking to LBC, Mr Lewis said: "I was everywhere saying we have to have an intervention, we need it."It was completely ignored during the leadership campaign."I can't understand how at the time that was happening that they didn't understand the realities so, it is rather frustrating.
