Collider.com In November 2021, Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble introduced us to Kimberly, Bela, Leighton, and Whitney, four college roommates trying to survive their first year at the elite and academically competitive Essex College of Vermont in The Sex Lives of College Girls.

Though, as the ladies deal with their own personal struggles they learn to trust and lean on each other, whether that's through the sharing of vulnerable secrets, attending awesome themed frat parties, or smashing entire cheesecakes in one sitting while badmouthing meathead boys, and their stupid, stupid six-pack abs.
