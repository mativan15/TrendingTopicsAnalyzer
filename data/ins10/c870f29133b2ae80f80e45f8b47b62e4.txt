Experience has made high expectations return for Virginia.

The Cavaliers, a team in transition last season, have all five starters back and have added some complementary pieces. A 10-day trip to Italy helped the new additions build chemistry with the veterans, and gave coach Tony Bennett a seasoned team in his 14th season. Virginia is ranked No. 18 in the preseason AP Top 25.

'Last year was a year of maybe not to what our standards usually have been, but we played a lot of big-time games, won some great games, got some postseason experience, so that was good,' Bennett said.
