TennesseePhotographer Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO), the rural lifestyle retailer headquartered in Brentwood, TN, is scheduled to report Q3 2022 earnings before market open on October 20. In 2022, the market has pummeled a lot of stocks post earnings release, and if TSCO too falls prey, it may be an opportunity to pick up shares for a more reasonable valuation. TSCO has held up quite well in 2022, with shares down 17% compared to the S&P 500's slide of 25%. I think TSCO's relative strength has been bolstered by its strong operating results and business fundamentals.
