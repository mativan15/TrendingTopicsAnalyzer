Liz Truss said on Thursday she was resigning as British prime minister just six weeks after she was appointed.
A leadership election will be completed within the next week to replace Truss, who is the shortest serving prime minister in British history. George Canning previously held the record, serving 119 days in 1827 when he died.
Given the divisions in the party there is no obvious candidate and any replacement would face a country likely heading into a recession. Leading names are below:
Rishi Sunak
Britain's former finance minister was the most popular candidate among Conservative lawmakers at Westminster in a leadership contest earlier this year but, after getting through to a run-off against Truss, he lost out in a vote involving some 170,000 party members who made the final decision.
