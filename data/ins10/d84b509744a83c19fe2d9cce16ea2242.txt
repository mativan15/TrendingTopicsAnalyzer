Robert Irwin is continuing to follow in his late dad Steve Irwin's footsteps — and hoping to make him proud along the way.

In a recent conversation with E! News, the 18-year-old conservationist opened up about his late father's legacy and what parts continue to inspire his life today.

"I think what dad really showed the world was, of course, to have that appreciation for the natural world and to treat every living being on this planet as you would wish to be treated," he said.
