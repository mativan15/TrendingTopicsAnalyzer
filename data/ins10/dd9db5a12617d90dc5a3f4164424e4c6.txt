Don't wake the sleeping Giants. 
The way the Giants have punched back after getting hit in the mouth is the defining characteristic of the back-to-back upset victories over the Packers and Ravens that have elevated their season from a nice underdog story to evaluating playoff scenarios. 
Discounting a safety intentionally taken on special teams, the defense has allowed eight scores — four touchdowns and four field goals — in the last two games. The offense has responded by scoring on the ensuing possession six out of eight times.
