The semifinals of the College Football Playoff could look very familiar on New Year's Eve.

Four of the teams currently in the top five of the AP Top 25 made a playoff appearance in either 2020 or 2021. And while any of those five teams could easily make the playoff, we're picking those teams with playoff experience to make the playoff field at the end of 2022 in our first set of bowl projections.

Georgia is our provisional No. 1 seed as the Bulldogs can solidify their status as the top team over the course of the regular season with a 13-0 record and wins over Tennessee and Alabama.
