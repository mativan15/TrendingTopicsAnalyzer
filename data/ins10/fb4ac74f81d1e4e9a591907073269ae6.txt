Ukraine's government seemingly threw its weight behind Boris Johnson to be the next Tory leader by sharing a meme based on a popular television show - before promply deleting it after a social media backlash. The tweet from its official government page was sent just hours after Liz Truss stood outside No 10 to tell the country she was resigning and a leadership election would take place imminently.She quit after a chaotic 44 days in office that was characterised by financial turmoil, uncertainty and poor communication.
