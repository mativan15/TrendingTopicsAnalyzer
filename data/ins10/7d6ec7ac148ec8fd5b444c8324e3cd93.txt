Singer KK's Tadap Tadap from the film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam has withstood the test of time and became known as one of the most popular heartbreak songs of his career. Composer Ismail Darbar who is still grappling with his sudden death, recalled when he first asked KK to come and sing the song, he was charmed by the singer's ‘masoomiyat'.  Darbar was moved by his honesty as KK didn't believe that he could sing the track. However, he convinced KK that he could only hear the song in KK's voice and no one else's.
