(Bloomberg) -- German and French finance ministers showed little enthusiasm for the prospect of new joint European Union debt instruments to provide financial support to countries struggling with the energy crisis.Fresh fiscal impulse is inappropriate given there is no problem of demand, labor markets are stable and inflation is strong, Germany's Christian Lindner told a virtual news conference on Wednesday.'I don't see any need for new European fiscal instruments since we already have very powerful instruments in place,' he said following a meeting with fellow German minister Robert Habeck and French counterpart Bruno Le Maire.
