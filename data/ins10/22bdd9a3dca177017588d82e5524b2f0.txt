Increased workplace surveillance has fuelled warnings that Black and Asian people in Britain face a heightened risk of discrimination at work, The Independent can reveal.One in three (33 per cent) of minority workers said all their activities in the workplace were monitored, compared to less than one in five (19 per cent) white employees, polling carried out for the Trade Union Congress by Britain Thinks, a strategy consultancy company, shows.Around one in 13 (8 per cent) of Black and Asian employees said their exact location and movements within a workplace were monitored, using handheld or wearable devices, compared to just one in 25 (4 per cent) white workers, the study found.
