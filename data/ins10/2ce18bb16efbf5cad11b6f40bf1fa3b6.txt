In the previous technical note, it was mentioned that in the absence of any adverse cues from the global markets, there are high probabilities of the markets inching higher. In line with this analysis, the Nifty saw a strong opening on Friday; it opened higher, grew stronger and ended the day on a strong note. The markets traded in a sideways range after a strong start while it protected its opening gains. The second half of the session saw the index piling up gains as it continued to mark incremental highs during the day.
