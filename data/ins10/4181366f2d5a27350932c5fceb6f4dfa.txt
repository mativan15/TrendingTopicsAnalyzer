Many employers are stepping in to help workers with the rising cost of living, with some firms offering a one-off bonus or other assistance ranging from improved employee discounts to free food.

Some big-name companies are giving lower-paid workers extra cash to help combat the impact of soaring inflation and higher bills.

Meanwhile, there may be employee benefits you have not utilised that could help you balance your budget even if your boss is not giving you a pay rise.
