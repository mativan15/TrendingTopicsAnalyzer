The shocking victory of Democrat Mary Peltola over Sarah Palin in Alaska's special congressional election ended a nearly 50-year Republican reign over House races in the state. It probably wouldn't have happened without Alaska's unique ranked-choice voting system. But nonetheless, Palin's loss may have revealed something alarming for Republicans about the limitations of MAGA personality politics in the post-Trump presidential era — not just in Alaska, but in the Lower 48 as well.

Independents in Alaska have swung dramatically toward Peltola over Palin — who along with traditionalist Republican Nick Begich III will repeat the contest all over again in the regular November election.
