India would be taking over the Group of Twenty (G20) presidency at 'a time when there are so many challenges', Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.Speaking to reporters on Saturday night, towards the end of her visit to Washington for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings, Ms. Sitharaman said that the current G20 President, Indonesia, had been through 'a very difficult year' in the context of the geopolitical tensions. This had resulted in the G20, which met in Washington this past week, not agreeing to a joint communique.
