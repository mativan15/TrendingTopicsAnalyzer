WITH DIWALI around the corner, Chetan Chauhan (42), is busy attending to customers to sell earthen diyas in the congested lanes of Kumbharwada, also known as potter colony, in the century-old pottery hub of Asia's largest slum Dharavi. After two years of suffering huge losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, his business has finally taken off again ahead of the festival of light.
'The public is also keen to celebrate Diwali whole-heartedly after two years of the pandemic. The response is overwhelming,' Chauhan told The Indian Express, as customers around him flocked to buy the colourful diyas.
