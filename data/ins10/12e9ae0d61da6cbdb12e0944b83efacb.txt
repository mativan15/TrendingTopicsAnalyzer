Axar Patel enjoyed an intense net session under watchful eyes of coach Rahul Dravid but his spot is still not certain in India's playing XI since Pakistan are likely to have three left-handers in their line-up in the much-awaited T20 World Cup contest, here on Sunday. Indian team hasn't had a settled XI in the last one year, either due to workload management or because of injuries to players that affected the balance of the side. Friday's practice session couldn't be a definitive indicator as to what will be the final playing eleven as most of the senior players opted to rest on the day.
