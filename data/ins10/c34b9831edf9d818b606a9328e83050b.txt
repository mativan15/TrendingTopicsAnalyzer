While subscription totals got all the attention out of its third-quarter earnings Tuesday, Netflix also made some announcements on the gaming front that shouldn't be overlooked.
 Netflix games VP Mike Verdu revealed this week that a domestic gaming studio in California is being planned with a former Activision Blizzard executive aboard, as well as that the company is considering an additional expansion into cloud gaming. The disclosures came a month after the company announced it is establishing an internal studio for first-party development in Finland that will be led by a former exec from mobile giant Zynga and leading AAA publisher Electronic Arts.
