Mumbai: IndiGo is talking to three-four more global carriers for operational alliances and could likely have 12 partnerships in the next two to three years, its chief executive told ET. "The math is very simple on this," said Ronojoy Dutta. "We have a great domestic position as you know. So, if an airline is coming into Bangalore, 50% of those passengers are going to connect elsewhere. They'll go to Mangalore or Vizag on IndiGo, or to some (other) place. Who better to carry them than IndiGo?" The yield for the airline from carrying such passengers is usually higher than its average, Dutta said.
