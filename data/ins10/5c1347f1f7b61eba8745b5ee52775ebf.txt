FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — With two consecutive Elite Eight appearances in tow, Arkansas' hopes for the Final Four aren't just a pipe dream.

Coach Eric Musselman, heading into his fourth season in charge of the Razorbacks, has two returning players from last year's rotation, only one of which is a starter in guard Devo Davis.

But he pulled in the No. 2 class in the nation, headlined by projected lottery pick and first-team preseason All-SEC guard Nick Smith Jr. He also picked up five players via the transfer portal to complete the reload.
