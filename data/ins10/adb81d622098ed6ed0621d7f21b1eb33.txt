The price of ITM Power (LSE: ITM) shares has fallen 79% in the past 12 months. And since an all-time high in January 2021, we're looking at an 87% drop.

That 2021 high did mark the end of a massive bull run though. And even after the subsequent collapse, the shares have still more than doubled over the past five years.

This often happens with promising growth shares. We see an initial surge, then investors get cold feet and the price reverses. At that point, it can be a great time to get in for a second upwards run, often more strongly sustained.
