Consumer groups in 18 European countries have backed a report calling gaming loot boxes "exploitative."

The contents of the virtual boxes are only revealed through either game play or by making a payment.

While some contain useful tools or desirable extras which improve the experience, others are worthless.

The report authors, the Norwegian Consumer Council (NCC), say gamers are being "manipulated" into spending large sums of money on the chests.
