Michael Cohen on Sunday said former President Trump will not run for president in 2024 because it would 'destroy the great grift' and limit Trump's ability to spend money raised through his political action committee.

Cohen, a former personal attorney for Trump, has repeatedly said that he does not believe Trump will ultimately run for president, despite the former president suggesting that he will.

'It would destroy the great grift. If he runs, all the money would then have to go into a campaign fund, people would have to start expressing who they are and it becomes listed,' Cohen told MSNBC'a Ali Velshi.
