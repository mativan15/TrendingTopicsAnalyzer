Weeds often pop up on garden lawns, in beds and borders, in between paving slabs and on driveways. While they're not causing much harm, they can look unpleasant and can easily make a home look untidy, which can be a real turn-off for potential buyers.Weeds do also compete with your plants for light, water and nutrients, starving the plants growing in the garden.This can then lead to a loss of nutrition including phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium can make plants prone to disease and insect infestation.
