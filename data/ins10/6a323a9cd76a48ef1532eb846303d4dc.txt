During economic downturns, incorporating diversification in your portfolio is a strategy that may reduce risk while investing. One type of investment to consider in a bear market is an exchange-traded fund (ETF)."An ETF is a basket of securities that are pooled together and they operate much like a mutual fund," Rachelle Tubongbanua, a private wealth adviser at U.S. Bank Wealth Management explained.  She said that investors can purchase or sell shares of the fund on the stock exchange the same way they can with a regular stock.
