(Bloomberg) -- Peloton Interactive Inc. is still working on a fix for its high-end treadmill that was recalled last year and is extending the refund window for current users, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.The model, called the Tread+, was pulled off the market in May 2021 following reports that children, pets and adults had been pulled underneath the treadmill, causing injuries. In at least one case, a child died. At the time, the safety commission recommended that all owners of the Tread+ stop using it immediately and contact Peloton for a refund.
