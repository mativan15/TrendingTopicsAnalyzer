This past January, China's agricultural ministry said one of its priorities over the next five years was to develop cultivated meat — meat grown from animal cells, sometimes referred to as 'lab-grown' meat. About a month later, President Xi Jinping made comments in a speech suggesting his support for the endeavor as well.
The decrees can be traced back, in part, to Ryan Xue, co-founder and head of the China Plant Based Foods Alliance, which brings together government agencies, researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors to build out the alternative protein industry in China.
