Marc Dufresne Against a backdrop of rising interest rates and slowing demand, Canadian business sentiment has fallen the most since the Covid-19 pandemic started, the Bank of Canada's survey signaled on Monday. Specifically, the BoC's business outlook gauge in Q3 dipped to 1.69 from 4.87 in the prior quarter and 5.88 at the peak in Q4 2021. While the latest figure remained in positive terrain, it's the worst deterioration since Q2 2020, when the indictor dropped to -6.32 from -0.81 in Q1 2020. 'Many firms expect slower sales growth as interest rates rise and demand growth shifts closer to pre-pandemic levels,' the report said.
