The MOEX Russia Index is down more than 36% year-to-date as of Friday afternoon. And international investors in Russian securities have endured restrictions in managing and valuing their positions since the war began. Based on a model that links stocks and bond markets, MSCI on Friday said the market for credit-default swaps suggests that Russian stocks "may be essentially worthless" in contrast to the prices listed on the exchange. Russian stocks may have "no value" compared to the prices listed on the Moscow Exchange, new research from MSCI has suggested.
