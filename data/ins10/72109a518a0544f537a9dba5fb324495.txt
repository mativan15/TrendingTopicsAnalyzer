Not ready for your nightly fix of wedded bliss to end with Married At First Sight UK coming to an end? Netflix has you covered with a new series of Love Is Blind. 
The hit show sees a group of singletons take to the famous pods in the hope of building a connection with a stranger, without ever seeing their physical appearance. 
By the end, some decide they've met their soulmate – and pop the question before knowing what they look like.
We then follow the couples that emerge from the experiment, as they try to turn their pod-based romances into ones ready for the real world.
