There is no rising without setback. The more the UConn football team improves, the more its games start to matter, the greater the risk of heartache.

So if UConn began to shake fans out of their apathy with two wins in a row and raise hopes, that meant disappointment was in the offing, and this came Saturday in Muncie, Ind. The other cleat dropped with an 11-point lead and the .500 mark close enough to sniff. The Huskies faltered and frittered away the game 25-21 at Ball State.

It was a gut punch for a team that was earning the right to feel good about itself, and must now pick itself up, dust itself off, you know how that goes.
