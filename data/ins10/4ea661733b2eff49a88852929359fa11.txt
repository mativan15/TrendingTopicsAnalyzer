Jeremy Hunt has insisted that Liz Truss is in charge despite her premiership looking increasingly in peril, as he warned of further public spending cuts and failed to rule out more U-turns on her disastrous mini-budget.The new chancellor, now widely seen as the most powerful man in government since he took over from the sacked Kwasi Kwarteng, has buried a series of flagship policies that brought Truss to power.'The prime minister is in charge,' he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, even though her authority has been seriously undermined by her decision to allow him to tear up her economic agenda in a bid to calm the markets and mutinous Tory MPs.
