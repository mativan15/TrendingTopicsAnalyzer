Rarible's new aggregated marketplace is the company's answer to a changing NFT market. The updated website, dubbed Rarible 2, allows users to view items from collections listed on multiple marketplaces on a single page. Announced as part of a series of updates, Ethereum-based collections of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) listed on centralized and decentralized marketplaces—including OpenSea, LooksRare and SudoSwap—will be listed on Rarible's website according to price.
