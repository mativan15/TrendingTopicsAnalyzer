CHIEF MINISTER Bhupendra Patel said on Friday that the state government will extend necessary support if industrialists from Surendranagar propose a textile park in their district to set up cotton value-addition vertical.
'There is a big cotton industry here… If you do value addition to cotton, it will be hugely beneficial. If you all come together and think about setting up a textile park here, the state government will stand by you,' Patel said. He was addressing the inaugural ceremony of Zalawad Business Conclave, a business meet organised by Zalawad Federation of Trade and Industries, a chamber of industrialists and businessmen of Surendranagar district.
