LETHBRIDGE, Alta. - New data released by Statistics Canada Wednesday contained both good and bad news for consumers. On the positive side, inflation continued to decrease, down to 6.9 per cent in the month of September. While it's not as significant a drop as many experts anticipated, it's a step in the right direction. The same can't be said for food prices however. Food prices have risen again. They're now up 11.4 per cent and show no signs of slowing down. This marks the 10th consecutive month where food prices have outpaced inflation.
