Health and tech are providing heat in what is otherwise a lukewarm year for merger and acquisition deals, according to Bank of America. The bank reported 150 deals so far this year, which annualized comes in about 9% lower than last year. That makes sense given lower market returns typically make for a weaker deal landscape, said strategist Jill Carey Hall. But health care and tech are on pace for their best dealmaking years since 1997 and 2016, respectively. Deals in biotech is specifically up due to cheaper valuations, vulnerable sellers and a growing interest in big pharma.
