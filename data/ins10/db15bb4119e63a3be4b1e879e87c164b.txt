Robert Luna likes to point out that he's held every rank in the Long Beach Police Department since he joined as a reserve officer in 1985.

Under his watch as the department's first Latino chief — a seven-year stint that ended when he retired in December — property and violent crimes in the city fell, although the annual tally of homicides and rapes increased.

Luna is proud of his record in Long Beach, but there's one problem: It's barely known beyond the boundaries of the second-largest city in Los Angeles County.
