A look at the shareholders of Portillo's Inc. (NASDAQ:PTLO) can tell us which group is most powerful. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

Portillo's is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$637m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors.
