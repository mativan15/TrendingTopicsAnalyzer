Kolkata: Manappuram Jewellers Ltd, a Manappuram group company, has set up a manufacturing unit at Ankurhati in West Bengal, an official said on Monday. This unit, the company's second after Bangalore, will be formally inaugurated on Tuesday. "The unit has begun on a 2,500 square feet location in Ankurhati. We have sought an additional 3,000 square feet for expansion. We expect to receive it in 3-4 months," the company official said. The fundamental reason for having the unit at Ankurhati Gems & Jewellery Park is to be closer to talent, he said.
