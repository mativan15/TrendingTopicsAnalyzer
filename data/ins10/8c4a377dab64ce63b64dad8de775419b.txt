In the wake of a report that the Midwest-central U.S. region may not have enough power supply on extremely hot days this summer, Holland and Zeeland's electric providers say they are prepared to do their part to reduce energy load, if needed.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the organization that manages the power grid for 15 states, including Michigan, and the Canadian province of Manitoba, warned in its summer forecast for this year the electric system might have insufficient power supply to meet the system's peak demand.
