If $10,000 vanishes from your student debt, you may want to celebrate. But what does that mean for the rest of your financial life?This is a question millions of student loan holders may be facing soon if President Joe Biden proceeds with a controversial plan to cancel $10,000 in federal student-loan debt per borrower with an executive action. The details of this answer are going to touch a borrower's day-to-day budget, their credit score and potentially their taxes too, financial experts say. The Biden administration is reportedly considering a plan to forgive $10,000 in federal student-loan debt per borrower for people making up to $150,000 and married couples filing jointly that earn up to $300,000, the Washington Post said, citing sources familiar with the discussions.
