In this edition of Author Talks, McKinsey Global Publishing's Rama Ramaswami chats with Roger Martin, a thought leader in business management and former dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, about his new book, A New Way to Think: Your Guide to Superior Management Effectiveness (Harvard Business Review Press, May 2022). A cornerstone of business education is the idea that all decisions must be based on rigorous data analysis, but Martin says this framework is beginning to crumble under the weight of an uncertain future.
