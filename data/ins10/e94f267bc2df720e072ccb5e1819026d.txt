We Are I bought the dip in Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN), a business development company whose stock price has dropped from around $45 to $32 in just two months. Even though Main Street has a high book value valuation, I believe the current valuation provides investors with an opportunity to access a higher margin of safety while the actual dividend payout is more than secured by net investment income. Main Street may also continue to pay supplemental dividends to distribute excess portfolio income.
