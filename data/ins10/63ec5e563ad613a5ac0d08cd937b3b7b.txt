This means that someone who earns around £75,000 today would be hit with the 60pc tax trap before 2027, while anyone who earns £81,000 would see their earnings exceed the threshold within four years.
Someone on £90,000 a year would fall victim to the hidden tax rate within two years, assuming wage growth stays high.
Even under a more conservative outlook in which wage growth returns to its 10-year average of 3pc after 12 months, someone who earns £90,000 a year would still be hit with the tax trap within three years.
