Punjab Vigilance Bureau (VB) Wednesday informed a court that a currency-counting machine was seized during the searches at the residence of former cabinet minister Sunder Sham Arora. The VB added that they are yet to find the source of money which Arora allegedly offered as bribe to VB's Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of police Manmohan Sharma.
The court sent Arora to 14-day judicial remand. The VB had Sunday arrested Arora for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 50 lakh to Sharma to 'clear his name' in an ongoing inquiry against him in a disproportionate assets case.
