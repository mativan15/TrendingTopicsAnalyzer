Every investor in Serica Energy plc (LON:SQZ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

With a market capitalization of UK£684m, Serica Energy is a decent size, so it is probably on the radar of institutional investors.
