An escaped murderer believed to be connected to the deaths of a family of five this week in Centerville, Texas, has been captured and killed, the Leon County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.  The murders occurred in the area where Gozalo Lopez, a convicted murderer, escaped from prison last month, launching a three-week manhunt. He was reportedly killed in a shootout with police. Authorities found the bodies of two adults and three children Thursday while conducting a welfare check at the home at the request of a relative.
