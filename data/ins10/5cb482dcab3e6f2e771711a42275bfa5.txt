AgenciesAsh dieback, a fungus-caused illness, was discovered for the first time in the UK ten years ago, and now the disease is hitting harder than expected, and the cost of its prevention is increasing. Ash dieback is a disease caused by a fungus and was first seen in the United Kingdom a decade ago. Experts suggested the disease would have bad repercussions but hoped the disease would spare some trees and the woodlands would largely be unaffected. However, it was not the case. An expert said they would be lucky if only 5 per cent of the ash trees survived.
