The Government of India has set a target to increase coal gasification to 100 million tonnes (MT) by 2030, V K Tiwari, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal, said on Friday. "Coal gasification is the future. It is considered a cleaner option compared to the burning of coal. Gasification facilitates utilization of the chemical properties of coal," Tiwari said while addressing the National Mineral Congress held in Bhubaneswar.

 He said the government has prepared a National Mission document to achieve 100 MT Coal Gasification by 2030.
