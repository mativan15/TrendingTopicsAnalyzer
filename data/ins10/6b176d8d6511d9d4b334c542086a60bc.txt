Bioncé FoxxJun 1, 2022How is that you can be a billionaire and not touch cash? That's what Kanye West is saying. Must be nice to have so much money and not even touch the stuff. Last I checked Ye was considered an official billionaire but he says it's been four years since he touched some cash. How does this dude buy anything? I guess I don't really carry cash around or use it that much but at least I have picked up a dollar or two here and there. But I'm not a billionaire either.
