BEIJING, June 2 (Reuters) - China's local governments have issued a net 2.03 trillion yuan ($302.91 billion) in special bonds in the first five months of the year, a finance ministry official said on Thursday.

That means the local governments need to issue 1.42 trillion yuan in special bonds for June if they want to meet the cabinet's goal, which is largely in line with analysts' estimations.

China's cabinet had told local governments on Tuesday to ensure 2022's 3.45 trillion yuan in special bond issuance for infrastructure is completed by the end of June, bringing the deadline forward by three months in a bid to boost investment.
