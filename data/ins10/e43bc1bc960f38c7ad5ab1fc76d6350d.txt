Published: 19:24 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 19:29 EDT, 20 October 2022 Steven Gerrard's dismissal as Aston Villa just hours after their 3-0 Premier League hammering at the hands of Fulham was 'inevitable' according to Newcastle and England legend Alan Shearer.Gerrard's luck as Villa boss finally ran out on Thursday evening, less than a year after he took over at the Midlands club having left Rangers in November 2021. Pressure had grown on the 42-year-old to be removed as Villa head coach following a string of devastating defeats, with Thursday's 10-man loss at Craven Cottage leaving them one place above the relegation zone.
