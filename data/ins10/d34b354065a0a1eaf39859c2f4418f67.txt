Investors in Freshpet — an upscale pet food maker whose stock soared during the pandemic but has tanked this year — are hissing and howling after learning that some of the company's top executives and directors have quietly been moonlighting at a startup that also sells pricey pet food, The Post has learned.
Freshpet's president and operating chief Scott Morris, who co-founded the Secaucus, NJ-based manufacturer in 2006 and is now its No. 2 executive — also indicates on his LinkedIn page that he launched a website in 2019 called Hive Brands that sells sustainable consumer goods.
