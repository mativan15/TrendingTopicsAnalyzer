Even with the market downturn and proliferation of hacks, Mary-Catherine Lader is among the most bullish on crypto—and has been for a while. Being chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, the company behind the development of the largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, Lader sees great value in decentralized protocols specifically.  To her, not all products within the space are created equal, and that has been seen throughout the ongoing Crypto Winter. Following the Terra stablecoin collapse in May, countless centralized projects and lenders deteriorated, leaving investors at a loss and market sentiment very fearful.
