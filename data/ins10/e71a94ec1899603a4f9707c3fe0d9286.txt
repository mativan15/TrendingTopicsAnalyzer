Isela Perez entered the custody of Georgia's child welfare system at age 10. It happened after her father was deported and her mother left her and her brother alone in their home for two weeks, she said.
Perez estimates she moved more than 20 times among group homes, mental health facilities, and foster families.
'A lot of foster parents didn't know how to deal with my anger issues or my depression,' said Perez, now 18 and in an independent living program in Dahlonega, Georgia.
