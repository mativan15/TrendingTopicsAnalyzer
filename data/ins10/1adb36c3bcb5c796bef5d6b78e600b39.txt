Abseiling protesters who closed Wellington's Mount Victoria tunnel have been arrested and the road has opened again. Police closed the road just after 9am after abseiling protesters from the group Restore Passenger Rail lowered a banner into traffic. One protester lowered himself to the ground shortly before 10am, while the second climbed back to the top of the tunnel. One was put into a police van while another abseiled up the steep concrete bank above the tunnel. Police at the scene confirmed two people had been arrested.
