Patna: The Patna high court on Friday declared 'unconstitutional' certain provisions of the Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Act, 2021, which amended the state's original Act of 2007, saying they were contrary to the Constitution (74th) Amendment Act, 1992 that aims to achieve self-governance. The court also pointed out that though the state legislature has the power to legislate on matters concerning municipal bodies, however, its involvement in the functioning of local bodies has to be minimal. The order was passed by a bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and justice Sanjay Kumar while hearing a writ petition filed by a Patna resident, Dr Ashish Kumar Sinha, and others, challenging the constitutional validity of the Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Act, which came into effect on March 31, 2021.
