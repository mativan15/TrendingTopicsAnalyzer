Islamabad, Pakistan – Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has continued his dominant electoral streak after being removed from office some six months ago.
With eight National Assembly seats up for grabs in Sunday's by-elections – three each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces and two in Karachi city – the 70-year-old leader's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) contested seven and won six. Candidates of the Pakistan People's Party, part of the ruling alliance, won the other two seats.
According to Pakistani laws, a candidate can run for multiple seats.
