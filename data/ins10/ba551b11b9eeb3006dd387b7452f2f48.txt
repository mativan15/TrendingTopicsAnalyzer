JJFarquitectos/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Unilever's (NYSE:UL) accommodative approach to activist investor Nelson Peltz is encouraging, according to Bank of America. The legendary investor was added to the board at Unilever on Tuesday, noting that he will assume his role as a non-executive director from July 20. His firm, Trian Fund Management, previously took a 1.5% stake in Unilever (UL) back in January, making it the company's fifth-largest shareholder. Shares ralled over 6% in pre-market trading on the announcement.
