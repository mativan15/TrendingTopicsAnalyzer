Tesla CEO Elon Musk has endorsed Democratic candidate for mayor of Los Angeles Rick Caruso. Musk made the formal endorsement Friday in a series of social media posts in which he talked about his own views of politics and government."Los Angeles is fortunate to have someone like Rick Caruso running for mayor. He's awesome," Musk wrote Friday on Twitter.The unprompted message was notable as one of the first formal endorsements Musk has made since his surge into political discourse. Since announcing his intentions to buy Twitter, Musk has become more vocally in support of the Republican Party, openly hostile to Democrats, and more opinionated on issues than ever before.
