Rishi Sunak's measures are one-off payments, and the basic £400 covers only half of the projected average energy cost rise of £800 (Sunak U-turns on ‘energy profits levy' in £15bn cost of living package, 26 May).

People need a much better level of guaranteed income and greater employment rights and security.
