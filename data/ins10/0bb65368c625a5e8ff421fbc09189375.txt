A 24-year-old Los Angeles woman is recovering from a traumatic brain injury after a homeless man stabbed her in the head with a pair of gardening shears in an unprovoked attack, authorities said.

Kyli Watts was walking along Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood around 11:30am local time on October 10 when the grisly assault took place, according to news station KTLA.

The suspected stabber, 30-year-old Jonathan Cole, rammed a pair of gardening shears with 4-inch blades into the back of Watts' head as they passed while walking down the street, police said.
