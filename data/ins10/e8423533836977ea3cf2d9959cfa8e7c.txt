Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves insisted the Conservatives have now "run out of credibility and are running out of chancellors" after performing a screeching U-turn on Liz Truss's mini-budget on Monday. New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt wiped the slate clean as he announced nearly all measures included in the fiscal plan would be scrapped after weeks of market and political uncertainty. But Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid noted the Labour Party had also performed some significant U-turn on an income tax cut.
