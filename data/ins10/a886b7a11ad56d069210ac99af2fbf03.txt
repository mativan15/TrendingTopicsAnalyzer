Auburn is looking to avoid their fourth-ever loss in Oxford, Mississippi Saturday morning.

The Tigers are 13-3 all-time at Ole Miss but they will have a tough time avoiding a loss. Not only does Auburn have a dreadful offense but the Rebels are explosive and can score quickly when they have the ball.

The Tigers will need a strong performance from their offense to keep them in the games and to help put the defense, which is thin and poorly equipped to handle the Rebel's high-tempo offense.

The game is set to start at 11 a.
