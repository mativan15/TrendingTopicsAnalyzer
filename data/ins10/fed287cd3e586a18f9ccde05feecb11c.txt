Texas Tech wide receiver Trey Cleveland scores a touchdown during the Red Raiders' victory against West Virginia two years ago at Jones AT&T Stadium, where the same two teams square off again Saturday. Cleveland has emerged as a big playmaker for the Red Raiders in recent weeks.

Texas Tech and West Virginia are two of the six teams in the Big 12 who already have at least two losses in conference play. Each team is halfway toward becoming bowl eligible as they prepare to face each other at 2 p.m.
