Indiewire Television Joy Behar has a different point of view on 'The Crown' than Dame Judi Dench.'The View' co-host clapped back at Dench's criticisms over the 'cruelly unjust' portrayal of the British royal family in the fictionalized Netflix series.'This dame disagrees with Dame Judi Dench, because they tell you at the top that it is not a documentary, and if you have a brain, you can figure out that the writers have used history,' Behar said during 'The View,' via Entertainment Weekly.
