Along with new Silent Hill games, the series' movie franchise is set to re-emerge with Return to Silent Hill.We'd previously heard about plans for a new movie from director Cristophe Gans (who also directed the original Silent Hill in 2006), but this is the first official confirmation. A reveal for the film showed concept art, as well as discussion of the idea from Gans and producer Victor Hadida. The new movie will be based on the story of Silent Hill 2, and will be more of a psychological horror.
