For more than 20 years, AVL has been actively and successfully involved in all technical aspects of motorsport for teams in the world's most respected racing series, including F1, NASCAR, and Moto GP. The company's motorsport division, previously known as AVL RACING, was established especially for this purpose—supplying state-of-the-art technology and services ranging from engineering, testing, testbed assembly and simulation, through to manufacturing. The rebranding helps clarify the company's offerings and goals…not as a race team or car, but as a provider of advanced technologies to help teams around the world, in all series win races.
