During my term on the Modesto City Council, Mayor Carmen Sabatino and the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors were constantly at loggerheads over which level of government should pay for what. Despite their differences, both levels of government did their best to deliver services to constituents.

The present Board of Supervisors applauds itself for having a $250 million budget surplus due to excellent fiscal management. Supervisors are also proud of passing a half-percent road tax, starting the Route 132 expressway project, acquiring motels to house the homeless, and the falling unemployment rate.
