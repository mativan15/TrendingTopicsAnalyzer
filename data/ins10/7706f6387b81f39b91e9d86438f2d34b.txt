Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) headquarters were searched by prosecutors as part of Germany's wider investigation into "cum-ex" transactions, according to media reports. Under the cum-ex scheme, clients of several big banks allegedly profited from share transactions executed in the days before and after a stock dividend's payment, that led governments to reimburse taxes that were never actually paid. In August, Deutsche Bank's (DB) internal investigation found that some of its London-based investment bankers skirted the companies own policies against the cum-ex activities.
