After graduating close to 100 deep-tech startups from its outposts in Israel and Germany, Intel Corp. is bringing its 12-week accelerator program Intel Ignite to the Boston area.

Tzahi Weisfeld, the Tel Aviv-based general manager of Intel Ignite, said that the ten startups who'll be in the first Boston batch will be announced in the coming days. Serial entrepreneur Mark Castleman will manage the hybrid program, slated to start in November.

The strategy arrives as Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger, as reported by the Oregonian, told employees that "targeted cuts" are on the way.
