Oct. 20—HAMILTON — The jury continued deliberations this morning in the Gurpreet Singh's death penalty trial after being sequestered Wednesday night in a hotel.

They returned to the courtroom about 9:15 a.m. and left after about deliberating about two hours Wednesday.

The prosecution rested Monday and the defense rested Wednesday morning after calling one witness, a blood spatter expert. Singh did not take the stand.

The 40-year-old former truck driver is charged with four counts of aggravated murder for allegedly shooting and killing his wife Shalinderjit Kaur, 39; his in-laws, Hakikat Singh Pannag, 59, and Parmjit Kaur, 62; and his aunt-in-law, Amarjit Kaur, 58, at a West Chester Twp.
