AgenciesNTPC is currently running the two units of 300 MW each for a fee on special government directives aimed at overcoming power shortages.Mumbai: Lenders to the Chhattisgarh-based distressed electricity producer SKS Power Generation have extended the due diligence deadline by prospective buyers for the second time to November 25 as bidders needed more time to thoroughly analyse the plant, said people familiar with the process. "The 600 MW plant is a rare running plant available with all linkages in place so bidders want to make sure they put their best foot forward and hence more time has been given," said one of the persons, who did not wish to be identified.
