Welcome to the third installment of our 2022 Power 100, the NBJ newsroom's list of the most influential people in the city's business scene.

Today, we introduce you to the Industry Giants. These are the executives leading the most powerful companies in town, be it for their high-profile reputations or top-of-the-market success. Their companies or organizations are among the largest — for the dollars or the jobs they generate — and they use that scale to drive decisions and wield influence.

As a reminder, Power 100 is an assessment based on our newsroom's reporting and expertise covering the region's high-powered business community to know who's driving decisions, both in the headlines and behind the scenes.
