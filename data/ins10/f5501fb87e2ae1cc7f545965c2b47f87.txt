(Reuters) -Harini Logan, 14, of San Antonio won the 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday after a first-ever 'spell-off' was required for a champion to emerge in the extremely close competition.
Logan takes home $50,000 from Scripps, plus further money prizes and reference works from Merriam-Webster and Encyclopedia Britannica.
She beat Vikram Raju, 12, of Denver after their neck-and-neck competition required a 'spell-off' to decide the winner, a first in the history of the Bee.
