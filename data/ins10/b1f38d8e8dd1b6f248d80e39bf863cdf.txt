Like most so-called Tiger Cubs, the tech-focused hedge fund Coatue has lost significant money this year. But it has fared better than rivals, thanks in part to founder Philippe Laffont's longstanding propensity to slash exposure and build up piles of cash during market turbulence, according to sources familiar with the fund and a recent investor presentation.Coatue would be down as much as 40% through May had it held on to its positions from the start of January — losses that would put it in league with the likes of Melvin Capital and Tiger Global.
