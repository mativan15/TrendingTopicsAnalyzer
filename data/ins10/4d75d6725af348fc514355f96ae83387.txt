Coworking is continuing to find a home in the Bayou City.

The Houston area ranks among the U.S. metros with the highest number of coworking spaces, according to a recent report by CoworkingCafe, part of Santa Barbara, California-based Yardi Systems Inc.

With 208 properties containing coworking spaces, Houston came in at No. 8 on CoworkingCafe's list, narrowly edging out Boston, which had 198 coworking spaces in 2021. Houston also beat the San Francisco Bay Area, which had 171 coworking spaces last year.
