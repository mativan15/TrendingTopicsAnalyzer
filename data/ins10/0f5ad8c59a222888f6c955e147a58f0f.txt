Western Australian nurses and midwives could begin the first leg of a series of escalating industrial actions by midday tomorrow if Australian Nursing Federation members agree to bans on double shifts in a straw poll being held overnight.

The poll is being held after freshly-elected Australian Nurses Federation secretary Janet Reah and Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson met for about 45 minutes on Tuesday afternoon.

The meeting was a last-ditch effort by the government to avoid industrial action from nurses after the ANF flatly rejected the government's official pay offer and prospective nurse-to-patient ratio model sent to the ANF on Monday night.
