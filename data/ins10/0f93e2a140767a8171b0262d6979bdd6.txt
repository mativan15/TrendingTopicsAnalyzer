Southern Charm star Naomie Olindo is being sued by her former business partner for fraud, breach of contract and defamation.
 
Virginia Cox claims Olindo approached her to start an online fashion store together in 2018 due to her previous experience with fashion buying, sales, and customer service. Together they started L'Abeye.
 
According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Cox claims that after building a successful business, Olindo refused to share profits, stopped sharing access to financials, and eventually removed her from the business with no cause.
