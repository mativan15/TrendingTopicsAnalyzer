Oct 21 (Reuters) - American Express said on Friday its third-quarter profit had modestly improved as spending on goods, services and travel kept up despite fears of a potential economic slowdown later in the year.

The company said it now expects to report full-year profit above its prior forecast of $9.25 to $9.65 per share.

"The demand for travel has exceeded our expectations throughout the year," said Chief Executive Officer Stephen J. Squeri.

Travel and entertainment spending volumes in international markets surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time this quarter, he added.
