Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has regained the ability to (checks notes) rarely enter his team's workplace.

Ross, a notorious absentee owner who lives and works in New York, has had 'full ownership privileges' restored, now that Week Six has come and gone. It really doesn't mean much for Ross, since he isn't the kind of owner who is around the team on a regular basis. Given that he was still permitted to attend games (and to keep the money his team made during the suspension) it wasn't much of a suspension at all.
