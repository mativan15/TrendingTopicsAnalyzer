Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday called electoral bonds the "biggest scam" in the history of independent India. His remark came days after the centre told the Supreme Court that the electoral bonds scheme was an absolutely transparent mode of political funding. Gehlot said that electoral bonds have been devised by the NDA government in such a way that not only it allows easy funnelling of money, but also ensures that no one can be blamed for it. He said that the Supreme Court should not delay judgement on the matter and should hold regular hearings.
