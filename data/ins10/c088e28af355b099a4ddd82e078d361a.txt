Neuhoff, the giant historical renovation development on Germantown's riverfront, is making progress. Nashville Business Journal got a sneak peek into site work.

Developed by Atlanta-based New City Properties LLC and backed financially by JP Morgan and Cousins Properties, the project is transforming the former Adams Street meat-packing slaughterhouse into 14 acres of mixed-use offerings.

When complete, the $550 million project's first phase will hold 448,000 square feet of office and retail space across two buildings, as well as 542 apartment units across two eight- and nine-story buildings.
