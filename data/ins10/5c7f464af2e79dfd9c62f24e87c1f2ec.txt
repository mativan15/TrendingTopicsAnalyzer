GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — The British government said Tuesday said it was abolishing visa entry requirements for Guyanese, whose nation's global importance has been rising with its growing oil and gas export capacity.

High Commissioner Jane Miller announced the decision, which takes effect next month, saying it is 'a real sign of the confidence the United Kingdom has in the growth of our relationship.'

She noted that British Airways flights to South America's only English-speaking country would resume at the end of March.
