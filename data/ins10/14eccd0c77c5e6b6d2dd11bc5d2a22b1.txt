NBA TV's Isiah Thomas likes the Lakers' reported hiring of Darvin Ham as coach because he will bring a defensive mentality to the team.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A person with knowledge of the decision says Darvin Ham has accepted an offer to be the next head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.
The person spoke with The Associated Press on Friday on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been publicly announced.
The 48-year-old Ham is getting his first head coaching job as the 28th coach in Lakers history.
