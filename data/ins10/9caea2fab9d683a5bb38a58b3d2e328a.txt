The New York Giants have placed veteran defensive back Tony Jefferson on injured reserve with a foot injury. He will now have to miss the team's next four games.
Jefferson joined the Giants in September after turning down several other teams in order to work with Wink Martindale. He appeared in three games this season and recorded five tackles (four solo).

With Jefferson going on IR and rookie D.J. Davidson also lost for the season with a torn ACL, the Giants now have two open spots on their 53-man roster.
