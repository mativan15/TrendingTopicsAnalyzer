Donna Brewer got home from her late shift at work around 1:30 a.m. But she wasn't tired yet.

So she decided to check her Virginia Lottery app. That's when Brewer saw she won $12 in the previous night's Mega Millions Drawing, she told lottery officials, according to an Oct. 14 news release.

Instead of taking her winnings, the Danville resident used her $12 to play a few Virginia Lottery online games. While playing Shamrock Winnings, Brewer uncovered three matching amounts and won the top prize, worth $200,000, officials said.
