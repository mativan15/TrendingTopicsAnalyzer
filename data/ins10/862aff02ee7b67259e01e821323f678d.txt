Ushering in Netflix's latest slate of Thai content is The Lost Lotteries, a "heist-comedy" that director Prueksa Amaruji hopes will resonate with not just viewers in Thailand, but also international audiences. The subject that underpins the film is universally relatable: playing the lottery, or huay in Thai. Amaruji says he and executive producer Ekachai Uekrongtham agreed that Thai people from all walks of life, regardless of social class and financial condition, buy lottery tickets. "Winning the first prize in the Thai lottery is like a national dream – I'm also one of those dreamers – so both of us thought that creating a film about the lottery can appeal to the masses, and surely our Thai fans," says the director, who is best known for his comedy duology, Bikeman.
