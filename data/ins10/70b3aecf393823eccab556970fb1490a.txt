Siragusa thanked viewers for their kindness and support. "I didn't think that many people would give a shit, to be honest. It's kind of crazy," the content creator said. "Even people who don't like me, even haters who are like, 'damn, I fuckin' hate Amouranth, but you know what, I hope she's OK,' that's so nice." "As of today, I have access to all of my accounts and finances again," Siragusa told viewers. "Some people, though, seem to be using the situation for personal gain and clout, which is less moving," she continued.
