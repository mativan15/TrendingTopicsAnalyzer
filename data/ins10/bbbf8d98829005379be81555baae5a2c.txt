The Manitoba Metis Federation (MMF) says it has filed a police report after discovering the gravesite of Metis leader Louis Riel was defaced.
Images on social media show Riel's gravestone in Winnipeg was marked with scratches earlier this week.'This deliberate, targeted attack and the complete disrespect shown to Louis Riel as the historic leader of the Red River Métis, the founder of Manitoba and its first premier, is appalling,' said MMF president David Chartrand in a release Thursday.'This is not just offensive to our Nation, it is an insult to all Manitobans, and should be treated as such.
