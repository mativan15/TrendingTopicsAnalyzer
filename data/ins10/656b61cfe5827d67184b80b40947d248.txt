Molly-Mae Hague has teased the name she and Tommy Fury are giving to their unborn baby, and it sounds ultra-unusual.
The PrettyLittleThing creative director, 23, is expecting a baby girl with the boxer, with the pair having met three years ago on the 2019 series of Love Island.
Molly and Tommy have been inseparable since and are visibly overjoyed to be welcoming their first child together, sharing clips and updates to social media including the moment they learned they were having a girl.
