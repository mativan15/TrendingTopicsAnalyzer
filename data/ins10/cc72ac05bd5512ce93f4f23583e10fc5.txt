Published: 12:10 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 12:12 EDT, 30 May 2022 Netflix camera crews will be 'moved on' if they try to film Harry and Meghan from public areas during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, it was claimed today. The streaming giant, which is rumoured to be making a documentary about the Sussexes as part of their rumoured $100m (£79m) broadcast deal, is not among media outlets accredited to film the event.While Netflix workers will be able to travel to areas near official Jubilee celebrations, stewards will intervene if they try to set up professional cameras or tripods, a source told the Telegraph.
