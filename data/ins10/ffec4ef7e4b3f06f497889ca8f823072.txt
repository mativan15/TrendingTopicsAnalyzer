A former executive has claimed to the government that Donald Trump's eponymous media company -- which sources say is under federal investigation -- committed "fraudulent misrepresentations" regarding possible mergers with two other firms as it sought to raise money. The complaint from Will Wilkerson, a former executive at Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), alleges federal securities law violations were committed by TMTG and several company officials, as well as Benessere Capital Acquisition Corporation (BENE) and Digital World Acquisition Corporation (DWAC).
