Tom Brady, Elton John among stars at Robert Kraft's wedding originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

Robert Kraft had cause for celebration this week, and not just because his New England Patriots shut out the Detroit Lions on Sunday.

The 81-year-old Patriots owner married Dr. Dana Blumberg in a surprise wedding in New York City on Friday. The star-studded guest list was invited to a 'Kickoff and a Touchdown' party at the Hall des Lumières in Manhattan and did not know that Kraft and Blumberg were going to get married, according to Page Six.
