British paratroopers are having shooting wars with robots that can fire and talk back at them as they practise for hand-to-hand combat and street battles in mock towns and villages.Normally during training soldiers shoot at metal or wooden targets, known in the army as 'figure 11s' or 'figure 12s', depending on whether they are the size of a man standing up or a torso.However, elite troops in 16 Air Assault Brigade have been training with multilingual 'humanoid robotic targets', called SimStrikers, armed with BB gun-style pellets — and they are now buying ten of them.
