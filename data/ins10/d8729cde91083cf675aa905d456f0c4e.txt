DJ 4eignOct 19, 2022According to reports, the Denver Nuggets mascot, Rocky the Mountain Lion, makes about $625K per year, which is nearly ten times the amount the average NBA mascot earns annually. Unlike his contemporaries around the league, Rocky's stage presence isn't largely based on comedic antics, galvanizing a live audience and athleticism. Rocky is a high-flying act who often takes risks high above the ground with ladders, trampolines, and spirited climbs to the top of the Pepsi Center. Needless to say, whoever dons Rocky's costume has to be an exceptional athlete with an incredible workout regime.
