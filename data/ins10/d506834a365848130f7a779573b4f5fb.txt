The Delhi High Court has said that it is impermissible for an arbitral tribunal to re-work the bargain between the parties and rewrite the contract for being commercially difficult for one party to perform. Justice Vibhu Bakhru, while dealing with a challenge to an arbitral award passed against the Ministry of Railways in relation to its disputes with Jindal Rail Infrastructure Ltd (JRIL), stated that the arbitral tribunal cannot examine the commercial wisdom and rewrite the agreement on the basis of the commercial difficulties faced by a party in performing its obligations.
