'Fame can hit people really hard,' Gallagher said. 'I always use the story of Amy Winehouse, a lovely girl from North London. All of a sudden she makes that album, she becomes a world superstar, fame hit her like a truck and she didn't make it.' 'Sadly she didn't have the people around her," he added.
