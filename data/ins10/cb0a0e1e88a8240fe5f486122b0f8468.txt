NeuBase Therapeutics Inc. is laying off 60% of its workforce in a strategic restructuring of the Pittsburgh-based biotech firm that is also seeing a new chairman in place and a focus on its gene-editing platform.

A specific number of employees to be laid off weren't disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Friday, and NeuBase (Nasdaq: NBSE) didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had 37 employees as of earlier this year, according to Pittsburgh Business Times research.
