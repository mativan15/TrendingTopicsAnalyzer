A college is to become the first in the UK to hold an interactive metaverse open day – with its campus recreated on Minecraft.
Glasgow Clyde College says it has taken the decision after experts predicted that, by 2030, more time will be spent in virtual worlds than the real world.
It says it wants to give school pupils finishing their exams in Scotland over the next week a glimpse into the future by launching the UK's first ever interactive metaverse open day, encouraging them to log on or watch live on twitch, and explore the Langside campus on Minecraft.
