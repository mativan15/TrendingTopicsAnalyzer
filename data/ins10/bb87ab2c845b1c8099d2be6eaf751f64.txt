As Milwaukee County continues its search for a new secure facility for youth to replace the Department of Corrections' Lincoln Hills facility, a longstanding issue is getting renewed attention: the lack of options in the juvenile justice system for girls.

Copper Lake, a secure detention facility for girls, is located on the Lincoln Hills site north of Wausau. Along with Lincoln Hills, the legislature ordered it to be converted into an adult institution by January 2021, according to the Department of Corrections.
