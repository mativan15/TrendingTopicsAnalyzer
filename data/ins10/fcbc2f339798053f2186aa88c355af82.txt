ozgurdonmaz/E+ via Getty Images Citi argued Tuesday that the stock market has reached "peak bearishness" related to expectations for the Federal Reserve and the risk of an eventual recession. As such, investor attention will now turn to earnings results and projections from individual companies, the firm stated. In a note authored by Scott Chronert and Drew Pettit, Citi based its opinion on positioning data, which it says shows that some investor types have already moved their portfolios to prepare for an eventual recession.
