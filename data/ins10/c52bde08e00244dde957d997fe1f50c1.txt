As she toured the country during the summer, Ms Truss said she would use Britain's newfound freedoms to speed up transport projects – suggesting Brussels red tape had delayed these – and unleash more investment to grow the economy faster.
Ms Truss also announced that around 2,400 EU laws on the UK statute books would be given a 'sunset' clause by the end of next year, meaning decisions would be taken on whether to amend, scrap or keep these pieces of legislation.
Senior Tories warned on Saturday that disillusioned voters could flock to a new Farage vehicle if Ms Truss were to back down on any more of her pledges.
