Many aspiring entrepreneurs feel the creative urge represents the most important trait for success. Many great ideas, though, never become viable businesses. Take a look at some of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. Did Henry Ford invent the automobile? No. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot first produced a steam-powered automobile in 1769. Did Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak invent the microcomputer in 1979 with the introduction of the Apple AAPL ][ computer? No. The French team headed by François Gernelle within a small company, Réalisations & Etudes Electroniqes (R2E), created what they called the 'Micro-ordinateur' in 1973.
