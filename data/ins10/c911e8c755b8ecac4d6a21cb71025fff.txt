Ember Fund offers fractionalized NFT for the average investor.

LOS ANGELES, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Ember Fund, the crypto portfolio investing app, launches their Top NFT Index that includes Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Cryptopunks, World of Women, and Doodles, allowing anyone with $10, access and exposure to blue chip NFTs.

With the rarest Bored Ape having sold for $3.4 million, investing in blue chip NFTs has been impossible for the everyday investor. Alternatively, investing in affordable NFTs can be fraught with extreme volatility, scams and low liquidity.
