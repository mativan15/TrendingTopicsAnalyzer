Oct. 19—Over the summer, Kutztown University wide receiver Jerome Kapp would take the half-hour drive from his family's home in Barto to Andre Reed Stadium, arriving sometimes as early as sunrise to practice with Golden Bears quarterback Donny Blaine.

While the extra practices were nothing new to Kapp, a graduate student and Kutztown's leading receiver in 2021, the Boyertown grad understood that he could not rely solely on his past successes heading into the 2022 season.

"That mindset and that want to always keep developing and always keep gaining trust with your teammates is the biggest part of my success," Kapp said.
