The price of the popular crypto meme token dogecoin jumped Friday after Elon Musk indicated that his private space exploration firm SpaceX would begin accepting it as payment for merchandise.
Musk, whose frequent public support for dogecoin has regularly driven spikes in its value, revealed his plans for SpaceX on Twitter. His other firm, Tesla, has already accepted dogecoin in its online store since January.
'Tesla merch can be bought with Doge, soon SpaceX merch too,' Musk tweeted.
Musk did not specify exactly when SpaceX will start accepting dogecoin as payment.
