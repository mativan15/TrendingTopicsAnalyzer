One of the most conspicuous characteristics of the bear market of 2022 has been the stock market's almost unrelenting grind lower. Unlike March 2020, when most of that year's volatility was packed into the span of a month, this year's selloff has dragged on and on. As it turns out, this is something uncommon in the history of the U.S. stock market, according to an analysis by LPL Financial. The percentage of 'up' days for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.67% so far this year through the close on Wednesday stands at just 43.
