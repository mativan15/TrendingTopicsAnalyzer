Just steps from Prince's old haunt, the First Avenue nightclub, a nearly 100-foot mural of the music icon is slowly emerging. International artist Hiero (pronounced "high-row") Veiga and his assistant Betto jumped onto a green crane Thursday to continue painting the new Prince mural on the Ramp A parking garage at N. First Avenue and N. Eighth Street in downtown Minneapolis. As the crane rose, it hovered above the traffic lights, and a purple banner with Hiero's name and Instagram handle dangled from the bottom of the platform, flapping in the wind on an unseasonably chilly day.
