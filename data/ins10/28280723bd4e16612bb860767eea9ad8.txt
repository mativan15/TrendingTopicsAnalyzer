The Dollar General Market in the Westpark Shopping Center is closing July 18, according to employees. Signs on the front window announce the news.

The Dollar General Market is closing July 18 in the West Park Shopping Center, one of the handful of businesses still bringing people into the shopping center.

Signs on the store windows this week spread the news that the business is closing at the shopping center along Park Avenue West.

The Dollar General media department acknowledged receiving the News Journal email last week requesting information about the market closing, but no one from the corporate media office responded to requests for comments via phone and email.
