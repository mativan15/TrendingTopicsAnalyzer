The dance floor has emptied and the reviews are in. ABBA Voyage, the Swedish pop icons' computer-generated concert extravaganza that opened in London this week, has been acclaimed as a triumph. The 95-minute, 20-song show sees Benny, Björn, Agnetha and Frida brought back to life as virtual (and much younger) musicians using the very latest motion capture technology. 
The ‘ABBAtar' show is, according to my colleague Neil McCormick, a 'mind-blowing hi-tech celebration.' Another review said that the concert 'really does look like the future of music'.
