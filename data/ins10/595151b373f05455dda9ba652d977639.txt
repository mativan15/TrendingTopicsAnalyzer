The president, however, vowed to not step in the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation.
'I'm not going to interfere with their critically important work,' Biden said.
Tuesday's meeting is the first since Powell was renominated by Biden to lead the central bank in November and comes two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the Senate.
