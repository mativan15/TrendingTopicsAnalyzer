A global price war for electric vehicles may be coming soon, where the price of an EV could fall to around $25,000, Ford's (F) CEO Jim Farley predicted.
Farley made the comments at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Wednesday, according to ABC News, where he said, 'our industry is definitely heading to a huge price war.'
Farley pointed out that the $25,000 price tag will democratize EVs as the materials to build these vehicles will cost around $18,000. According to Farley, cost reductions are coming through new battery technologies that will incorporate fewer precious metals and save time and labor to build the vehicles, in addition to cuts in distribution costs and advertising expenses.
