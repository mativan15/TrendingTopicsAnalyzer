With costs at an all-time high, Dickey's Barbecue Pit has taken down 50,000 square feet in Mesquite for a new manufacturing and distribution facility to streamline production for retail products.

The facility, which has been dubbed Wycliff Douglas Provisions, is expected to provide 350 new jobs to the community just east of Dallas.

The plant will provide, sausage, chicken breast, pre-smoked chicken wings, chicken tenders, and multiple retail products for Dickey's Barbecue Pit as the Dallas-based company looks to alleviate costs for owners and operators of the outpost.
