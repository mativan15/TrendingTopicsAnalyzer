Members of the House Jan. 6 committee hold their final scheduled public hearing on Oct. 13. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)

To the editor: About all the House Jan. 6 committee is likely to learn by subpoenaing former President Trump and having him testify is which of three stock responses he favors most:

"I take the 5th amendment."

"I don't recall."

"This investigation is a witch hunt."

OK, he may throw in an occasional attack on selected committee members, the better to stoke the demagogic drama he relishes.
