Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the Interpol to speed up Red Corner Notices against fugitive offenders to help eliminate safe haves for the terrorists, corrupt and criminals. Red Notices are issued by Interpol to locate a fugitive who has fled the country where he is wanted. A member country can arrest or deport an individual against whom such a notice is circulated by Interpol. Inaugurating the 90th General Assembly of the Interpol, the prime minister flagged the need for global cooperation to deal with safe havens in different parts of the world where the corrupt find a way to park the proceeds of crime.
