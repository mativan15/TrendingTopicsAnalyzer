By Will Feuer Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., ON Semiconductor Corp. and VICI Properties Inc. all rose at least 6% in after-hours trading Friday after S&P Global Inc. said the three companies will be added to the S&P 500 index. The addition of a stock to a major index can increase the stock's exposure to everyday investors, like those investing for retirement, who typically put money in broad indexes as opposed to individual stocks. VICI, a real-estate investment trust focused on gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations, will replace Cerner Corp.
