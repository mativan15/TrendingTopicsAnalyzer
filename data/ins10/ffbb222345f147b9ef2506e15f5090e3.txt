The outlook for crypto banks is surprisingly strong given a drop-off in customer deposits in the wake of depressed prices and low volatility , according to JPMorgan. Both Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank , two commercial banks that serve the cryptocurrency industry, reported their third-quarter financial results this week. On each bank's respective payments platform, there was a drop in customer deposits as well as transfer volumes thanks to the fall in crypto prices and activity over the last two quarters.
