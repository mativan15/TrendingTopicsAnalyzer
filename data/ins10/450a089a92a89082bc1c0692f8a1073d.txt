A four-decade-old technical body, the Central Organisation for Modernisation of Workshops (COFMOW), which specialises in procurement of machines for Railways, will be shut down from December 1, the Railway Ministry ordered on Tuesday.
The decision is in line with the policy to shed flab by shutting down government organisations in Railways that have outlived their utility, as per last year's recommendations by Sanjeev Sanyal, member of the PM's Economic Advisory Council.
COFMOW was set up in 1979 to modernise various Railways production units and other workshops that were transitioning from mechanical machines to more advanced, computer-controlled machines.
