A man from Blackburn has been jailed for more than 12 years for his role in a £40 million Encrochat drug gang.

Sohail Ali was a 'trusted lieutenant' for Irtiza Bashir who was responsible for buying and selling multi kilograms of cocaine and heroin. Both men were arrested as part of Operation Venetic - an international investigation into the use of a mobile encryption service, commonly referred to as Encrochat.

38-year-old Ali, of Revidge Road, Blackburn, used the device handle 'LIQUIDEMU' which he used to arrange the delivery and collection of drugs.
