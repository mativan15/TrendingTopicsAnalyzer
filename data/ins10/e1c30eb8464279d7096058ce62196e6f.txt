Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is aware of the scrutiny he received last month after the team shared a video that featured him launching what appeared to be a wobbly throw to receiver Tyreek Hill.
Although some football fans found the hype video to be chock full of evidence depicting Tagovailoa's arm strength struggles, the former first-round pick is now hitting back at those chastising his play from behind a screen.
'Twitter warriors, keyboard warriors, whatever you want to call them, they're not out here practicing with us working hard,' Tagovailoa told reporters Thursday at Miami's scheduled OTAs.
