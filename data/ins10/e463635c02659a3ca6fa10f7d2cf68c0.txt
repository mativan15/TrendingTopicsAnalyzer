Poole's career has taken an unusual path. He had one of the worst statistical seasons in recent NBA history as a rookie in 2019. A quick dip in the G-League appeared to lead to some improvement, but he got off to a rough start yet again in 2020-21. About a quarter of the way through that season, the Warriors demoted Poole back to their G-League affiliate, where he teamed up with Lin in the starting backcourt.

For the second straight season, Poole made significant strides in his development against weaker competition and was much more productive after rejoining the Warriors, where he emerged as the team's best bench scorer to close out the 2021 season.
