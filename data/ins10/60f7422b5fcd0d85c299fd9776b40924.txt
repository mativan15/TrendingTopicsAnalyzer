Elon Musk has reportedly told Tesla employees that they must put in a minimum of 40 hours per week in the office if they also wish to do remote work. In a screen grab of an e-mail allegedly sent by the billionaire on Tuesday, the Tesla CEO said that 40 hours is "less than we ask of factory workers." "If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly," he wrote, according to the screenshot, which was shared on Twitter.
