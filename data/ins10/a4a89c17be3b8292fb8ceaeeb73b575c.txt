Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman's health "has continued to improve" and he is speaking "without cognitive deficits" months after a stroke, the Democrat's primary-care physician wrote in a report released Wednesday by his campaign. "Overall, Lt. Governor Fetterman is well and shows strong commitment to maintaining good fitness and health practices. He has no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office," wrote Clifford Chen, a Pittsburgh-area doctor who began serving as Fetterman's physician in May, according to the report.
