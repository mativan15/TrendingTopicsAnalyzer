The big shareholder groups in PSC Insurance Group Limited (ASX:PSI) have power over the company. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

PSC Insurance Group has a market capitalization of AU$1.6b, so we would expect some institutional investors to have noticed the stock.
