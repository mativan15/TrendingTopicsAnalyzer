(June 17, 2020) On June 12, 2020, the governments of Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore signed the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) in an online ceremony, with e-signature tools utilized.
Negotiations for the agreement were launched in May 2019 when the trade ministers of the three countries met and 'discussed ways to maximize the contributions that digitalization can provide to [their] economies and how to take advantage of the opportunities offered by trade in the digital era.' The DEPA was intended to 'deepen and strengthen cooperation in digital areas, establish new international approaches for digital trade issues, and explore new frontiers  in the digital economy, such as digital identities, e-payments, cross-border data flows and artificial intelligence.
