Ricky Hatton insists boxers are using banned substances 'a lot' as the sport recovers from a week of shame. onor Benn returned an adverse finding of clomifene in a Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) drugs test ahead of his super fight against Chris Eubank Jr. The fight was eventually postponed two days before the first bell, with the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) maintaining the contest was 'prohibited'. Benn maintains his innocence as a 'clean athlete' and has vowed to clear his name.
