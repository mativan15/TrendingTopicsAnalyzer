SANTA CLARA — If the 49ers wanted Christian McCaffrey, they could have taken him with the No. 3 draft pick in 2017. Instead, they took his Stanford classmate, Solomon Thomas.

Well, they 49ers got a mulligan.

McCaffrey is coming to the 49ers via a trade with the Carolina Panthers, ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported Thursday night, well ahead of the NFL's Nov. 1 trade deadline approaches. A league source confirmed the trade.

In return, the 49ers will give up four draft picks, none of which are of the first-round variety, in part because their 2023 first-round pick was included in last year's package to Miami to move up for Trey Lance.
