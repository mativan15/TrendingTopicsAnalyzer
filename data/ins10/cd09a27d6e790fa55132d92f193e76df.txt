Nebraska agreed not to fire former football coach Scott Frost for any NCAA violations stemming from an investigation into the program's impermissible use of an analyst in an on-field coaching role, according to an amendment to Frost's contract outlining certain metrics that would allow him to remain in the position beyond the 2022 season.

The school released the amendment Friday to USA TODAY following a ruling by a Nebraska state court judge, who ordered its release as part of a lawsuit filed by USA TODAY against Nebraska under the umbrella of its corporate parent Gannett.
