Crypto spams and bots have plagued the internet, revealed a new report by crypto intelligence provider LunarCrush. For the crypto industry, Twitter is the go-to social media platform, and it is flooded with spam and bots. There has been an estimated 1,374 per cent increase in Twitter spam volume over the past two years, as per the company.
This report comes as Billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion was put on hold earlier this month after Musk made a number of statements around this issue of bots, the latest being the claim about 20 per cent of users are fake, but he's now insisting on more evidence from Twitter to back its claims that only 5 per cent of users are spam or fake.
