A particular lyric, which is performed every single evening while Hamilton is on in the West End, had the audience cheering and laughing for the first time last night (20 October).The resignation of prime minister Liz Truss on Thursday 20 October, after just six weeks in the role, gave one of the lines in the show a whole new meaning.In a part in the musical where King George III (played by Joel Montague) is asking who is going to be in charge of America after George Washington's retirement, he sings: 'Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge? If so, who's next?'In a recording of the moment by a Twitter user called Matt, the audience can be heard cheering and laughing at the lyric.
