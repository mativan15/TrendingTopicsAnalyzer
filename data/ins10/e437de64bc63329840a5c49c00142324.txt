This game was close until it got ugly in the second half, but Florida really started slipping at the end of the second quarter. After a gift of a muffed punt helped UF keep pace with LSU at 21 points each, the Gators had a chance to drive down the field with 5:55 left on the clock and take the lead before halftime and blew it. A three-and-out gave LSU the ball, and Jayden Daniels found Jaray Jenkins on a free play — Princeley Umanmielen jumped early — for a touchdown.
LSU got the ball to start the second half of the game and quickly found the endzone after a 50-yard run put them in the red zone.
