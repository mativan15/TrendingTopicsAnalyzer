U.S. stock indexes traded lower on Wednesday afternoon in choppy trade, as investors weighed Netflix's surprisingly positive earnings report and monitored a continued rise in Treasury yields. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 551 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 rose 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.4%. The S&P 500 was up 4% from its 2022 closing low through Tuesday but remained down 22% for the year to date. Stocks struggled out of the gate after back-to-back gains as worries about stubbornly high inflation counteracted positive news on company earnings.
