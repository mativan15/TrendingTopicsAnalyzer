Oct. 19—PLATTSBURGH — Morrisonville resident Jerry Bates patronized Senior Planet Exploration Center North Country when it first opened its doors, and he was there for the grand reopening Friday with a new brand, Senior Planet from AARP.

"I have been a long time attendee," Bates, 88, said.

"Every program that they offer, I try to take part in if it meets my time schedule. They're widely diversified hours, so a lot of times you can get it. Then, you also have the one-on-one interviews that you can do if you have a special problem.
