An report has suggested inclusion of fuel under GST to cushion from the impact of fluctuating revenue due to volatility in oil prices. "The ultimate solution to reduce the complexities in oil tax structure and bring down extreme volatility in oil revenues due to volatile crude price would be to bring it under the ambit of GST," the report said. This is not the first time that the experts have suggested inclusion of fuel under the GST regime. Speaking to Mint, Bibek Debroy, chairman of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Economic Advisory Council (EAC-PM), also advocated bringing fuel under the GST.
