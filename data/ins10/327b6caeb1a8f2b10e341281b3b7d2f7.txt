OPINION:

One of the most hypocritical and downright diabolical facets of the pro-abortion lobby is the penchant some of its adherents have for exulting pro-abortion narratives, lionizing these stories into hero narratives while excluding divergent experiences.

Many on the left love to relish these macabre accounts under the guise of opening the floodgates for women to tell their stories, yet other females who regret their abortions are almost always left in the dust.

It seems only some people are worthy of having their stories told, while others — simply by virtue of having a different experience — are denigrated, downgraded or ignored.
