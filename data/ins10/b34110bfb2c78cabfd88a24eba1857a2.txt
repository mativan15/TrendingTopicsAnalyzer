UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — A new ethane cracker plant in western Pennsylvania may transform the Ohio River Valley into an industrial hub, but its footprint will extend far beyond the energy sector. Jenn Baka, associate professor of geography at Penn State, received a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award to examine the cracker plant's impact on humans' relationship to the environment and environmental policymaking.
The cracker plant will take ethane, a chemical byproduct of shale gas development, and transform it into components used to make plastics.
