Cann: "Taste So Good' (The Cann Song)" Hi gay! Yes, this is technically a sponsored video, but it's camp enough to be a full Pride Month bop. (Plus, we're not getting any ad money from it.) Written by Leland and featuring vocals by Hayley Kiyoko, Vincint, MNEK, and Kesha, this song actually has me nodding in gay appreciation — mainy because the music video features queer faves Gus Kenworthy, Kornbread, Willow Pill, Kerri Colby, Patricia Arquette, Jorgeous, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and more. The collab aims to, as Weedmaps puts it in the description, 'not only say ‘gay,' but scream it from the rooftops.
