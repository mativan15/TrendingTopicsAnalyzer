Construction of a vaikuntha dhamam (graveyard) meant for use by Reddy and Vaishya communities was completed in Kurthivada village in Papannapet mandal of Medak district about a year ago, but last rites are being performed outside the premises. Reason? Money matters. Payment to some contractors who had taken up the job of constructing the graveyard is pending.
