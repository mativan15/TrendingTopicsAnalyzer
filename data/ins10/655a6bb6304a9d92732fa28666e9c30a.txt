The BBC Breakfast presenter has been an anchor for the broadcaster since 2008 when she first joined the BBC Working Lunch Team. Since 2010 she has presented the morning bulletins with co-host Charlie Stayt and isn't afraid to call out guests when she disagrees with their views or offers a counter-argument. However, she recently admitted she was told to "toughen up" before taking the role as she used to be "too sensitive".Being on the TV each morning with the eyes of the nation on you to deliver the latest news can come with certain challenges such as trolling on social media.
