Canadians have flocked to gun stores this week, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau proposed a freeze on the sale of handguns following the mass shooting in Texas last month.
If approved, the plans are expected to come into force in the autumn, and come after a ban on assault-style firearms in May 2020.
Mr Trudeau said: ‘One Canadian killed by gun violence is one too many. I've seen all too well the tragic cost that gun violence has in our communities across the country.
‘We're proposing some of the strongest measures in Canadian history to keep guns out of our communities and build a safer future for everyone.
