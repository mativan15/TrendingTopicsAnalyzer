‘That's from a religion I created 10 years ago,' says Tat Vision, pointing to the corner of his studio where a giant papier-mache spider lies draped over a cross. 'It will catch on one day,' he adds casually, as I negotiate my way through all the other oddities cluttering every surface of this workspace in central Birmingham, from Freddie Mercury masks to wobbly towers of VHS tapes and retro board games.Yet nothing else here is so strange as what is standing proudly in the centre of the studio. If you cast your mind back to 2020, you may remember a photograph that went viral, known as the Four Lads in Jeans meme.
