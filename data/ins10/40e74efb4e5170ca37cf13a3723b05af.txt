I've been sporting a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 for a few years now. Of all the wearables I've used, that watch really hit the sweet spot. It was very easy to use, highly functional and offered plenty of options. It wasn't, however, terribly reliable. I'd set alarms or timers, and they wouldn't go off. The split time functionality wouldn't always give me my times while running, and the battery life was starting to show its age.
