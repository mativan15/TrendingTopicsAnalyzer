Published: 01:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 01:19 EDT, 18 October 2022 Alex Ovechkin scored his first two goals of the season, and his second assist of the night set up Conor Sheary for a tiebreaking tally to highlight the Washington Capitals' four-goal third period in a 6-4 comeback win over the visiting Vancouver Canucks on Monday. With Washington down 4-2 at 1:16 into the third, Dylan Strome got enough of his stick on the puck, amid a power play, to beat Vancouver netminder Thatcher Demko (24 saves).
