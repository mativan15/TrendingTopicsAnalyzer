Think of Glastonbury, and the themes of peace, love (and mud) probably spring to mind.
The idea of the ‘hippy dippy' festival hiking up the ticket price goes against everything Glasto-goers believe in… right?
That's certainly what many people thought when they read that they'd have to fork out £340 (up from £250) for 2023, with some branding it a ‘joke'.
But when I heard the news, I didn't balk or groan. ‘That's still a bargain!' I said to my husband. ‘Mind you, I'd pay double that again!', and I have Glasto buddies who I know feel the same.
