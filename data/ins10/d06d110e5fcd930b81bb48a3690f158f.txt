Meta Platforms Inc's META-Q independent oversight board said on Thursday that starting this month it can decide on applying warning screens, marking content as 'disturbing' or 'sensitive'.The board, which already has the ability to review user appeals to remove content, said it would be able to make binding decisions to apply a warning screen when 'leaving up or restoring qualifying content', including to photos and videos.Separately in its quarterly transparency report, the board said it received 347,000 appeals from Facebook and Instagram users around the world during the second quarter ended June 30.
