Former Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has alleged that the government is not showing any interest in opening the Mother and Child Hospital since it wants to promote the CPI(M) controlled cooperative hospital in Kanhangad. He was inaugurating a protest organised by the Youth Congress in front of the Mother and Child Hospital in Kanhangad on Monday. Despite the inauguration of the hospital by former Health Minister K.K. Shylaja more than a year ago, the hospital is yet to be opened.Mr. Chennithala, referring to the order allowing local bodies to donate money to the cooperative hospital controlled by the CPI(M), said that the government is more interested in diverting public money to such hospitals.
