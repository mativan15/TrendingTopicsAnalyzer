Germany is establishing a special €100 billion fund to upgrade its underequipped armed forces. Here's what the money will be spent on.

Russia's war on Ukraine led the German government to reassess the state of this country's armed forces. It had long been well-known that the Bundeswehr is lacking equipment. Now, military experts point out that the country had not a single combat-ready brigade to defend German territory. 
In response, the government has joined forces with the main opposition parties to change the constitution and allow €100 billion ($107 billion) in additional debt to upgrade the military — an unprecedented occurrence in the history of the Federal Republic.
