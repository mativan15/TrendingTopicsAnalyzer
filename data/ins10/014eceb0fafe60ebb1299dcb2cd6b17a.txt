Just like storm chases jumping into their truck to go after a weather event, Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment are in the process of fast-tracking Twisters, a sequel to the 1996 disaster film that starred Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, Deadline reports.Twisters is in early development, but producers are hoping to see filming begin as early as this spring. The script comes via The Revenant writer Mark L. Smith; Steven Spielberg reportedly pushed to get the film moving after reading the script.
