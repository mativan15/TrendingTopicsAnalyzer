Update 10/14/2022: A Space for the Unbound has found a new publisher for its console versions after developers Toge Productions and Mojiken Studio accused previous publisher PQube of manipulative behaviour and terminated their contract.The two developers alongside PQube and new publisher Chorus Worldwide released a statement on Twitter (below) announcing that A Space for the Unbound's console release is back on track and that a specific date would be revealed soon.The four parties reached an agreement regarding the handing over of rights, and "whilst there have been commercial differences in respect of some of the terms", the statement confirmed that all grant funding (that caused the initial dispute) had been handed over to Toge Productions and that PQube had been fully supportive in the transition.
