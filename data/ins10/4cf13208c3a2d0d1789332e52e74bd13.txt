Lackawanna [Junior] College football coach Mark Duda, the man who helped bring former University of Miami Outland Trophy winner Bryant McKinnie to the Hurricanes, figured a long time ago that Colbie Young might be Tyler Van Dyke's new favorite target.

'Spectacular, right?'' Duda told the Miami Herald on Tuesday, three days after the 6-5, 215-pound Young, in just his second game catching passes for UM, pulled in nine for 101 yards and a one-handed touchdown to help lead the Canes to a 20-14 win at Virginia Tech.
