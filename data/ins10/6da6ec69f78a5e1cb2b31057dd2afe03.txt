NEW YORK – Aaron Judge has brought his record-breaking power to the postseason.

The Yankee outfielder crushed his second home run in three games on Tuesday in the second inning against the Cleveland Guardians. His two-out, solo shot off Cleveland reliever Sam Hentges gave the Yanks and starter Nestor Cortes a 4-0 lead in the decisive Game 5 of the American League Division Series.

It was Judge's fourth home run in a winner-take-all postseason game and breaks a tie with Troy O'Leary for the most in major league history.
