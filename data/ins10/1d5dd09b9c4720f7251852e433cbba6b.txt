The Western Bulldogs have delisted 'heart and soul' veteran Mitch Wallis after two injury-plagued seasons marred his last two years at the club.Wallis, son of club legend Stephen, missed the Bulldogs' 2016 premiership win and 2021 grand final appearance during his 12 years at the club.He also managed just 11 games in the past two seasons as a result of injury and poor form, playing just six in 2021 despite being the club's vice-captain.The 29-year-old played just five matches in 2022 after signing a one-year deal but said playing for the Bulldogs gave him 'so much happiness but also a hell of a lot of perspective on what's important in life'.
