AgenciesThe remake of Resident Evil 4 is looking good and ready to impress the fans. Despite that, the argument remains that there was really a need to create a remake of the original. It is considered one of the best games ever made and it is freely available on many platforms. However, many fans believe that Resident Evil - Code: Veronica from the 2000s is more deserving of a remake. Despite the high demand, Capcom continues to have little interest in making the remake of Resident Evil – Code: Veronica.
