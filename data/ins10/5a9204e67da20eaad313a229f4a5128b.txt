Constitutional Court dismisses Kaesong firm's lawsuit against suspension SEOUL, May 31 (Yonhap) -- The Constitutional Court ruled Tuesday the state does not have to enact laws to compensate businesses that operated in the now-shuttered Kaesong industrial zone in North Korea. The court dismissed a lawsuit one of the Kaesong companies filed against the government, claiming it breached its constitutional duty to legislate laws to provide compensation for property rights violations. The court said the companies decided to do business in North Korea under their own responsibility, knowing their investment was at risk of unpredictable damage depending on inter-Korean relations.
