Diablo Immortal is the free-to-play mobile entry in the franchise launched early on Android and iOS Wednesday across the globe -- except for the Netherlands and Belgium. The reason behind those countries not having access to the new game are the laws preventing the selling of loot boxes. A post on the Diablo Immortal subreddit from May 23 had a screenshot of a reply from a Blizzard Entertainment employee in Europe who confirmed that players in Belgium and the Netherlands won't be able to install the game when it's released.
