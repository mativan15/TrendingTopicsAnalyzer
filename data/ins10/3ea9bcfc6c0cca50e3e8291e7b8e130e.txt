Oct. 16—Maine Democrats and their allies are outspending Republicans 4 to 1 in an effort to retain control of both the House and Senate during a high-stakes election year that is widely expected to favor their opponents.

If successful, Democrats would maintain the ability to elect constitutional officers, including the secretary of state and attorney general. And if Gov. Janet Mills also wins reelection over Republican Paul LePage, the party would have the power to implement policies on issues such as abortion, taxes, health care and energy.
