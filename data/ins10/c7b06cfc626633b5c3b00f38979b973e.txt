Arsenal have the opportunity to finally replace Aaron Ramsey following the announcement that Corentin Tolisso will depart Bayern Munich for free this summer upon the expiry of his contract. The Gunners are in the market for a new midfielder and could now move to capture the Frenchman, who would provide the sort of goal threat that has been missing since Ramsey left for Juventus back in 2019.Bayern Munich confirmed on Monday that Tolisso will be departing the club this summer after five years in Bavaria, with the two parties having failed to strike an agreement over a new deal.
