A chain of BBQ spots has closed its only location inside Route 495--and its only remaining outlet in all of New England.According to a source (Aron Levy), Dickey's Barbecue Pit in Andover is no longer in business, with a check on the chain's website indicating that the Main Street location has indeed been removed from the site. Dickey's first opened in Andover a bit more than a year ago, and about ten years ago we had reported that the chain was looking to open a couple of locations in the Greater Boston area; it appears that the only other outlet in the state was in Seekonk, but that one is shuttered as well.
