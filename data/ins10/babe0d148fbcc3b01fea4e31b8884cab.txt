Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Modi to 'take stock of the reasonable fear & discontent among the non-Hindi speaking states following the aggressive attempts of the Union Govt to impose Hindi by all possible avenues.'
The DMK leader called such attempts 'impractical, divisive', and urged the PM to make all languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution ‘official languages'.

Such impractical, divisive attempts will put non-hindi states people in a disadvantageous position & jeopardise the spirit of the union – state relations.
