Published: 16:25 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 16:25 EDT, 20 October 2022 The White House said Wednesday that Iran was not only selling lethal drones to Russia but had 'assisted' Russia as it carried out attacks from annexed Crimea. White House national security spokesman John Kirby leveled the startling allegation after Russia had carried out a string of attacks on civilian infrastructure using what videos showed and Ukrainian officials identified as the Iranian drones. 'We can confirm that Russia's military personnel that are based in Crimea have been piloting Iranian UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], using them to conduct strikes across Ukraine, including strikes against Kyiv in just recent days,' Kirby said.
