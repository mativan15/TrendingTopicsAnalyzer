The DMK's first goal is to emerge victorious in all the 39 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone Puducherry segment as well in the 2024 Parliamentary election, party President and Chief Minister M K Stalin said here on Sunday.
The next goal is to facilitate formation of a new government at the Centre that is committed to the principles of social justice and federalism, he said.
'During the run-up to the (Lok Sabha) election (in 2024), we will take political steps aimed at it,' he said in a video-message.
