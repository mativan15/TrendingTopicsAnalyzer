A Ferrari driver and passenger were victims of a knife attack in Hong Kong early on Friday (Oct 21) morning, with police on the hunt for at least six black-clad suspects who had rammed the vehicle before carrying out their assault. The driver and his passenger, both aged 27, tried to hide in their car but the knife-wielding gangsters pulled open the Ferrari doors and attacked the pair. The violent incident occurred in the Pat Heung area of Yuen Long shortly before 3am. An initial investigation showed the gang first used one of their three vehicles – a Toyota sedan – to ram the black Ferrari on Kam Tin Road near the junction with Ying Ho Road, according to a police source.
