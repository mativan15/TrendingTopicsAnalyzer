Amazon, already the biggest online retailer in the world, isn't content with total global domination of commerce. Instead, the company is constantly seeking to expand into new realms. It has a streaming service, a shipping and logistics arm, its own pharmacy, owns the cloud through its web services, runs the largest organic grocery chain in the U.S., and so on and so forth. In a lot of ways, Amazon is inextricable from day-to-day modern life.So, obviously, the next logical question is: Why not insurance? The company is launching an online portal for purchasing home and personal property insurance for customers in the United Kingdom.
