Image source, EPAPakistan's election commission has disqualified ex-PM Imran Khan from holding public office in a case the former cricketer has previously described as politically motived. Mr Khan had been accused of not sharing details of presents from foreign dignitaries and proceeds from their alleged sale. The gifts included Rolex watches, a ring and a pair of cuff links. His lawyers say they will challenge the commission's verdict in the high court. The unanimous decision by a five-member panel of the election commission is a huge setback for the former premier, says the BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan.
