Pakistan is expected to reach an agreement with the IMF next month to resurrect an enhanced bailout package to support the cash-strapped country's sagging economy, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has said. Pakistan has repeatedly been seeking international aid to support its failing economy. 
The talks with the International Monetary Fund are being held in the Qatari capital Doha. 
He said that the country is projected to need USD 36-37 billion in foreign financing in the next fiscal year. Speaking at a webinar on the "National Dialogue on Economy: The Way Forward for Pakistan", organised by Nutshell Conferences and Corporate Pakistan Group on Saturday, Ismail revealed that at present the government was not considering raising fresh foreign debt from the global capital market and commercial banks after the country's international bonds lost almost one-third of their value, while their yields went up significantly, The Express Tribune reported.
