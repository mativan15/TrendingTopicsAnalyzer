Americans are worried sick about their finances.

The signs are abundant that Americans are deeply anxious about their financial condition, and that problem isn't going away anytime soon.

According to a recent study by the Financial Health Network, the proportion of Americans deemed 'financially healthy' fell for the first time in the five years the FHN has been tracking money and mental health.

The survey noted the percentage of Americans who are financially healthy fell from 34% in 2021 to 31% in 2022.
