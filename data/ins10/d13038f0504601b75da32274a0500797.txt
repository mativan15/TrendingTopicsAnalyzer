In a bid to rid consumers of having to deal with those universally-hated automated voices on the phone, Spain's government is presenting a bill that would make it obligatory for companies to have a real person in customer services pick up the call.The bill, which includes a number of other related measures - such as limiting the time it takes to answer the call to a maximum of three minutes - was proposed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and backed by the country's ruling left-wing coalition in November.
