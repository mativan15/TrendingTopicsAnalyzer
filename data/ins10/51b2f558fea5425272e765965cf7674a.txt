The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday announced it's investigating Mississippi's use of federal funds in the lead-up to a water crisis over the summer that left the state's capital city of Jackson without potable water for several weeks. According to NBC News: The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether Mississippi officials handled federal funds in a way that discriminated against residents of the state's predominately Black capital city, which has been roiled by a series of drinking water crises and service outages in recent years.
