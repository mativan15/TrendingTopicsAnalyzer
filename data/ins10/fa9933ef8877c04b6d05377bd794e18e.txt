Stock futures were little changed in overnight trading Sunday after a losing week as investors continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat surging inflation. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 30 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both flat. The overnight action followed another disappointing week for investors as the major averages suffered modest losses. The blue-chip Dow fell 0.9% for its ninth negative week in 10, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.
