A controversy erupted after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday inaugurated a railway overbridge at Kamarkundu Railway Station in Hooghly 'without extending an invitation' to Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for the event.
The Eastern Railway has alleged that the state government 'ignored' its letter regarding joint inauguration of the bridge, sources said.
The Eastern Railway had written that it would be 'fitting if the Railway Minister jointly inaugurated the bridge with Banerjee,' underlining that 60 per cent of the project cost was borne by the railways.
