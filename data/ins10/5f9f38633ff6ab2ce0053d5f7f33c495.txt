And after playing six NFL seasons without sacking a quarterback, Ramsey is now a pass-rushing weapon with a sack in back-to-back games for the defending champions (3-3) as they hit their bye week.

'I definitely still get a little reaction out of them,' Ramsey said of his teammates' sideline celebrations of his sacks. 'It's just funny that I've been playing (this long) and I haven't gotten sacks, and I've got two in a row now.'

Ramsey's latest standout season is one of several bright spots on his side of the ball for the Rams, who are awakening memories of 2020 with one of the NFL's most effective defensive units backing up an inconsistent offense.
