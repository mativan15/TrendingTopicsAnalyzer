The Wrap For some theater fans, the 1936 production of the 'Voodoo Macbeth' (as it became commonly known) is the stuff of legend. Funded by the Federal Theater Project, which gave financial aid to the struggling theater community during the Great Depression, the 'Voodoo Macbeth' starred a cast of black performers in an imaginative new staging of William Shakespeare's so-called 'Scottish Play,' set in Haiti in the late 1800s.The show was a mammoth success, critically acclaimed and financially successful, and not for nothing, it was one of the more noteworthy early accomplishments of a 20-year-old thespian and director named Orson Welles.
