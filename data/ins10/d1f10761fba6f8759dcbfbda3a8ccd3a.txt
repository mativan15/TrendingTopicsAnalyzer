It's been a turbulent start 2022 for the major market averages, and an especially difficult year for the restaurant sector. While a few names have given up ground grudgingly, this has not been the case for Portillo's (NASDAQ:PTLO), which has massively underperformed the market and its peer group (EATZ). In fact, the stock has been cut in half in six months, partially attributed to continued headwinds for restaurant operators. The good news is that much of this negativity looks priced into the stock, but at $18.
