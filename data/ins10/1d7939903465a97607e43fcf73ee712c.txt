Olemedia/E+ via Getty Images Lithium is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft and silvery-white alkali metal. Lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements because of its relative nuclear instability. Lithium's nuclei are very light, and the metal is an exception, as heavier nuclei tend to be less common. With the lowest density of all metals, lithium is a critical component in heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel, and aluminum products, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.
