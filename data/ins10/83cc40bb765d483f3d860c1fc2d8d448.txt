American Airlines is shaking up its premium cabin offerings, phasing out its first-class cabin to instead focus on business-class seats in response to shifting consumer demand.Vasu Raja, American's chief commercial officer, confirmed the move to investors on a Thursday morning earnings call.'Yes, the first class will not exist on the [Boeing 777] or for that matter at American Airlines, for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it,' said Raja. 'The quality of the business class seat has improved so much, and frankly by removing it, we can go provide more business class seats, which is our customers most want and are most willing to pay for.
