A former Wall Street crook with ties to the Mafia allegedly set up two dozen fake cancer charities across the country and scammed donors out of more than $150,000, prosecutors charge.
Starting in 2014, Ian Hosang, 63, of Staten Island, began establishing fake non-profits with legitimate-sounding names, including 'American Cancer Society for Children' and 'United Way of New York Inc.,' but donations never went to medical research or community outreach, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.
