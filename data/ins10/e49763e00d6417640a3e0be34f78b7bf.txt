Oct. 16—Visitors to the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park took a deep dive into archaeology Saturday morning with the park's Archaeology Fair to celebrate Texas Archaeology Month. The fair featured booths with hands-on activities and presentations for attendees from local and state organizations like the Brownsville Historical Association, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley's Community Historical Archaeology Project with Schools (CHAPS) and Texas Parks and Wildlife.

The park's Chief of Interpretation, Daniel Ibarra, was excited to welcome the archaeologically curious back to the park for their first in-person fair since 2019.
