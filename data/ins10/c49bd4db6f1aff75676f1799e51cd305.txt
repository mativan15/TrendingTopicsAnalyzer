Of the more than 7,000 state lawmakers across the country, only 5% are mothers with young children at home, new research shows.

The numbers are even more paltry for groups typically underrepresented in government, according to a report from the Vote Mama Foundation, a nonprofit group that researches the political participation of mothers. Of the 7,383 people serving as state legislators nationwide, less than 1% are Black or Indigenous moms with kids under 18, the data show. Yet, 86% of American women are mothers by the time they're 44, according to the Pew Research Center.
