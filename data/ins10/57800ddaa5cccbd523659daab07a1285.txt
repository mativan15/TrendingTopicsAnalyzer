UK businesses must start taking cyber crime more seriously and do more – including working more closely with the Government – to protect themselves, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has said.Nadhim Zahawi, who is also the lead minister for cyber security, said companies must stop thinking of cyber security as 'an issue just for company IT departments' and treat it as a business priority.Mr Zahawi's comments come as figures show 1.6 million people were victims of cyber crime in the UK last year, with tens of thousands of businesses also targeted.
