ASHEVILLE - An overdue financial disclosure form appears to provide the "smoking gun" of an ethics violation by Rep. Madison Cawthorn and might indicate criminal activity, according to law, finance and ethics experts.

An ethics expert with the watchdog Campaign Legal Center and a director of the University of California, Los Angeles, Lowell Milken Institute for Business Law and Policy, reacted May 31 to a past-due financial transaction report recently filed by the Western North Carolina congressman.
