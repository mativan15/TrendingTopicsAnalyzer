The Justice Department filed injunctions against six companies on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration to stop the sale of unauthorized vaping products.

The complaints were filed Tuesday in the U.S. district courts corresponding to where each defendant is located.

The filed complaints allege that 'the defendants caused tobacco products to become adulterated and misbranded while held for sale after shipment of one or more of their components in interstate commerce,' the DOJ wrote.

The six defendants failed to submit premarket authorization applications to the FDA, and have 'continued to illegally manufacture, sell, and distribute their products, despite previous warning from the FDA that they were in violation of the law,' the FDA said.
