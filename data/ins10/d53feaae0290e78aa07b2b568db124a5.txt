Giorgia Meloni is on course to form a government in Italy as early as the weekend after defeating a power play by her ally Silvio Berlusconi in a spat seen as a humiliation for the former prime minister.Summoned to her office for a 70-minute meeting, Berlusconi, 86, emerged to claim he was fully backing Meloni to become Italy's first female prime minister, days after he described her as 'patronising, overbearing, arrogant and offensive'.Meloni's Brothers of Italy became the largest party at last month's elections but needs backing from Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's League parties to achieve a parliamentary majority — prompting tough talks over assigning cabinet posts.
