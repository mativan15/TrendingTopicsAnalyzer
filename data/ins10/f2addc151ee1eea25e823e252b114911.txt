Cats are curious creatures, and while some of their quirks can be entertaining at first, they can quickly start to become a problem.

In a post on Reddit, a user shared a video of a cat drinking from a water cooler, saying: "That's one way to drink water."

Another user pointed out that this was clearly a regular occurrence as the owners had placed a towel around the base of the cooler to mop up the moggy's mess.
