CEBU
– Over 3,700 workers who lost their jobs at the Mactan Economic Zone in
Lapu-Lapu City received financial aid from the Department of Social Welfare and
Development (DSWD). DSWD
said it released some P18.2 million to at least 3,744 retrenched workers of
Sports City Incorporated. 'The displaced workers received cash aid and family
food packs through the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation during the
convergence activity organized by several offices to assist the individuals
affected by the closure of the factory,' DSWD said.
