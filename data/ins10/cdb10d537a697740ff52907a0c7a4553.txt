The USA Special Olympics lifted its COVID-19 vaccine requirement for athletes on June 2 after the state of Florida threatened to fine the organization $27.5 million for a violation of state law, according to a letter obtained by ABC News reporter Jay O'Brien.The Florida Department of Health argued that state law prohibited the organization from barring unvaccinated athletes from competing in the 2022 Special Olympics USA Games in Orlando this weekend. The department planned to assess 5,500 fines of $5,000 unless the Special Olympics pulled its vaccine mandate, per the letter.
