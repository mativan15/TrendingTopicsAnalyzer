As an avid horror reader, Nimbus Games founder Joseph Teng decided to mix hobby and work by developing horror games.

Launching in November this year, Malice is a two-player co-op horror game designed with an international audience in mind. The game is based on Japanese folklore (instead of Malaysian equivalents such as the Pontianak).

Drawing on his prior experience as an escape room designer, Malice is based on the escape room that he and his wife created previously, called Undying Temple.
