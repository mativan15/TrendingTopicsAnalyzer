COLOMBES, France, May 31, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Nippon Shokubai and Arkema (Paris:AKE) are joining forces to launch feasibility studies and establish a joint venture for the construction of an industrial plant for the production of LiFSI (Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide) ultrapure electrolyte salts, a key component of battery cells for electric mobility.

Ultrapure and high performance LiFSI electrolyte salts, a key component of car battery cells, will speed up the development of new electrolyte formulations for the next generations of batteries, including semi-solid and solid state batteries, by significantly increasing their power, stability, cycle life and recyclability, while reducing charging time in high or low temperature conditions.
