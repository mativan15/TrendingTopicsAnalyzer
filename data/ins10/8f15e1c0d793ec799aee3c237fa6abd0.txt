Data analytics company Amplitude (AMPL 4.04%) operates in a new field of enterprise software called Digital Optimization, where companies use data to guide their business decisions around digital products. The stock has fallen below its $50 direct listing price, sliding throughout this bear market after going public in September 2021.
The company recently held a conference and management unveiled new products and integrations for the company's software. These new products could be vital in driving investor returns moving forward.
