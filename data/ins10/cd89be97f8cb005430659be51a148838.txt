Unions will be stripped of their power to shut down the rail network as the government presses ahead this week with legislation forcing workers to provide a minimum service during strikes.The new measures, to be announced as the unions seek a mandate for another six months of industrial action, will limit future disruption for passengers, who have already endured 11 days of national strikes this year.
