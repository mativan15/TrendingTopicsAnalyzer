Wimbledon is set to replace its honours boards before The Championships begin next month in order to remove the titles ‘Miss' and ‘Mrs' in front of the names of female winners.Umpires at Wimbledon stopped using the terms 'Miss' and 'Mrs' when announcing scores during women's matches in 2019, but the practice has not been wiped out across the board.In the past, the chair umpire would use the titles at the end of each game during women's matches, and at the end of the match - something that did not happen during men's matches.
