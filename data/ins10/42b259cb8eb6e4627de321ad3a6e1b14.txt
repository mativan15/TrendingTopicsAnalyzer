'Across-the-board, there has been a clear trend that every sector has seen some bit of margin pressure. This will be a trend maybe for a quarter or more and that is where the growth expectations for the next year may need a little bit of trimming down,' says Santosh Kumar Singh, Fund Manager, Motilal Oswal AMC. 
If inflation indeed has peaked out or is in the process of peaking out, where do you see interest rate sensitive sectors 12 months far out – lenders, real estate, materials and autos also?
Inflation on an incremental basis might not be that big a concern for RBI because it is already at a high level but there is the need to increase rates from here on as well.
