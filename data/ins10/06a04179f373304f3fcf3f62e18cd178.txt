The Prime Minister has survived a meeting of the Cabinet without any ministers calling for her to quit but one of the Tories' key economic pledges appears to be under threat.
Ms Truss is no longer committed to keeping the pensions "triple lock", Downing Street has said, paving the way for payments to be squeezed again next year. 
The Prime Minister's spokesman refused to confirm that handouts will rise in line with inflation as previously promised, in what would be another humiliating U-turn. 
Pensioners will be £12,000 worse off over their retirement if the Government refuses to honour its state pension triple lock promise.
