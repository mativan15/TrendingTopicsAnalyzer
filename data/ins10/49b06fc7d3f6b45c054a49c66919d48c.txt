COVID-19 began impacting Lake County residents more than 2½ years ago, but when an additional $6 million of federal funds became available to assist renters who were behind in payments the Lake County Housing Authority was overwhelmed with applicants.

Ofelia Navarro, the authority's deputy director, said more than 100 people came through the doors the first four days seeking help. They experienced drops in income related to the coronavirus pandemic, but were initially able to stay current with rent and other expenses.
