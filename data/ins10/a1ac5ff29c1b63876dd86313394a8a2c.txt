Scammers are looking to take advantage of military members this Memorial Day as the nation remembers those who lost their lives serving their country, a watchdog group warns.

The Better Business Bureau is raising the alarm about 'a variety of schemes' targeting current and former members of the U.S. military.

The ruse is typically 'patriotic' or military-focused and includes phony rental properties, pricey life insurance policies and deceitful car sales, according to the group's website. High-interest military loans and buyouts offering cash in exchange for an injured veteran's benefits or pension payments are also common.
