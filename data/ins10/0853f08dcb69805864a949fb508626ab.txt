May 27—EAST HARTFORD — Goodwin University President Mark Scheinberg has agreed to retire from Goodwin and University of Bridgeport within five years, as part of a settlement with the federal government over allegations of loan fraud, U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut Vanessa Roberts Avery announced Friday.

In addition, Scheinberg and Stone Academy agreed to pay more than $1 million to resolve allegations that they violated the federal False Claims Act by concealing a series of money order payments made by Scheinberg to prevent certain loans from being counted in Stone Academy's student loan default rate, and for failing to disclose Stone Academy's actual, higher default rate to the U.
