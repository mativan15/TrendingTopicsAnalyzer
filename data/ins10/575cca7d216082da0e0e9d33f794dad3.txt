Using an ATM overseas isn't like withdrawing from a cash machine in the United States. If you rush to agree to terms without paying close attention, you could wind up losing hundreds of dollars on unnecessary conversion fees. I wish I had warned my brother about this when he visited me in Athens this summer. As we were exploring the historic Plaka district one hot afternoon, he excused himself to withdraw money from an automatic teller. A few minutes later, he returned with €1000. The cost: US$1219 (€1247 in today's exchange rate).
