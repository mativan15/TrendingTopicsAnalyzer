Oct. 19—James Franklin began this football season carrying a new 10-year, $75 million contract and fully aligned with the Penn State leadership.

But if anyone thought for one moment that Franklin suddenly became comfortable, they were mistaken. Maybe better than anyone else, he realizes how important this season is to him and the Nittany Lions.

He has been reminded frequently about going 11-11 the last two seasons, and rightfully so. He knows that in order to maintain a high level of recruiting and to please the high-rolling donors, he and Penn State can't afford another mediocre season.
