The Wrap 'Halloween Ends' has become the latest film that Universal has moved to a day-and-date release strategy with a simultaneous rollout in theaters and on its streaming service Peacock. But Christopher Landon, who directed the Blumhouse horror films 'Happy Death Day' and 'Freaky' for Universal, is sick of Hollywood using the strategy at the expense of directors.In a Twitter thread on Saturday, Landon talked about how 'Freaky,' his horror comedy about a teenage girl who switches bodies with a wanted serial killer, was released theatrically in November 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic but then released as a video-on-demand title less than a month later, in keeping with Universal's then-newly-signed agreement with major theater chains allowing them to release films on-demand as early as 17 days after theatrical release.
