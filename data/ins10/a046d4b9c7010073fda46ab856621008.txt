Normal service has been resumed. After several disruptive years in which the Turner Prize made headlines for all the wrong reasons, the annual award is once again doing what it was supposed to: showcasing excellence in contemporary British art.
This time, on the shortlist, there are no architecture collectives, artist-led charities, or community projects. Instead (how quaint!), the judges have picked four individuals who actually identify as artists: Heather Phillipson, the 44-year-old Londoner; Ingrid Pollard and Veronica Ryan, both 68 years old; and Canadian-born, 31-year-old Sin Wai Kin, whose Day-Glo-bright, 'intergalactic' videos fuse Chinese philosophy, sci-fi, and drag-queen subculture.
