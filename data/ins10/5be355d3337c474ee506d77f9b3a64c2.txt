Work can begin on the expansion of the controversial New Acland thermal coalmine after the Queensland government granted a water licence for the project.Stage three of New Hope Group's open-cut mine was on Thursday granted a water licence, clearing the final hurdle for work to start.New Hope exhausted its last coal reserves at the site, north-west of Toowoomba, in November and the company has made almost 300 workers redundant since 2019.The project will produce up to 7.5m tonnes of coal a year and extend the mine's life for 12 years.
