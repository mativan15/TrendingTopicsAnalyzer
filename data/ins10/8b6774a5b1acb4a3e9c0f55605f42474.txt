McDonald's limited edition Adult Happy Meal toys are selling for over $300,000 on eBay and other resale sites.

Can you set a price on nostalgia? McDonald's certainly made an attempt with the release of their Adult Happy Meals earlier this month, which have both received mixed reviews from eager buyers and frustrated McDonald's workers. Now, fast food connoisseurs are testing the limits even further; as reported by CNBC‘s 'MakeIt', toys from the limited edition meals are popping up on resale sites, listed for as much as $300,000.
