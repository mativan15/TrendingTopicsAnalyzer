An Oakland ice cream shop was burglarized by brazen thieves on Wednesday – mere months after the Northern California business was nearly destroyed in another robbery this summer. Flavor Brigade in Oakland's Dimond District was broken into by the burglars at 4:45 a.m on Wednesday. The business said the suspects stole their tie-dyed shirts, safe, cash and tools. Footage shows hooded suspects walking suspiciously outside the business before entering the store.The Mailbox, a nearby mailbox rental service, confirmed that the same suspects stole a key-copying machine and cash register on Wednesday morning.
