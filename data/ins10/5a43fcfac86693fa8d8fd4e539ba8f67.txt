A former Wall Street Journal reporter has sued a multinational law firm, some of its attorneys, and others for allegedly stealing his emails and spreading the messages to wrongly discredit him, leading to his firing.
In court documents, Jay Solomon, who was the newspaper's chief foreign affairs correspondent until he was axed in 2017, accused [PDF] 11 defendants including Philadelphia-based law firm Dechert of costing him his job and damaging his reputation.
They did this, in part, by paying Indian hack-for-hire firms Cyber Defense, BellTrox, and CyberRoot to break into the email account of Farhad Azim – one of Solomon's sources – to obtain private communications between the two men, it was claimed.
