Three large real estate projects in Pleasant Ridge and Walnut Hills that will bring an estimated $67 million in private investment to the region will receive key financing from the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority.

The Port's board unanimously approved capital lease structures for the Lester & Montgomery project, Paramount Launch and Peebles Apartments.

Under such deals, the Port becomes the formal owner of such projects, allowing the developers to avoid sales taxes on building materials.
