Unwanted body hair can be frustrating to deal with. Sure, you can wax and shave regularly, but who has time for all that? That's why a growing number of people are turning to intense pulse light (IPL) laser hair removal. This technology takes out unwanted hairs permanently, saving you time and money over the long run. While you can have this procedure done in a salon, it's going to cost you. Just a heads-up: Today only, Amazon is running a can't-miss sale on a top-rated home device: It's called the XSoul At-Home IPL Hair Removal device, and it's $125 off.
