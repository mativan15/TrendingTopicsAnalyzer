I don't have to think hard to find my most successful investment. It was 20 years ago -- this month -- that I bought a broken IPO by the name of Netflix (NFLX 13.09%). October 2002 also happened to be the same month that Netflix shares would hit an all-time low. I didn't nail the bottom, but I was close enough to make this jaw-dropping claim -- Netflix is a 540-bagger for me after Wednesday's blowout earnings performance. 
It's a bittersweet victory lap for me. I sold 80% of my stake within a couple of months, a mistake that literally cost me millions at the stock's peak last year.
