The Lions have won 4 straight regular-season games following losses of 20+ points. They'll go for 5 against Minnesota.

After Penn State's 41-17 loss to Michigan, coach James Franklin received a text from former tight end Mike Gesicki. It reminded Franklin of what happened in 2016.

The Lions fell at Michigan 49-10 and returned home to play Minnesota, as they do this week. Penn State defeated Minnesota in overtime, beginning a nine-game win streak that ended with a Big Ten title.

Seems Gesicki wants Franklin and the Lions to believe in history repeating.
