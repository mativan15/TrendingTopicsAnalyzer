"A lot of people are talking about the metaverse, a lot of people are talking about 5G use cases, but no one really knows what those technologies look and feel like. That is why all our showcases at GITEX resemble how customers can use them [the technologies] in real life." This was an important point raised by Jasim Alawadi, Head of Government and Key Accounts Segment at UAE-based telco firm Du, during his exclusive interview with Entrepreneur Middle East on the sidelines of GITEX Global 2022.

When asked what some of the main objectives his enterprise had hoped to achieve at the week-long tech startup event, Alawadi said that du aims to change the fact that a lot of the use cases of new technologies do not necessarily replicate how they can be implemented in day-to-day life.
