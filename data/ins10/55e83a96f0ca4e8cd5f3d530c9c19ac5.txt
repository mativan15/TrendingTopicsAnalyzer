US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused China of speeding up plans to seize Taiwan as Chinese President Xi Jinping looks set to secure a precedent-breaking third term at a Chinese Communist Party congress this week. 'There has been a change in the approach from Beijing toward Taiwan in recent years,' Blinken told an event at Stanford University on Monday. This includes 'a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that Beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline', he said.
