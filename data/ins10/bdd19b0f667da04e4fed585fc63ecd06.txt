The Pasmanda Muslim conference organised by the BJP on Sunday in Lucknow is part of the politics of outreach that the party has been working on to expand its support base. The BJP has managed to successfully build a 'Hindu vote' around a hardline politics that mixes nationalism and religion since 2014 and win elections, including and especially in Uttar Pradesh. Now, the party seems to be looking beyond its core voters and engaging castes and communities that traditionally voted for non-BJP parties to firewall its electoral gains, especially in UP and Bihar.
