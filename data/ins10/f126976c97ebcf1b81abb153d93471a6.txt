An Independent candidate, with the support of a former long-time Progressive Conservative MPP, has won the riding of Haldimand-Norfolk. Bobbi Ann Brady is now the province's only Independent MPP-elect. 'I am pleased that we defied the odds. I was told when I decided to do this that I would embarrass myself, that I would only get five per cent of the vote,' Brady told CTV News following her victory. Haldimand-Norfolk was previously held by PC Toby Barrett who announced he would not be seeking an eighth term in April.
