PHILADELPHIA – Here are my five biggest plays that led to the Eagles' 26-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night:

1. INTERCEPTION NO. 1

It came from Chauncey Gardner-Johnson and led to the Eagles' second TD and a 14-0 lead. How important was that? It was the first time the Cowboys had given up two offensive touchdowns in the same game this season. Their defense had allowed only five in five games, so getting two before halftime is big. Of course, give an assist to James Bradberry on the play, who broke up the pass intended for Michael Gallup.
