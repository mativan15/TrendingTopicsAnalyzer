It's incredible to fathom the fact that the BBC has been going for a whole 100 years.
However, on this day a century ago, the British Broadcasting Company (as it was then known) came into being, having been founded on October 18 1922 by a group of wireless manufacturers, including telecommunications and engineering company Marconi.
While today marks the anniversary of the broadcaster's existence, it was the following month that the firm's legacy in radio began.
On November 14 1922, the BBC began broadcasting daily from Marconi's London studio 2LO, located on the Strand in the English capital.
