President Biden claimed Friday that three universities reached out to gauge his interest in their top jobs after he left office as vice president in 2017, but that his wife Jill strongly objected.
Biden told the story at Delaware State University while speaking about his cancellation of about $400 billion in student debt — saying it was a 'true story.'
'True story: When I left the vice presidency, after Beau died, I wasn't going to get involved in politics anymore. So I became a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania,' he said.
