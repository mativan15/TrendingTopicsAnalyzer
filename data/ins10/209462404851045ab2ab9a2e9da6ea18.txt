Italy has just elected the far-right party Brothers of Italy to head its future government. Its charismatic leader, Giorgia Meloni, is a young politician who reinvigorated the conservative movement's messaging, often borrowing from rather unexpected sources. One of the authors she likes to cite – a lot – is none other than fantasy novelist J. R. R. Tolkien, who wrote the Lord of the Rings saga between 1937 and 1949.

Her fascination with the books may sound bizarre, but Tolkien has been an icon in the Italian far-right for the last 50 years.
