Bitcoin's price shot up by about eight per cent in the last week, taking its price nearly 18 per cent above its lowest mark this year of about $26,700.The world's largest cryptocurrency is currently valued at about $31,500, after being stuck in a bear run for most of the month.The leading cryptocurrency was at its lowest this year on 12 May, slipping in value to about $26,750 following the crpyo market crash triggered by the uncoupling of so-called stablecoin TerraUSD (USDT) from its dollar peg. 'Bitcoin broke above $30,000, but it needs to hold the $29,300 level on a retest to suggest continuation to the upside,' Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said on Monday.
