Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) has stopped the PGNEET-2022 (post graduate medical courses) counselling following the interim order of the High Court of Karnataka on the in-service quota. This has led to uncertainty among PGNEET eligible candidates.The case had gone to court after KEA has released 4,157 PG medical and dental course seat matrix for the 2022-23 academic year on October 10. The contention was over Karnataka's share of in-service postgraduate (PG) quota, which is down by 192 seats.
