Simona Halep has been provisionally suspended from tennis after failing a drugs test at the US Open.
The two-time Grand Slam champion, who won the 2019 Wimbledon title a year after her success at the French Open, posted a statement on her Twitter account to deny ever knowingly taking a banned substance.
Halep said: 'Today begins the hardest match of my life: a fight for the truth. I have been notified that I have tested positive for a substance called Roxadustat in an extremely low quantity, which came as the biggest shock of my life.
