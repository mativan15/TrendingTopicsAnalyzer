By Reuters Published: 10:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 10:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - British government bond prices rose on Thursday although their gains were tempered by the prospect of another week of political upheaval as the Conservative Party chooses a successor to Prime Minister Liz Truss who announced she would resign. Investors further scaled back their bets on an outsized 1% point interest rate hike next month by the Bank of England. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent questioned aggressive pricing in markets of future rate hikes in a speech earlier on Thursday.
