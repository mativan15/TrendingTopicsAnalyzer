Colbie Young didn't even realize his touchdown Saturday — the second in as many weeks for the Miami Hurricanes' out-of-nowhere new No. 1 wide receiver — was made with just one hand.

'I didn't even know,' he said after Miami beat the Virginia Tech Hokies, 20-14, in Blacksburg, Virginia. 'It was just a moment thing.'

It was another whirlwind moment for the sophomore in a year full of them so far.

Back in the winter, Young didn't have a single scholarship offer — and his only offer out of New York's Binghamton in the Class of 2020 was as a walk-on for the FCS Albany Great Danes.
