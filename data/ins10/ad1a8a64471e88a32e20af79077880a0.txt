Coffin makers will go on strike in a move that has evoked memories of the winter of discontent that crippled Britain almost five decades ago.In the winter of 1978-79 images of coffins piling up and bodies going unburied prompted fury when gravediggers joined workers taking part in the largest wave of industrial action since the general strike of 1926.Now staff at the Co-op's only UK coffin-manufacturing plant have voted to bring production to a halt after rejecting a pay offer.They are joining a number of public sector unions, representing teachers, rail workers and firefighters, who are threatening to take industrial action.
