Excited fans have revealed that a new Diablo 4 closed beta has started for the game's endgame.
Initially, the only ones able to play Diablo 4 early were friends and family of Blizzard Entertainment employees, thanks to a restricted alpha test. Not that this stopped people from leaking footage of it anyway.
Last month, though, Blizzard announced that it would be conducting a closed endgame beta session; one that select players would be invited to take part in.
It sounds like said beta has started because people are talking about it on social media, something which Blizzard has also told them not to do.
