(Bloomberg) -- T-Mobile US Inc. is coming under scrutiny for its business relationship with a small wireless carrier that's helped fund a conservative takeover of several North Texas school boards.

More than 1,200 people have signed an online petition asking the mobile-phone giant to cut ties with Patriot Mobile, a Grapevine, Texas-based company that calls itself 'America's only Christian conservative wireless provider.' It founded a political action committee this year that backed 11 winning candidates for school boards in the Dallas suburbs, many of whom sought to ban books as part of efforts to fight what they see as 'woke' education policies.
