Japanese government officials are pledging more support for the science and technology sectors. They say innovations across these fields will help to navigate changes in global security. Officials have drawn up a draft strategy that commits a fund of 10 trillion yen, or around 77 billion dollars, to universities for research and personnel training. The strategy identifies quantum and artificial intelligence as two key areas of academic research. It also says the government will offer more financial backing to get technologically-innovative start-ups off the ground.
