PTIUnion Home Minister Amit ShahUnion Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said most of the "hotspots" in the country are almost free from anti-national activities now and the situation in major security theatres has improved over the last eight years of the Narendra Modi government. He said more than 70 per cent decline has been recorded in incidents of violence that were reported from insurgency-hit areas of the Northeast during this time period and this is an indicator of a "happy Northeast". Same was the situation in Jammu and Kashmir as well as in the states affected by Naxal violence, the minister said while addressing top police and paramilitary forces commanders at the National Police Memorial in the Chanakyapuri area here on the occasion of the National Police Commemoration Day.
