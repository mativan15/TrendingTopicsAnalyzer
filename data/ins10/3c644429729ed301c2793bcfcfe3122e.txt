Retirees are on track to receive a record pay rise due to historically high inflation. September's inflation figure will be published on Wednesday, and if it remains elevated at 9.9pc, the new state pension will rise by £18.35 a week, from £185.15 to £203.50.
The basic state pension, which is paid to those who reached state pension age before 2016, would increase from £141.85 to £155.90.
Rebecca O'Connor, of the broker Interactive Investor, said: 'We have seen U-turns on the triple lock before and we cannot rule them out again.
