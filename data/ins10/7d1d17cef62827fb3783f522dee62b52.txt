Wall Street Published by Reuters UK PRAGUE (Reuters) -The Czech parliament on Tuesday approved raising this year's state budget deficit by a third to 375 billion crowns ($15.03 billion) as the government seeks extra funding to help people and companies cope with soaring energy prices. The Czech government, similar to other European Union countries, is trying to shield the population and businesses from high energy prices resulting from delivery disruptions and market volatility mainly caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
