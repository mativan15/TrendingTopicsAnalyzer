Hospitality and leisure sector workers are missing out on about £200m in tips every year according to Labour figures, with the party pledging to 'stamp out' unfair deductions for good.Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, will set out plans this week to ensure employers allocate all tips, gratuities and service charge payments to workers in full, without any deductions apart from statutory taxes, by the end of the following month.At the Trades Union Congress conference in Brighton, she will also announce proposals to allow exploited workers to lodge any workplace grievances collectively, a right denied to many hospitality workers seeking the return of deducted tips.
