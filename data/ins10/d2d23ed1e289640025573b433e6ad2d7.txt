(Reuters) -Super Apps Holdings will go public in the United States through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal that values the Malaysian payments technology firm at $1.1 billion, the companies said on Wednesday.

Before the deal with Technology & Telecommunication Acquisition Corporation closes, Super Apps will buy 60% of fintech firm MobilityOne's stake in OneShop Retail.

Proceeds from the merger will be used to expand headcount, Super Apps said. The combined company will be listed on Nasdaq and named TETE Technologies Inc.
