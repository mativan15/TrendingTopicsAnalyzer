Presented by Bayer There's no question that food insecurity is one of the biggest problems facing the global population today. About 283 million people around the world are experiencing acute hunger, according to the World Food Program. In the United States alone, nearly one in eight families doesn't have enough to eat. Even worse, child food insecurity increased from 15 percent in 2018 to 24 percent in 2020, Axios reports. And these numbers could continue to rise. Various sources predict that if stresses on our food system increase — everything from staffing and supply chain issues to climate change negatively impacting crops — more than 500 million people around the world could be facing acute hunger as soon as next year.
