Americans are losing their appetite for home buying.Sales of previously owned homes fell for the eighth straight month in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.71 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That's down 1.5% from August's pace and 23.2% from the year-ago rate. It also marks the slowest rate of sales since September 2012.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasted a similar decline for the month. September's readings stand as another reminder of just how much power home sellers have lost in 2022.
