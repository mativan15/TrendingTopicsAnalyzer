Dame Deborah James ' family have thanked the public for their support as they continue to raise money for charity. The podcaster, 40, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, established the Bowelbabe Fund recently to raise money and awareness, as she receives end-of-life care. The initiative - in collaboration with Cancer Research UK - has already raised more than £6 million in the few weeks since it was set up by Deborah, her family and the charity. And in an update on its Instagram page today, her family thanked her supporters for donating to the Bowelbabe Fund - which funds causes and projects close to her heart.
