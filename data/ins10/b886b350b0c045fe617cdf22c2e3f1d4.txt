Newly independent India issued elegantly designed postage stamps to celebrate its rich heritage and broadcast its self-image as a developmental state. In the late 1960s, the Indira Gandhi government made more room for personalities in the country's philatelic space. The Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates, the Sangh Parivar, though, did not feature on stamps until the late 1970s when the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) joined the Janata government. The philatelic output of governments involving the BJS and the BJP holds a mirror to the Parivar's internal conflicts, its relationship with competing organisations, its understanding of the country's diversity, and its selective appropriation of the founding fathers.
