Newly elected Auckland mayor Wayne Brown has announced plans to fix the region's mobile phone blackspots. In a statement on Sunday, Brown said he had written to the chief executive officers of 2degrees, Spark and One NZ (formerly Vodafone) offering to work with them to elimate Aucklands remaning mobile blackspots and dropped-call rates. He had also asked the cell phone companies how he could help them to improve their service. In general, mobile coverage in the biggest cities is good. There are, however, parts of Auckland where there is bad cellphone coverage and, so-called dead zones (locations where there is no cellphone signal).
