Oct. 20—This year's race to represent the 139th District pits a seasoned incumbent against an ambitious newcomer.

Republican Mark Adams of Norwich is challenging State Rep. Kevin Ryan, D-Montville, to represent a newly reconfigured state House district that covers parts of Montville, Norwich and the Gales Ferry section of Ledyard.

Ryan, 70, a longtime Montville resident and former optometrist who works as an adjunct professor at the University of New Haven is seeking election to his 16th term in office.
