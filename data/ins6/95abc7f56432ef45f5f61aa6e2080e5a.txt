The college basketball season is right around the corner.

The preseason Associated Press Top 25 Poll was released on Monday afternoon and the Michigan Wolverines will open the season ranked 22nd in the country.

There is only one Big Ten team ranked higher than Michigan. Indiana opens the season ranked 13th. Besides the Wolverines and Hoosiers, the only other Big Ten team that will begin the season ranked is Illinois at No. 23.

Michigan has a tough non-conference schedule. Now that the preseason rankings are out, the Wolverines will face the No.
