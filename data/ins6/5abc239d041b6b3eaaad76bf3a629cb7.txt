By Reuters Published: 12:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 12:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Eight out of 10 people in Britain now disapprove of the government, a YouGov poll showed on Tuesday, as the country deals with an economic crisis inflamed by new Prime Minister Liz Truss's now-abandoned attempts at radical tax cutting reforms. The poll found that 77% Britons disapproved of the Conservative-led government, the highest in 11 years of YouGov tracking, the company said. YouGov also said that nine in 10 Britons, or 87% of those polled, say the government is handling the economy badly, in a blow to the party that has historically talked up its record for fiscal discipline.
