SACRAMENTO — No longer will candidates running for office in California be able to rely on a high schooler's financial wizardry.
State regulators on Thursday passed a rule prohibiting anyone under the age of 18 to be hired for a position that requires them to sign campaign financial documents under penalty of perjury. The change — made by the Fair Political Practices Commission — will mostly apply to a campaign's treasurer, but could affect other positions that involve financial decisions.
Candidates, however, can still recruit youth for positions that involve tasks, like door knocking in local campaigns, state senate and assembly races.
