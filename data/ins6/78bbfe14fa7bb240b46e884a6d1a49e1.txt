Get the popcorn: it's a British fiscal-policy statement. The government has spent the past few weeks turning announcements about taxation and spending into moments of remarkable political theatre. On September 23rd a fiscal event dubbed the 'mini-budget' introduced the largest package of tax cuts in half a century. (A 'medium-term fiscal plan', eventually scheduled for October 31st, was to set out the more trivial details, like how it would be paid for.) On October 17th Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor of the exchequer, cancelled £32bn ($36bn) of those tax cuts, ripping up virtually the whole mini-budget.
