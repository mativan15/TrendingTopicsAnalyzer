A day after Queen Elizabeth II's death last month, Netflix confirmed that its hit series 'The Crown,' an intimate and fictional look at the British royal family, had temporarily paused production on its sixth season.

At the time, a spokesperson for the show told the Associated Press that filming was halted 'as a mark of respect' and that shooting would be suspended on the day of the long-reigning monarch's funeral as well.

Ahead of Season Five of 'The Crown' premiering on Nov. 9, cast and crew members opened up to Entertainment Weekly about their reactions to the queen's death.
