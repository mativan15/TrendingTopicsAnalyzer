Emergency rooms across Montreal were overcrowded throughout the heights of the pandemic, and after three years doctors say the ailing health-care system is not improving. In fact, it's getting worse. "We have to build back capacity," said health care advocate Dr. Paul Saba. "There is no capacity in the system. In fact, we've reduced it so there's less than." Almost every ER in Montreal is overcrowded. As of Tuesday morning, the Royal Victoria Hospital was at more than double capacity (230 per cent), and Verdun and LaSalle hospitals were at around 165 per cent.
