The money will be used to bring forward treatment in orthopaedics, general surgery and ophthalmology. Health Minister Rob Callister said the wait for procedures had "unfortunately grown to beyond what we would consider safe".Updates on the progress of the initiative must be published every quarter until the money runs out.
