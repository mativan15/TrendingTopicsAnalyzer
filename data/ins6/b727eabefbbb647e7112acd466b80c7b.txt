Collider.com Carrie, a timeless tale of a young girl exacting revenge on her bullies, based on Stephen King's first published novel, has become one of the most recognizable horror icons in cinema. The striking image of a girl drenched in blood has stayed with people over the years. While the original film starring Sissy Spacek as the titular character is undoubtedly a classic, the lesser known 2002 TV movie written by Bryan Fuller and directed by David Carson is a much more faithful adaptation of King's original novel.
