Grocery items may still be skyrocketing in price (when they aren't out of stock). But luckily, inflation hasn't affected the price of meal kits much, making these easy subscription services as good a deal as ever. While typical grocery costs are up as much as 23% versus two years ago, most meal kit service consumer prices are only up about 5% or 10% since 2020. That raises the question: With inflation, are meal kits any more expensive than buying the same groceries? And if so, how much more expensive is a budget meal service such as EveryPlate or Dinnerly than purchasing the items yourself?
