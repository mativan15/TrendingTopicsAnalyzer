In yet another case of loan app fraud, a 28-year-old man, who took an online loan of Rs 5,000 from a mobile app and repaid Rs 8,200 including the interest amount, was harassed by recovery agents who extorted Rs 4.28 lakh from him.
An FIR was registered on June 2 at the Chunnabhatti police station. The man told the police he works as a kitchen supervisor and was in urgent need of money in the month of March for his wife's medical treatment.
When no one helped him, on March 28, he came across an app called ‘Cash Bus' on the Google Play Store, the man told the police in his statement.
