The Forbes 400 list is out, and six Tennessean, including one Memphis business legend, made the list richest of the rich billionaires.

And for fun, we've included No. 37 on the list: Memphis Grizzlies majority owner Robert Pera, whose net worth is $17.6 billion.

After the company he founded, Ubiquiti, went public in 2011, Pera made Forbes' youngest billionaires list. He subsequently acquired a majority sake in the Grizzlies in 2012, later consolidating that interest in the team.

FedEx founder and executive chairman Fred Smith — the only Memphian on the list — ranked third in Tennessee among the state's billion-dollar set.
