The Indiana Pacers opened up their 2022-23 season on Wednesday night at home with a hard-fought 114-107 loss to Bradley Beal and the Washington Wizards.
Of the many reasons you might be able to point to for the loss, the one that stands out the most is that the Pacers' star big man, Myles Turner, didn't play.
The reason? A sprained left ankle.
But when did this happen? Turner finished the preseason healthy and had intentions of playing in Wednesday's opener. In fact, he even suited up and began warming up.
