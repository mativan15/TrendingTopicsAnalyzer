MADISON — New Jersey's epidemic of suburban auto thefts is now a federal issue.

Local police chiefs and county sheriffs from across North Jersey joined a bipartisan coalition of elected officials on Monday to promote legislation in Washington to fight the problem.

The news conference in Madison was organized by U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Montclair), who introduced a bill in Congress last week that would provide $150 million in grants over five years to local law enforcement, in response to a wave of auto thefts and stolen vehicle trafficking around the country.
