By Chris Wack Avadel Pharmaceuticals Plc shares gave back some of Friday's big gains, dropping 12% to $2.20. The stock more than doubled on Friday, in turn bouncing back from the 52-week low of $1.05 hit on Thursday. The company said in a filing on Thursday that it received a proposed final label and medication guide for lead drug candidate FT218 from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. The stock moved higher Friday after Oppenheimer analyst Francois Brisebois said Thursday's move lower was an overreaction, and the proposed final label and medication guide for FT218 is a positive, as it gives confidence in the product's approvability.
