deepblue4you Elevator Pitch My investment rating for Lear Corporation's (NYSE:LEA) shares is a Hold. In my prior article for Lear Corporation written on August 5, 2022, I discussed about how "recession concerns" had hurt LEA's stock price performance. I will be focusing on Lear Corporation's recently announced partnership with General Motors Company (GM), and its third-quarter results which will be announced next month. My analysis leads me to the conclusion that LEA still warrants a Hold rating.
