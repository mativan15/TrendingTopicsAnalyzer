 Apple's WWDC 2022 event is now only a few days away, and in the run-up, it appears that the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is incredibly hard to buy.Now, usually, news about stock shortages for a popular product isn't good news, especially when it concerns the best laptop you can buy right now, but this has actually got me pretty excited for what Apple could show off at WWDC.As 9to5Mac reports (opens in new tab), the M1 model of the MacBook Air is hard to get hold of right now, with shipping estimates in the US for the base model between June 8 – 15.
