MARIKINA 2ND District Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo on Tuesday called on fellow lawmakers in the House of Representatives to help bring back the lost glory of the country's footwear industry. Quimbo made the call in a sponsorship speech for House Bill (HB) 491 or 'the Philippine Footwear, Leather Goods, and Tannery Industries Development Act of 2022'. She said her hometown Marikina City, tagged as the 'Shoe Capital of the Philippines', was once renowned for exporting fine, durable, and elegant shoe products around the world.
