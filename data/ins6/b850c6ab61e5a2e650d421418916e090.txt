Don't forget about Anthony Richardson!
Florida's superstar quarterback tried to get the Gators back into their game with LSU on Saturday with aplomb, rushing for an incredible 81-yard touchdown and nearly taking out the entire Tigers defense in the process.
Richardson — who's believed to be a first-round prospect in the 2023 NFL Draft — is going to need more highlights like this to bolster his draft stock and help the Gators push for a major bowl game appearance this winter.
Though, for now, enjoy watching Richardson demolish some pathetic play from LSU's typically vaunted defense.
