Apple's Spatial Audio is coming to a number of Mercedes-Benz cars, the tech giant announced Monday. Spatial Audio, which is Apple's music tech that makes the sound come at you from all directions, has so far been available only on Apple's own audio gear. 
Now, however, owners of Mercedes-Benz's Maybach, the EQS and EQS SUV, the EQE, and the S-Class models, will be able to enjoy music in Spatial Audio as well. The feature is integrated with the MBUX infotainment system, so only cars that have it will get Spatial Audio.
