There's no doubt about it: this is America's Most Beautiful Bike Ride. The gorgeous route follows the contours of the sparkling blue alpine waters of Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada, surrounded by mountains—some of which still carry a good dusting of snow at the crest. The annual bike ride's been on hiatus for two years for reasons no one needs to enumerate, but now, as reported by the Tahoe Daily Tribune, the ride's back for its 29th annual occurrence, hosted by Bike The West and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
