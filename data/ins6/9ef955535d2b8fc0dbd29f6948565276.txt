Dutch navigation and digital mapping company TomTom on Friday cut its cash flow target for 2023, citing inflationary pressures and economic uncertainty, sending its shares tumbling 12% despite better than expected third-quarter performance.The Amsterdam-based group, whose customers range from major car companies to global tech firms, forecast free cash flow at break-even for next year, compared with a previous outlook for an inflow of at least 5% of revenues."High energy prices, high interest rates and inflation pressure give us quite a bit of uncertainty if we look at the mid term," Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn told Reuters.
