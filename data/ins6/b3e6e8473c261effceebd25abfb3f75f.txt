My Chemical Romance is touring again. Hayley Williams was on stage at Coachella. Travis Barker has married a Kardashian. That's right – emo is really hot again. 
There have been rumblings of a big emo revival for a little while now. 
After all, tickets for the MCR gigs went on sale back in 2019 and the shows have been pushed back thanks to the pandemic, so this is in part due to the hand fate dealt us. 
With the ever-nostalgic trend cycle swallowing up the 00s and spitting out the current Y2K trend, combined with the full-scale return of live music, and the celebs doing… all the things they like to do, it feels like the ripples of emo are turning into a tidal wave.
