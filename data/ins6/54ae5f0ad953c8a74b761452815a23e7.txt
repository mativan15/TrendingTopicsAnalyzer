With the Chicago Bulls right in the middle of the pack with a projected win total of 41.5 games, there's not a ton of appetite to make sweeping predictions about how they'll fare this season. As a result, it's tough to be relatively bullish on their chances to improve on last season's postseason berth.

Starting point guard, Lonzo Ball, is sidelined for the foreseeable future. And given that Chicago didn't add any significant free agent pieces outside of re-signing Zach LaVine, I'm not surprised they were downgraded after winning 46 games last season.
