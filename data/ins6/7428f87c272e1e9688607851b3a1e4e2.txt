Apple is feeling the heat from labor activists. 
The iPhone maker is rolling out improvements to its retail scheduling policies in an attempt to placate dissatisfied workers amid a unionization push, Bloomberg reported. 
Apple will up the amount of time between retail workers' scheduled shifts to 12 hours from 10 and will allow them to choose a dedicated weekend day off every six months, according to the outlet. 
The Tim Cook-helmed company will also reportedly no longer schedule retail workers to work for more than five days in a row, with possible exceptions for especially busy periods like holidays and new product launches.
