LAS VEGAS, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- St. Jude's Ranch for Children, a community of healing and hope, with the help of its construction team — Grand Canyon Development Partners, EV&A Architects, Taney Engineering, and The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company — will break ground on its Healing Center on Oct. 25, 2022, for children who are victims of sex trafficking. Unlike any other nationwide, this first-of-its-kind center will build on the 56-year legacy of the charity by providing safe therapeutic homes and a specialized nurturing recovery program for children who have been forced or manipulated into having sex for money.
