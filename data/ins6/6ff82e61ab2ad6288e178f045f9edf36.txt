Bray Wyatt finished his message to the fans on SmackDown while WWE revealed another QR code which leaked the star's psych evaluation.
The sinister and cryptic wrestler stunned fans last week as he came out of character for the first time only to be interrupted by a voice behind a mask seemingly known as Uncle Howdy.
The mystery continued this week, first with a video interrupting the broadcast with the unknown messenger urging viewers not to lie to those we love, with a simple ‘Howdy' bringing the clip to an end.
