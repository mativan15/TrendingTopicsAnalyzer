TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Sunday slammed the eight-year rule of the BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, charging that the party has not fulfilled any of its election promises and has only indulged in anti-people activities.'The BJP rule over the last eight years has caused only untold miseries and pain to the citizens of the country, and the party is working hard only on dividing people on communal lines. The BJP cannot hide this no matter how many thousands of crores it spends on advertisements,' he said.
