WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand Rugby has been given approval to sign a ground-breaking deal with California-based private equity firm Silver Lake which will bring a cash windfall but which some observers fear may threaten the 'special bond' between New Zealanders and their national team, the All Blacks. NZR chairman Stewart Mitchell described it as a 'monumental moment" for the sport. Silver Lake will pay around 200 million New Zealand dollars ($130 million) for a share of between 5-8% in NZR's future commercial revenues, which it pledges to use its expertise to increase.
