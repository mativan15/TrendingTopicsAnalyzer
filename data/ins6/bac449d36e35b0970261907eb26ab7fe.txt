The Wrap Netflix co-ceo Ted Sarandos explained why arguably its biggest movie of the year, 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,' will not get a wider theatrical release as some have clamored for, saying that ultimately they want their subscribers to watch Netflix movies on Netflix.'There's all kinds of debates all the time, back and forth, but there's no question internally that we make our movies for our members, and we really want them to watch them on Netflix,' Sarandos said in Tuesday's earnings interview.
