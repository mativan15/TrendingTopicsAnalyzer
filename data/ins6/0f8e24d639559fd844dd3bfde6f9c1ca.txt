Tim Boyle/Getty Images News The global market selloff in 2022 has lowered stock prices and valuations but simultaneously increased yields. As a result, there are now bargains in dividend growth or income stocks. One stock that is trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and a relatively high dividend yield is Altria (NYSE:MO). The stock is trading at a fair valuation of about 11.14X earnings with an excellent dividend yield of 6.66%. Interestingly, the stock price is up for the year, but still, few stocks offer this combination.
