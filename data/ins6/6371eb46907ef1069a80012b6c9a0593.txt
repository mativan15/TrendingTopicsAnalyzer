Lately, it seems like time is going too fast, but thankfully spooky season isn't over yet, and to celebrate this scary time, Sony has discounted hundreds of horror games in the Playstation Store. There are some great deals on offer, so you can see October out with a boo. Every year around October, horror games get put on the price-chopping block. While recent releases don't often see much love, that's not the case with this year's sale. The Quarry's not even been out six months, and it's been discounted by £30.
