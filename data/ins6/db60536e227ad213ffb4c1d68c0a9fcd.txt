The Nets open their season on Wednesday night in Brooklyn against the Pelicans. The Post's Brian Lewis makes three bold predictions about the highly anticipated Nets campaign.
Three bold predictions
1. Joe Harris wins his third 3-point crown: Ben Simmons creates as many clean 3-point looks for teammates as anybody in the league. After Harris won 3-point titles in two of his past three healthy campaigns (47.4 percent and 47.5 percent), expect to see him claim another once he gets healthy.
2. The Nets give Kyrie Irving an extension, or he'll end up in Los Angeles: When the Nets and Irving couldn't agree on an extension this past summer, it led to speculation he would leave for the Lakers.
