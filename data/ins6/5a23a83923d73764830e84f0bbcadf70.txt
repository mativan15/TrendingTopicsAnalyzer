It has been over 10 years since the terrors of the last Silent Hill game left fans of the franchise shaking in terror, but now, all of that is changing. After years of silence—and a failed attempt to reboot the franchise with P.T. back in 2014—Silent Hill is finally getting a terrifying new lease on life.Konami released a special Silent Hill transmission on October 19, detailing several new projects that will help carry the series forward. The new projects include a remake of Silent Hill 2, which will be available on the PlayStation Store, as well as a new game called Silent Hill: Townfall, and an interactive series called Silent Hill: Ascension.
