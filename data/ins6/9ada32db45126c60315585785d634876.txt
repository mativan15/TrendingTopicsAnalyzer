The Dolphins have started three different quarterbacks in their last three games and they'll be making a change back to the first of those signal callers if all goes according to plan this week.

Head coach Mike McDaniel said at his Monday press conference that the team's plan is for Tua Tagovailoa 'to approach the week as the starter.' Tagovailoa has not played since suffering a concussion in Week Four, but he practiced fully last week and has made his way out of the concussion protocol.
