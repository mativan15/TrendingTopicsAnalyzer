A Florida voting rights group is calling on state officials to fix what it says is a 'broken' Florida voting system after videos of felons being arrested on charges related to voting illegally in 2020 went viral this week.

The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, which led the 2018 effort to allow Floridians with felony convictions to vote, is also urging people to sign a petition for state and local prosecutors to 'immediately stop arrests' of people with felonies on their records for voting.
