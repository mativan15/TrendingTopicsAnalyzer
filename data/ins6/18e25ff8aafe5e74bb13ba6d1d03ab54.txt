They will have to wait until next month to see the former coach who took them to the Stanley Cup Final just more than two years ago. Bowness, now Winnipeg´s coach, missed Monday night´s game in Dallas because of a positive COVID-19 test that also kept the 67-year-old coach out of the season opener three nights earlier. "Our time together was awesome," Stars captain captain Jamie Benn said after the morning skate.
