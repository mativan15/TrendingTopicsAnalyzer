Oct. 17—The Odessa Police Department Sunday afternoon received a call about a possible threat made by a student.

ECISD's threat assessment team started an immediate investigation and found that a Permian High School freshman had texted two friends who attend New Tech Odessa and warned them not to go to NTO Monday (Oct. 17); the text included a picture of a gun he took from the internet, a news release said.

"We want to remind parents and students once again, what may be intended as a joke will not be treated that way.
