Oct. 19—Jurors who must decide the fate of an Odessa man who pleaded guilty to savagely beating a woman during an armed robbery were forced to watch video surveillance of portions of the attack Tuesday and to look at more than 100 photos documenting the bloody scene and the victim's injuries.

Isaac Jerald Jackson, 33, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in the 244th Ector County District Court just before his trial was set to begin in connection with the March 21 attack at the Garden Rose Spa.
