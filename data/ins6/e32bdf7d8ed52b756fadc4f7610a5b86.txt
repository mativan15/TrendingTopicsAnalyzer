The Santa Clara County Library District was set to kick off its free Summer Reading Program, Read Beyond the Beaten Path on June 1. The program, which runs through July 31, encourages readers of all ages to go on a new adventure in the pages of a book or take the adventure outside.
Research shows reading during summer vacation can help prevent 'Summer Slide', where students lose a significant amount of reading and math knowledge over the summer vacation. The COVID-19 pandemic, which forced school closures and distance learning, compounded the learning loss.
