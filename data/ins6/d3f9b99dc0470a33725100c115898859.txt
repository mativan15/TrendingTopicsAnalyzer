The Diwali special episode of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 10 will host television's original Ram and Sita — Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia. Colors TV dropped a promo of the episode where the two are seen in their divine avatars. The episode will also see contestants putting up spectacular performances depicting mythological stories.
In the video, while the ‘Ram Siya Ram' song plays in the background, Dipika mentions how her life's aim will only be fulfilled if every house starts respecting Ram. He, on the other hand, aims an arrow at a dancer, dressed as Ravana, to mark the beginning of Diwali celebrations.
