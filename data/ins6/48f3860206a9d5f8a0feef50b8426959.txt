Konami's Silent Hill 2 Remake from Bloober Team won't feature loading screens and instead has seamless gameplay when transitioning to new areas, coming out of cutscenes, and so on.

Announced in a PlayStation Blog post, Bloober Team's creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart discussed how Silent Hill 2 Remake's PlayStation 5 console exclusivity allowed for some additional features.

One of these is the seamless gameplay made possible by the console's SSD storage system. "One last great improvement I want to mention is the SSD storage technology," Lenart said.
