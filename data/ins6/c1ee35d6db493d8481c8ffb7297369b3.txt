WHERE: Stratford, Ont. WHEN: through Oct. 29 COST: $21+ No way could this list possibly exclude the world-famous Stratford Festival. Shakespeare fans might have already committed the lineup to heart, but those of us less friendly with the Bard might wish to check out the fantastic studio lineup. I'm particularly looking forward to 'Hamlet-911,' written by Ann-Marie MacDonald and directed by Alisa Palmer. The play wrestles Shakespeare's text into whimsical submission, roving from a matinee performance of the text at the Stratford Festival to … the Underworld.
