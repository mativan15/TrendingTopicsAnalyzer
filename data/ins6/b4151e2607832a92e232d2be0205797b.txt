Don't wait for complaints to act against hate speech, Supreme Court tells policeThe Supreme Court on October 21 said it is 'tragic what we have reduced religion to' in the 21st century and a 'climate of hate prevails in the country' while directing police and authorities to immediately and suo motu register cases against hate speech makers and offenders who commit acts of communal violence without waiting for a complaint to be filed. A Bench of Justices K.M. Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy ordered that any 'hesitation' to comply with the direction would attract the proceedings for contempt of the Supreme Court against the erring officers.
