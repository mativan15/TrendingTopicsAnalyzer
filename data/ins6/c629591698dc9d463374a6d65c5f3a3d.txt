Zac Brown Band said it was forced to cancel its Friday night concert in Vancouver, British Columbia, just hours before they were set to perform after some members of the group weren't allowed across the Canadian border. "We're sorry to announce that we won't be able to perform in Vancouver tonight," the  band wrote on Facebook Friday evening. "Our Canadian fans are incredible, and we would love nothing more than to share an evening of music together. Some of our crew members had charges on their records from over a decade ago that have since been removed.
