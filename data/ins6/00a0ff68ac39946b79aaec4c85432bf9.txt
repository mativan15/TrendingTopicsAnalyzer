Bang! Zoom! And a Happy Birthday to The Honeymooners star Joyce Randolph, who turns 98 years of age today. It has been 70 years since Miss Randolph debuted as Thelma 'Trixie' Norton, first in a series of sketches on the variety hour The Jackie Gleason Show, and then in the one season standalone comedy The Honeymooners.
