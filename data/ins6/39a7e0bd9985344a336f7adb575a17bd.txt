Pay Dirt is Slate's money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Lillian, Athena, and Elizabeth here. (It's anonymous!) Dear Pay Dirt, When my sister had her son—the only one in my extended family to have a child so far—our grandmother told her she wanted her family to have her home when she died. It's a modest house in a very nice neighborhood with excellent schools, a walkable downtown, and so on. (My sister and her husband currently rent a house.) We all hoped this would be a faraway offer, but unfortunately, my grandmother fell ill and died this year.
