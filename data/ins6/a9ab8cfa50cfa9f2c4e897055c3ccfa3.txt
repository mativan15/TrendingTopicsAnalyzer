On Monday, the NCAA selection committee announced the full 64-team field for this year's NCAA Baseball Tournament.

LSU went into the day knowing it would have to hit the road for the regional round as the 16 host sites were announced Sunday night with Alex Box Stadium in Baton Rouge not being among them.

Now, the Tigers know they'll be staying relatively close to home as they will head to the Hattiesburg Regional to take on No. 11 national seed Southern Miss in addition to No. 3-seeded Kennesaw State and No.
