Paul Ryan praised Rep. Tom Rice for his Trump impeachment vote while campaigning for him in South Carolina.

"There were a lot of people who wanted to vote like Tom but who just didn't have the guts to do it," he said.

Ryan also criticized Trump for his "vengeance" in backing primary challengers to Republicans who cross him.

Former House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that more House Republicans would've voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the January 6 Capitol riot if they'd had the "guts" to do so.
