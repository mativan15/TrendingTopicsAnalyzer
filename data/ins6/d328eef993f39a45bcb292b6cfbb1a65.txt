This week was filled with highs and lows for brands across sectors. While for FMCG giant Marico it turned out to be towards the higher side with the acquisition of a majority stake of 54 per cent equity in HW Wellness Solutions, it was not that kind towards OTT platform Netflix.After having to pay more than 55.8 million euros (USD 59 million) to settle a tax dispute in Italy as the week started, the platform further went on to record 3.6 mn service cancellations in the US in Q1. The quarterly loss is one million more than what Netflix faced in both Q1 2021 and Q4 2021.
