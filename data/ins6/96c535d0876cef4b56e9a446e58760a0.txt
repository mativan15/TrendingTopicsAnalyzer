In a first-of-its-kind conference of Pasmanda Muslims the state BJP's minority wing organised in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh ministers and other party leaders on Sunday assured the community members that both they and their faith were safe in the saffron party's rule.

At the conference, prominent Pasmanda Muslims were honoured with saffron scarves and pagdis (headgears) amid chanting of slogans of 'Bharat mata ki jai' and 'Vande Mataram'.

Addressing the gathering as chief guest, Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak said the Congress and the Samajwadi Party (SP) only misled Muslims just for sake of votes.
