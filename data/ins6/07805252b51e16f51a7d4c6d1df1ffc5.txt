For one hour each week, imprisoned Russian dissident Alexey Navalny is allowed to send and receive messages with the outside world.
Navalny's hand-written missives are transmitted through his lawyer to his staff in exile in Vilnius, Lithuania, who work to share his calls for action against Russia's war in Ukraine, expose Kremlin corruption and push back on disinformation and propaganda.
'He's still very much involved in the functioning of our organization despite being in prison,'Vladimir Ashurkov, executive director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said in an interview with The Hill.
