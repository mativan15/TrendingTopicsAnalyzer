A computer hacker who made $147,000 stealing unreleased music from Ed Sheeran and Lil Uzi Vert was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Adrian Kwiatkowski exchanged the music by Sheeran and Lil Uzi Vert for cryptocurrency on the dark web after hacking into their cloud-based accounts, the Associated Press reported. The 23-year-old, from Ipswich, a town in eastern England, admitted to 19 charges, including possessing criminal property and 14 copyright offenses. 'Kwiatkowski had complete disregard for the musicians' creativity and hard work producing original songs and the subsequent loss of earnings,' Joanne Jakymec of the Crown Prosecution Service told AP.
