When asked at an Irish International Business Network event on Thursday evening why he had bought Sherry FitzGerald, the country's largest residential estate agent, the tech entrepreneur Tommy Kelly quipped: 'Blame Roy Barrett.'Last year Kelly hired Barrett, the former head of Goodbody Stockbrokers, to run CastleGate Investments, a family office that will distribute some of the estimated €600 million fortune that the former logistics company owner amassed from the sale of his ecommerce company eShopWorld (ESW).
