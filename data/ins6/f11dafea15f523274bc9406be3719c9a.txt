A French jet manufacturer will bring hundreds of high-wage jobs to a maintenance facility it will build on Florida's Space Coast.

Dassault Aviation aims to open the 175,000-square-foot facility in Melbourne by 2024, the company announced Oct. 17. The $115 million project is expected to generate 400 local jobs.

The building will be capable of handling a full range of inspection, repair and overhaul activities. It will be equipped with workshops, customer offices and lounges, along with a large warehouse to support shop activity and serve as a regional distribution hub.
