Published: 04:34 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 04:34 EDT, 20 October 2022 Weakening planning rules and rowing back on plans to pay farmers for woodland creation could hit the UK's tree planting efforts to tackle climate change, campaigners warn. The Woodland Trust is warning that Government moves to relax planning policy in 'investment zones' and rumoured risks to a new scheme to pay farmers for creating habitat could see the UK lose more trees and plant fewer. The UK currently has 13% woodland cover, with Government climate plans requiring woodland cover to reach 17% by 2050 through planting and establishing trees.
