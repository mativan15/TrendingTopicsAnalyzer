Crypto venture capital fund Paradigm Operations has asked a federal court for permission to join two other groups in arguing that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should serve the members of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) directly, rather than through a generic website help portal.

Paradigm filed for permission to join Ooki DAO's case with the CFTC on Monday, arguing in a motion that the CFTC's view that any voting token-holder who participated in the DAO's governance process is liable may threaten DAOs in general.
