It is a pleasure to report that the Beston Global Food Company Limited (ASX:BFC) is up 53% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last half decade have been disappointing. In fact, the share price has declined rather badly, down some 59% in that time. So we're hesitant to put much weight behind the short term increase. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround.

Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline.
