Oct. 21—As Indiana State University graduate student Allison Lehman walked across campus Thursday, she did a double take when seeing a small, moving robot accompanied by two people.

She immediately recognized its purpose — future automated food delivery at ISU. The robots, made by a company called Kiwibot, are still in testing and preparation mode on campus.

Lehman had seen similar food delivery robots at another Hoosier university.

"I've been to Purdue's campus and seen theirs (made by a different company, Starship Technologies), and so immediately I was like, oh the cute little food delivery robots," she said.
