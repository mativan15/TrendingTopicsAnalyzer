ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday refused to get involved in the political wrangling as it rejected a plea from the government to issue directives against a planned anti-government protest by ex-premier Imran Khan The apex court, however, gave the government a 'free hand' to control the law and order situation and warned that it would intervene if any party violated court orders.The federal government approached the Supreme Court last week for initiating the contempt of court proceedings against Khan for violating the court's May 25 order regarding his party's 'Azadi March'.
