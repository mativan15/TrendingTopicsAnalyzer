Debris packed Fort Myers Beach on Oct. 11, nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ian struck Southwest Florida Sept. 28. An emergency-relief fund established by the Town of Palm Beach United Way has so far raised more than $600,000.

Two Palm Beach billionaire couples have stepped forward with challenge grants for the Town of Palm Beach United Way's relief fund, which so far has raised more than $600,000 to help survivors of savage Hurricane Ian in southwest Florida.

The latest matching grants were made by investments manager Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management, joined by his wife, Claudia; and Marvel Entertainment Chairman Isaac Perlman and his wife, Laura.
