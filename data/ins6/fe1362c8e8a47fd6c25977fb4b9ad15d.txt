The Auckland Tuatara have signed former Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins short stop Tzu-Wei Lin and are in talks with former World Series winner Jonny Gomes. Lin, a 28-year-old Taiwanese superstar has agreed to join the club for the upcoming Australian Baseball League season, which starts next month. It's not uncommon for former Major League Baseball players to join ABL clubs, but rare for someone to do so at Lin's age, who's so recently played at the top level, and he hopes his time with the Tuatara springboards him back into the MLB.
