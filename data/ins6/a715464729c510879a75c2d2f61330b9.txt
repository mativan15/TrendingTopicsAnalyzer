BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty jokingly shared her frustration over ‘aloof' Larry the cat as she reported from Downing Street.
The broadcaster was giving updates from No 10 in the aftermath of Liz Truss' resignation on the current affairs programme on Friday.
As she spoke to co-host Charlie Stayt from Westminster, the former Strictly Come Dancing contestant revealed she had got a rather frosty reaction from the prime minster's feline.
