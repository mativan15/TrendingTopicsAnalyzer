Former President Barack Obama said on a recent podcast appearance that "a lot of voters" were "complacent" when Roe v. Wade was in place for nearly 50 years, arguing that the Supreme Court remains "reflective of our politics."During a newly-released episode of "Pod Save America," Obama remarked on the fallout over the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States, stating that many people had just assumed such protections would not be reversed.
