Arch-Liz Truss critic Michael Gove said it is a matter of when, not if the prime minister leaves office, warning the public to expect 'a hell of a lot of pain in the next two months'.The former levelling up secretary said 'we are going through hell' and need 'tough economic medicine' to reduce inflation and recover the economy from the damage of Ms Truss's mini-budget.Asked whether it was 'no longer a question of whether Liz Truss goes, but when she goes,' Mr Gove agreed that was 'absolutely right'.
