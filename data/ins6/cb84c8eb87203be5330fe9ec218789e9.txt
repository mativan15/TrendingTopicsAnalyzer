Euro zone inflation rose to another record high in May, boosting government bond yields as markets saw the data as a challenge to the European Central Bank's view that gradual interest rate increases from July will be enough to tame fast price growth.Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 8.1% in May from 7.4% in April, beating expectations for 7.7% as price growth continued to broaden, indicating that it is no longer just energy pulling up the headline figure.'The inflation problem in the euro area is getting worse,' said Commerzbank economist Christoph Weil.
