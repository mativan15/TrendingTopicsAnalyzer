sshepard What happened? I bought a 1/2 position in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) last Friday prior to the earnings announcement for my Seeking Alpha marketplace service, The Winter Warrior Investor. This was due to my due diligence informing me the odds favored the bank beating on the top and bottom lines and experiencing a pop due to it trading near 52 week lows. That is exactly what occurred. Finviz Bank of America topped consensus estimates on higher net interest income and strong consumer demand.
