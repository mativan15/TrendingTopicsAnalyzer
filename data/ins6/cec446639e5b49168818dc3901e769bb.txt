The California Golden Bears committed a big no-no on Saturday: They lost at Colorado to a bunch of Buffaloes which is widely regarded as being one of the worst teams in the country, definitely the worst team among all Power Five conference squads in the country.

Virginia isn't as bad as Colorado. Boston College isn't as bad. B.C. was able to beat Louisville earlier this year. Vanderbilt isn't as bad. Rutgers isn't as bad. Northwestern might be the one team in the Power Five ranks Colorado could beat, but it's clear that the Buffaloes are not very good at all.
