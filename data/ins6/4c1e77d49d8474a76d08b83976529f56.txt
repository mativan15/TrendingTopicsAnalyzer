Variety - TV News Cannes – Three film women of Japan hit the Croisette on Tuesday for Mipcom's Asian World Premiere screening of Kansai TV's groundbreaking female TV reporter series 'Elpis,' set in Japan's male-centric TV universe.In the plot, a female journalist has been demoted, following a scandal, to 'Friday Bonbon,' a show far less serious than the newscast that she was involved in before. She soon gets her mojo back, however, investigating a complicated murder case with the help of some friends in high places.
