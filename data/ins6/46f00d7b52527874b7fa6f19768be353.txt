SL Green Realty Corp. and Caesars Entertainment said Thursday they are pursuing a gaming license for a casino in New York City's Times Square. Under their proposal, the companies would create a casino called Caesars Palace Times Square by redeveloping the existing building at 1515 Broadway, according to a press release from the companies. They said their gaming license proposal also includes plans to improve security, mass transit and traffic congestion in the Broadway theater district.
