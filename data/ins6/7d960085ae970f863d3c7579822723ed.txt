CLEVELAND -- The Guardians weren't supposed to be here.
While the team never doubted its capabilities this season, it's reminding itself now that a trip to Game 5 of the American League Division Series would've sounded like a dream just months ago. The Guardians had a chance to lock up a spot in the ALCS on Sunday night. Instead, Cal Quantrill was handed his first loss at Progressive Field since getting traded to Cleveland in 2020 as the Guardians fell, 4-2, to the Yankees in Game 4.
Now each team's fate is dependent on Monday's Game 5 at Yankee Stadium.
