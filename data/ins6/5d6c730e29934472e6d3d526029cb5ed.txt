After Tampa Bay's tech scene had one of its highest-grossing years of all time, it has hit a dip.

The region raised $82.16 million in Q3, according to data from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association. In contrast, Q2 brought in more than $108 million, and Q1 had a record-breaking $218 million. Tampa Bay's Q3 in 2021 brought in roughly $27 million more than the same time in 2022.
