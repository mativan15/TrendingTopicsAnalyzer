LONDON — A charter airline contracted by the British government to transport asylum seekers to Rwanda has pulled out of the deal following outside pressure, another blow to Britain's hard-line immigration plan to send asylum seekers to the small African nation.

The British deal with Rwanda came as Western nations are taking tougher stands against accepting refugees, and as thousands of people have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year seeking asylum. Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, is aiming to position his country as a solution to the migrant crisis, though critics see the country as trying to benefit financially from the arrangement.
