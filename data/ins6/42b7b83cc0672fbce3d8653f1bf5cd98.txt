The Yankees and Astros played a disjointed seven games this season, with Houston going 5-2. The teams originally were slated to play three games in Houston in the first week of the season, but those games were rescheduled due to the lockout. They were played as a single game on June 30 (a 2-1 Astros win) and a doubleheader on July 21 (which the Astros swept). As scheduled, the Astros came to The Bronx for four games in June; the teams split the series, but one of Houston's wins was a combined no-hitter.
