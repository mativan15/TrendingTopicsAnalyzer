The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is starting a pilot alongside financial heavyweights DBS, JPMorgan (JPM) and Marketnode, to explore use cases of digital assets in tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi).

The project will explore the feasibility of tokenization and DeFi using open, interoperable networks, enabling digital assets to be traded across platforms, including existing financial infrastructure, Singapore's central bank announced on Tuesday.
