The investigation concerns whether AVEO and its board of directors violated the federal securities laws and/or breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to, among other things: (1) obtain the best possible consideration for AVEO shareholders; (2) determine whether LG is underpaying for AVEO; and (3) disclose all material information necessary for AVEO shareholders to adequately assess and value the merger consideration.
