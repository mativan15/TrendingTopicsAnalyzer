Jos Buttler says England are 'chomping at the bit' to start the T20 World Cup but Chris Woakes is unlikely to be risked for their opening match against Afghanistan.

England have laid down a marker in the last month by beating hosts and defending champions Australia twice after a series win in Pakistan, but preparations for Afghanistan on Saturday have been disrupted.

Reece Topley was set for a pivotal role but suffered a tournament-ending ankle injury in freak circumstances on Monday and now a tight quad is set to preclude Woakes' involvement at Perth.
