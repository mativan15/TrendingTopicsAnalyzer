VALLEY FORGE, Pa., May 27, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanguard today reported expense ratio changes for five mutual funds across multiple share classes. These changes align to funds with fiscal years ending January 2022 and represent an aggregate $2.8 million in net savings for investors.1
Expense ratio changes occur for a variety of reasons, including asset growth and operational efficiencies. For most of Vanguard's external advisory arrangements, the advisor's fee is also subject to an adjustment up or down based on their investment performance relative to the total return of an appropriate benchmark, typically over a three-year or five-year period.
