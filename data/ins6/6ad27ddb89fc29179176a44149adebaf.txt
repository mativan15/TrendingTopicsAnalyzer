NEW REACH: Flavialarocca, the Italian sustainable womenswear brand, has launched an e-commerce site that also aims to inform customers about its practices and manufacturing.

The website will offer only made-to-order pieces to highlight the brand's sustainable objectives and and reduce waste.

All garments are dyed in collaboration with Phillacolor, a sustainable textile company that uses natural colors and the cold dyeing method to produce its fabrics.

Online customers will also be able to find the 're-dyeing' service, which revives garments that have faded through the years and renews them instead of buying a new product.
