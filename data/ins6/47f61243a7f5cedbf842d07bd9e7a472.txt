During his "My Take" Thursday, "Varney & Co." host Stuart Varney blasted Biden's policies as the root cause of inflation, arguing the president will "do nothing" to fix his policy mistakes as the country grapples with rising prices. STUART VARNEY: The administration is confused about inflation. Consumers, and voters, are not. They see it and feel it every day. And they really don't like it.You'd think the Biden team would take note and respond, but they are tone-deaf.  On the day gas hit yet another record high, the president said, in the short term, there's nothing to be done.
