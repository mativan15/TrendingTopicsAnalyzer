A huge fire broke out at Iran's infamous Evin prison in Tehran on Saturday night. Gunshots and clashes also erupted at the prison amid the nationwide protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini. Evin jail houses many of Iran's political prisoners and anti-government activists. Many anti-hijab demonstrators have also been lodged in the facility. However, it is not clear if the clashes were linked to anti-hijab protests. Meanwhile, the U.S expressed concerns over the safety of its nationals lodged at Evin jail.
