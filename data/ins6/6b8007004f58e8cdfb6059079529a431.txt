Nintendo and Game Freak are back with another installment of Pokémon and The Washington Post was able to try it out and form impressions. 'Pokémon Scarlet' and 'Pokémon Violet,' which release on Nov. 18, demonstrate that the developers are listening to fans — at least a little more than they have in the past. The titles add fun, creative elements to shake up the classic, repetitive formula of battling and catching Pokémon on the road from gym to gym.
