Joe SotoJun 1, 2022A woman made a startling discovery after bringing home a set of sofas she found on Craigslist -- more than $36,000 in cash hidden inside one of the cushions. Vicky Umodu said she was never tempted to keep what she found. She said she immediately gave the money back to the family who gave her the furniture. But as a way of saying thank you, they agreed to pay for a new refrigerator for Umodu and gave her $2,200.
