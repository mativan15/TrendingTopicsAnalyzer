Tight end Evan Engram hasn't caught a touchdown in his first games with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but quarterback Trevor Lawrence says the stats don't tell the story of the impact the free agent signing has made on the team.
'Maybe stats-wise, he doesn't have the craziest stats, but just as far as what he does in the run game, what he's been able to do especially after the catch,' Lawrence said of Engram on Wednesday. 'He's had a lot of short throws come to him, and he's been able to fight for first downs.
