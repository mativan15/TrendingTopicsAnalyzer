Pfizer Inc. plans to raise the price of its Covid-19 vaccine next year to $110 to $130 a dose, about quadruple what it's charging in the United States currently.

The company, which developed the vaccine with Germany's BioNTech, told investors and analysts in a presentation that it aims to increase the price after the U.S. government's purchasing program expires and the vaccine moves to sales in the commercial market next year.

Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal told Reuters the increased price is higher than expected and could boost Pfizer's annual revenue by $2.
