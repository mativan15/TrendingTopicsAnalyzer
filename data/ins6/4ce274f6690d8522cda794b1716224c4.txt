It's somewhat of an unsaid rule in Hollywood that the one phrase you don't use when you're rich and famous is: ‘Don't you know who I am?' 
However, in a moment of losing their cool, there are a few celebrities who have used the infamous entitled phrase – or something like it. 
James Corden is currently catching heat after a famed and well-respected restaurateur in New York City accused him of being demanding and even ‘abusive' with staff over a wrong order. 
According to Keith McNally, who owns a portfolio of restaurants including the plush Balthazar, Corden metaphorically clicked his fingers and demanded a round of drinks.
