Antonio Giovinazzi has said sorry to the Haas team after he crashed out early on during his FP1 run-out at the United States Grand Prix.

The Italian filled in for Kevin Magnussen during the first practice session of the weekend but his time in the car was over pretty much before it had even begun as he lost control of the car and crashed into the barrier.

Giovinazzi did look as if he had beached himself into the wall but after some persisitent trying, he was able to free himself which revealed the extent of the damage he had caused to the car.
