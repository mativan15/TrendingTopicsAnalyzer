This novel is not for those without readerly stamina. At 912 pages, you are going to have to love John Irving dearly, or have a passion for reading novels come hell or high water. If the former, then it's hard to see the publication of The Last Chairlift as anything other than good news, in so far as there's now a great deal more Irving to read. But what about those of us in the latter camp who are only, say, Irving-curious?

The first thing to note is that this is Irving's 15th novel – and that he is now 80.
