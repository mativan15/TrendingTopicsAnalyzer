Orlando Magic rookie Paolo Banchero on Friday put up his second straight 20-point performance to begin the season during a loss on the road to the Atlanta Hawks.
Banchero finished with 20 points, 12 rebounds, three blocked shots, two assists and one steal in the 108-98 loss. He went 6-of-18 from the field, including 1-of-6 from 3-point range, and 7-of-8 from the free-throw line in 33 minutes of work.
The performance marked his first career double-double and the third by a rookie this season (Walker Kessler, Jaden Ivey).
