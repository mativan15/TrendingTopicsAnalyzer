We all get baited into clicking on content that makes us angry, or fuels "our side" of a contentious topic. The problem is that once you start engaging with "rage bait" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.You feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things. First your anger obviously. But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more "correct" than they/you actually are.
