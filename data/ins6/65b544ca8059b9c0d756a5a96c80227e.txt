The government is only seeking an easier visa regime for businessmen and professionals through the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom, officials said in response to the UK 's Home Secretary Suella Braverman's comments of Indians overstaying their visas.'It is not as if we are seeking to push economic migrants through the trade agreement. We have signed treaties with the UAE and Australia, which have provided for an easier dispensation for our professionals and that is what we want from the UK too,' a government source told TOI, while accusing Braverman of speaking out of turn and without full understanding of the issue.
