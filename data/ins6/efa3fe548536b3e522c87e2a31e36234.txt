District 16 encompasses portions of Lincoln, Turner and Union Counties.

Republicans from parts of Lincoln, Turner and Union Counties have more choices to make in next month's primary election than most voters in the greater Sioux Falls area.

Registered GOP voters in South Dakota Legislative District 16 on June 7 will see a pair of primary contests that will advance candidates to the general election for state House and Senate.

The Senate primary race features a pair of established Republicans who each have experience in state government, while three are vying for the two House spots up for grabs in the district.
