Nobody was eliminated on Dancing With the Stars, Monday night, but only because Selma Blair withdrew from the competition. The actress, who revealed her Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis in 2018, has been an inspiration to viewers throughout the competition. However, doctors have been monitoring her health since she began and have noticed excessive damage to her body.

'I can't go on with the competition,' Blair told her partner, Sasha Farber. 'I pushed as far as I could.'

The Cruel Intentions star explained that her chronic illness has made her more susceptible to significant injury.
