Oct. 15—ELKHART — While Friday may have seemed like a field day for students at South Side Elementary School, it was really an opportunity for them to put their philanthropic skills to the test.

The school held its annual Read, Write and Move fundraiser which raises money and promotes the importance of exercise and education.
