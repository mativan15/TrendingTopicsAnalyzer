Investors are getting closer to the point of capitulation as expectations for plummeting global growth and a hostile market environment could mean a bottom is near, according to the latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. The closely watched sentiment gauge for Wall Street professionals shows that the outlook in October for the global economy is around an all-time low, and allocation to cash is at multidecade highs. For the third prong of BofA's capitulation test, the policy outlook also is getting closer, with respondents seeing interest rate cuts and lower bond yields ahead.
