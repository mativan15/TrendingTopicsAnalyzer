Coronation Street will tackle the subject of abortion next week as Summer Spellman (Harriet Bibby) decides she isn't ready to bring up a child.
Summer discovers she's pregnant at the start of this week but chooses to keep it a secret up until a mix-up at the clothes stall sees Paul (Peter Ash) realise the pregnancy test in Gemma's (Dolly-Rose Campbell) new jacket belongs to Summer.
In the pub, when Paul arrives to see Billy (Daniel Brocklebank), Summer, Aaron (James Craven) and newcomer Esther (Vanessa Hehir), he makes a comment about Summer's condition and soon enough, her friends and family discover she's carrying a baby.
