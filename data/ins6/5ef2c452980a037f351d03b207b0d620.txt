Naomi Watts is opening up about plastic surgery.
 
In a special issue of InStyle focused on menopause, The Mulholland Drive actress talked about beauty ideals for aging women and whether or not she'd ever get plastic surgery.
 
In her latest film, Goodnight Mommy, Watts' character gets plastic surgery in an effort to look and stay young. When asked if she'd ever do that same, Watts, 54, revealed she's seriously considered it.
 
"I've done plenty of research and have gotten close at times and thought about doing it," she told InStyle.
