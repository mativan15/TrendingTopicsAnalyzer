Snap's shares plunged after it reported revenue for the three months ending Sept. 30 that fell short of analysts' expectations. The company blamed inflation for advertisers pulling back on spending, the social media site's main source of revenue.

The company's shares fell 25 percent in after-hours trading Oct. 20 and were down about 30 percent at the start of trading today. Its stock is down 80 percent from this time last year.

Snap's earnings suggest trouble for similarly positioned social media companies like Meta.
