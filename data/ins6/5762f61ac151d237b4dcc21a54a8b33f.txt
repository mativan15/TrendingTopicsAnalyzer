The Mankad debate may be running rampant in cricket but two WBBL openers found their own way to get run out at the non-strikers end in stunning fashion, hours apart, on Thursday.

A double-header at Karen Rolton Oval was highlighted by a stunning innings from Sydney Sixers veteran Erin Burns, who belted 71 off just 38 balls to nearly snatch an unimaginable win as the Brisbane Heat and Adelaide Strikers netted crucial victories.

But the teachable moments from the two games should ensure Grace Harris and Deandre Dottin never leave their crease early again.
