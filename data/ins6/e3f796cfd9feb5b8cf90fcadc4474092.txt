NEW HOPE, PA — They roared with Lion's pride during the New Hope-Solebury School District's first ever all-school pep rally on Oct. 12. Waving towels through the air and cheering loudly, the event brought together all 1,300 students from kindergarten through 12th grade on the district's brand-new turf field. Students enjoyed a series of fun activities designed to engage all ages, including a dance-off contest between their school buildings, a students versus teachers tug-of-war, and a cheer led by the high school's student government leaders.
