May 28—JOHNSTON — The football field at J-E-T Middle School was packed Saturday morning with hundreds of kids.

They ranged in age from the little ones practically swimming in their commemorative T-shirts all the way up to some of the area's high school talent, all running through drills and playing under the watchful eye of guys who played on those same fields on their way to the NFL.

It was more than just another successful outing for Camp Hamilton — it was the best turnout yet for Strom Thurmond grad Antonio Hamilton, currently with the Arizona Cardinals, and friends.
