A massive block of Activision Blizzard shares was recently sold off in a move that some are taking as a signal that the proposed sale to Microsoft might not happen due to regulatory concerns.SeekingAlpha discovered (via Ethan Gach) that a block of 3.7 million shares sold recently at a price of $72.25 per share, netting the seller $267,325,000. That is obviously a huge sum, but whoever sold these shares--the report mentioned it might have been Goldman Sachs--would be taking a huge loss against the proposed sale price to Microsoft.
