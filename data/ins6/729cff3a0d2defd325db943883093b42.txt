AntonioSolano The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter. Equinox Gold (NYSE:EQX) As a first-order effect, gold has done poorly in a rising real rate environment and a strong USD (although it is at all-time highs in other currencies). The gold price adjustment to real rates appears contemporaneous. Historically, for every 1% increase in 10-year real rates, there is a reasonably predictable 10% decline in USD-denominated gold price, all else equal. If that historical relationship holds, the current rise in real rates implies a 26% decrease in gold prices, which aligns with the 22% fall from the March highs of this year.
