North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, pushing it to a record number of launches in a single year under Kim Jong Un, who appears ready to further ratchet up tensions with his first test of a nuclear device since 2017.South Korea's military said it detected the missiles being fired between 9:08 a.m. and 9:43 a.m. from four different sites, including an area around Pyongyang's main airport toward waters off its east coast. The single-day ballistic barrage is likely the biggest since Kim took power a decade ago, with launches for this year beating the previous record of 24.
