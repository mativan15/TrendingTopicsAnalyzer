May 27—EBENSBURG, Pa. — Cambria County will soon be required to send more than $4 million of funding it received for rental assistance in the county back to the state.

Controller Ed Cernic said that his office received word from state officials that the county will be required to return $4.2 million of funding in the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP).

"They wanted us to return some funding because there are other places in the state that are using the funding up faster than we are so they wanted to redistribute some of the money," he said.
