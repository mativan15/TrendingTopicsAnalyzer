Brad Fittler knows he will continue to be linked to Canterbury as long as he refuses to officially rule himself out of contention and because of his close friendship with Phil Gould.

But Fittler also wants you to know he is being paid good money to do the two jobs he dreamed of as a kid.

The Bulldogs have Penrith assistant Cameron Ciraldo at the top of their wish list - but they are just as happy to keep things interesting by leaving a Panthers legend among their coaching contenders.

'I will never, ever rule out anything,' Fittler told the Herald.
