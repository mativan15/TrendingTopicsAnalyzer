"That ‘70s Show" actor Danny Masterson is set to face three women in court who said he allegedly raped them between 2001 and 2003. The 46-year-old actor, who is also a Scientologist, has been accused of allegedly raping the women in his Hollywood Hills home amid his rise to fame. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges. The three women were members of the Church of Scientology; however, they have left since Masterson's alleged actions. The "Ranch" actor has been free on a $3.3 million bond since his June 2020 arrest.
