Even the best stock pickers will make plenty of bad investments. And unfortunately for Freelancer Limited (ASX:FLN) shareholders, the stock is a lot lower today than it was a year ago. To wit the share price is down 68% in that time. We note that it has not been easy for shareholders over three years, either; the share price is down 57% in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 37% in the last 90 days.

It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two.
