jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Wabash National Corp. (NYSE:WNC) is a diversified semi-truck manufacturer that has been negatively impacted by disruptions caused by the global pandemic. Wabash reported lackluster operating results to end the prior fiscal year, so it should come as no surprise that the company's stock has underperformed the broader market so far in 2022 by a wide margin. However, as shown, WNC shares have performed well since the April 2022 lows. Moreover, I believe that the YTD underperformance has created a buying opportunity for investors that are interested in a company that has great long-term business prospects.
