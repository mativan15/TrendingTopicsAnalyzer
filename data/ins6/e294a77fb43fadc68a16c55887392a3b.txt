BOSTON–As the Philadelphia 76ers prepare for the 2022-23 season on Tuesday by taking on the rival Boston Celtics on the road and there is already a big question the team must answer and figure out.

Matisse Thybulle and the Sixers were unable to agree to a rookie extension before the 6 p.m. EDT Monday deadline and he will enter restricted free agency in the 2023 offseason. The defensive stud out of Washington will now have to play under a cloud of uncertainty in the upcoming season.

Coach Doc Rivers, a former NBA player, has never dealt with a situation like this as a player, but he understands the stress that can come with the position Thybulle is in and that it can affect him.
