GameStop's (GME) latest quarterly report was a mixed bag, showing outperformance on the top-line yet disappointing on the profitability profile.

In Q1, revenue hit $1.38 billion, amounting to a 7.8% year-over-year uptick while coming in ahead of the consensus estimate for $1.34 billion. However, adj. EPS of -$2.08 fell some way short of the loss of $1.45 a share Wall Street expected.

With management still not receptive to any questions regarding the details, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian says it is hard to know what lies behind the actual results.
