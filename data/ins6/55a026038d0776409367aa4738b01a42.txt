Tyler Morton looks disappointed after his error in the defeat at Wigan Athletic

Jon Dahl Tomasson says fewer unforced errors are vital to Rovers' efforts to improve away from home.

Rovers have now lost their last three away matches without scoring following Tuesday's defeat at Wigan Athletic.

Tomasson revealed his side made 31 unforced errors in the first half against the Latics, while the goal they conceded saw Tyler Morton lose the ball on the edge of his own area.

Rovers went through the 90 minutes without a shot on target, and have managed only 13 across their seven away matches which have brought six points.
