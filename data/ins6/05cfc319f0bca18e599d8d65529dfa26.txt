Peace and tranquillity in the border areas remain the basis for normal ties between India and China and 'new normals of posture' will inevitably lead to 'new normals of responses', External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday, amid the lingering standoff in eastern Ladakh.
Delving into Sino-India relations following the border row, he said the last few years have been a 'period of serious challenge', both for the relationship and for the prospects of Asia, noting that continuation of the current impasse will not benefit either India or China.
