When Jane Fonda was preparing for the galactic striptease that opens the 1968 sci-fi fantasy Barbarella, she plied herself with vodka. She was so terrified that she made sure she was completely drunk before the cameras started rolling. A bat flew in front of the lens, spoiling the shot, and the director, her then-husband Roger Vadim, insisted that she shoot it again the next day.'The take that was actually used, I was not only drunk. I was hungover too,' Fonda recalled in the 2018 documentary about her, Jane Fonda in Five Acts.
