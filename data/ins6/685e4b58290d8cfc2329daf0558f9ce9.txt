Liz Truss pulled out of a scheduled visit on Wednesday to a business in Hertfordshire with No10 remaining tight-lipped about the reason for the last-minute cancellation.

Just hours earlier, Downing Street said the Prime Minister was going on the visit, where she had been expected to take questions from broadcasters at the electronics business site.

Downing Street source later said Ms Truss's trip was cancelled due to 'Government business', but declined to elaborate further.

The trip was ditched shortly after she announced at Prime Minister's Questions that the Government was committed to the 'triple lock' on pensions.
