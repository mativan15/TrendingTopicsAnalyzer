May 30—The city of Springfield is allocating $320,000 in federal relief money to nine organizations that focus on arts, cultural and tourism programming as the pandemic had impacted those sectors.

The money is coming from the city's allocation of $44.2 million in American Rescue Plan funding that aims to provide local municipalities relief due to the strains caused by the pandemic.

The vast majority of the city's allocation is going towards projects that aim to have a long-term impact on the community, including building new fire stations, infrastructure related to water and sewer utilities and projects aimed at addressing homelessness and creating more affordable housing options.
