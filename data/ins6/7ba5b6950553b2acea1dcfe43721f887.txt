Terra supporters have voted to approve founder Do Kwon's plan for a new blockchain for its luna cryptocurrency, without reviving the failed stablecoin terraUSD.The plan called for a hard fork of the existing Terra blockchain. The new community-owned chain will now continue with the name "Terra", and its native token will take on the "luna" name. The older chain will be known as "Terra Classic" and its token renamed "luna classic". The proposal ditches the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, whose collapse helped spur a wider sell-off in crypto markets.
