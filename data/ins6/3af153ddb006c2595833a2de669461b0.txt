The Bank of England has said it will delay the sale of Government bonds to November 1 due to the fiscal announcement later this month.The central bank had been due to start buying UK government bonds, called gilts, on October 31.It came as the bank denied reports earlier on Tuesday that it would postpone the bond sale programme in an attempt to allow battered gilt markets to recover following the mini-budget chaos.'The first gilt sales operation was scheduled to take place on October 31 and proceed thereafter,' the Bank said in a statement on Tuesday evening.
