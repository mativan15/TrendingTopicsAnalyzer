HOUSTON — So far this season, the Yankees have overcome a terrible stretch in August and two elimination games against Cleveland in the ALDS.
Now, they're facing their toughest task of all: coming back from two games down to the Astros in the ALCS.
Luis Severino gave up a three-run homer to Alex Bregman in the third inning in Thursday's Game 2 at Minute Maid Park and the Yankee offense was quiet once again, as they dropped a second straight game to start the series, 3-2.
They'll turn to Gerrit Cole, who beat the Guardians twice during the ALDS, to try to get them back in the series in Game 3 on Saturday in The Bronx.
