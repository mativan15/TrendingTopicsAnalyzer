CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Nick Biddison and Carson Jones both hit two of Virginia Tech's six home runs, combining for nine runs batted and powering top-seeded Virginia Tech to an 18-6 romp over No. 12 seed Clemson during pool play of the ACC Tournament on Thursday night. Virginia Tech (41-11) will close out pool play against No. 8 seed North Carolina in the nightcap on Friday. It didn't take long for the Hokies to take control, putting on a two-out third-inning power display that wasn't over until seven runs had scored.
