EDMONTON - Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she is apologizing for what she calls 'ill-informed comments on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.'

In April, Smith said the only answer for Ukraine is neutrality, adding that she understands why Russia would have a concern with a western-aligned Ukraine armed with nuclear weapons on its doorstep.

Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons in the 1990s.

In February, she wrote that two regions of Ukraine feel more affinity to Russia.

On Monday, Alberta's Opposition NDP called on her to apologize for her 'tone deaf' and 'cruel' remarks, noting that Alberta is home to about a quarter of all Canadians of Ukrainian heritage.
