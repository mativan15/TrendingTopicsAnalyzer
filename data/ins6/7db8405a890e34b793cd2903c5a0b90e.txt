The first inning of Game 2 of this Guardians-Yankees AL Division Series played like a continuation. Not just of Game 1, but also of the past six years. An AL Central team had shown up in front of the Yankees in October and there was inevitability over where this was heading.
Nestor Cortes went from two on and no out to open the first to a nine-pitch scoreless inning. In the bottom half, Giancarlo Stanton went from furious at home-plate ump Jeremie Rehak for missing what should have been ball four with two outs and one on to regaining his composure and hitting the subsequent full-count Shane Bieber fastball for a homer.
