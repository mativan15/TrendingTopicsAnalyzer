Amazon's (AMZN -2.52%) shares are set to open on Monday for a much lower price than we're used to seeing. That's because the retail giant is completing a 20-for-1 stock split. The move doesn't change the market value of the company -- or the value of your investment in Amazon. But, in offering current investors more shares, Amazon is bringing down the value of each individual share.
Splits make it easier for a broader range of investors to invest in stocks that have climbed to high levels, often into the thousands of dollars.
