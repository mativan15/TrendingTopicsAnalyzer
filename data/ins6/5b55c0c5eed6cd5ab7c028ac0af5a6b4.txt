Basketball fans in Calgary now know the name of the newest Canadian Elite Basketball League franchise that will play its home games at WinSport. Calgary's team will be known as the Surge. The CEBL announced Aug. 17 that the Guelph Nighthawks would be moving to Calgary for the start of the 2023 campaign.  Fans had the opportunity to submit their own ideas through the league's website leading up to the decision on the team's identity. That survey was open to fans since the league announced the team would move to Calgary.
