$1.5 billion US is a lot of money by any measure. However, the reality is that Glencore is making so much in this climate of metal scarcity and elevated prices, that they likely won't have a hard time accommodating the fine. So when metal market news broke of their massive, three nation fine, there was not much reaction. But as we'll see, the money may not be the real concern.

Glencore is now an FTSE 100 company, which means it is under much more public scrutiny than when it was a freewheeling, privately-owned trader.
