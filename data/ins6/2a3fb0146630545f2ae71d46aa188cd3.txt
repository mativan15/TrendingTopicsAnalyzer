Tesla stock fell Thursday morning, a day after the company reported softer than expected third quarter earnings while chief executive Elon Musk noted demand concerns. Shares were down 5.75% shortly after the opening bell, after being down as much as 6.6%. Tesla's third quarter sales were $21.5 billion, below analyst forecasts of $22.1 billion. Tesla told investors Wednesday that the company would fall short of its goal of 50% growth in vehicle deliveries, citing problems with getting cars from assembly to customers.
