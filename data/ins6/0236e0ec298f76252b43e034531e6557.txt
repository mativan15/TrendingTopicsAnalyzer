EnchantedFairy/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIf you are looking for a roller coaster ride, you should consider The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). I'm not referring to the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride at EPCOT. I'm talking about share price action. As 2020 dawned, DIS traded for close to $150 a share. Investors then rode the stock down to a pandemic inspired low in the mid 80s, at which point the shares trundled up to an all-time high of around $203. The stock then zoomed down to a 52-week low of $99.
