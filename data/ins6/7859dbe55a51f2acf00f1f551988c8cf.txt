TOKYO (AP) — Japanese two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani arrived home on Tuesday and was critical of his Los Angeles Angels team missing the Major League Baseball playoffs again.

In an interview at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, he said it was 'a good season for me personally.' Not so good for the Angels, though.

Without solid support for former AL MVPs Ohtani and Mike Trout, the Angels suffered a seventh consecutive losing season, and missed the playoffs for an eighth consecutive year.

'I have to say that August and September in particular felt longer to me than last year,' Ohtani said, speaking in Japanese.
