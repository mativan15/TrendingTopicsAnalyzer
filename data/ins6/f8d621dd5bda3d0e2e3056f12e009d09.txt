The protests in several parts of Chad were to demand a return to civilian rule

There has been an overnight curfew in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, and other towns, in the wake of violent clashes between pro-democracy protesters and security forces on Thursday.

Around 50 people have died, the military-led government says.

In an unusual move, the US embassy to Chad posted a photo of its ambassador kneeling on a blood-stained street.

A US statement expressed deep concern and called for de-escalation but the opposition says protests will continue.
