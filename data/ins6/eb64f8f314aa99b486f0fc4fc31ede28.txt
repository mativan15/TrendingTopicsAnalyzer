STORY: Chinese pigs are going high-tech.

Or at least so is the effort to breed them.

Around 100 farms there have enrolled in a state-led bid to improve the genetics of China's hog herd.

It's part of a drive to hit self-sufficiency for the world's top consumer of pork, and deliver cheaper meat for consumers.

The aim is to develop pigs that grow faster, need less feed, and produce bigger litters.

BGG in Inner Mongolia is among the farms taking part.

Head breeder Hao Wenjie says breeding from foreign hogs isn't always right for China:

"Europeans may decide this type of pig is the best according to their eating habits, understanding of pigs and market conditions.
