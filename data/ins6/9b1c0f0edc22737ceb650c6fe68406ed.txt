There's an automotive adage that says the best Porsche 911 is the one you can afford, and indeed, the standard Carrera coupe is really stinkin' good. Making its debut Tuesday, the new Carrera T builds off that intrinsic 911 greatness, adding a number of performance goodies from higher-spec Porsches that make it the absolute ace of base.The new Carrera T has the same 3.0-liter twin-turbo flat-6 engine as the standard 911, making 379 horsepower and 331 pound-feet of torque. But while the base 911 Carrera can only be paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, the T comes with the optional seven-speed manual found on the Carrera S.
