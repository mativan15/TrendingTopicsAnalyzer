Report: Panthers listening to Christian McCaffrey trade offers originally appeared on NBC Sports Bayarea

An NFL superstar could soon be on the move.

The Carolina Panthers are listening to offers for running back Christian McCaffrey ahead of the NFL's Nov. 1 trade deadline, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Saturday.

The Panthers, however, are adamant they will hold onto McCaffrey past the deadline if they don't receive "a real offer" with "a high draft pick or multiple picks," according to Schefter.
