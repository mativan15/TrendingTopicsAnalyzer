Second-year Detroit Lions defensive tackle Levi Onwuzurike will miss the 2022 season after undergoing back surgery during last week's bye.

Lions coach Dan Campbell said Onwuzurike's decision to have surgery was "a last resort" due to disc problems that have persisted throughout his career.

A second-round pick out of Washington in 2021, Onwuzurike missed most of training camp his rookie year with a back injury that dated to his college days and has not played this season.
