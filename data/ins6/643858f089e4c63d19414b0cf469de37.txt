Billionaire Elon Musk is being sued by Twitter investors claiming he manipulated the company's stock price to go down.
The CEO of electric carmaker Tesla is in the middle of a $44 billion takeover bid for the social media platform.
Twitter investors are suing Musk for damages claiming that Musk saved himself $156 million by failing to disclose that he had purchased more than 5% of Twitter by March 14. 
The investors said Musk continued to buy stock after that, and ultimately disclosed in early April that he owned 9.
