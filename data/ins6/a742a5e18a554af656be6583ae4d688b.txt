Erik ten Hag has urged his Manchester United players not to lose their concentration and discipline in the run up to the World Cup by sticking to his strict rules. The Red Devils have at least nine fixtures in all competitions to play before the Premier League is brought to a halt in November to allow the international tournament to take place - starting with Sunday's Premier League game against Newcastle at Old Trafford. Ten Hag has a reputation for being a strict manager. Previous reports suggest players must turn up for training and meetings on time, and they aren't allowed to use phones during meals.
