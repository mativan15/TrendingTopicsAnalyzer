When I was a kid, my family didn't have a ton of extra money, but we splurged a little and frequently ordered pizza or Chinese food delivery on Friday nights. Especially during the school year, it was a great way to start the weekend, and while I've tried to continue this tradition as an adult in my own place, I've had to reevaluate because of the cost.
