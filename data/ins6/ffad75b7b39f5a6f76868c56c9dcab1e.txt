Seeking a boost at wide receiver, the Ravens will sign veteran DeSean Jackson to the practice squad, his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told reporters Tuesday.

Jackson, a three-time Pro Bowl selection whose production has fallen off in recent years, worked out for the Ravens on Tuesday. He said last week, during an appearance on the 'I Am Athlete' podcast, that he was interested in playing for the Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles or Green Bay Packers this season.

Jackson skipped training camp this summer and went unsigned over the first month of the NFL season.
