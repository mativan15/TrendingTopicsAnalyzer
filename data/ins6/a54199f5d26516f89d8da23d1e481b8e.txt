Konami has officially announced four new Silent Hill games, as well as a new film by Christophe Gans called Return To Silent Hill.
One of the most leaked games in gaming history has finally been officially announced, as Konami confirm that they are in fact doing a Silent Hill 2 remake.
Despite earlier rumours, there's no hint of it being release episodically but everything else proved to be true, including the involvement of original artist Masahiro Ito, composer Akira Yamaoka, and Polish developer Bloober Team.
