For the first time in 24 seasons, the San Diego Padres are in the NLCS and this time they're taking on the Philadelphia Phillies.
A lot has changed since Tony Gwynn, and Trevor Hoffman's squad marched to the fall classic in the last millennium, but one thing has remained consistent — the fanbase is as strong as ever.
That being said, Yu Darvish, Manny Machado, Juan Soto and co. will need all of the Padres faithful at all home games against the Phillies to ensure they bring their absolute best to the series.
