It's fall, a time to cozy up with a mug of tea and a good book and then realize you…don't want to read a book. What you're really in the mood for are fall movies. (If you've already binged Gilmore Girls, that is.)

So, to the theaters? Maybe. The season is traditionally when some of the best movies of the year come to theaters. After the studios make their money with summer blockbusters, they roll out their awards contenders from Labor Day to Christmas. But there are only so many new movies to watch, and we wanna keep that golden-leaf energy every day!

Thankfully, there are more than enough good fall movies, new and old, to keep us in the mood all season long.
