A father who was paralysed in the Manchester Arena attack has said climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is just the start of his plan to 'move mountains' for disabled people.Martin Hibbert, 45, will fly to Tanzania next week and embark on the seven-day trek in a specially adapted wheelchair in the hope of raising £1 million for the Spinal Injuries Association (SIA).He said: 'This is actually going to be the easiest part of it, even though we're climbing Kilimanjaro.'The actual work starts when we get back in terms of the bigger message about wanting to change the landscape for disabled people, especially people with spinal cord injuries.
