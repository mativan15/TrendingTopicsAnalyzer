A vehicle containing two people crashed into an alligator-infested pond in Miami on Friday, leading to a complicated rescue mission involving rescue divers and police snipers, according to local reports.

Nieves Matos, 80, and her son, Mario Laza, 56, were driving along the Florida Turnpike when their vehicle lost control and overturned, veering off the roadway into a pond, a Florida Highway Patrol spokesperson told WSVN 7 News.

Some witnesses of the crash dove into the water to help, WSVN reported.
