Kelly and Kate's Isle of Wight challenge.

TWO sisters walked around the Isle of Wight to raise money for Parkinson's UK and their stepdad, who suffers from the disease.

Kelly Pavitt, from Portsmouth, and Kate Pavitt, from the Island, were devasted when their stepdad, John, was diagnosed with Parkinson's a year ago.

The sisters decided to take on a challenge to raise funds by walking around the Island – a distance of 70 miles – in three days, with no prior training.

Kelly and Kate will use some of the money raised from their challenge to purchase a mobility scooter, so John can get out and enjoy life again, and the rest will be donated to the Parkinson's charity.
