(WSET) — After 81 years, a lot of good meals, and many smiles from restaurant-goers who say they've been treated like family — The Roanoker Restaurant closed its doors Sunday afternoon. Earlier this month, owner Butch Craft posted on social media, with what she called a heavy heart, that the restaurant in Downtown Roanoke would soon close. She said she tried to sell the business but with no luck. She thanked loyal customers for their decades of support.
