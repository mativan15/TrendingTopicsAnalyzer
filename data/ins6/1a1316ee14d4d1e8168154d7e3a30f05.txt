Jurgen Klopp has made five changes to his Liverpool lineup for today's clash with Man City, with injuries limiting his selection for a high-profile meeting.

The Reds head into today's tie 13 points behind their long-time rivals in the Premier League, having only won two of their eight games so far.

But a 7-1 thrashing of Rangers in midweek served as a major boost to confidence on Merseyside, which they will need as they take on the free-scoring champions.

Klopp is once again bound by fitness issues throughout his squad as he names his side to face City, with Alisson among those able to keep his place.
