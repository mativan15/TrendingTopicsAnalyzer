hatman12 Barclays (NYSE:BCS) is currently valued at ~0.4x tangible book value. It is also poised to deliver a return on tangible equity greater than 10%. This translates to an earnings yield of ~25%, or a PER of ~4. Notably, it is also buying back shares and is expected to continue doing so in the near future. For a bank that's earning above its cost of capital, buying back shares at such a discount to book is highly attractive. In my view, management should be buying shares hands over fist at such valuations.
