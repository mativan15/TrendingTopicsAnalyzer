30 years! Wow, that's a lot of Mortal Kombat. As I reflect on the history of Mortal Kombat and the fact that I've been a part of the franchise for its entire history, I feel incredibly grateful to have been on this ride. I am also in awe of how this little game we put out in 1992 has survived and thrived to become a bona fide cultural touchstone with so many people contributing to deliver on the promise of over-the-top martial arts Kombat and, of course, incredibly imaginative finishing moves. Also, looking back over the history of the game and the tools and tech we've used along the way to create it, I'm struck by where we were when we started, and where we find ourselves today.
