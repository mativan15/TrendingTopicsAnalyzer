Dubai: Mass transit solutions provider Swvl has announced to reduce its headcount by approximately 32% to enhance efficiency and cut central costs to turn cash flow positive in 2023, as economic downturn hits companies and tech startups worldwide. The Dubai-headquartered mobility startup has over 1,330 employees and laying off 32% of its workforce means that over 400 people will lose their jobs. "Such reductions will focus on roles which have been automated by investments in the company's engineering and product and support functions," the startup said in a statement late on Monday.
