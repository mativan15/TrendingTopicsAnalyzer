Pensioners will be £22,000 worse off over their retirement if the Government refuses to honour its state pension triple lock promise. 
New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has refused to rule out abandoning the policy that protects millions of retirees from inflation. 
When asked yesterday in the House of Commons to reaffirm his commitment to the state pension triple lock, Mr Hunt said he would not make 'any commitments to individual policies'. 
The triple lock, which Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged to reinstate in her leadership campaign, promises to increase the state pension every April in line with the highest of the previous September's inflation rate, wage growth or 2.
