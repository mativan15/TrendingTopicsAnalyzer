The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has spoken of 'mistakes' made by the Liz Truss administration as he predicted 'difficult decisions ahead'.Appearing on Sky News on Saturday, in his first interview since replacing Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, the former health secretary signalled he would have a 'clean slate' when it came to the budget, and vowed to be 'completely honest with the country' amid rumours that Truss has only weeks left in No 10.Hunt, who was parachuted into No 11 in a bid to restore order to Truss's ailing government, also suggested that some taxes could rise, as he promised to bring stability to the UK in the wake of the disastrous mini-budget.
