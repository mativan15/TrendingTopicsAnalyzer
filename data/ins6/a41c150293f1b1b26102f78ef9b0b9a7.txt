Rod Stewart has put up a Ukrainian family of seven and promised to pay their rent and bills for a year after they fled their war-torn homeland.The legendary British singer has helped husband and wife Rostyslav and Olena and their children Taras, 17, Kostya, 16, Roman, 13, Mariia, 10, and Dymtro, two, start a new life in the UK by finding them a house in Berkshire, furnishing it and paying the bills.The singer said he usually keeps his 'charitable efforts nice and quiet,' but hoped that by making his actions public, they might inspire others to help too.
