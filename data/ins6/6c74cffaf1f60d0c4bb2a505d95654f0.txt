What to expect during today's Patriots practice

FOXBORO – We'll get another sneak peak of the Patriots on Tuesday when the team holds its fourth OTAs session of the offseason. This marks the second open practice to the local media. We'll see five practices overall before training camp starts up this summer.

What: Day 4 of Patriots OTAs

Where: Gillette Stadium practice fields

When: Tuesday starting at 11:30 a.m.

These practices aren't padded, so there's no contact, but it's a nice preview of the 2022 roster and how the coaching staff views its returning players and newcomers.
