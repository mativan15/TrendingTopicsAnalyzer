On Tesla's third-quarter earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said the company is not cutting production "in any meaningful way, recession or not recession." "We're very pedal to the metal come rain or shine," Musk said. Regarding Musk's proposed $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, he said that the company "sort of languished for a long time but has incredible potential." Elon Musk sees elements of a recession in China and Europe and says that the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates by too much.
