No Governor can dismiss an individual Minister from a State Cabinet unless recommended by the Chief Minister, said P.D.T. Achary, former Secretary General of Lok Sabha.Responding to the controversial tweet of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Mr. Achary said though the Governor is the appointing authority of the Chief Minister, he cannot appoint any person of his choice as a State Minister. A State Minister can be appointed only on the recommendation of the Chief Minister and if a Minister has to be removed from the post, it can only be on the advice of the Chief Minister, he said.
