Khanchit Khirisutchalual/iStock via Getty Images A Quick Take On DoubleVerify DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV) went public in April 2021, raising approximately $359 million in gross proceeds in an IPO that was priced at $27.00 per share. The firm provides an enterprise digital media platform for online advertising monitoring and analysis. Despite the firm's uneven net results earnings over the past several quarters, I'm impressed by its growth path and breakeven earnings (or better) along with its improving guidance for 2022.
