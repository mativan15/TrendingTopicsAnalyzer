The Chicago Bears were defeated by the Washington Commanders, 12-7, on Thursday Night Football, where they dropped to 2-4 on the season.

It was another demoralizing loss for the Bears against a bad Commanders team, where there were opportunities for Chicago to pull out the win. The Bears red zone offense went 0-for-3 and managed just seven points. Chicago's defense played their best game of the season, but another muffed punt ultimately cost the Bears.

But there were some encouraging (and not-so-encouraging) outings coming out of this game.
