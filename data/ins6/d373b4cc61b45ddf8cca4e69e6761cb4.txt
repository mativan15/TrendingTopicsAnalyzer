Eyes firmly set on breaking their five-year-old title jinx in the Sultan of Johor Cup, India would look to begin their campaign against hosts Malaysia in a positive note in the U-21 men's hockey tournament.
The Indians have won the age group tournament twice 2013 and 2014 and finished second best four times in 2012, 2015, 2018 and the last edition of the event in 2019. The tournament was not held in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Best known for producing top-level international players, the invitational tournament serves as a perfect platform for hockey-playing nations to test their bench strength.
