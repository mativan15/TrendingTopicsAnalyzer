The southern African kingdom of Lesotho went to the polls on 7 October 2022. Or at least some of its voters did. Turnout was at an all-time low of 38% of registered voters. Many are expressing discontent with politics in Lesotho by refusing to participate. Those that did come out were in an anti-incumbent mood.

This turnout was almost 10 percentage points below the 47% who voted in the last elections in 2017.

Sam Ntsokoane Matekane, a wealthy businessman who has never been engaged formally in politics before this year, emerged as the new prime minister.
