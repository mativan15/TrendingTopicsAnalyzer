Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is selling its U.K.-based student housing business to Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Ltd. and U.S. property manager Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC.

Brookfield got into the U.K. student housing market six years ago and helped develop what is now Student Roost.

Brad Hyler, head of Brookfield's European real estate business, says the Toronto-based company has transformed Student Roost into one of the U.K.'s largest purpose-built student accommodation providers.
