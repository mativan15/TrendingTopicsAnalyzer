Source: Terminator Genisys (2015)Judgment Day, for those of you who don't know, refers to the day that the artificial intelligence — Skynet — becomes self-aware and starts a nuclear strike on humanity, killing three billion people. Due to a lot of time travel in the Terminator Universe, the date of J-Day has been altered several times. The latest date, as of today, is the 18th of June, 2021.All this makes for a really good sci-fi time travel dystopian story! But, in reality, how close are we to building our own Skynet? How close are we to achieving Artificial General Intelligence? Should the studio make another movie to push the date further (one last time)?What is Artificial General Intelligence? Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the idea that a computer could think and reason like a human across multiple problems.
