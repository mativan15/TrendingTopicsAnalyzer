Reno, Nevada, also known as the 'Biggest Little City in the World,' has jumped on the Web3 bandwagon and is rolling out a new blockchain-based pilot program that promises to do what the blockchain does best: keep digital records of stuff.It's the highest-profile city yet to begin storing records in this way. Officials hope the project, cheekily dubbed Reno's 'Biggest Little Blockchain,' will improve 'clarity and transparency' in the city's record-keeping systems, according to a press release published Thursday.
