Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) Wednesday reported a beat and raise quarter but warned of a revenue hit due to U.S. restrictions on China exports. Needham On Lam Research Analyst Quinn Bolton reiterated a Hold rating. Lam Research delivered a beat across the board, driven by CSBG strength, while upside in the ongoing quarter is 'likely due to shipments out of backlog and deferred revs,' Bolton said in a note. "Lam guided the total China export control impact to be $2-$2.5bn for CY23, and the loss of this profitable China business will be a GM headwind,' the analyst mentioned.
