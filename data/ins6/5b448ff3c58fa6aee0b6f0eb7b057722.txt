UK music lovers are still reeling from the announcement that Glastonbury is massively hiking its prices for the 2022 festival.
One of the world's most famous music events, the five-day festival returned in 2022 after a two-year break thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic.
However next year's Glastonbury has soared in price, with tickets rising from £270 this year to an eye-watering £340.
With everyone already feeling the pinch from the cost of living crisis, the public has already threatened to boycott next year's festival – rumoured to include Eminem as a headline act.
