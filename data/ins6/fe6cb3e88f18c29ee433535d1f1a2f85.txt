The U.S. job market remained tight last month as employers struggled to find people to wait tables, staff factories and guard swimming pools. The Labor Department said Friday that U.S. businesses added 390,000 jobs in May, as the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%. Job gains for March and April were revised down by a total of 22,000 jobs.
