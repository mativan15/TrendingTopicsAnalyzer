Ohio lawmakers approved a plan to spend $3.5 billion over the next two years on projects at parks, schools, prisons and more.

The Ohio House voted 82-8 in favor of a capital budget bill that calls for spending $3.5 billion on improving school safety, upgrading parks, investing in community projects and helping Intel build a semiconductor plant in Licking County.

The Senate is expected to vote on the capital budget later today and then it'll be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine.

The capital budget bill, which is done every two years, pays for bricks-and-mortar projects and includes earmarks for community projects.
