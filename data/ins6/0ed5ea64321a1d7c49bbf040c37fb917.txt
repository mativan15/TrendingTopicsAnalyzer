Scotiabank recently called for more special and variable dividends to be initiated across the energy sector through 2023.

Tourmaline Oil (TOU.TO), Canada's largest natural gas producer, is boosting its dividend for the fifth time since the beginning of last year.

The Calgary-based company announced late Wednesday that its quarterly payout will jump 12.5 per cent to $0.225 per share from $0.20 as of June 30. As part of its commitment to reward shareholders, Tourmaline has also issued three special dividends since 2021, most recently a payment of $1.
