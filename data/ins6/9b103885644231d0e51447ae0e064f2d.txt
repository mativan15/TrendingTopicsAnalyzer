As the cost of living crisis continues and inflation sits at nine percent, any extra cash could be vital for people on low incomes who are feeling the financial squeeze. By successfully claiming Pension Credit, thousands of pensioners could be due a cash boost each month.Claiming Pension Credit could also lead to an additional cost of living payment in the autumn. Last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £650 one-off payment for people on means-tested benefits, which includes Pension Credit, to be paid in two instalments for eligible households in July and autumn.
