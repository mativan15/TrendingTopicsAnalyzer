Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed charges against the 50th suspect in what has been alleged as a sprawling $250 million fraud perpetrated by a federally funded child nutrition program in the Twin Cities during the coronavirus pandemic.

Abduljabar Hussein, 42, was charged in a 20-count indictment with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, federal programs bribery and money laundering.

The Shakopee resident was named along with his wife, Mekfira Hussein, 38, who was arrested and charged by criminal complaint last month.
