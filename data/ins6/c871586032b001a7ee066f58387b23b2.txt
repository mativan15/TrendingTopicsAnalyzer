Are you watching The Watcher? Netflix's new creepy crime series from producer Ryan Murphy has jumped to No 1 on the streaming service just a day after it premiered. It tells the story of a picture-perfect family that moves into a picturesque suburban house, only to be terrorised by a mysterious letter-writer known as The Watcher. If the skin-crawling tale sounds like something out of Murphy's American Horror Story, you might be surprised to find out that it's based on an incident that really happened in Westfield, New Jersey, in 2014.
