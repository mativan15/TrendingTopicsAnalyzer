Danaher (DHR) reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, as all three segments of the health technology company posted strong gains. Revenue rose 10% to $7.66 billion for the third quarter, well above estimates of $7.14 billion, according to Refinitiv. That growth also outpaced the high-single-digit forecast reaffirmed at the company's investor day in September. Earnings increased 7% to $2.56 per share, exceeding the consensus estimate of $2.25 per share. Even when excluding the impact of declining Covid testing sales — but keeping in revenues from products that support vaccines and therapeutics — Danaher's base business realized organic growth of 8.
