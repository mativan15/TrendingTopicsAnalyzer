Former US president Donald Trump's contention that the 2020 presidential election was rigged has hit the big screen.At several hundred cinemas across the country a film called 2,000 Mules sets out to show that Democratic operatives (or mules) were paid to collect and drop off absentee ballots illegally in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
