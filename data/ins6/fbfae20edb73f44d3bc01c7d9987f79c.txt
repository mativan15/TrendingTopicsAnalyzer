Jun. 4—Daviess County Middle School, 1415 E. Fourth St., closed last month.

In August, students are scheduled to move to the new $27.85-million middle school being built in Gateway Commons.

Four years ago, the Daviess County Board of Education approved the sale of the old school property to Owensboro Grain for $1.5 million.

Helen Cornell, Owensboro Grain's president and CEO, said Friday that the sale hasn't closed yet.

She said the company is buying the 11.9-acre site because of its prime riverfront location.
