Which is the best way to handle an individual retirement account (IRA)? Let it sit and earn money, then pay taxes on the withdrawals in retirement? Or roll it over to a Roth IRA? Should I pay the taxes now and get tax-free money later? And can I have the taxes due on the rollover taken from the rollover account itself?

While taxes play a big part here, they aren't the only factor at play.
