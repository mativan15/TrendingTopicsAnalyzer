According to the NY Post, when asked about Elon Musk and his criticism of Democrat-run cities, Breed referred to him as "the person who got a ton of tax breaks in California and decided to take that money and run.' This comes after he reportedly received over $3.2 billion worth of direct and indirect subsidies from California since 2009 and then decided to move the Tesla headquarters from California to Texas.
