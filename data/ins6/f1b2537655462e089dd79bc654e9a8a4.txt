The popular e-girl streamer, Amouranth, has taken to Twitter to elaborate on her success on Twitch through the hate.
Amouranth, the ever-popular streamer, has begun to wind down her involvement with erotic content, with plans to close her OnlyFans account in June despite the $1 million dollars a month it brings in at the moment. Instead, her plan is to refocus on a more mainstream audience.
Her personal Twitter page, which uses her real name of Kaitlyn Siragusa, is where she posts a lot about her business dealings and is fairly transparent with what she's doing.
