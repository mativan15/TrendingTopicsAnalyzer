A recent Microsoft (MSFT) survey found that employers and workers still disagree over whether remote work boosts or kills productivity. In a new interview with Yahoo Finance, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said companies should consult the data to determine workers' performance — rather than assume they're getting more work done in the office.The company's recent Work Trends Study, which surveyed 20,000 people across 11 countries, found 87% of employees say they're more productive remotely or with a mix of in-office and remote work.
