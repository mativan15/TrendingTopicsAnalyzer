New Hope Group's expansion of the New Acland coal mine near Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, was on Thursday granted a water licence, clearing the final hurdle for work to start. The green light comes after a long political and legal battle to stop the project going ahead, and after the government pledged to phase out coal-fired power generation at its public plants by 2035.
