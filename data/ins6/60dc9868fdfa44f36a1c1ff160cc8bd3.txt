It's been a whole year since Sky launched its long-awaited, satellite-free TV offering, Sky Glass, in the UK – and now the company is bringing the streaming-based benefits of Glass to those who'd rather not shell out for a whole new TV.

Sky Stream, which was first announced back in April, is essentially Sky Glass condensed into a drinks coaster-sized streaming puck. By plugging one of these devices into your current home display via HDMI, you'll get access to all the channels, shows and apps currently offered by Sky – including Sky Atlantic and Netflix – through Wi-Fi alone, eliminating the need for an external dish.
