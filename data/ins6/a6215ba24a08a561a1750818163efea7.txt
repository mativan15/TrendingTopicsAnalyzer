Papero brings decades of experience in child development and a passion for creating opportunities for young learners. With significant expertise leading early learning programs and a distinguished career teaching early childhood education at the university level, she is uniquely qualified to lead CHS at the early stages of the initiative and build an engaging team at CHS Hershey.

"Annie is an inspirational and gifted advocate for children's needs during the formative years and sees child development as more than just meeting educational requirements and milestones," said Senate Alexander, Executive Director of CHS.
