The Shaw Trust Disability Power 100 is published every year and celebrates the most influential disabled people in the UK. The 2022 list is published on the 17th October, following a delay to allow for the mourning of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The Disability Power 100 List recognises success, inclusion and advocacy. It highlights the pioneers, the changemakers and influencers opening doors for future generations.
