At San Diego Comic-Con in July, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson had other people raising eyebrows when he said that his long-awaited superhero debut in Black Adam would be the beginning of 'a new era' for the DC Extended Universe. The questions naturally followed: What did he mean? And what would that kind of reset mean for the remainder of DCEU's roster, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the rest of the Justice League, Suicide Squad, Shazam and so on.

As Black Adam neared theaters, though, Johnson clarified that statement in a recent sit-down with Yahoo Entertainment (watch above).
