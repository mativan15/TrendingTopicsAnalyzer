We can be real about where the Oregon Ducks stand going into the first game of the 2022 season. With a matchup against the Georgia Bulldogs, the defending national champions, on a 'neutral site' in Atlanta, it's fair to say that the Ducks are going to be an underdog going into the game. They have a young roster and will be led by a first-time head coach. A win would be among the best achievements in Oregon football history.
Despite that, are we sure they aren't being undervalued a bit going into the marquee matchup?
