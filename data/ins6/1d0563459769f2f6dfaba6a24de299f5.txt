NEWS vending has become highly diversified in the modern world. Of old, the town crier and the beggar going from European village to village purveyed the news. Their companion in commerce was the peddler of oddments with his pack on his back. The town crier was more or less a subsidized news merchant. The beggar was a free agent, except that the better his story, the better bed and board he got. Thus lying early became highly profitable in merchandising the news. But after the peddler put down his pack and opened a store he found beside him the town crier or the beggar, or both, running a printing office.
