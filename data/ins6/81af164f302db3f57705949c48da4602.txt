By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:11 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 01:11 EDT, 21 October 2022 NSW Labor has stood by its decision to send Tania Mihailuk to the back benches before she quit the party months out from the state election. The Bankstown MP told parliament on Thursday she was joining the crossbench as Labor had "not cleaned up its act" and wasn't ready to govern by endorsing a candidate she believes is corrupt. "I'm left with no other choice," she said. Ms Mihailuk was sacked from shadow cabinet in September after using parliamentary privilege to link Labor upper house candidate and Canterbury-Bankstown mayor Khal Asfour to disgraced party powerbroker Eddie Obeid.
