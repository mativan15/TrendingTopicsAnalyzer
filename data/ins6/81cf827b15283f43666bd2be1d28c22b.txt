Glatfelter Corporation's (NYSE:GLT) investors are due to receive a payment of US$0.14 per share on 1st of August. This means the annual payment is 6.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry.

While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Glatfelter's stock price has reduced by 39% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield.
