A trio of Conservative MPs have called for Liz Truss to step down as prime minister as of Sunday night. Crispin Blunt was the first to go public, declaring he did not think Truss could weather the current economic crisis, followed by Andrew Bridgen, who said 'our country, its people and our party deserve better.' The third, Jamie Wallis of Bridgend and Porthcrawl, lamented that Truss had 'undermined Britain's economic credibility and fractured our party irreparably.' Wallis, who came out as transgender earlier this year, excoriated his party for 'weaponizing' the trans issue 'in order to score cheap political points' and suggested he would leave the party entirely if Truss was not removed.
