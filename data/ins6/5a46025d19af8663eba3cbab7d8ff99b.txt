Around 17 lakh Maharashtra government employees will get the salary for the month of November before Diwali, by October 22. Pensioners will also get their monthly pension by the same day. The decision was approved Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday.
A statement from Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's office said the employees and officers would have gotten their October salary and pensioners their pension in November, but the government took the decision to disburse the payments early due to Diwali.
