There aren't normally many gaming deals during the Memorial Day sales, but this year PlayStation has actually been kind enough to bless us with a few thanks to the Days of Play sale running all the way until June 8. That means that there are plenty of gaming deals to check out during the Memorial Day weekend, even if they aren't directly linked to any retailer's Memorial Day discounts. For now, we've got plenty of PlayStation deals to check out over the weekend, including $39.99 for Ratchet & Clank, 20% off DualSense Controllers, and PS5 stock expected by June 2 at Walmart.
