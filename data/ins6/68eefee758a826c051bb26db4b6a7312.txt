The NSE Nifty 50 index was 0.52% higher at 17,275.45 as of 0510 GMT, and the S&P BSE Sensex advanced 0.56% to 58,244.997. "Rallies triggered by market positioning will be temporary because there won't be any follow-on fundamental support for the rally," said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
