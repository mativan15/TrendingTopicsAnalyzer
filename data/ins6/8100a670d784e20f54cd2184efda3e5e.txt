Matthew Wright has criticised the lavish ongoing festivities for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, while many in the UK are struggling with the cost of living crisis. 
Matthew, 56, joined Gyles Brandreth, 74, on This Morning as they went through the day's biggest news stories with Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary. 
Of course, the Jubilee was at the top of the list, after events got underway on Thursday, with Trooping Of The Colour kicking everything off.
