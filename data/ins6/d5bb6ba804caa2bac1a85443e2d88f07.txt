Mark Steward is stepping down as the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's executive director of enforcement and market oversight, the regulator announced on Tuesday.

In January 2021, the FCA became the supervisory body for anti-money laundering compliance for crypto firms in the country.

"While we do not regulate or supervise the cryptocurrency business, these firms are required to be registered with the FCA and they are required to comply with the money laundering regulations," Steward said during a speech in March 2021.
