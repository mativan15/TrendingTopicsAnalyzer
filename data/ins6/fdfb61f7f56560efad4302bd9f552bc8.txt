Xbox has recently announced the Xbox elite controller series 2 is now available to customise through its design lab programme. Launched in 2019, the advanced controller for enthusiast players offers pro-level features not seen on the regular pad, not to mention it's one of our favourites when it comes to playing PC games. The design lab service was previously only available for the standard Xbox controller, giving customers a choice of different coloured thumb sticks, buttons and triggers, and that's just for starters.
