A Regina resident is $200,000 richer after she won the top prize on her scratch ticket. Gwen Mills scratched her Lucky Lines Extravaganza Zing ticket at home and went to a local store to check and make sure she was a winner. 'I went to the store, and the screen lit up with some numbers. I thought it was $2,000. I wasn't counting the zeroes. So, I asked the cashier who said, ‘No, it's $200,000!'' she said.
