A $30 million business park and residential subdivision in South Taranaki started because the developer was worried about losing access to his business. The entrance to Ag Trans, a crane and heavy haulage business based in Hāwera, is on a ‘paper road' that happened to be part of an area the South Taranaki District Council earmarked in 2019 as a potential business park to lure more business to the district.Catherine Groenestein/StuffMahony is developing a business park on the outskirts of Hāwera, in partnership with the South Taranaki District Council.
