A good chunk of the country will be able to watch the Green Bay Packers visit the Washington Commanders on FOX on Sunday.

The Week 7 game is set for noon CT and will be called by Adam Amin and Daryl Johnston.

While the TV broadcast map during the early timeslot on FOX is split between Packers-Commanders, Giants-Jaguars, Buccaneers-Panthers and Falcons-Bengals, FOX is putting Packers-Commanders as the top game and it will be shown across an extensive section of the country.

Here's the television coverage map for Packers-Commanders, via 506sports.
