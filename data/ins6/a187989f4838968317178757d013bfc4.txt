‘How do you pronounce legendary?' asks superstar DJ, writer, producer and multi-multi-millionaire David Guetta from his apartment in Paris. ‘Where do you put the accent there?'
He's trying to describe Creamfields, the festival he's been linked to pretty much ever since he was first starting out as a DJ – and an event he's still excited to be part of in both its North and South incarnations.
‘I was a kid when I first played Creamfields,' he says in an accent that still sounds quite French even after all these years.
