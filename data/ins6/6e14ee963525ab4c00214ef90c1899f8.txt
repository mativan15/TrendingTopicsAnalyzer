A monkey sanctuary is on the brink of closure amid the cost of living crisis. Wild Futures in Cornwall, which is home to 40 monkeys rescued from abuse and neglect in the UK's primate pet trade, has launched a desperate fundraising appeal to keep its doors open.The primate welfare and conservation charity was forced to spend its reserves during the Covid pandemic and has now been hit by the rising cost of living.Its monthly outgoings have risen to almost £50,000 but it is not raising enough money to cover costs.
