On Friday, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) exonerated Aryan Khan, son of Shah Rukh Khan, and five others as it filed a charge sheet against 14 persons in the case related to the raid on the yacht Cordelia in Mumbai on October 2 last year. Aryan's name was not mentioned in the list of accused and the charge sheet mentioned that no drugs were found on him. Incidentally, Friday also happens to be the birthday of Aryan's brother and Shah Rukh's younger son AbRam Khan. Shah Rukh's fans reacted to the news online, calling it a double celebration for the family.
