UK-based drug company GlaxoSmithKline will buy Boston-based vaccine developer Affinivax for $2.1 billion, according to press releases issued by the two companies early Tuesday. GSK will also pay up to $1.2 billion more if certain milestones are reached in Affinivax's upcoming clinical trials for a new pneumococcal vaccine.The deal, first reported by the Financial Times, gives GSK an even bigger footprint in the U.S. at a time when it's arguably playing catch-up in several high-profile ways. The drug giant is already one of the biggest vaccine developers in the world, but lagged behind others like Pfizer in developing a vaccine for covid-19.
