JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images We monitor dividend announcements for stocks in Dividend Radar, a spreadsheet we update and publish for free every Friday. The spreadsheet provides key data of stocks with dividend streaks of five years or more. The Dividend Radar spreadsheet separates stocks into categories based on the length of the streak: Champions (25+ years), Contenders (10- 24 years), and Challengers (5-9 years). In the past three weeks, twelve companies in Dividend Radar announced dividend increases, including three of my DivGro holdings.
