Microsoft is slowing hiring in its Windows, Office, and Teams divisions.

It joins a raft of tech companies dialing back recruitment as the economy slows.

Microsoft announced last week it would increase employee salaries.

Microsoft is pulling back on hiring in its Office, Windows, and Teams divisions, becoming the latest tech company to dial back recruitment as fears of recession loom.

Executive Vice President Rajesh Jha sent an email to staff Thursday saying all new hires in the three divisions must be approved by him and his leadership team, a Microsoft spokesperson told Bloomberg, adding that the policy didn't affect the whole company.
