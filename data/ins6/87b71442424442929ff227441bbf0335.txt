'It doesn't take a brilliant amount of perception to see that Boston needed more bookstores.'

There's been good news recently for bibliophiles in Boston; a wave of independent bookstores are opening new storefronts around the city.

Shop owners, managers, and industry leaders are cheering the development, which comes on the heels of a pandemic that caused the shuttering of many local businesses.

'I think we are in a real renaissance at this point where indie bookstores are on the upswing, after years of not being — or people were closing,' said Jeff Peters, owner and chief operating officer of East End Books in Provincetown, which is slated to open a Boston location by the end of the year.
