Shares of Spikevax maker Moderna (MRNA) have stabilized in the $130-140 per-share range in recent months, potentially marking a bottom after its 75% peak-to-trough plunge.

Recently, the White House noted that COVID-19 vaccinations of young children could start on June 21 at the earliest, if approved. With so many Americans who've psychologically moved on from the pandemic, the news may not have been viewed as material for vaccine makers as it should have been. Regardless, all eyes will be on regulators as they move closer to making a decision.
