Struggling retail giant Kohl's pushed back this week's deadline for final bids to buy the company after several potential suitors bowed out, multiple sources told The Post on Thursday.
The closely watched sales process, which scared off bidders after Kohl's delivered weaker-than-expected first-quarter financial results, hit a snag when the company slashed its sales and profit outlook for the rest of the year, citing a decline in consumer spending at its 1,100 stores – even as other retailers like Macy's report strong sales.
