Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa avoided serious injury after being carted off the field in a loss at Indiana and will be 'a game-time decision' for Saturday's homecoming game against Northwestern, coach Mike Locksley announced Tuesday.

Locksley said the third-year quarterback reaggravated a previous injury on his right knee sustained in Maryland's loss at Michigan Sept. 24. The coach disclosed for the first time it was a sprained MCL, for which Tagovailoa had been wearing a knee brace for in recent games and kinesiology tape to help stabilize his leg.
