TYSON FURY has been flaunting his £10,000 winnings after winning a bet with Frank Warren that the Anthony Joshua fight would collapse.
 The Gypsy King's promoter revealed this morning that he owed the WBC heavyweight champion that his proposed 'Battle of Britain' bout 'would be finalised' during the negotiations with AJ.

However, a deal never materialised and Fury will now face Derek Chisora instead on December 3 at Tottenham in a trilogy clash.
