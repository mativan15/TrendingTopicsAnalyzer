There's an election in Providence next week.On June 7, voters will be asked to let the city borrow $515 million through a pension obligation bond and deposit that money in the city's underfunded retirement account for municipal workers. Only registered voters who live in Providence can vote.The proposal also requires legislative approval: The House passed it on Wednesday, and the Senate appears likely to give the bond its blessing, too.You can learn more about the proposal here, but I thought it would be a good idea to hear from the candidates running for state treasurer on whether they support the bond.
