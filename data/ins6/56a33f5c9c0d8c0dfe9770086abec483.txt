Konami themselves seems to have ruined the surprise for tonight's Silent Hill Transmission, with up to three new games.
Considering how many Silent Hill rumours and leaks have circulated around the internet over the last couple of years, it's perhaps fitting that the final leak comes from Konami themselves.
As a quick reminder, Konami is set to officially reveal new projects for its horror series in a streaming event happening later tonight, entitled Silent Hill Transmission.
While nothing as spoilery as a trailer or box art has leaked ahead of it, fans may already have an idea of what to expect.
