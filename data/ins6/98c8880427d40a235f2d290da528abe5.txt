Ever since Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead near Mansa, the Punjabi music industry has been in a state of shock. While many mourned the demise of the 28-year-old singer, others opened up about the gun culture in Punjab and the threat to life they face every day. Now, Daler Mehndi has opened up about the incident that has shocked the nation.
Speaking to India Today, Mehndi said he was shocked to see that Moose Wala was driving his car with hardly any security at a time when in Punjab, every singer – popular or not – has a convoy along.
