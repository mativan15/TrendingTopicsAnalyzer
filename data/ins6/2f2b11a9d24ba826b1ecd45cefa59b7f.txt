11:03 AM ETPITTSBURGH -- Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett cleared concussion protocol and is in line to start Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, the team announced Friday morning.Pickett suffered a concussion on a hit in the third quarter of the Steelers' 20-18 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Coach Mike Tomlin said Pickett would start against the Dolphins if he cleared protocol, and he didn't expect the concussion to hinder his practice availability this week."Oftentimes, someone's in the protocol and they've got complete clearance in terms of full participation, so you let them participate," Tomlin said Tuesday.
