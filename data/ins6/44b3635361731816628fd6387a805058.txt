"Straight trees are always cut first", said senior bureaucrat Ashok Khemka while reacting to appointments of some of his batchmates as secretaries in different central government departments. Khemka, an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of the 1991 batch, is currently serving as principal secretary (additional secretary level) in his cadre state Haryana. 
The officer, who has been transferred 52 times, according to his executive record sheet on the Department of Personnel's website, had cancelled the mutation of a prime plot of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra in Manesar in Gurugram district.
