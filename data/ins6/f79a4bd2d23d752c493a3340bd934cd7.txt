milan2099A year ago, everything seemed to be moving in the right direction for Spectrum Brands (NYSE:SPB). Spectrum's pet and home & garden businesses were benefitting from stay-at-home trends which lead to increased consumer interest in gardening and an uptick in pet ownership. In the midst of a housing boom, Spectrum agreed to sell its hardware & home improvement (HHI) business to Sweden's ASSA ABLOY (OTCPK:ASAZY) for a top of the cycle price of $4.3 billion (14x peak EBITDA) which would lead to the payoff of the company's debt and a substantial cash balance.
