The State Bank of Vietnam directed four banks to help manage Saigon Commercial Bank, also known as SCB, according to a statement from the regulator. SCB is the nation's fifth-largest commercial lender by deposits and assets.

Earlier this week, the central bank tried to calm markets after financial stocks plunged and SCB's customers rushed to pull out deposits.
