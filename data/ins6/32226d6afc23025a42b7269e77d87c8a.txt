Coca-Cola is focusing on its nutrition portfolio in the country and expects it to be the biggest growth driver through its fruit juice-based brands - Maaza and Minute Maid. "We are very clear (that) this (nutrition portfolio) is going to be one of our biggest growth drivers for our volume, value and consumer base," Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia Vice President and Head Marketing Arnab Roy said in a media round table.
