MSMEs in India are a colossus of over 66 lakh units manufacturing over 6,500 items, apart from delivering a plethora of services. Together, MSMEs in India employ the largest number of people after agriculture.
MSME is the sector to reckon with as small businesses are often, and justifiably, called the backbone of the economy. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises employ 11 crore people directly, and many more indirectly. They contribute 30% to India's GDP, and account for nearly half of our exports.
