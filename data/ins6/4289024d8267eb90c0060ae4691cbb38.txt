Spokespeople for the Bank of International Settlements, which handles communication for the Basel committee, and for the European Central Bank (ECB), which oversees the euro area's biggest banks, declined to comment. A spokesperson for BNP Paribas also did not want to comment.The ECB had argued that progress in the decade-long effort to create a banking union should be reflected in capital surcharges for so-called global systemically important banks. The agreement at the Basel committee allows capital requirements to be lowered by a maximum of one notch for lenders in the banking union, if the new way of calculating risk warrants such a move.
