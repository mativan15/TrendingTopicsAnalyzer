It was only in February that the boss of Hargreaves Lansdown declared that he had 'never been as excited about the opportunities we see for our business as now' as he set out an ambitious five-year strategy for the DIY investment platform.Yet less than eight months later, Chris Hill has revealed that he would leave the FTSE 100 company by November next year, despite having the vast majority of his growth plan still to execute.Shares in the business have fallen by almost 40 per cent since Hill unveiled his strategy amid scepticism from investors that his targets could be achieved.
