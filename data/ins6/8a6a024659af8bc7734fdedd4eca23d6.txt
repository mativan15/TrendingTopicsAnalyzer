After being closed for two months, the Santa Clara BMX track is set to reopen on May 31, but it's yet to be seen whether the track will be able to hold sanctioned races instead of serving just as a practice track.
The track closed April 1 following a dispute between the Santa Clara Police Activities League (PAL), which leases the track from the city, and the volunteer management group that ran it.
PAL accused the group of financial mismanagement — a claim the volunteers have vehemently denied — and is currently conducting an audit of the finances.
