Rejecting pleas of two middlemen who took money to ensure selection of candidates and three candidates who used unethical means to clear the police sub-inspector (PSI) recruitment exam, a sessions court on Friday said that the scam is a socio-economic offence which affects the moral fibre of society.
'It is a case of a recruitment scam by manipulating the OMR sheets to deprive deserving candidates who have honestly worked hard for the examination for selection. Therefore, it is a  socio-economic offence which affects the moral fiber of the society,' a sessions court in Bengaluru has ruled.
