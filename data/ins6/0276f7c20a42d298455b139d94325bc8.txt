UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday demanding an immediate end to violence and criminal activity in Haiti and imposing sanctions on individuals and groups threatening peace and stability in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation — starting with a powerful gang leader.
The sanctions were the first authorized by the U.N.'s most powerful body since 2017 and the resolution's approval by all 15 council nations, whose divisions have been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, demonstrated a rare sign that council members can work together — at least on some global crises.
