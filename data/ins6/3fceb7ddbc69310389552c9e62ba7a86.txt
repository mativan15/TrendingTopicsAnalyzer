Santa Clara University Leavey School of Business

It was a good day at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. The U.S. News rankings had just been released, and the Leavey School had placed well in a pair of key categories.

Better than well — great. Leavey ranked No. 13 in executive education and, in its highest-ever placement, No. 19 for part-time MBA programs. Its online MBA, at No. 62, remains in the top 20% of all ranked programs.

In the administrative offices of Lucas Hall, the achievements were hailed with a vertical banner and balloons in the school's maroon hue, and smiles and good cheer all round.
