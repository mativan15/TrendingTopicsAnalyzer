The Government has been urged to take 'immediate' action over illegal Channel crossings. Ministers have been criticised over a 'pilot scheme' which saw just a 'tiny' number of people sent home.A group of 11 Albanians was last Wednesday flown out of the UK soon after arriving in small boats as part of a pilot scheme.This came close to two months after former Home Secretary Priti Patel secured a deal with her Albanian counterpart for a 'rapid removal' scheme.Ms Patel said this would help to 'speed up removal of Albanians with no right to be in the UK'.
