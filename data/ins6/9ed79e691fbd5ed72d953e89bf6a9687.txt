Edit: yes it is. But what about stagnation?

There was the gold standard. But it seemed to only work during good times and was always ditched during big crisis like wars or recessions.

There was already an ugly mechanism where panic was used to steal gold from people while devaluing it, then revalue it and sell it back to them while devaluing paper.

But that was not good enough for the US, so they took advantage of their role in WW2 to setup the Brenton Woods system. USD became the reserve currency of the world, backed by gold.
