WINNIPEG, MB, Oct. 21, 2022 /CNW/ - Along Canada's coasts and inland from the Great Lakes to the Prairie provinces, federally-owned small craft harbours provide the commercial fishing industry with safer access to waterways. Small craft harbours are the heart of Canada's coastal communities. They are places of gathering, hubs of recreation and industry, and they're essential to Canada's growing blue economy.
