The UK can take a lead in trying to forecast and avert mass atrocity crimes, MPs suggest in a report published on Monday.Calling on the government to develop a cross-Whitehall mass atrocity strategy, the international development select committee says Britain could deploy its diplomatic network to warn the world if conflicts are threatening to spill into greater crimes against humanity.'Britain could show global leadership about these horrific crimes' and help to fill the impunity gap that has developed due to the political deadlock between the west and Russia at the UN security council, the committee says.
