Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Junior says he is standing by his predecessor's decision to scrap a deal with Russia to buy military helicopters. He said on Thursday the government will get aircraft from the United States, instead. President Marcos said, "The deal with Russia was for some heavy-lift helicopters and now we have secured an alternative supply from the United States through the manufacturer in Poland." The Philippine government agreed last year to buy 16 Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters for more than 200 million dollars.
