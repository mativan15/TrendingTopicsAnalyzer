Nissan has brought three of its popular international SUV models to India, with the new X-Trail due for launch soon. The latest versions of the Juke and Qashqai have also been shown in New Delhi, with the latter being tested on Indian roads.While the Japanese brand has said it is showing all three, the X-Trail will be launched in India first. The SUV was sold here in its first and second-generation guises, and though it never went on sale, the third-generation model was showcased in the Indian market a few years ago.
