Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council member (North Andhra-Teachers' Constituency) Pakalapati Raghuvarma on Friday urged the State government to continue Amaravati as the capital to get continuous financial assistance from the Union government. He said that the Centre had already allocated funds for the new capital and its shifting to Visakhapatnam might lead to denial of funds and other support to the State government.
