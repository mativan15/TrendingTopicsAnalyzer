Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Thursday hit back at AIADMK interim general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, who labelled him as the ruling DMK's 'B team' and alleged that he was helping Chief Minister M K Stalin to 'defeat' the Opposition party.
'Good people and those who understand politics know who had crawled and come to power and betrayed… If Edappadi proves that I spoke with the chief minister, I am ready to quit politics but if whatever he claims turns out to be false, will he quit politics?' Panneerselvam told reporters in Madurai.
