In the strategic maneuverings of Oscar season, betting on primacy in recency is always smart. Hoping to capitalize on last year's immense love for 'Flee,' the first film to be nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best International Feature, and Best Documentary at the Academy Awards, Canada chose a politically bold animated documentary as its official entry. Apparently, nobody at the National Film Board of Canada knows about Wikipedia.

Directed by Jason Loftus, 'Eternal Spring' uses beautiful 3-D drawings to animate the story of a 2002 state TV hijacking by members of Falun Gong, a religious group that was brutally censored in the late-'90s/early aughts.
