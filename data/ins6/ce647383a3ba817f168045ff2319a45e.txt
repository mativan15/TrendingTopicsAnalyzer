Dominic Calvert-Lewin is ‘open' to leaving Everton this summer as Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle United eye moves for the England striker.
Calvert-Lewin, 25, has scored 58 goals in 191 appearances for Everton since joining the Toffees from Sheffield United in 2016.
The forward enjoyed a breakthrough season in 2020-21, scoring more than 20 goals in all competitions to help Everton finish in the top-half of the Premier League and establish himself as an England regular.
However, Calvert-Lewin only played 17 league games last term as a string of injuries impacted on his game-time at Goodison Park.
