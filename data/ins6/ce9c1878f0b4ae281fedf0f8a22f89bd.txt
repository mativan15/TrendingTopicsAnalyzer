'I trust the offensive line to make blocks, they trust me to run behind them,' Yanchuk said. 'We all trust each other and that's what makes us so good. I think we have one of the best lines in the region.'Yanchuk ran behind a line featuring the 6-foot-3, 255-pound Case Mankins — the son of former New England Patriots stalwart Logan Mankins — as well as Tristen Upton (5-11, 255), Sean Finucane (6-1, 280), Eddie Cinelli (6-3, 275) and Jake Gosselin (6-0, 235).'We put a lot on our offensive line and we put a lot on Nick,' said Feehan coach Bryan Pinabell.
