Delhi minister Satyendar Jain's home was raided by the Enforcement Directorate on Monday, nearly a week after he was arrested in a money laundering case, news agency ANI reported. The fresh action comes as a political row brews between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party over the arrest.Monday's raids, including at Jain's Delhi home, and certain other locations, were being conducted as part of a "follow up" in the case, officials were quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, during an address last week, told Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "arrest all AAP leaders".
