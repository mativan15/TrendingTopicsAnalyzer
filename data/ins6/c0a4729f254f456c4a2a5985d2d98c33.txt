Ottawa and Northwest Territories are in discussions with a large American charity about permanent funding for a program that puts First Nations people in charge of looking after parks and other conservation areas on their traditional lands.Representatives from all three groups have agreed to try to work out a way for The Pew Charitable Trusts to help fund the Indigenous Guardians program in N.W.T. If successful, the project could expand to other such programs across the country.'Our programs are rarely infinite in time,' Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault said from Stockholm, Sweden, where he was attending meetings.
