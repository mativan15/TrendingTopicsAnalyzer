Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) is finally taking its ultra-luxury accommodations to the high seas.

The Bethesda hotel giant on Monday announced it has launched The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, what it bills as a combination of its high-end luxury hotel brand and the joys and exploration of a yachting vacation.

The Evrima, a luxury vessel flying The Ritz-Carlton flag, left Saturday from Barcelona on a route to Nice on the French Riviera. It's the first of three vessels planned as part of the collection — a collaboration between veteran cruise industry executive Douglas Prothero, Los Angeles investment firm Oaktree Capital Management and Marriott's high-end brand portfolio.
