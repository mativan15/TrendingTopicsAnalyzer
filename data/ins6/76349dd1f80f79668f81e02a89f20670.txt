Georgia voters turned out in record numbers on Monday, the first day of early in-person voting in the state, where Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock is facing a tough challenge from Republican Herschel Walker, and Republican Governor Brian Kemp is in a rematch against his 2018 opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams.

With three weeks to go before the Nov. 8 election, more than 133,000 votes were cast Monday, an 87% increase from the nearly 71,000 people who voted on the first day of early in-person voting in 2018.
