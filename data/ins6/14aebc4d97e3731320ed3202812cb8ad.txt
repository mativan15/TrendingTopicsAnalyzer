Thousands across Canada are calling for the government to live up to a commitment to give permanent residency status to people living in limbo in the country. In Toronto, demonstrators marched Sunday to the downtown constituency office of Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, chanting, "What do we want? Status for all! When do we want it? Now!" They covered her office door with posters calling for immediate permanent residency status for all undocumented migrants in Canada and those with a "temporary" status.
