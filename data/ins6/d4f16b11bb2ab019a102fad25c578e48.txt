Manchester United are reportedly set to decide between Newcastle United's Karl Darlow and Watford's Daniel Bachmann if Dean Henderson heads for the exit this summer. the Red Devils' back-up stopper has been starved of game time this season, and is set to pursue regular action ahead of the World Cup later this year. Henderson looked destined for a fruitful future at Old Trafford when he signed a bumper five-year contract in 2020. That only looked more realistic when he was phased into the side at the end of 2020/21, with David De Gea dropped to the bench.
