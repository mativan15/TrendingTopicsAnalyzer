IBM intends to withhold tens of thousands of dollars each from certain retiring staff unless they agree to the IT giant's demands.
This has been described as an "outright attack" on the ex-IBMers' pension schemes and the freedom to choose their healthcare.
Last month, Big Blue shook up the health insurance coverage it subsidizes for retirees in the US. As a result, the corporation will freeze healthcare funds it set aside as a retirement benefit for certain Medicare-eligible former staff who fail to sign up for one of two new plans.
