The interest rate on British government bonds fell.The FTSE 250 MCX, +0.82% index of smaller and medium-size British companies, a good bellwether for the domestic economy, rose by nearly 1%. The FTSE 100 UKX, +0.27% index of large-caps, many of them multinationals, rose 0.3%.

The downfall of Truss doesn't make me change my mind.
