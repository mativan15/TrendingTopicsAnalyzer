Twitch streamer and OnlyFans content creator Amouranth alleged Saturday during a stream that her husband has threatened to kill her dogs and is controlling her social media and bank accounts.

'The therapist even told him it's a form of psychological abuse and that I'm basically living in a fancy prison,' a visibly upset Amouranth told her viewers.

The stream has been removed from her account, but multiple clips are still circulating online.

In one clip, Amouranth, whose real name is Kaitlyn Siragusa, live-streamed a phone call with a man—implied to be her husband—while he screamed at her.
