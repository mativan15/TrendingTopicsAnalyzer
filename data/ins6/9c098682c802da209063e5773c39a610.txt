Actor Anthony Rapp sued Kevin Spacey for allegedly trying to seduce him when he was 14 in order to hold the Hollywood star 'accountable' – and not because of a 30-year vendetta against the celebrity, his lawyer told jurors in closing arguments Thursday. 
Rapp's attorney maintained his client has been completely honest about the encounter between him and Spacey in 1986, as he urged jurors in Manhattan federal court not to let the Oscar-winner 'get away with it.'
'The simple truth here is: this happened, he shared it, and after all this time he's come here to share that truth with you,' attorney Richard Steigman said, referring to Rapp.
