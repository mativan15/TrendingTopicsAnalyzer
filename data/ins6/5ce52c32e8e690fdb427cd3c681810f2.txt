Jun. 3—With the deadline to withdraw from the 2022 NBA draft passing on Wednesday, the picture for the upcoming Mountain West men's basketball season has become clearer.

Here's a look at where each team stands in WyoSports' offseason power rankings.

1. San Diego State (2021-22 finish: 3rd)

The most consistently competitive MW program in recent history, San Diego State has made nine out of the past 12 NCAA tournaments, and should be in line for their third straight appearance next March. The Aztecs bring back several contributors from a team that finished third last season, including the reigning MW newcomer of the year and defensive player of the year, respectively, in Matt Bradley and Nathan Mensah.
