Elon Musk said Wednesday that Tesla could repurchase up to $10 billion of its shares this year.

Some investors have called for a stock buyback as the EV maker's stock has been declining.

Tesla stock fell 5% Thursday after it missed on earnings and warned it wouldn't meet delivery targets.

Elon Musk has hinted that Tesla could repurchase up to $10 billion worth of its shares next year, after a slide in the electric-vehicle maker's stock this year spurred calls for the move.
