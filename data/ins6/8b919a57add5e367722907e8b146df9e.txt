The Indian Medical Association (IMA) criticised the Bihar government's decision on Friday to suspend Dr Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of Patna's Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), without giving him an opportunity to defend, and said it will take legal recourse if the government does not revoke its decision, IMA national president Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said on Saturday.The action was unfair to an officer of his stature and repute, said Dr Singh in separate letters to the Bihar governor Phagu Chauhan and chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking their intervention to revoke the suspension order.
