(Bloomberg) -- 1k(x), a $1 billion crypto venture capital firm that counts British hedge fund tycoon Alan Howard among its backers, hired former Valour Inc. executive Diana Biggs as a partner. Biggs will provide support to new and existing portfolio companies, driving partnerships with institutions and non-crypto applications for British Virgin Islands-based 1k(x), it said in a statement. She was previously chief strategy officer at Valour, the Swiss provider of crypto exchange-traded products. Founded by European crypto investors Lasse Clausen and Christopher Heymann four years ago, 1k(x) focuses on early-stage investing in blockchain ecosystems and developers such as Arweave, Gnosis and Matter Labs.
