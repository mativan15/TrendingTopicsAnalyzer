Snapchat no longer has an office presence in San Francisco.As part of its recent restructuring, which led to at least 1,200 full-time employees being laid off and a number of projects being shut down, parent company Snap decided to close its office in the city, a person familiar with the decision said. Snap disclosed in a footnote to its third-quarter results that an unspecified "lease exit" was part of $155 million in costs the company incurred related to its reorganization. Snap's San Francisco lease wasn't due to end until November 2024, according to another person familiar with the situation.
