Former President Obama said voters became disengaged in elections following the 1973 Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade.

The 50-year precedent, which granted Americans the constitutional right to abortion, was overturned this summer in a ruling from the high court. The majority opinion was penned by Justice Samuel Alito.

During a Friday appearance on Pod Save America, a podcast whose hosts include former Obama administration staffers, Obama was asked about why progressive voters can't rely on the court system for policy.
