Joseph Kosinski says he got close to doing a Tron: Legacy follow-up, but believes Disney's acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm made his sci-fi sequel obsolete.
The Top Gun: Maverick director spoke to Vulture in a new interview about the fate of Tron: Ascension, what would have been the third installment in his Tron franchise, revealing that it nearly came to pass. 'I got so close. I really tried. I got close in 2015, and Disney pulled the plug on it. I hadn't built anything, but I had the whole movie storyboarded and written,' he said.
