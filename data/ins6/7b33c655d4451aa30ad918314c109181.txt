It's a good week for Ryan Murphy. Now on the fourth year of his five-year Netflix deal, he's had the streamer's most-watched title of the week for four weeks in a row now. For the previous three weeks, it was 'Monster,' the limited series starring Evan Peters as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, which has now shifted to the No. 2 position. At the top of the chart for the Oct. 10-16 viewing window is 'The Watcher,' Murphy's limited series that racked up a chart-topping 125 million hours watched in its first four days of availability.
