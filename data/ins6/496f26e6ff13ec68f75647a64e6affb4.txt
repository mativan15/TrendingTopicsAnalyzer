The news broke just before midnight on Thursday. The Carolina Panthers had traded Christian McCaffrey to the San Francisco 49ers, getting four draft picks in return.

This means that in the short term the Panthers will become even more unwatchable. In the long term, it means that the team has gone into full tear-it-down-and-rebuild-it mode — again.

Immediate impression? This trade feels like a win-win to me, and the Panthers have to take any win they can get these days.

Carolina didn't get the first-round pick it wanted for McCaffrey, despite talking to several teams about his availability.
