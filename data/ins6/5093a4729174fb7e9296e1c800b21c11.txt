NEW YORK — The decision by Frontier Airlines to sweeten its offer for Spirit Airlines paid dividends Friday when an investor-advisory firm recommended the deal to Spirit shareholders.
Glass Lewis supported the deal after Frontier added a $250 million breakup fee to the February agreement between boards of both budget airlines.
The firm said a rival offer by JetBlue exceeds the current value of the Frontier deal 'by a fairly wide margin,' but that JetBlue hasn't made a compelling case to override Spirit's argument that antitrust regulators would block a sale to JetBlue.
