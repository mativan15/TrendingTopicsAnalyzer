General Fusion

Together with the UKAEA's world-leading researchers, General Fusion progresses its Fusion Demonstration Program

General Fusion's Plasma Injector 3

General Fusion has formed over 200,000 hydrogen plasmas and relies on intelligent diagnostics to observe them. Our projects with the UKAEA include the additional study of the experiment results from General Fusion's PI3 – the world's largest and most powerful operational fusion plasma injector. Our joint efforts will create new, higher-fidelity physics models.
