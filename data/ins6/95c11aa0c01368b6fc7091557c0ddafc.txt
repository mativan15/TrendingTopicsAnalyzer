Even the best investor on earth makes unsuccessful investments. But it's not unreasonable to try to avoid truly shocking capital losses. We wouldn't blame Twist Bioscience Corporation (NASDAQ:TWST) shareholders if they were still in shock after the stock dropped like a lead balloon, down 72% in just one year. While some investors are willing to stomach this sort of loss, they are usually professionals who spread their bets thinly. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 30% in the last three years.
