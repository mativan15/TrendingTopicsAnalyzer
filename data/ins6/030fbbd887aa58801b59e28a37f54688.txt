On Tuesday, star biotech stock Moderna (MRNA -3.71%) had one of those rare days in which it declined in price while the broader market rose. On the back of a fresh analyst price-target cut, the company's shares tumbled by nearly 4% in contrast to the S&P 500 index's more than 1% gain.

The prognosticator who lost a little faith in Moderna is Morgan Stanley's Matthew Harrison. Before market open, Harrison reduced his price target on the stock to $175 per share, down from his previous level of $197.
