Vance's campaign claims that a 'woke' Cleveland newspaper is 'encouraging bigotry' after publishing a political cartoon last Wednesday that made the Indiana heritage of the Ohio Senate candidate's wife the butt of the joke.Vance got testy at Monday night's debate – days after the cartoon was published – and lashed out at his Democratic opponent Tim Ryan by claiming his comments claiming he is racist are stoking attacks against his biracial children.
