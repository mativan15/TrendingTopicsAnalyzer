ROME, Oct 21 (Reuters) - In 2019, Giorgia Meloni made a speech that has come to define her: "I am a woman, I am a mother, I am Italian, I am a Christian, and you can't take that away from me," she told cheering supporters in Rome.

Fast forward three years, and the nationalist leader can now also say she is Italy's first female prime minister.
