Only a new approach to funding will prevent up to one in four Scottish cultural bodies 'toppling over' as a financial crisis sweeps through the arts, a leading theatre director has warned.David Greig said falling audiences, rising costs, and shrinking funding were heaping pressure on the industry, with nothing invulnerable.The recent financial collapse of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and the closure of the Modern Two national gallery for the remainder of the year were straws in the wind, he said, with the city's entire festival season at risk.
