A $15.5 million redevelopment project at the historic Agora Theatre and Ballroom complex in Cleveland's MidTown neighborhood has qualified for a new type of low-interest financing based on its future energy efficiency.

The buildings that once housed portions of the former WHK Studio One and a recording studio were acquired by Hungary-based Sabor Group and Geauga County developer Renew Partners LLC in January 2021 for $1.7 million.

Renew Partners, which focuses on the development and adaptive reuse of historic buildings in Northeast Ohio, and Sabor Group USA broke ground in early September on their project to redevelop the office building adjacent to the Agora Theatre as 48 market-rate apartments and 21,000 square feet of office and restaurant space.
