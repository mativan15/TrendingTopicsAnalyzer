Monsoon is likely to progress into parts of north Bengal and Sikkim by Thursday, at least four to five days ahead of the rainy season's normal onset date, Regional Met Director G K Das said here on Tuesday. Following the onset of the southwest monsoon in the northern districts, it will be possible to forecast the date for its progress into other parts of the state, he said. "Conditions are favourable for the monsoon to make further progress over some parts of north Bengal and Sikkim within the next two to three days," Das told PTI.
