The World Bank and IMF offer financial assistance and policy advice to countries around the world to promote development and bolster economic stability. The annual meetings provide a forum for governments and international financial executives to set the agenda for the coming year. In recent days, for instance, the U.S. and Germany led a push to modify World Bank policymaking to scale up climate finance.
