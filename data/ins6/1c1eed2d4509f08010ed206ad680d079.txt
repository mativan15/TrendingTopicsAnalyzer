Good morning, Bay Area. The San Francisco 49ers grabbed headlines last night with a blockbuster trade NFL all-pro running back Christian McCaffrey. The 49ers, who gave up a glut of high draft picks to snag the former Stanford star from the Carolina Panthers, will pay McCaffrey $690,000 for the rest of the season, but he will earn $11.8 million in 2023 and 2024 and $12 million in 2025.
