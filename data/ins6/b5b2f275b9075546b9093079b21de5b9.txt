Elon Musk seems to have backed down from his earlier plea to have the Pentagon pay for Starlink connectivity in Ukraine, and will continue to fund the internet satellites being used by the war-torn country. On Saturday, Musk sent out a seemingly frustrated tweet saying, 'The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free.'SpaceX had reportedly asked the Pentagon to pay roughly $120 million for Ukraine's use of its Starlink satellites for the rest of the year.
