TerraUSD or UST, is an algorithmic stablecoin which was supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar. But it lost its dollar peg, collapsed and sent shockwaves through the crypto market. Reeve Collins, co-founder of BLOCKv and co-founder of another stablecoin tether, said the terraUSD debacle will "probably be the end" of so-called algorithmic stablecoins. The crypto industry also warned that regulation is likely to come for stablecoins as global governments look at the risks in the space. Algorithmic stablecoins like terraUSD, which collapsed and sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, are unlikely to survive, the co-founder of digital currency tether told CNBC.
