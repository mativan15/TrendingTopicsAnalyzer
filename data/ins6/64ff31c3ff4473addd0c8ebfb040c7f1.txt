Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford at 19 to start Theranos and grew its value to $9 billion.

Later, technology flaws were exposed, resulting in a months-long trial where Holmes was found guilty on three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy.

Now, she's asking a judge to throw out her conviction, citing "insufficient" evidence on which "no rational juror" could convict beyond a reasonable doubt.
