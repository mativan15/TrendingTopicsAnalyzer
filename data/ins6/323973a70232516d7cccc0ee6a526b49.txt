Robb Elementary School, the site of the tragic shooting on May 24 where 19 children and two teachers were killed, may be demolished using federal grant money, according to Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin.
'I don't think anybody's plans are but to tear that building down,' McLaughlin said in a quote to NBC. 'I would never ask, expect, a child to ever have to walk in those doors ever, ever again. That building needs to be gone.'
State Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio, who oversees the Uvalde district, agrees with McLaughlin and when President Biden paid a visit to the school to pay his respects at a memorial service, the matter was discussed with him in an effort to gain federal assistance.
