LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - London-based information provider Relx (REL.L) said annual profit was set to grow faster than its historical trend boosted by continued strong demand for its data analytics and fraud prevention tools, and as conferences return after the pandemic.The group on Thursday said that underlying revenue growth for the year to date was 9%, compared to a historic level of about 4%."Momentum remains strong across the group, and we continue to expect full year underlying growth rates in revenue and adjusted operating profit, as well as constant currency growth in adjusted earnings per share, to remain above historical trends," the group said in its statement.
