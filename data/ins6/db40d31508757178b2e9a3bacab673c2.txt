Thousands of dollars worth of garden pots have been reported stolen from Timaru's Mitre 10 Mega store and the manager believes the burglary could be linked to a spate of thefts at a nursery in the town. Mitre 10 Mega Timaru store manager Dave Ferguson said about $6000 worth of pots have been stolen from the Bank St store's off-site storage area about 1am on May 25. 'We haven't done the actual estimations yet, but it's roughly around $6000. 'They have gained entry through the gates and have taken the garden pots, some of which are very heavy," Ferguson said.
