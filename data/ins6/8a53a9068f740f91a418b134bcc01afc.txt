The trial of a Steve Bannon associate accused of stealing donations from a fund to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been thrown into chaos by a juror claiming the case is a government 'witch hunt.'Colorado businessman Timothy Shea is on trial in Manhattan Federal Court for his alleged role siphoning money from the 'We Build the Wall' charity, which collected cash from supporters of President Donald Trump's signature policy to combat illegal immigration. The money was supposed to go to a privately-funded section of border wall, but prosecutors allege Bannon, Shea and others raided the charity.
