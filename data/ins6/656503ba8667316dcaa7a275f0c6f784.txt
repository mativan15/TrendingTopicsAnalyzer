MONEY saving expert Martin Lewis has revealed the full list of cars that could see people get a payout of thousands of pounds over the diesel emissions scandal.
It comes after it was revealed registered keepers or owners of a Volkswagen diesel vehicle were in line to get an average payout of £2,100 after the manufacturer agreed a £193million settlement with 91,000 UK motorists.
