Private security patrols may become a permanent fixture in central Christchurch following a successful trial, but it's uncertain if ratepayers will contribute. Two security guards patrolled the city centre in a three-month pilot scheme in an effort to deter and resolve anti-social behaviour near private businesses. The trial, part funded by the city council, was set to end on October 9, but Annabel Turley​, business owner and chairperson of the Central City Business Association, said the patrol became too successful for it to stop.
