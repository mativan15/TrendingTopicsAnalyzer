Six soldiers from the Queen's guard have been arrested just days before they were due to lead the Platinum Jubilee parade.
The serving Irish Guards members were arrested on suspicion of dealing cocaine and running a loan shark operation, The Sun reports. A former sergeant from the Coldstream Guards was also arrested.
A source from the 1st Battalion Irish Guards' base, Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire, said authorities ‘came in like the DEA, kicking down doors'.
‘There was no warning,' the source added.
