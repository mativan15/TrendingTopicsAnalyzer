John Bishop is a Wellington political veteran, who helped set up the NZ Taxpayers' Union. He has never joined any political party. He is the father of National list MP Chris Bishop. OPINION: Critics have been quick to criticise the Government's latest Budget, and for a range of reasons. It's been said that Grant Robertson is addicted to spending; that the deficits and borrowings are too high. Also, the spending is poor quality and badly directed, and the assistance to the so-called 'squeezed middle' is ungenerous.
