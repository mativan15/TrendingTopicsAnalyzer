The once-blazing Carvana is stalling as the market for used cars shrinks and issues with its business model become harder to gloss over, according to Wedbush. Analyst Seth Basham downgraded the stock to neutral and cut the price target a whopping 70% to $15, now implying the stock has downside of 17.7%. "While we have been cautious on the near-term outlook for CVNA for some time, we have maintained a positive long-term outlook given potential for solid unit economics at scale," Basham said in a note to clients.
