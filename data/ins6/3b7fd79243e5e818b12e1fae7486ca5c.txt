Junior forward Jonathan Magana believes he's at his best when it matters the most for Bloom. And he's certainly building the resume to support that claim.

In September, he scored twice as the Blazing Trojans upset the state's top-ranked team in Lyons. This week, he has scored two goals each in back-to-back regional games.

'I feel like I've always been the man in big-game scenarios,' Magana said. 'I don't know why, but I think it's the way I carry myself and the way I prepare myself and challenge myself.
