(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Liz Truss promised growth and tax cuts, but the risks of recession are growing for the UK after her economic package backfired and left the Treasury forced to raise taxes and weigh deep spending cuts. The measures set out by Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt on Monday will pare £32 billion from the £45 billion of giveaways Truss's government announced last month in a mini-budget that triggered a sharp sell-off in UK assets. That will cause pain for households and businesses struggling with soaring energy costs but also limit upward pressure on interest rates.
