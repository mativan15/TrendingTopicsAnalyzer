HBS Announces 2022 Faculty Teaching Award Honors

Four Harvard Business School (HBS) faculty members have received Class of 2022 Faculty Teaching Award Honors.

Class of 2022 students honored HBS faculty members Mattias Fibiger, Nori Gerardo Lietz, Emily McComb, and David Moss for their excellence and dedication to teaching, and for the positive impact they had both in and out of the classroom.

'The faculty at HBS have such a visible place in the HBS experience as leading the case method discussions, but our class has also experienced the incredible impact they have outside the classroom with coffee chats, dinners, career advice, startup critique, and a whole host of moments we'll treasure,' Brandon Angelini and April Weathers, 2022 Class Day Committee co-chairs, say in a press release.
