The Forecastle Festival tends to bring the characters to Louisville's Waterfront Park, and Saturday was no exception.

The second day of the annual music festival along the Ohio River brought tons of energy to the start of the long Memorial Day weekend and musis fans were ready to take in the scene, with three stages for performers and thousands in the crowd cheering along.

Friday was a wet opener to the 2022 festival, with showers throughout the day. Still, the dreary conditions didn't stop Louisville native Jack Harlow from rocking the stage as the day's headliner, with other performers like Earl Sweatshirt and COIN entertaining the crowd as well.
