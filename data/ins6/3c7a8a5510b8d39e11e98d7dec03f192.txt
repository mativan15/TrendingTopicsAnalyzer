Penny Mordaunt may have been the MP for Portsmouth North for 12 years, and could perhaps be the next prime minister, but some of her constituents were perplexed when hearing her name on Friday.'Who's she? I don't know nothing about her,' said James McLeish, who added he would not recognise her if she passed him on the street. 'Never seen her, don't even know what she stands for.'McLeish's bemusement came hours before Mordaunt formally announced she was standing to replace Liz Truss – stealing a march on her presumed rivals Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson.
