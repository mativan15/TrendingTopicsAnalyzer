Jun. 5—Saturday afternoon, the sun glinted off polished chrome in downtown Owensboro, as the Sunset Cruisers brought dozens of classic cars downtown for a competition and car show at City Hall.

While most of the cars gleamed, Raymond and Autumn Davis' 1991 Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser station wagon stood out. Covered top to wheels with rust and adorned with bolted-on license plates along the sides, the station wagon resembled a vehicle rescued from a wrecking yard.

When the couple purchased the car, "it was perfect," Raymond Davis said.
