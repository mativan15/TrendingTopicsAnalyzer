The NCP on Sunday targeted Union Home Minister Amit Shah and claimed the Centre has failed to protect the lives of Hindus and Kashmiri Pandits, in the wake of the recent targeted killings of people from the community by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. NCP's chief spokesman Mahesh Tapase, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra, in a statement also said that BJP leaders were busy promoting "The Kashmir Files" (movie) for their own political purpose. Maharashtra was the only state which offered a safe passage to the displaced Kashmiri Pandits, while the BJP only played with their sentiments, Tapase claimed.
