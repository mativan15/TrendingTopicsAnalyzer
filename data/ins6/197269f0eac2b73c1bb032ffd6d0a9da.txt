TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Panasonic Holdings Corp 6752.T, which makes batteries for Tesla, said on Wednesday it had shipped samples of its more powerful 4680 format electric car battery to the U.S electric vehicle maker as it prepares for a surge in North American power pack production.

Panasonic said mass production of the new battery is set to begin in its new fiscal year starting March next year at its plant in Wakayama in Japan, before production is moved to North America.
