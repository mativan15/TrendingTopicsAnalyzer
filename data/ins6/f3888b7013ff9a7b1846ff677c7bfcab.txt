NEW YORK -- Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday named a new gun violence prevention task force, selecting a community organizer and long-time community-based violence interrupter as a co-chair.As CBS2 political reporter Marcia Kramer explains, the goal is to take a different approach than the NYPD.The move by the mayor comes at the start of the summer when the city traditionally experiences a dramatic spike in gun violence and more cops are put on the street to get guns, but the role of this task force is different.
