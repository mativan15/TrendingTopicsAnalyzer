By Ian Walker CPPGroup PLC said Friday that it sold its operations in Mexico for a nominal sum after a review of the business. The provider of assistance and insurance products said it has left 280,000 pounds ($314,692) in the business to cover the working capital requirements and other liabilities. The business has been sold to Rafael Ortiz Moran and Silvia Daniela Rodriguez Gaona. Rafael Ortiz Moran is the country manager of CPP Mexico. "The disposal of our Mexican business is consistent with the group's recently announced strategy to withdraw from its legacy businesses and migrate CPP to an InsurTech business, one with a clear purpose and simplified operating model," Chief Executive Simon Pyper said.
