After a long fight, Danny Baker has become Britain's first transgender boxer to glove-up for a men's semi-­professional bout. The 34-year-old was born female but transitioned in his 20s and has had to battle to compete in the sport he loves amid the controversy ­surrounding trans sportspeople. Danny, of Enfield, north London, said: 'When I'm boxing, I feel like the man I am. I feel included by the ­boxing community. My testosterone levels are kept within the natural human amount. When it comes to sport, I don't have an advantage.
