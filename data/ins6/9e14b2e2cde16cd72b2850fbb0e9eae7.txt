Sheryl Sandberg announced Wednesday that she is stepping down as Chief Operating Officer of Facebook parent company Meta. The 52-year-old executive has been with the company since 2008, and she oversaw its operations through milestones ranging from its IPO in 2012 to hitting a $1 trillion valuation last year.For investors who have held Facebook shares for the duration of Sandberg's tenure at the company, it has been a lucrative, though at times volatile, run. If you invested $1,000 in Facebook when it went public on May 18, 2012, the market value of your shares would be worth $4,964.
