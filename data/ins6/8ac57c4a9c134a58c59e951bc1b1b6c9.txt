News about Elon Musk's potential $44 billion purchase of Twitter is moving at the speed of...well, Twitter. Case in point: The Washington Post dropped a bombshell Thursday night, and it was immediately supplanted in magnitude by Bloomberg. Musk has been telling investors he plans to fire 5,000 workers at the social media company, the Post said, leaving a "skeleton staff" of just 2,000. According to the second report, however, Musk may not even get to own the company until he passes muster with the Biden administration — which is planning a "national security review" of Musk's Twitter deal, alongside his Starlink satellite network.
