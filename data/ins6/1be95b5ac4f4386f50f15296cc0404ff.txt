Far more than a handy voice assistant that can stream music, give you recipe tips, and answer whatever random questions may pop into your head, Alexa is also a phenomenal resource for keeping in touch with family and friends. For those of us with loved ones that may require assistance and monitoring on a near-frequent basis, the minds behind Alexa have developed an interactive and customizable suite of features for just that purpose housed under one roof.
This platform of powers is called Alexa Together, and it's a peace-of-mind solution for both remote caregivers and family members that want independence and privacy but also a helping hand (or several) when they may need it most.
