By Cristina Roca Credit Suisse Group AG is strongly capitalized and isn't considering raising additional equity capital, a spokeswoman said Tuesday, responding to a report that the Swiss bank was weighing options to shore up its capital. Late on Monday, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources, that the lender was considering a capital increase likely topping 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion), and that selling a business such as its asset management unit could also be on the table. "Asset Management is an essential part of our Group strategy presented last November, with four core divisions," the Credit Suisse spokeswoman said Tuesday.
