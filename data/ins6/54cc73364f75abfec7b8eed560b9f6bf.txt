Former President Donald Trump is set to be deposed Wednesday for a civil lawsuit accusing him of defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her.

Trump on Oct. 12 lost his bid to delay being questioned under oath by Carroll's lawyers when a federal judge brushed aside arguments that a pending appeal in the lawsuit warranted putting the case on hold.

The timing of Trump's deposition and its location were not immediately available Wednesday.

"We do not have those details and do not have a comment," said a spokesman for Carroll's lawyer, Roberta "Robbie" Kaplan.
