Sanctioned Russian oligarch Andrey Melnichenko's megayacht was found hidden in a United Arab Emirates creek after a string of sanctions was imposed to punish those in Russian President Vladimir Putin's close circle.  Motor Yacht A, estimated to be around $300 million, was found docked at the port of Ras al-Khaimah flying an Emirati flag. The megayacht appears to have avoided the same fate as Melnichenko's other yacht - the Sailing Yacht A - that was seized by Italian authorities in March. The Motor Yacht A was last located on March 10 off the coast of the Maldives.
