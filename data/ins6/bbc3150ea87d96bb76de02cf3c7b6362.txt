Dimensions/E+ via Getty Images The opportunity Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has had a great decade. Since IPO, the stock has rewarded investors with a >3000% return and a market cap that exceeded $50B last year. But the ride to stardom has not always been smooth. The stock has had its own share of troubles and has been able to emerge stronger each time. This has given investors increased confidence in its growth abilities, and results from the most recent quarters have taken this even a step further. But what if the stock is priced for perfection and it can't deliver? If a stock has a high beta, how will it behave during market shocks? Have we seen this story before? How can we benefit from a potential reset in its valuation? A growth darling Chipotle's growth story has been quite breathtaking.
