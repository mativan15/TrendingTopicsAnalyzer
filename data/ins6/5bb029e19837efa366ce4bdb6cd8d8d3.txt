When done properly, dividend growth investing is an all-weather strategy. What I mean by this is that an investor's portfolio should produce steadily growing passive income, regardless of what may be going on in the world. A dividend growth stock portfolio should also fare better than the broader market in market downturns.
One stock that fits this description is the Dividend Aristocrat McDonald's (MCD 1.52%), which has raised its dividend for 46 years straight. And while the S&P 500 index has fallen 14% year to date, McDonald's stock has only dropped 7% during that time.
