From the time of the first noble castles through to some of today's most sought after indulgences, the experience of luxury has always been about more than just the acquisition of expensive trinkets. Luxury is what people seek when they are able to look beyond the basic needs of every day life, and begin to think about how to really live life well in a way that's exactly right for them.
What goes beyond the expected for any one person is unique, but today's most compelling luxury experiences still focus on the same things that have defined luxury for centuries – superior, personal service and deep personalization, now supercharged by algorithmic smarts and rapid manufacturing, serving every individual directly in what has come to be seen by many of today's innovators as a hyper-personalized 'market of one'.
