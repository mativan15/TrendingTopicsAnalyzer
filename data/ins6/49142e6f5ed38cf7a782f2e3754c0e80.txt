I decided to go back to the University as a mature student. Early 30's and I'm currently in my first year studying business management, I plan to conclude this course and begin a career in the business sector. Growing up, I didn't really have a good math teacher, so math has always been a problem for me (not the regular math but the science based math like calculus, algebra, coordinates etc), however the Uni that I attend some insisted that I take one of these type of math courses (algebraic math to be precise, not the type of math used in business) even though I informed the Uni that I wasn't so good with these and would much rather prefer if I could replace it with a course that is more relatable to me.
