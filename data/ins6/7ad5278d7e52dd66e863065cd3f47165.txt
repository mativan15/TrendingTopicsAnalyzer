'I watched ‘Top Gun: Maverick' with the family last night,' Goyne said. 'In the beginning of the movie, Maverick is doing flight testing of a hypersonic aircraft and demonstrating flight at Mach 10. Later in the movie, they're using F-18s. In both cases, with every tight turn and high angle of attack, there's a chance the aircraft engine might stall.' Over the next three years, Goyne's multi-institutional team will build a scramjet engine for a hypersonic vehicle. The technology, if successful, will likely be incorporated into the next generation of both piloted and unpiloted aircraft, and missiles.
