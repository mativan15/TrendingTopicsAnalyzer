Parents play a significant role in shaping a child's life. For Saif Ali Khan, his mother, Sharmila Tagore, is no less than an inspiration. In a recent video, Saif Ali Khan described Sharmila Tagore as inspiring for all working women. He praised his mother for defying stereotypes and used his actor-wife Kareena Kapoor as an example.  PinterestSaif further explained that he takes care for his son Taimur Ali Khan in India while Kareena is filming a movie in London. Saif stated that the reason was solely due to what they had learned from Sharmila, who delivered some of her biggest hits after getting married.
