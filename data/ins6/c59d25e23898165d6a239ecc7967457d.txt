It's easy to miss the tiny, iterative changes made to each new installments of EA's NHL franchise. Oftentimes, the alterations are minuscule, tweaks so minor they're hardly worthy of comment. This is largely true of 'NHL 23,″ which released Oct. 14. However, there is one addition to this year's game worthy of specific commendation — the addition of female hockey players to the game's Ultimate Team mode.

Change is not something for which EA's sports franchises are known, but the addition of women to the popular fantasy team-building mode is worth celebrating for what it means to women's hockey.
