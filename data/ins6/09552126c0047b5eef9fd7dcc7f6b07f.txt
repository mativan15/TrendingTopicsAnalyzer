In a game where you can build nearly anything, one 18-year-old spent two months creating and sharing the whole observable universe.Christopher Slayton, 18, is a long-time aficionado of Minecraft, a game that allows people to create castles, cliffs and other objects using old-school blocks. But Slayton supersized the effort. He created black holes, stars and galaxies using his desktop computer and shared the epic results on YouTube (opens in new tab) and in the Minecraft Reddit community (opens in new tab) earlier this month, swiftly going viral in the process.
