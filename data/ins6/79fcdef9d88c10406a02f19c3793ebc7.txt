(WBZ NewsRadio) — First responders in Mansfield are reminding residents not to undersell the importance of calling 911 for any emergency, no matter how small it may seem. The Mansfield Fire Department tells WBZ's Chris Fama that they are experiencing an increase in people calling their business line or leaving voicemails instead of dialing 911 for an appropriate response to their home or business. Some calls coming in from residents mention their fire or carbon monoxide alarms are going off, but since they don't smell or see anything wrong, they say it's nothing to request emergency help for.
