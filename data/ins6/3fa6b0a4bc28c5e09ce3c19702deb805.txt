For over four years 343 Industries has been proud to partner with Limbitless Solutions to bring the hope and wonder of the Halo franchise to children with limb differences. Limbitless Solutions is a nonprofit organization based at the University of Central Florida (UCF) which creates bespoke 3D-printed prosthetics for children experiencing limb loss, often in the style of characters from major entertainment franchises. Limbitless Solutions then works with their recipients — known as 'bionic kids' — to train them how to use their new prosthetic, leveraging a variety of methods including instructional video games developed in partnership with UCF's School of Visual Arts and Design and Games and Interactive Media.
