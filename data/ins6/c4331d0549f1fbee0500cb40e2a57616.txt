Billionaire Elon Musk has promised to carry on funding Ukraine's Starlink internet service a day after tweeting a threat to pull out.
On Saturday, Musk said his rocket company SpaceX would continue to fund its Starlink internet service in Ukraine, a day after he said it could no longer afford to do so.
‘The hell with it … even though starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding ukraine govt for free' Musk tweeted.
This seems to be a U-turn on Friday's tweet where he said that SpaceX could not indefinitely fund Starlink in Ukraine.
