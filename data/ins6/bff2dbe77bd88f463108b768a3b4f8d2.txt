Google took its case against Canada's proposed Online News Act to a parliamentary committee Tuesday, warning MPs that the legislation is flawed and won't address the challenges faced by struggling Canadian news organizations.Colin McKay, head of public policy and government relations for Google Canada, told members of the Canadian Heritage committee that while it supports a sustainable future for Canadian journalism, Bill C-18, the Online News Act — which would force online platforms to compensate Canadian news organizations for the use of their content — won't do what the government hopes it will do.
