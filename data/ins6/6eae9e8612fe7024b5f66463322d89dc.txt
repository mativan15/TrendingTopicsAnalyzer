Last night I was again upset after Notre Dame's offense was non-existent in the first half, in fact putting up a goose egg in the first half against Stanford.  On Sunday afternoon I decided to go into the numbers a bit on Notre Dame's slow start and the numbers are incredibly concerning over the last two years, the two years Tommy Rees has been offensive coordinator.
Since the start of 2021, a 19 game span, Notre Dame has scored a grand total of 86 points in the first quarter.
