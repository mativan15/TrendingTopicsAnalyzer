President Joe Biden predicted Democrats will fare better in the midterm elections as the economy improves. Polls have recently favored Republicans as concerns over the economy have eclipsed abortion in recent polls. "Back and forth, with them ahead, us ahead, them ahead, back and forth. The polls have been all over the place," Biden said, speaking at the White House. "I think that we're going to see one more shift back to our side in the closing days." A recent CNBC survey found Republicans scored higher on voter preference for economic issues, with double-digit leads on the questions of who would do a better job bringing down inflation, handling taxes, dealing with deficits and creating jobs.
