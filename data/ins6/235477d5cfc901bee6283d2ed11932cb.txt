By Australian Associated Press Published: 22:00 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 22:00 EDT, 16 October 2022 The Central Coast Mariners will return to the A-League Women next season as the competition's 12th team. The Mariners were granted a provisional licence earlier this year, subject to approval by the FA Board, but were not officially welcomed into the competition until Monday morning. Central Coast were one of eight teams to contest the inaugural A-League Women season in 2008-09 but exited the competition after two campaigns due to financial constraints.
