SAN DIEGO —

Bob Melvin is about as mild-mannered as big league managers come, a 19-year veteran whose style has always leaned more toward the even-keeled, professorial Gil Hodges than the volcanic Billy Martin.

So when the San Diego Padres field boss aired out his players in the clubhouse and then ripped them to the media after a lackluster 4-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sept. 15, it caught his club by surprise.

'It's interesting, because you don't see it much,' Padres second baseman Jake Cronenworth said with a laugh, when asked what it's like when Melvin gets mad.
