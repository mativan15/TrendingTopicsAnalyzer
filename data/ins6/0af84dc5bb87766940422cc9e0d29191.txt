During family reunions over Thanksgiving, cousins Matisse and Sidney Thybulle frequently competed against each other in games like hide-and-seek and Nerf gun battles.

One of those competitive moments occurred in video games where Matisse Thybulle, who is four years older than his cousin, used his knowledge to his advantage. When Sidney inquired how to pull off a 'power slide' in Mario Kart, Matisse told his cousin that he had to hit the buttons in a specific pattern to call up a dialog box in which he had to type a certain password to acquire the special move.
