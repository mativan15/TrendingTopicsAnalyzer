Shares of retailers and other consumer companies rose as consumer discretionary stocks led gainers. Americans will spend a record amount on costumes, decorations and other Halloween items this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Total spending is expected to hit $10.6 billion, an increase of 5%, or $500 million, over last year, the National Retail Federation estimates. That's up $2 billion, or 20%, over the $8.8 billion spent on Halloween in 2019 -- the last trick-or-treat before the Covid-19 pandemic.
