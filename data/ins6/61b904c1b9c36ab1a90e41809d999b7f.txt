Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said that while the central bank will continue raising interest rates to curb high inflation, the objective was to ensure that the market doesn't get any shocks and that growth revival is not derailed. The bond market, however, doesn't seem to be listening. Yield on the 10-year benchmark 6.54 per cent 2032 paper climbed as much as 4 basis points on Friday, with the bond last trading at 7.33 per cent. Bond prices fall when yields rise. "We are committed to containing inflation," Governor Das told the Economic Times in an interview.
