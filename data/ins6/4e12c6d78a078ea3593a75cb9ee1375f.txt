Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam.
Warner Bros.


In his extensive filmography, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has drifted cars, braved falling skyscrapers, thumped Jason Statham, plunged bloodthirsty baboons into a bottomless canyon, thwarted domestic terrorists who would like to inflict harm on a bay, smacked Vin Diesel, fired a rocket at a mutant wolf, squared off against earthquakes, punched missiles, skinned a mythical lion, and revolted against a pyrokinetic Polynesian goddess bent on destroying human life.
