From the most loved footballer in Barcelona, Portuguese playmaker Luis Figo became the most hated figure overnight when he controversially switched to El Clasico rivals Real Madrid for then record transfer fee of 60 million dollars. No Clasico passes by without a passing reference to Figo, often as a symbol of greed and selfishness, as a sign of the game's shifting culture and politics. So significant a moment in football history that even 22 years after the incident, Figo is considered a 'traitor' in​ Camp Nou.
