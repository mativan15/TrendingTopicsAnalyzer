Banaras Hindu University (BHU) released today a notification clarifying the fee hike speculations. The university stated that the new fee hike system only applies to candidates taking admissions in the annual year 2022-23.
'It has come to the notice of Banaras Hindu University administration that misleading information regarding BHU's fee structure is being shared and spread over social media and other platforms by some persons. It is being falsely claimed that the fee of BHU students has been hiked, which is untrue and unfounded,' the notification reads.
