British Prime Minister Liz Truss has described herself as 'a fighter and not a quitter' as she faces down a hostile opposition and fury from her own Conservative Party over her botched economic plan.
Truss on Wednesday attended her first session of Prime Minister's Questions since newly appointed chancellor Jeremy Hunt ripped up the tax-cutting package unveiled by her new government less than a month ago.
She apologised to parliament and admitted she made mistakes during her short tenure as the United Kingdom's head of government.
