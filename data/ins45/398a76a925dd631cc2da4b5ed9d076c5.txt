By Australian Associated Press Published: 04:35 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 04:35 EDT, 19 October 2022 Perth Wildcats captain Jesse Wagstaff has rolled the dice and won at the NBL Tribunal, freeing him to play in Saturday's clash with the Tasmania JackJumpers. Wagstaff was offered a one-match ban with an early guilty plea for his screen that concussed Melbourne United's Lachie Barker last Friday. The incident was assessed as careless conduct, high contact and high impact, resulting in a base penalty of two games.
