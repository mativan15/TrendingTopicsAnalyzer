Barbershops might not seem to offer a huge market but the country has about 130,000 of them and 20,000 are using a barbershop management system called Squire. It handles online bookings, sends customers reminders when it is time to book an appointment, and pays barbers, even if they don't have bank accounts, and also provides an easy way for them to use debit payments to pay rent on their chair. Many barbers lack bank accounts and convenient access to basic financial services.
