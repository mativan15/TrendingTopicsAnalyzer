May 31—BETHEL — Authorities were searching Monday for the suspect in a Sunday night robbery at The Big Apple convenience store, Cpl. Michael Fitzsimmons of the Oxford County Sheriff's Office said.

About 10:20 p.m., sheriff's deputies responded to the store at 10 Railroad St. after an employee reported a robbery. An unknown person wearing a mask demanded money from the clerk and fled on foot with nearly $200 in cash, Fitzsimmons said.

Officers used police canines to try to track the suspect, Fitzsimmons said, but were ultimately unsuccessful.
