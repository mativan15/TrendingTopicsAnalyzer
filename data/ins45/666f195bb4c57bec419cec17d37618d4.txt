The delay in appointing the chairperson and members to the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) has almost paralysed the key rights body in the State.While the commission is without a full-time chairperson since December 2021, all six members retired in July 2022. With no members, and hence no quorum, the quasi-judicial authority, now led by an acting chairperson, Jayashree, is unable to pass any orders.This has led to a large backlog of cases at the commission. According to KSCPCR data, 532 cases related to various child rights violations are pending.
