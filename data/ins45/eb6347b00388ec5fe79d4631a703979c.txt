As Covid loosens its grip and travel guidelines across the globe are relaxed, Indians have begun to holiday with a vengeance. This, despite a rise in travel-related costs. While Yatra.com claims the foreign travel costs have risen by 8-10% compared to pre-Covid prices, SOTC Travel states these have gone up by 25-40% across countries. 'With strong pent-up travel demand and demand-supply imbalance, coupled with an increase in ATF (aviation turbine fuel), there has been an uptick in air fares. Still, we expect these to stabilise as airlines increase capacity and routes in a phased manner,' says Daniel D'souza, President & Country Head, Holidays, SOTC Travel.
