Furman magazine feature article inspires hope.

Recently I received my copy of Furman Magazine by snail mail. As an alumnus, my first inclination upon receiving the magazine is to go to the class notes section to check on my classmates, but along the way, thumbing through the magazine, I came across a full-page photo of a class of 1993 student, former Prime Minister of Finland, Alexander Stubb. His warm smile was compelling. Class news seemed less urgent.

What Stubb has already accomplished in his lifetime is remarkable.
