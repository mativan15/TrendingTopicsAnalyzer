For community association directors, members and property managers, the three similar news reports from across the country making headlines on the very same day on Sept. 26 should send a clear message: Fraud, theft and abuse can happen to any community, and only those with stringent preventative measures stand a chance at thwarting potential schemes.

The reports began in Minneapolis when several local outlets as well as the Associated Press chronicled how a California woman had been indicted in federal court for embezzling more than $1 million from several local HOAs.
