American actor Ralph Macchio, who has portrayed the character of Daniel LaRusso in the "Karate Kid" films and Netflix's "Cobra Kai," has assumed the role of author. "Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me" recounts the growth of Macchio, now 60, following the 1984 debut of the original film, which launched 1986 and 1989 sequels and a five-season Netflix series that elaborates on the tale of Daniel's original opponent, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). The story is inextricably linked to Daniel LaRusso and the adventure of 'The Karate Kid.
