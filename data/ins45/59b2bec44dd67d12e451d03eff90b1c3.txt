With a population of 250 people, the historic gold mining community of Ravenswood is often dubbed a ghost town.It's an unlikely stop for a music tour, but for one festival, it's the perfect destination. "It's such a cool town – I feel like I've stepped back 100 years," Canadian singer-songwriter Catherine MacLellan said.The Festival of Small Halls takes national and international folk musicians off the beaten track to perform in tiny town halls across the country. Ravenswood's community hall was built around 1880.
