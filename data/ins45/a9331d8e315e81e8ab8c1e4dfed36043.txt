Andrew Robertson claims this season's title race is different from previous seasons when Liverpool have slugged it out with Manchester City. Arsenal have opened up a four-point lead by winning nine of their first 10 league games, while Tottenham and Manchester United have also improved. Liverpool are back in eighth after their best win of the season so far over City and they have won just three of their opening nine games. Robertson knows this is not good enough and says the Reds still have work to do to get back into the title race.
