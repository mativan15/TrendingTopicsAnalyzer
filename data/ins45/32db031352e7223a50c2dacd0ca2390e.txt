Former Congress leader Ashwani Kumar has said the election of Mallikarjun Kharge as party president by a huge margin shows Sonia Gandhi has the last word in the organisation's internal politics. She is likely to command such respect as long as she is active in the party in whatever capacity, Mr. Kumar said on October 19, 2022 while asserting that it is because party persons retain a sense of personal loyalty to her, which extends to the family.
