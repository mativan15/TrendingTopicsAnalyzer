EAGAN CITY COUNCIL

Edward Arias

Candidate responses not available.

Paul Bakken

What would your top priorities be if elected? I will build on the contributions I have made to Eagan during my previous five terms. I will work to ensure good value for our tax dollars, preserve open space, support our infrastructure, and provide common sense leadership. I will also make certain that our decision-making processes are open, equitable, and accessible to input from the community.

What qualifies you to hold this position? I am a 29-year resident of Eagan, a small business owner, and a former Army officer.
