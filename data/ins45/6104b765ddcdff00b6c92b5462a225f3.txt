'Not only were we building the plane as we were flying it,' writes Kate Bingham, appointed by Boris Johnson in May 2020 to chair the UK Vaccine Task Force, 'we were flying in the dark and simultaneously writing the instruction manual, and fielding endless petty questions from air traffic control asking about the strength of the orange juice we were serving to passengers.'
