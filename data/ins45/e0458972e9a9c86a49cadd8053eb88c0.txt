Justin Sullivan Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) has just unveiled its new Polestar 3 SUV, slated to go on sale in late 2023 to 2024 following the discontinuation of the Polestar 1. The startup is also targeting one of the highest growth rates in the EV industry in Q4, looking to grow deliveries by over 110% q/q to reach 20,000 units; in essence, Polestar is aiming to deliver 40% of its annual volume in just one quarter. With production and deliveries scaling substantially alongside a long slate of upcoming vehicle models, Polestar will need cash, and a lot of it in order to execute its plan.
