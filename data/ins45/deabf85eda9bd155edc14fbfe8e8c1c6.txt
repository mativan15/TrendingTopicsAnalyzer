Melbourne Cup winner Verry Elleegant has been retired following her run in the Fillies' and Mares' Stakes at Ascot on British Champions Day.

She won 11 Group One races for Australian trainer Chris Waller before being transferred to Francis-Henri Graffard earlier this year in preparation for an audacious European campaign, which was focused around the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

The champion stayer did not sparkle in the northern hemisphere, however.

She failed to win on her first two starts and subsequently missed the cut for the Arc.
