Millions of families have been hit with more pain as food inflation soared to a 42-year high of nearly 15 per cent, official figures revealed on Wednesday.The rise in the cost of food helped push headline inflation in September to 10.1 per cent, up from 9.9 per cent in August and matching the previous record high reached in July, and underlined the huge cost-of-living squeeze being faced by households across the country.Economists said the latest inflation data was likely to increase pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates by one percentage point to 3.
