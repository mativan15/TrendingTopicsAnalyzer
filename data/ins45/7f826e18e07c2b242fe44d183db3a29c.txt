AFTER A brief absence from West Bengal politics following the BJP's defeat in the Assembly polls last year, where he was one of the star campaigners, actor-turned-politician Mithun Chakraborty is back in the picture with his surprise inclusion in the BJP's core committee for the state.
On October 17, BJP national president J P Nadda announced the new 20-member core committee, with its West Bengal president Sukanta Majumdar and Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari heading the panel.
A BJP National Executive member, Chakraborty's only political contribution lately has been claiming off and on about TMC MLAs who want to cross over being in touch with him – sometimes quoting a figure of about 21 and other times of around 38 MLAs.
