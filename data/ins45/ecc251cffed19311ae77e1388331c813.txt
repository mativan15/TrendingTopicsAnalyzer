One month after its foreclosure, Downtown's Peachtree Center has a new agency leasing team.

Transwestern Real Estate Services will provide agency leasing and asset services for the six-building office and retail district. Chip Roach, Stephen Clifton and Zach Wooten have the leasing assignment. Russell Lipscomb will manage asset services.

The leasing team was selected by Situs AMC, the special servicer who took over Peachtree Center from previous owner Banyan Street Capital at a foreclosure sale in September.
