A big mistake too many entrepreneurs make is spending thousands and thousands of dollars on a visual brand identity without proving their offers or their messaging. But what good are pretty visuals if too many people are confused when you talk about what you do? An indicator that you should prioritize your brand messaging over your brand imagery or brand design is a high bounce rate on your website, as shown in Google Analytics. Another indicator is that your business only gets referrals.

While you could ask a brand designer to create a custom logo, color palette and typography or a videographer and photographer to provide you with beautiful brand imagery, this almost always becomes an expensive mistake if you haven't proven your offers, or if your messaging doesn't resonate.
