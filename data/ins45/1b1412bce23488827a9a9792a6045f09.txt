A new entry in the Mortal Kombat series is coming to mobile. Unlike past mobile titles from the franchise, this one isn't a watered-down fighting game, but a roleplaying game featuring everyone's favorite ninjas, cyborgs, and EarthRealm kombatants.

The new RPG is titled, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught. In an interview with Buisnesswire, Ed Boon, Chief Creative Officer of NetherRealm Studios, describes the game as a 'strategic team-based collection RPG with fast-paced, group melee combat.' He also speaks on how the game aims to be open enough for old and new series fans to jump into.
