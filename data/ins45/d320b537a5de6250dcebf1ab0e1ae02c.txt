Ranvir Singh has brushed off any scrutiny of the age gap between her and boyfriend Louis Church. 
The Good Morning Britain presenter began quietly dating the TV producer in 2020 when she competed on Strictly Come Dancing where he was employed. 
They struck up a romance when Ranvir was stuck in isolation with professional dance partner Giovanni Pernice, and Louis – a production secretary – was one of the few faces she was allowed to see outside of training. 
Since then, the two have gone public with their relationship and were pictured attending Ascot as a couple with Ranvir's 10-year-old son Tushaan.
