Boris Johnson was ousted by his own party after a string of controversies
Liz Truss's resignation on Thursday was met with relief by voters in the Conservative stronghold town of Godalming, located in the well-heeled London commuter belt."Terrific!" said travel agent Ken Cully, 62, on hearing the news."She just made a mess of it, an absolute mess of it and didn't have the support of the rest of the party."Cully said the chaos of the past few weeks had left him very concerned and he feared it was too late for the Conservatives to turn their fortunes around.
