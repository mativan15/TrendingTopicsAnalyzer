Liz Truss has cancelled a planned visit to a factory where she had been due to take questions from the media amid continuing uncertainty over her future.

The prime minister was scheduled to visit an electronics manufacturer but No 10 said the event was axed because she had 'government businesses' to attend to, but declined to comment further.

It came as another Conservative MP publicly called on Ms Truss to quit over September's disastrous mini-Budget, which sparked chaos in the financial markets.
