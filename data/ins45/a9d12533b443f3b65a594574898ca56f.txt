The stock market could be gearing up for big upside as the Federal Reserve gets potentially closer to a pause in its interest rate hikes, according to a Wednesday note from Fundstrat's Tom Lee.The Fed is expected to hike interest rates another 75 basis points at its November and December meetings but could stop after that, according to Lee."A pause simply means [the] Fed is shifting back to data dependency," he said, rather than playing catch-up in its bid to tame inflation via outsized rate hikes.
