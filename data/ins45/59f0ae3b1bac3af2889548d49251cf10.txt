It is right that it remains a universal benefit available to all retirees – but those who need more, should get more, and vice versa.
An obvious way the Treasury could save money is to raise the state pension age even higher. But this solution risks penalising those who have toiled in physical, hard jobs and need to retire earlier on health grounds.
It is also unfair on those who have a lower life expectancy. Perversely, those from deprived areas who rely on the state pension the most, are likely to receive the least of it.
