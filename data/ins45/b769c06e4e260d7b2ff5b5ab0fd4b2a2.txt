As American manufacturers face mounting economic headwinds, an expired U.S. trade measure is inflicting unnecessary damage on our manufacturing sector which plays a critical role in strengthening our nation's health and national security and historically paves the way in any economic recovery.

The failure by Congress to renew a key trade measure for nearly two years has hit U.S. manufacturers recovering from the pandemic-induced downturn and facing new economic challenges extremely hard.

U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers have been operating without the benefits of a trade measure, known as the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB), since the end of 2020.
