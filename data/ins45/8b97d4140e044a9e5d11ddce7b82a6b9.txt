The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks are twins, and that will continue to be the case when they go electric. Contents 
Chevy unveiled its Silverado EV at CES 2022, and now it's GMC's turn. The 2024 GMC Sierra EV borrows some key features from its Chevy sibling, as well GMC's first electric truck — the Hummer EV. Some of those features were actually pioneered by General Motors two decades ago on non-electric trucks, and are now making a comeback.
You can reserve a Sierra EV now, but deliveries aren't scheduled to start until early calendar-year 2024.
