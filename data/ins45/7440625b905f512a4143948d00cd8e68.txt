Tokyo shares closed lower on Monday after falls on Wall Street, where investors shrugged off mostly solid bank earnings, and worries persisted over bond yields and recession risks. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 1.16 percent, or 314.97 points, to end at 26,775.79, while the broader Topix index lost 0.98 percent, or 18.63 points, to 1,879.56. Analysts said Tokyo shares dropped because traders were discouraged by losses of US stocks. The dollar fetched 148.75 yen in Asian trade, against 148.72 yen in New York late Friday.
