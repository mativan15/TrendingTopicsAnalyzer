If you're a die-hard Ranveer Singh fan, you must be well aware of his love for cars. Singh, a proud owner of luxury cars, is frequently sighted flaunting them on Mumbai's streets. The actor was recently spotted driving his Aston Martin around Mumbai airport. Ranveer had reportedly purchased the car three years ago, which he refurbished recently. Ditching his prolonged love for white cars, Ranveer made a surprising choice and unleashed his bold and eccentric side. The car, which was initially white, has an electric blue wrap to ensure it stands out on the road.
