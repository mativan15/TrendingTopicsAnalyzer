None of the non-government principals contacted by the Herald complained about the funding changes. They spoke anonymously to allow them to comment freely. However, they said the funding loss would require measures that could change the character and make-up of the school community by making them too expensive for middle-class families.Private school fees usually rise by about 3 per cent a year; affected schools would have to raise fees further.Waverley College, which costs up to $17,400 a year, wrote to its families predicting it would lose $27 million in government funding over the decade to 2029, equating to a 37 per cent decrease.
