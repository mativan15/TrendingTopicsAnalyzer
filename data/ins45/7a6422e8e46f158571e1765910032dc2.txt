Axon, the police technology company best known for selling stun guns and police body cameras, has announced its latest project in the wake of a series of deadly mass shootings: a drone equipped with a stun gun and a surveillance system. In a press release, the company stated that the system is 'part of a long-term plan to stop mass shootings,' and claimed that it would be capable of incapacitating an active shooter in 60 seconds.'This network of cameras, with human and AI monitoring, together with panic buttons and other local communication tools, can detect and ID a threat before a shot is fired and dramatically improve response times and situational awareness,' Axon wrote in the release.
