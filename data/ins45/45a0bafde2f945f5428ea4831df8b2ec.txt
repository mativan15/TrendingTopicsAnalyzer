Published: 17:48 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 17:48 EDT, 4 June 2022 Earl Spencer's former head of security is suing the BBC for damages after his bank statements were forged by Martin Bashir to help secure the now-discredited Princess Diana interview.Alan Waller was left ‘deeply distressed' by the Panorama reporter's deceitful tactics, according to documents filed at the High Court. The 59-year-old says his business ventures suffered when his name was linked to the scandal.While the BBC has compensated many others affected, including graphic artist Matt Wiessler who mocked up the fake documents on Bashir's instructions, Mr Waller says he has been forced to take the Corporation to court because it refuses to settle his claim, or even engage with him in a ‘meaningful' way.
