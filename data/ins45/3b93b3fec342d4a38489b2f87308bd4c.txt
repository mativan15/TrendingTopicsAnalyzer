By Xavier Fontdegloria Activity in the Chicago area gained momentum in May, partly reversing April's deceleration, according to data from a survey compiled by MNI Indicators published Tuesday. The Chicago Business Barometer rose to 60.3 in May from 56.4 in April, topping the 55.9 consensus forecast from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. Readings above 50 point to expansion of activity, while below 50 indicate contraction. The barometer is compiled after surveying firms in the Chicago area to assess business conditions.
