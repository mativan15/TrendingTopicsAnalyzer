 U.S. stock futures were mostly unchanged ahead of data on consumer spending and sentiment during a period of climbing prices. S&P 500 futures were down 0.1% and futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1%. Changes in equity futures don't necessarily predict movements after the markets open.
