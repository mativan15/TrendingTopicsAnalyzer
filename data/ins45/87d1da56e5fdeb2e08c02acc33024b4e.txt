Jonathan Kitchen/DigitalVision via Getty Images It's been about three and a half months since I wrote my "mea culpa" article on Fonar Corporation (NASDAQ:FONR), and in that time the shares are down about 7% against a loss of about 7.6% for the S&P 500. In case you forgot, I suggested in that article that the shares were neither cheap, nor expensive, and for that reason, I would neither sell my small position nor add to it. The company has released financials since, and the shares are cheaper, so this story needs to be revisited in my view.
