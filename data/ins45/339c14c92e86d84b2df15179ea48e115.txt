Former Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada at October 13 fireside chat October 17, 2022 – The U.S. has a lot to learn from Costa Rica.
That message came through loud and clear in a fireside chat with former Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, held October 13 at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Alvarado took office in 2018 at the age of 38 and stepped down last May, at the end of his constitutionally limited term. He is currently serving as a professor of practice at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
