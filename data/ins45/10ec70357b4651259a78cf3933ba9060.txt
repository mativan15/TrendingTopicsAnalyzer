Thinkhubstudio/iStock via Getty Images Thesis Futu (NASDAQ:FUTU) is a high risk/high reward bet. While the company is the clear market leader for online brokerage services in China, a market that provides truly enormous growth potential, the company is highly exposed to regulatory risk and uncertainty. Given the current situation, I advise to value Futu according to analyst consensus EPS and reflect the heightened risk exposure through a 50% WACC premium as compared to US peer Robinhood (HOOD). That said, based on a residual earnings framework I calculate a base-case target price of $41.
