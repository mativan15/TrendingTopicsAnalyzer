The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) officially cleared Apple AirTag trackers for takeoff, amid widespread confusion following German airline Lufthansa's tweet that the Bluetooth-enabled AirTags were 'classified as dangerous and need to be turned off' during flights. Five days later, Lufthansa reversed that position. 
'Luggage tracking devices powered by lithium metal cells that have 0.3 grams or less of lithium can be used on checked baggage,' the FAA said in a statement provided to Forbes.
