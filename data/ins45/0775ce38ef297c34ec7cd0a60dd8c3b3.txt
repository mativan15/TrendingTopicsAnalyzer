Former NFL running back Ricky Williams said he changed his last name about a year-and-a-half ago after he got married to his wife, Linnea Miron. During an interview on The Dan Le Batard Show with StuGotz, the Texas Longhorns legend said he has changed his name to Errick Miron.

Although his first name was always legally known as Errick, the retired athlete said he has now taken his wife's last name to find balance in their relationship, KXAN reports.

'It was quick and easy, and it felt really meaningful,' he told The Dan Le Batard Show.
