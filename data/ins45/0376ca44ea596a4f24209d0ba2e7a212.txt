Enhanced police action along with effective implementation of rehabilitation policy and police ensuring that the benefits of government schemes and employment opportunities reach the majority tribal population has resulted in a sharp decline in Naxal-related incidents in Gadchiroli over the last few years.
A 14-year data on Naxal killings, arrests, policemen and civilian killings in Gadchiroli district shows a declining trend of such incidents. This year, one Naxal (a woman) has been killed as against the killing of 49 Naxals in 2021 that included 26 deaths in just one encounter in November last year.
