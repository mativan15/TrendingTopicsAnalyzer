Thursday was a bit of a disappointment for investors as a stock market that spent the morning in the green ended the session in the red, with the S&P 500 down 0.8%.
It wasn't bad news for everyone, however. As of the close of trading for the day, cloud data services provider Snowflake (SNOW 1.75%) had managed to hang onto a modest 1.8% gain, while customer relationship management software giant Salesforce (CRM 2.49%) and database company MongoDB (MDB 3.37%) remained up by 2.5% and 3.4%, respectively.
