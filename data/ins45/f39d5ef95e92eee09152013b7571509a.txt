Insiders who purchased AU$750k worth of Analytica Limited (ASX:ALT) shares over the past year recouped some of their losses after price gained 33% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be an expensive wager as insiders are yet to get ahead of their losses which currently stand at AU$321k since the time of purchase.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
