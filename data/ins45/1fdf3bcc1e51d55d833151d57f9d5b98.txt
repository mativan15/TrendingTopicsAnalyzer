Klopp had prompted the war or words when he sarcastically criticised Newcastle's director of football Dan Ashworth for saying there was 'no ceiling' on what they could achieve under their new owners.
The combative Liverpool boss suggested this confirmed the Magpies would soon be spending vast sums of money to win trophies in England and Europe, which would make it harder for Liverpool to stay at the top of the game.
"It's a difficult one because it's probably been used in the wrong way,' said Howe ahead of Wednesday night's home game against Everton.
