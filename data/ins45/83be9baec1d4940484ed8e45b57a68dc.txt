Joe Joyce believes Oleksandr Usyk will vacate the WBO title rather than defend it against him. Joyce picked up the WBO interim belt in a career-best win against Joseph Parker last month and is now the established mandatory challenger for the main strap.Usyk will be ordered to defend his WBO crown against Joyce in March as per the sanctioning body's rules, so the race is on to book the undisputed fight with Tyson Fury before then. Fury's promoter Frank Warren recently told Express Sport that they are aiming to make Usyk vs Fury in February to ensure all-four belts are on the line.
