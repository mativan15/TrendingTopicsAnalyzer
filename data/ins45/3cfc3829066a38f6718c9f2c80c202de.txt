One of Top Gun's most iconic scenes so angered Paramount executives that the late filmmaker Tony Scott could have lost his job, according to the Oscar-nominated editors who worked on the 1986 classic.
The iconic volleyball scene featuring a glistening Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer has remained a pop culture fascination for 36 years. To capture the magic, Scott burned an entire day on filming, something the studio did not expect for the scene, which was only a paragraph long in the script . 'That scene was scripted as a real game,' editor Chris Lebenzon says on this week's episode of THR's Behind the Screen podcast.
