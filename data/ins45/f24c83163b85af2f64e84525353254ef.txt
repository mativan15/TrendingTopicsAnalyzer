SAGINAW, Mich. — The homecoming parade float carrying NBA champion Draymond Green — a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge — rolled for a mile headed straight toward Saginaw's North Side.

At the rally at end of the parade route, Green acted differently than the party animal who on stage in Oakland eight days earlier sprayed champagne and asked Warriors fans to 'stroke my ego a little bit,' prompting chants of his name.

On this day, a more serious Green stood before the crowd gathered near his old neighborhood and delivered a motivational speech.
