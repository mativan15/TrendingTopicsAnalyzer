An audacious $23.8-million high-tech heist has led to an unholy alliance between an alleged kid thief and his victim, who are teaming up to take down AT&T.
Last week, Ellis 'Baby Al Capone' Pinsky, 20, agreed to pay a $22 million judgment to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Michael Terpin, four years after Pinsky — then a 15-year-old high school student in posh Irvington, NY — allegedly led a team that hacked Terpin's phone and took some $24 million in crypto.
As part of the deal in Terpin's civil suit against him, Pinsky — who did not admit to any guilt and has not been criminally charged — will reportedly also testify under oath when Terpin takes AT&T to court in May 2023.
