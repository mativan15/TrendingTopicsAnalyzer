St. Thomas has announced plans to build new facilities for its hockey, baseball and softball teams, putting the hockey arena on campus and targeting St. Paul's Highland Bridge development as a potential site for the ball fields.

In a Tuesday news release, athletic director Phil Esten said a multi-purpose facility for the men's and women's hockey teams is likely to be built on its south campus. The school previously explored off-campus sites, including Highland Bridge and St. Paul's Town & Country Club, for a hockey arena.
