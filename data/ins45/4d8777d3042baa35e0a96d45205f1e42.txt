SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with investors cautious on China amid the ongoing Party Congress, while European markets are set to extend the optimism on earnings ahead of British inflation readings.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed earlier gains to be 0.5% lower, driven by a 1.2% drop in Chinese blue chips and a 1.4% fall in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index.

Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.5% while Australia's resources-heavy shares gained 0.
