Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images News U.S. stocks were struggling for direction on Wednesday as strong earnings reports from some big names were offset by soaring Treasury yields that earlier touched decade highs. By late morning, the Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) had lost 0.29% to 10,740.72 points, with a surge in shares of Netflix unable to buoy the tech-heavy index. The benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) was 0.18% lower at 3,713.36 points. The blue-chip Dow (DJI) was slightly higher, gaining 0.25% to 30,599.
