A family holiday went wrong when they arrived at Newport on the Isle of Wight for a holiday - only to discover that it wasn't the location they'd actually booked A family had to fork out £1,000 after they turned up at Newport on the Isle of Wight for a holiday - only to discover they'd actually booked a stay in Newport in South Wales. Louise Turner, 37, spent £1,000 on a guesthouse she claims was listed for the island but she and her family were dismayed to realise it was 130 miles away. This meant Louise and her husband Jose Pacheco, 46, were forced to stump up £1,000 for somewhere to stay - and are now looking for a refund.
