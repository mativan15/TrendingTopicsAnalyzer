By Brandon Truitt May 27, 2022 / 6:01 PM / CBS Boston HULL – Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer for many. At some Massachusetts coastal businesses, that means it will be a busy weekend while staffing levels are finally returning closer to normal.  On Friday, the lobsters were being put onto rolls at Jake's Seafoods in Hull, just one of the many signs of the quickly approaching busy season for coastal communities. "I think the season is going to be good. It takes a little bit to get going every season especially down here on the seacoast and on the Cape," said Jim O'Brien, who owns the Hull restaurant.
