GAINESVILLE — Though virtually impossible to upstage the all-time classic staged in Knoxville earlier in the day, give Florida and LSU credit for trying their darnedest Saturday night.

The Gators and Tigers tossed in every ingredient from their figurative spice rack to keep the spillover audience from Alabama-Tennessee engaged: pageantry, Petty music, prolific offense, even a punt muff.

Had the Gators tossed in even a dash of defense, this might really have been a doozy.

Instead (to steal a Tom Petty song title), LSU's skill guys found themselves repeatedly sprinting into the great wide open.
