Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to appear for a deposition Wednesday in a defamation lawsuit filed by former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll.

A federal judge said Mr. Trump had delayed the case and must show up for questioning because he 'should not be able to run out the clock.'

CNN reports it is unclear if Mr. Trump will answer questions since his lawyers did not return calls for comment.

Ms. Carroll is suing Mr. Trump because he denied her accusation that he raped her in a department store in the 1990s.
