Southland professional Corbin Strong has scored a silver medal at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships to cap a golden year which has featured a Commonwealth Games gold medal and a stage win in the Tour of Britain. The 22-year-old was rewarded for his bunch riding nous with silver in the elimination race on the final day of the world championships in Paris on Sunday (Monday NZ time). It left New Zealand with three silver medals from the world championships and encouragement that there is a silver lining to their preparations towards the 2024 Paris Olympics in the same St Quentin En Yvelines Velodrome.
