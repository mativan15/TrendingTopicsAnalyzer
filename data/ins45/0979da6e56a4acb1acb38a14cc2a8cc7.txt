What I am looking at June 3, 2022 Big call on Apple (AAPL): Weak App store growth in May poses risk to third-quarter estimates, says Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty, the axe. She estimates revenue growth decelerated to 4% year over year in May, down from what she estimates to be 8% year-over-year growth in April — despite easier comparisons. Results were weaker across all regions except the United States. First App store monetization decline in two years, with only two of 10 categories showing growth.
