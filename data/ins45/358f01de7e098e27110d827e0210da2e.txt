A huge push to recruit Kiwi nurses is putting further pressure on New Zealand's stretch health sector, but one West Coast nurse is bucking the trend by choosing to move here from Australia instead. Across the ditch, nurses can earn $20,000 to $30,000 more a year, than they can in New Zealand. However, for Sophie Carey, who moved from the Northern Territory in 2020, the decision to buck that trend came down to lifestyle and house prices. Carey is a part of a new recruitment campaign on the West Coast searching for those who are ‘Cut out for the Coast'.
