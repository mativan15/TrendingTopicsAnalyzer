Published: 10:36 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 11:21 EDT, 4 June 2022 Boris Johnson was jeered by the public during Platinum Jubilee celebrations because they are 'fed up' with the Conservative Government, according to his political rival. The Prime Minister was booed by some in the crowd as he arrived with his wife, Carrie Johnson, to attend the National Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he 'wasn't surprised' that Mr Johnson faced a hostile reception from some of those gathered in central London.
