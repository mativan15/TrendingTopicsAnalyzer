Australians haven't been holding back when it comes to saving their hard-earned cash.

New research from Finder found most Aussies were putting aside $743 a month on average.

A nationally representative survey of 1,057 respondents revealed three in five Australians – equivalent to 12 million people – had good savings habits.

This includes almost half who classify themselves as mostly a saver but splurge from time to time, and 13 per cent who say they are definitely a saver.
