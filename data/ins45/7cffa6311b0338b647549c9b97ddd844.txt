The British pound and government bond prices rose on Thursday as the Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation after a tumultuous six weeks in the job.

The British pound traded 0.5 percent higher against the dollar, reaching $1.13 as Ms. Truss read a short statement outside Downing Street. Ms. Truss said there would be a Conservative Party leadership election that would be completed in the next week and that she would remain as prime minister until her successor was chosen.

Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, fell.
