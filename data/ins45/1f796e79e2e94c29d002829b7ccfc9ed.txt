President Biden has OK'd the airlift of more than 8 million bottles of baby formula via a series of flights from London and Australia over the coming weeks, the White House announced Wednesday — as the shortage of product in the US shows no sign of easing. 
Moments before Biden convened a meeting of infant formula manufacturers, the administration announced two flights commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services would bring the equivalent of 4.6 million 8-oz. bottles of Bubs Australia formula to the US from Down Under.
