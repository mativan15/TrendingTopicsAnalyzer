President Joe Biden can do more to fight inflation and needs to take action soon, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Thursday.

Khanna broke with Biden on inflation in a Thursday op-ed in the New York Times, arguing the president's solutions to inflation are merely "reacting to headlines."

"I support the president's efforts, but we need a bolder vision and faster action," Khanna wrote.

"To meet the moment, Mr. Biden should convene an emergency task force empowered to lower prices and address shortages.
