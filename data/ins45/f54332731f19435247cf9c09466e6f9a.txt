 Electric scooter company Bird continues to downsize as it has announced its machines will be exiting several regions in an effort to stay afloat.The company states it's going to 'fully exit' (opens in new tab) Germany, Sweden, and Norway as well as several 'small to mid-sized markets' across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, although it didn't mention which exact locations. However, we do know of one: Atchison, Kansas, which recently revealed (opens in new tab) that Bird is pausing all operations in the city indefinitely.
