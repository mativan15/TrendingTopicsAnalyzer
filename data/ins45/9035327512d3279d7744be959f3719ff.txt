Harrison Bader's trade to the Yankees was met with skepticism. Why did the Yankees trade a very effective and reliable starter in Jordan Montgomery for an injured outfielder?

Bader has made his presence known this week in the ALDS against the Cleveland Guardians with two home runs, including one Saturday night in Game 3 that gave the Yankees a 5-3 lead. We know what happened next: The Guardians walked it off in the ninth inning with former Mets shortstop Amed Rosario scoring the winning run. The Yankees are now on the ropes, facing a must-win Game 4 at Progressive Field on Sunday.
