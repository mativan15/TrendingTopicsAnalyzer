Angry Tory MPs told the media later the events 'reflect really badly on the Government of the day'.LoadingSir Charles Walker told the BBC: 'This is an absolute disgrace. As a Tory MP of 17 years, who's never been a minister who's got on with it loyally most of the time, I think it's a shambles and a disgrace. I think it is utterly appalling.''I hope all those people that put Liz Truss in Number 10, I hope it was worth it... Because the damage they have done to the party is extraordinary. I've had enough of talentless people putting their tick in the right box not because it's in the national interest, but because it's in their own interest to achieve a ministerial position.
