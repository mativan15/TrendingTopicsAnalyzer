Key Points

Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech Sunday at the opening ceremony of the Communist Party of China's 20th National Congress that laid out priorities for the next five years.
The congress' implications for different sectors "are a big boost for industrial policy," the Natixis analysts said, pointing to Xi's frequent mention of the need for innovation.
"The focus on national security points to the continuation of zero-Covid policies and pressure in internet platforms," the Natixis analysts said.
