HoodyBy @AndrewHoodyOct 18, 2022This might be the weirdest collaboration we've ever heard of, but Cards Against Humanity is apparently selling clam-flavored mayonnaise in stores starting this week! The fill-in-the-blank card game has teamed up with Target to release "Clam-O-Naise" starting this week that is "the world's only tangy, garlicky mayonnaise made with real clams." Now it may sound off-putting to you because the mayonnaise is said to have notes of garlic, bacon, and white wine, but if you pick up a jar then not only do you get the card game's new "Clam Pack," but there's also a mystery prize at the bottom of every jar.
