"House of the Dragon" episode nine is full of that signature "Game of Thrones" political intrigue, as Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) and Ser Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) try to install Aegon Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the Iron Throne.This divides many of those around them since the now-dead King Viserys had previously sworn to his daughter, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy), that she would be queen. However, there's another powerful member of House Targaryen in King's Landing that the Hightowers have to deal with: Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best).
