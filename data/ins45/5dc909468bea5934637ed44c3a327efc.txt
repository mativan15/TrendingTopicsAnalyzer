MUMBAI: Now, one can buy craft wine or craft beer from microbreweries or wineries in bulk. In yet another move to make selling and buying of craft wine and beer more liberal and earn more revenue for the state, the excise department has allowed sale of naturally fermented craft wine and craft beer in cans or growlers up to the size of 5 litres.This, said experts, will not only help retailers carry larger stock but will also help individual hosts in serving their guests at parties. No other permission is needed for such a deal except for individual drinking permits and transport passes.
