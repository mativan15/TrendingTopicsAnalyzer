SIKSIKA, Alta. - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the chief of a southern Alberta First Nation have signed a historic land-claim settlement which the federal government says is one of the largest of its kind in Canada. Trudeau and Marc Miller, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, participated in a signing ceremony Thursday with Chief Ouray Crowfoot of Siksika First Nation, its council and community members 150 kilometres east of Calgary. 'We're gathered today to right a wrong from the past,' Trudeau said during the ceremony held where the original treaty was signed 145 years ago.
