Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would also be under pressure to resign if the Prime Minister's promise to spend 3% of national income on defence by 2030 was broken.Mr Heappey said he and Mr Wallace, who is tipped as a potential successor in Downing Street, both believe the pledge 'must be delivered' and warned there is 'no prosperity without security'.Mr Hunt has refused to rule out rowing back on the promise as he searches for cuts to plug a multimillion-pound black hole in the nation's finances.A defence source said Mr Wallace believes the pledge, which the Royal United Services Institute think tank estimates would cost an extra £157 billion, is a 'priority' and not a discretionary spend.
