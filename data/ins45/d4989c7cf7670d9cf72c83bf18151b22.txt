When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or "P/E's") below 13x, you may consider Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV) as a stock to potentially avoid with its 19.3x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Elevance Health has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue.
