Nathan Cleary has shelved five years of Origin duels with Cameron Munster and Daly Cherry-Evans as he picks the playmaking brains of Queensland's halves in his bid to secure the Kangaroos' halfback role.

Coach Mal Meninga has already hailed Cleary as a long-term Kangaroos half in waiting as the two-time Penrith premiership winner prepares for his Test debut against Scotland in Coventry on Friday (Saturday AEDT).

The scrum base is Australia's most contentious selection call, with NSW Blues star Cleary getting the chance to press his case alongside Munster after Cherry-Evans had first crack against Fiji.
