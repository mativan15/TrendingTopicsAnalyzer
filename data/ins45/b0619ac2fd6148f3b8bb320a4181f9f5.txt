IN the fall of 1937, in the course of a trip to a number of European countries, I made some comparisons of costs of living that were published in the Atlantic Monthly of March 1938. The article aroused much interest and discussion, and many reprints were made. During a visit to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay in the first three months of 1940, encouraged by this interest, I collectcd data along a similar line.No direct comparisons can be made between the figures and conclusions herein presented and the study of European countries referred to above.
