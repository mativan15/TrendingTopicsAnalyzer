A pundit thinks Matt Doherty hasn't done enough to impress Tottenham boss Antonio Conte and will be sold next year, despite the wing-back's solid display against Everton on Saturday.

Doherty was brought into the Tottenham starting lineup for the home clash due to Emerson Royal's suspension. Emerson was sent off in the 3-1 defeat to rivals Arsenal and has missed two domestic games so far as a result. He will also be unavailable to Conte when Tottenham come up against Manchester United on Wednesday night.
