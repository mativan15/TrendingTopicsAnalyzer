Chainlink is expanding to Solana.

The blockchain oracle network said Friday that developers who build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Solana mainnet can now incorporate seven of Chainlink's Price Feeds into their products.

Popular DeFi projects such as Aave, Compound, and dYdX already use Chainlink's data services. However, Chainlink's launch on Solana makes it the first non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain supported by the network.
