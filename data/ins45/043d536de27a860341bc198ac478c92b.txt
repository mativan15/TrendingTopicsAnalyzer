US diplomats have asked the United Nations Security Council to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea for its missile launches. But, on Thursday, the Chinese and the Russians blocked their efforts. Security analysts had warned the North Koreans could carry out a nuclear or missile test during US President Joe Biden's visit to South Korea and Japan. Authorities fired three missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Wednesday, including one believed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launches came just after Biden had left Tokyo.
