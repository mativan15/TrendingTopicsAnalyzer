It looks like it is Taylor Heinicke time in Washington.

NFL Media reports that Commanders quarterback Carson Wentz is expected to miss four-to-six weeks after fracturing his finger in last Thursday's win over the Bears. Given the timeline, an injured reserve stint is on the table for Wentz.

Wentz joined the Commanders in a trade with the Colts this offseason and he's completed 144-for-232 passes for 1,489 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions so far this season.
