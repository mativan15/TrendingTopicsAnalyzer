[Photo/Xinhua] Bedrock of peace across the Taiwan Straits being seriously damaged The one-China principle — the bedrock of China-US relations as well as peace across the Taiwan Straits — is being seriously damaged by the wrong US actions, which will turn the area into a "dangerous powder keg", according to a top Chinese envoy in Washington. In an opinion piece published on Thursday, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Qin Gang noted that recent US actions have been widely distant from its commitment to the one-China principle, and that Beijing will never compromise or back down on the issue concerning its core interests.
