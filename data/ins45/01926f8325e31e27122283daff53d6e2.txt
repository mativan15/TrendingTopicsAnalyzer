Viewers don't need a detective to figure out this mystery.
'Knives Out' director Rian Johnson has revealed the sexual orientation of Daniel Craig's character, super sleuth Benoit Blanc.
The sequel to the 2019 mystery comedy, 'Glass Onion,' is set for a Netflix release next month and Johnson confirmed at a London Film Festival press conference that Blanc is queer.
Johnson was asked about a particular scene in the upcoming movie that seemingly showed Blanc having a male lover.
'Yes, obviously he is,' the 'Looper' filmmaker bluntly told reporters.
