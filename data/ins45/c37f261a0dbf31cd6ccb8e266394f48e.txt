The New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) has requested Delhi Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena to intervene and help rectify the deteriorating structure of Connaught Place.
Constructed in the early 1930s, Connaught Place is one of Delhi's most iconic areas. It falls under Grade-II heritage sites as listed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which also poses a number of challenges in its administration and upkeep in general.
'Without the approval of the NDMC and HCC (Heritage Conservation Committee), we cannot change a water tap, let alone carry out structural alterations in the building.
