New Canadian technology is allowing surgeons to more easily remove breast cancer tumours with minimal cosmetic defect and less pain for patients. And this tech is the size of a sesame seed. The miniature localization application developed by Molli Surgical and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre has been approved by Health Canada and FDA-cleared for commercial use. 'We're all about making the entire process of delivering breast cancer care simpler,' Anath Ravi, president and CEO of Molli Surgical, told CTV's Your Morning on Tuesday.
