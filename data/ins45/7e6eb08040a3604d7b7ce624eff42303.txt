As News Corp and Fox ponder a merger proposal submitted by Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of both companies, an activist investor is pushing for a say in the matter.

The investor, Irenic Capital Management, wants News Corp to explore splitting its online real estate listings unit from its other businesses, which include The Wall Street Journal, HarperCollins and The New York Post. It has requested a meeting with the special committee that the company formed to evaluate Mr. Murdoch's proposal, said Adam Katz, one of Irenic's founders.
