Oscar Smith defensive back DJ Etheridge has come on strong.

In his past three games, the senior has eight interceptions, including three in a win over King's Fork on Friday night.

'It's just been hard work, dedication and putting God first,' he said.

Oscar Smith coach Chris Scott said the Tigers — who are ranked No. 59 nationally by MaxPreps and No. 144 by High School Football America — made a change to their secondary before the Indian River game to utilize Etheridge.

'We had been rotating about three or four safeties, and I said, ‘Listen, we're going up against some quarterbacks here, we need DJ in the backfield because he can fly to the ball and make plays on them,'' he said.
