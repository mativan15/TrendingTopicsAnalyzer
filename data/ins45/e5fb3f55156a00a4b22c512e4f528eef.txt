SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Calum Scott shot even-par 70 and Ben Hogan Award winner Ludvig Aberg carded a 71 for the third round in a row on Sunday, helping Texas Tech make the cut to the final 15 teams at the NCAA championship golf tournament.

After the cut from 30 teams to 15, those remaining will play the fourth round of stroke play on Monday before another cut to eight for match-play quarterfinals.

Tech and Auburn are tied at 29 over par through 54 holes. They are three strokes behind eighth-place Arkansas.
