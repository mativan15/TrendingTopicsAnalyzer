Netflix viewers have been left a little more than disappointed at the ending of new chilling series, The Watcher.
The thriller centres on married couple Dean (Bobby Cannavale) and Nora Brannock (Naomi Watts) who, after moving into their dream home, receive threatening letters from a terrifying stalker known as The Watcher.
Based on inspiration from a true story, the drama has been created by Glee's Ryan Murphy, and stars Jennifer Coolidge as a real estate agent.
