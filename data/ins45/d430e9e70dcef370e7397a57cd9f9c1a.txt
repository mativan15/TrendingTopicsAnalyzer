The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 92% in that time. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 35% drop, in the last year.

While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.
