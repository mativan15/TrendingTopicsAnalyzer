Married At First Sight UK's Jordan Emmett Connelly has vowed to ‘try and keep' Chanita Stephenson in his life, after it was revealed he dumped her over FaceTime.
Meanwhile, Chanita earlier spoke to Metro.co.uk about how she ‘deserved better' and was left questioning how ‘genuine' Jordan was after the experiment.
Chanita and Jordan stunned viewers during the reunion episode when they walked into the dinner party alone, and tearfully shared that they were no longer together.
The couple had been one of the strongest this series, with all of us voting in their favour, including their fellow contestants and the experts.
