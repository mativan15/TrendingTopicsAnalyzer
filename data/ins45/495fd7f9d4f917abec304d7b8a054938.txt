WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court found the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is funded through an unconstitutional method, a ruling that threw out the agency's regulation on payday lenders and struck a blow against how the agency operates. The decision, by a three-judge panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, found the CFPB's funding structure violated the Constitution's doctrine of separation of powers, which sets the authority of the three branches of government.
