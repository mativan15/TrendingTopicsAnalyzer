DETROIT – The hardest pitch of Devin Smeltzer's outing -- 92.2 mph -- came in the seventh inning on Tuesday, when he'd already blown well past his season high in pitches and as he readied himself to cruise past his previous career high.
This is the fully realized and unleashed version of Smeltzer that he hasn't been since before a series of injuries derailed his 2021 -- and, frankly, it might be the best the left-hander has been since he debuted in ‘19. Pitching in turn for a fourth consecutive start, Smeltzer twirled another gem, allowing two runs on 101 pitches across 6 2/3 innings to give the Twins' bullpen a breather during an 8-2 victory to open Tuesday's doubleheader against the Tigers at Comerica Park.
