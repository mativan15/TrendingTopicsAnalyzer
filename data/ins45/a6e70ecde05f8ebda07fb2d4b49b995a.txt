D'Andre Swift looks bigger this offseason, his sleeves rolled up to his shoulders instead of half way down his biceps.

Just don't say that publicly, asks Detroit Lions running backs coach Deuce Staley, who fears it will go right to his head.

'Please, don't tell him that," Staley said on day five of Organized Team Activities at Lions headquarters. "That's only because he did five pushups before practice."

Staley said Swift knows how to look good for the camera, too, "he's got that baby oil over there" to make sure he looks shiny.
