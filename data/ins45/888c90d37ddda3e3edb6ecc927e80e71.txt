OTTAWA—Top local officials in Ottawa were warned days before the 'Freedom Convoy' that tens of thousands of protesters were on the way, many sought hotels for up to 30 days, and that demonstrators planned to chain their trucks together to 'attempt to block all access to the city.'

The warning came in an e-mail from the head of a local hotel association, which was shared Monday morning at the public inquiry into the federal government's use of the Emergencies Act to deal with the protests.

Ottawa city manager Steve Kanellakos stressed in his morning testimony that despite warnings like that, top officials trusted local police information that the self-styled 'Freedom Convoy' protesters would leave the capital after a few days.
