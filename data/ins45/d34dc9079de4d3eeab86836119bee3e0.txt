May 31 (Reuters) - The role of the dollar and the euro as global currencies is set to decline as central banks rethink their strategies after the West froze Russian reserves, Russia's central bank said on Tuesday, suggesting it could consider imposing negative rates for dollar and euro deposits.Unprecedented Western sanctions have frozen around half of Russia's gold and forex reserves that stood near $640 billion before Moscow started what it calls a "special military operation" in Ukraine on Feb.
