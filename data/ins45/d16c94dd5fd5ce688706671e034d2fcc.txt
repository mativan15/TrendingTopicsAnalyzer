We've gotten some new details about the plot of the long-awaited Attack the Block 2, with Moses (John Boyega) taking on gentrification and getting older as well as, presumably, another alien invasion.During an interview with Deadline, Boyega reveals that gentrification has hit some of the original film's locations, and that's going to be a big part of the Attack the Block sequel.'We go back and look at the locations where we shot the first movie [Southwark and Walworth in south London] — once dodgy areas — and we find that it's all gleaming, high-end apartments and Starbucks,' he revealed.
