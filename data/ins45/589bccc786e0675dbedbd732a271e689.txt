About two years ago my partner and I moved to a new area; the plan was to downsize and for him to retire and begin to draw his ‘all-singing, all-dancing' pension. Instead, he has continued to work a couple of days a week back where we used to live. 
I have recently found out that his pension is not quite as magnificent as I had been led to believe. In fact, he needs to keep working in order to top up his National Insurance contributions. I feel he is neglecting our relationship and hasn't been completely honest with me.
