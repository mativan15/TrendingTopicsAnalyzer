Hello and welcome to Telegraph Sport's live coverage of Manchester United vs Newcastle United, a showdown between fifth and sixth with both teams showing solid form going into this match.
Eddie Howe's Newcastle are proving difficult to beat this season having lost only one game so far – against Liverpool at Anfield – and are firing on all cylinders at the moment with nine goals scored in their last two matches.
The Magpies are being touted as European contenders, something which they've not enjoyed since the 2012-13 season, but Howe is determined to keep Newcastle grounded.
