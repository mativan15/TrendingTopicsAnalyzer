Michael Vi The Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, has offered many nuggets of wisdom in a long and storied career. One of them is 'be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.' Certainly most investors in Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) are fearful. Fearful of all kinds of things, most of them not related to the company. This has not been an easy time in which to invest in high growth IT companies. It really hasn't been a great time in which to invest in almost every class of financial assets, but I specialize in looking at IT vendors and that has been an especially difficult road to hoe.
