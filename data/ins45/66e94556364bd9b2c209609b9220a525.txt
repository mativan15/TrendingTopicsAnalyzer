The Nova Scotia government is trying again to avoid having the federal carbon tax imposed on the province, this time by creating its own tax on large industrial emitters.Environment Minister Tim Halman introduced amendments to the Environment Act on Tuesday at Province House. The changes would use the federal carbon price scheme to create a new "output-based pricing system" targeting Nova Scotia Power, Lafarge and other emitters, but would not apply to the price of gasoline and furnace oil."We've arrived at a hybrid model, essentially, where we will have made-in-Nova Scotia performance standards," Halman told reporters during a briefing on the bill.
