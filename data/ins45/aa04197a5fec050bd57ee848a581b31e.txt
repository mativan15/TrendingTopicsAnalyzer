Princess Diana wore a little black dress in 1994 that is still talked about today.

The sleek number from Christina Stambolian is called her "revenge dress."

Elizabeth Debicki got to recreate the historic fashion moment in season five of "The Crown."

Elizabeth Debicki was asked one thing when the world learned she was playing Princess Diana. Would she get to wear the revenge dress?

In 1994, Princess Diana wore a black off-the-shoulder bodycon dress designed by Christina Stambolian to an event at London's Serpentine Gallery.
