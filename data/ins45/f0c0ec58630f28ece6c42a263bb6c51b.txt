Finish this joke: A climate reporter rides a scooter branded with the logo of a major international oil company for a weekend. What could possibly go wrong?That was the question I set out to answer when a representative for Shell's consumer products reached out to Gizmodo to ask if we wanted to test out the company's electric scooter model. Despite all the very mean things I've written about Shell in the past, the company sent me its first electric scooter model, the SR-5S, which launched last year.
