The U.S.-listed shares of China-based companies traded broadly higher Tuesday, as investors were emboldened by the major steps to be taken to lift COVID-19-lockdown measures in Shanghai. The Invesco Golden Dragon China exchange-traded fund PGJ, +5.42% charged up 4.6% in morning trading, with more than three-quarters of its active components enjoying gains, to buck the weakness in the broader stock market. That put the ETF (PGJ), which is comprised of U.S.-listed shares of companies based in the People's Republic of China, on track for the highest close since May 4.
