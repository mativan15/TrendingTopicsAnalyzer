Brazil is the largest exporter of sugar, constituting 35%-45% of the global trade, and a fall in its exports in the current season could result in India's share rising to around 15%. The recent restriction on sugar exports is unlikely to materially impact the sector dynamics, as the ceiling of 10 million tonnes (mnt) is sufficient to tap the export potential and maintain domestic balance, says India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra). The government on 24 May 2022 imposed a cap of 10mnt on the export of sugar for the sugar season 2022 (SS22; October-September) while requiring exporters to take approvals in the form of export release orders from the Department of Food and Public Distribution from June 2022.
