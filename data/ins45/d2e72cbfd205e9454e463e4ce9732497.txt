PHILADELPHIA − It seems almost preposterous that the Eagles could win all 17 of their regular season games.

But the Eagles have won their first six games after beating the Dallas Cowboys 26-17 on Sunday night, and they schedule gets easier over the next three games. Still, there are 11 games remaining, and anything can happen.

"I never been (6-0), so it feels amazing," cornerback Darius Slay said. "Feels good, man, going into the bye week."

In fact, nobody on the Eagles has been undefeated this late in the season during their NFL careers.
