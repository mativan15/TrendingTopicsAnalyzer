MarkGillow/E+ via Getty ImagesRocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (NASDAQ:RMCF) is a franchisor of chocolate stores and ice-cream stores in the US. For a more detailed understanding of the company's business and structure, please refer to my initial coverage of the company in January, and the follow-up article in June for FY22. My hold rating for RMCF has not changed. I believe the company is entrenched in proxy fights among shareholders, and is not solving its most pressing issues. Operations and profitability continue deteriorating.
