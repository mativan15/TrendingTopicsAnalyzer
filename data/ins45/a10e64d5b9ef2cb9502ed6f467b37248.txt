But both are off to 2-4 starts as they try to get their campaigns headed in the right direction when they meet Thursday night in Glendale, Ariz. The Cardinals lost two offensive starters to major injuries during a 19-9 loss at Seattle last Sunday. Left guard Justin Pugh suffered a torn ACL that will end his season and wide receiver Marquise Brown will miss at least several weeks because of a foot injury.
