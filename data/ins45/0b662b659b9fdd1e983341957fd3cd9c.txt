The BBC is celebrating 100 years of broadcasting to the nation with a packed schedule of special events, from shows including Doctor Who, The Repair Shop and Strictly Come Dancing.
Today, the broadcaster – the full name for which is the British Broadcasting Corporation – turns 100 years old, having been founded on October 18 1922, then as The British Broadcasting Company.
To mark the momentous occasion, there are plenty of special programmes in the line-up in the coming days, including Jodie Whittaker's final appearance as the Doctor on Sunday.
