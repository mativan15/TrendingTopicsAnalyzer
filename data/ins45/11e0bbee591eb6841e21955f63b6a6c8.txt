The late American novelist Kurt Vonnegut, in a lecture at Case Western Reserve University, explained that stories have a shape. In the session titled ‘Shape of stories', he draws a straight line from top to bottom on the margin of a board, and then marks the top end as ‘G' — meaning good fortune, and the bottom as ‘I' — meaning ill fortune. And then, from the middle of that line, he draws a horizontal line —‘B' for beginning, and ‘E' of end of the story.
Using the graph, Vonnegut jokingly notes the method as a scientific way to write stories that could be fed into a computer, which in turn could push out a desired output.
