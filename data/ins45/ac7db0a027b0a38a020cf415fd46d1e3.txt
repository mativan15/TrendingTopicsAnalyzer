Across the US and Asia, the progress of fishing boats and trucks is being tracked in real-time, via satellite, thanks to a Nelson tech company. Now, after successful trials, company PinPoint Earth is planning to take its solar-powered satellite tracking device to a global market, with plans to expand to other industries including tourism. The company currently has a team of three, but that would grow 'rapidly', and in two to three years time planned to have up to 30 staff, with manufacturing, research and development, and sales operating from Nelson, project lead Ali Kennard said.
