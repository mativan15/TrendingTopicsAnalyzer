CLEVELAND -- Every time José Ramírez was asked whether his right thumb was bothering him, he'd insist that he was fine. But now, it's clear that his hand was giving him more trouble than he led on. 
The Guardians confirmed Wednesday evening that Ramírez will undergo surgery on his right thumb in the next several weeks, and it will be performed by hand specialist Dr. Thomas Graham in Dayton, Ohio. Cleveland's third baseman will have a six-to-eight week recovery period that isn't expected to significantly impact his offseason training, and he's planning to be ready for Spring Training.
