London-based Sensat raised another $20.5 million to help commercialize digital twins for infrastructure projects in energy, rail and telecommunications. This comes on the heel of several successful trials with large customers since its $10 million raise in 2019. The company launched in 2018 with an ambitious plan to help infrastructure companies achieve the same productivity gains as in other sectors.
