Antonee Robinson's ankle injury looks like a good news-bad news situation at the moment.
Robinson is back on the pitch for Fulham, returning two weeks ago after missing over a month with the injury he suffered against Tottenham on September 3.
The left back's return was most welcome for the U.S. national team just over a month before the World Cup. Robinson is absolutely vital for the USMNT, partially because of his dynamic two-way performances and partially because of the team's lack of a clear alternative at left back.
