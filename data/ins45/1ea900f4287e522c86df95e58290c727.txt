Former team India captains and two of the most popular cricketers Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli are set to launch their personal digital collectibles, or NFTs (non-fungible tokens) during the upcoming T20 World Cup. Both Dhoni and Kohli have entered into exclusive partnership with Web 3.0 company FanCraze to launch their player cards on FanCraze platform.

'We view marquee athletes as artists who create their art on the field of play. We are very excited to partner with MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, the biggest stars cricket has ever produced, to build the new paradigm of engagement between cricketers and their fans,' said Anshum Bhambri, CEO, FanCraze.
