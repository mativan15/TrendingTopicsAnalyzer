ET Canada Olivia Wilde and Harry Styles didn't let recent drama impact their relationship. A source tells Et that the 'chaos' of the 'Don't Worry Darling' press tour actually brought the 38-year-old director and the 28-year-old pop star closer together.'The press tour was stressful,' the source says. 'The goal was to let their work speak for itself — but that backfired.'According to the source, though, the couple now feels like they've come out the other side and are closer because of it.
