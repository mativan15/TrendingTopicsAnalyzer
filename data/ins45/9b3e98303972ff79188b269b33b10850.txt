NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Ranked in the AP Top 25 for the first time in 24 seasons, Dorian Williams and his Tulane teammates have no interest in making it a brief stay.

'It's good that finally people are recognizing what we are doing here, but that was never the goal,' said Williams, a linebacker whose 46 tackles pace the top-ranked defense in the American Athletic Conference. 'The goal is to win the conference and go 1-0 each week. We can start by beating Memphis this week.'

No. 25 Tulane (6-1, 3-0 American), which never had won more than two in a row to start conference play since joining the league in 2014, can double that mark with another victory on Saturday.
