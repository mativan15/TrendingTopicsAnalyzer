Doug Ducey, Arizona's Republican governor, is dismissing the Biden administration's request that the state take down a wall of shipping containers set up to block migrants from entering the country illegally.Ducey on Thursday reacted defiantly to a letter from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation asking state officials to remove the double-stacked containers used to fill a gap on a planned partial border wall with Mexico. The Biden administration had planned to complete the barrier, but Ducey said he's pressing ahead with the border wall, which has been a political lightning rod.
