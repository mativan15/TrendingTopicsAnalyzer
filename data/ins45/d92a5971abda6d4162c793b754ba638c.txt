In a Zoom call earlier this month with the founders of its approximately 250 portfolio companies, the venture firm reviewed a 50-page presentation titled 'Adapting to Endure,' according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News.

Sequoia laid out the case for a long and drawn-out recession, and instructed founders to 'do the cut exercise' immediately if they haven't already done so by examining ways to conserve cash through eliminating or scaling back projects, R&D, marketing and other expenses.
