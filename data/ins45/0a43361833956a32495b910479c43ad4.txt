Ditching her tax cuts, however painful for Liz Truss, was the easy bit. Now the government must find up to £40bn of public spending cuts, or a combination of cuts and tax rises, a week after Truss told the Commons she would not reduce spending. There were tensions at yesterday's cabinet meeting after Jeremy Hunt told his colleagues they would all have to make savings. Sources described a 'lengthy discussion' – Whitehall code for a row. The chancellor wants a savings figure for each department by Friday, so the Office for Budget Responsibility can factor in the cuts when it gives its all-important verdict on his medium-term fiscal plan on 31 October.
