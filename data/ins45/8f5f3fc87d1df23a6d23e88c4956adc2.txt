The El Classico match with Real Madrid saw a wounded Barcelona trying to push away a special attack by the former to beat the Catalans 3-1. Barca now has its back to the wall and hopes to beat Villareal and Athletic Bilbao to earn much-needed match points. However, a match that will be fought tooth and nail is awaited when Bayern Munich visits Camp Nou to fight the Catalans on their home turf next week. The match with the German champions is a must-win for Barca if they have to hold on to their Championship dreams.
