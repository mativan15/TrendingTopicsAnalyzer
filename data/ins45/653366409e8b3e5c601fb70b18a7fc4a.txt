Amani Oruwariye was a surprise inactive for last week's game against the New England Patriots, but the Detroit Lions are not counting their interception leader from last season out of their cornerback rotation yet.

"Amani's going to get a chance to compete," Lions coach Dan Campbell said Monday. "I told him, he's not out of the boat, so he's going to get a chance to compete this week and see where he can help us."

Oruwariye had a career-high and team-leading six interceptions in 2021, but struggled through the first month of this season.
