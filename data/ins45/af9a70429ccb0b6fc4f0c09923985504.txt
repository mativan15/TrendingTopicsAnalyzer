LOVE Island's Savanna Darnell looks unrecognisable four years after appearing on the show.
The reality star appeared on the fourth series of the ITV2 dating show in 2018 with a head of blonde hair.

But Savanna shaved her locks off to raise money for the Make A Wish foundation after leaving the villa. 
And she's since embraced a completely new look -long, brunette and often in braids.
