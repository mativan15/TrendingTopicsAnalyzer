S﻿cott McCarthy, We Are Brighton, externalBrighton fans watching the 2-0 defeat at Brentford on Friday were left feeling the Albion were back in 2020-21 season.That campaign, under Graham Potter, was an xG nightmare. The Albion dominated and had lots of shots, but struggled to score. It was the same story at the Gtech Stadium: 73% possession, 21 shots, seven on target, zero goals, zero points.It took Potter the best part of two and a half years to get Brighton's return on the scoreboard matching what they did elsewhere on the pitch.
