While the Catholic Church, Foggy Nelson, and the love of an ever-expanding list of good women have all tried, and failed, to save Marvel superhero Matt 'Daredevil' Murdock over the years, it turns out that only one force was capable of bringing everyone's favorite very brood-y crimefighter back from the brink: The internet.

This is per no less an authority than Daredevil star Charlie Cox himself, who openly credited the online 'Save Daredevil' movement with his recent immigration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe proper, first in a small scene in last year's Spider-Man: No Way Home, and more recently (and prominently) in the annals of the Disney+ She-Hulk show.
