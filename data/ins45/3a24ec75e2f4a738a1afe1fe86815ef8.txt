Here is a timeline tracing the various attempts to curb unethical marketing of pharmaceutical products:
1981– International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations' (IFPMA), of which many MNCs in India are members, draws up the Code of Practice on ethical marketing/promotion of drugs, a voluntary code for self-regulation. It has been revised at least six times since
 1988- World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends 'Ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion'
1998– Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), which primarily represents multinationals, introduces a Code on Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices in line with the IFPMA guidelines
2006 – OPPI moves to draft an ethical marketing code for pharmaceutical products and invites other pharma associations including the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association (IDMA) to join them
Sep 2009 – Govt decides to allow pharma companies to self-regulate.
