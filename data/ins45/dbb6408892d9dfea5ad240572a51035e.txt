Homeowners and would-be buyers should expect house prices to recover more quickly from their current downturn than they did after the global financial crisis, Corelogic says. It has released its property market and economic update for the third quarter. House prices had fallen 6.3% over the last six months, and the average house price was now $977,158, compared to a peak of $1.043 million, it said. The last time there was any sizeable drop in house prices was around the time of the global financial crisis.
