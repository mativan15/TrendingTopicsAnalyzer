UK chancellor Rishi Sunak insisted he remains a 'pragmatist' as he refused to rule out another emergency package as UK households struggle to pay bills amid soaring inflation.

Asked if he is prepared to return with another emergency package next year even if it requires more borrowing and taxes, Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'People can judge me by how I've acted over the last couple of years.

'I've always been prepared to respond to the situation on the ground, what's happening to the economy, what families are experiencing and making sure we've got policies in place to support them through that.
