WorldSpectrum via Pixabay Cronos (CRO) is the cryptocurrency issued by Crypto.com, a popular crypto exchange platform. It was launched in 2016, at the same time as Crypto.com itself. Initially known as ‘the Crypto.org Coin', the currency was rebranded as Cronos in February 2021.  Cronos can be used to pay fees on Crypto.com, and can also be ‘staked' (which allows users to earn passive income by tying up coins to help run the blockchain) on the platform in exchange for benefits such as trading fee discounts.
