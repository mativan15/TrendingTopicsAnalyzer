'The New York state Senate has abdicated its responsibility to address climate change or attempt to meet the goals of the CLCPA,' Parker told POLITICO. 'The lack of courage on the cryptocurrency moratorium is especially disappointing because it's a resource that's being exploited by people that care nothing for our state.'
Why it matters: The two-year cryptocurrency mining moratorium was passed by the Assembly earlier this session and is narrowly targeted at proof-of-work mining that utilizes behind-the-meter electricity from fossil fuel plants.
