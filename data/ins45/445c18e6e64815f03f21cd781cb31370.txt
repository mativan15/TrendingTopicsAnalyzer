(Bloomberg) -- The UK's program to freeze energy prices to help households shoulder the burden of rising costs will be scrapped at the end of this winter, as the government seeks to salvage its credibility with investors.It would be 'irresponsible' for the government to continue exposing the public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said in a statement to broadcasters on Monday. The Treasury will investigate a replacement program that better targets lower-income households.
