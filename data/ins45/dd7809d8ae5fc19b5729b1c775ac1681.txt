Thomas Barwick/DigitalVision via Getty Images Investment Thesis In my last article on the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:RYT), I discussed how the fund was fairly valued given the quality of constituents. Since then, RYT lost ~16% vs. a loss of ~12% for the S&P 500 and has underperformed the market. RYT wasn't spared by the recent tech sell-off and is now trading at ~18x earnings vs ~21x six months ago, prompting many investors to wonder if it is a good moment to buy. While I still believe RYT offers a good deal relative to other tech funds trading at much higher multiples, I believe that short-term performance could be disappointing given the hawkish shift in the monetary policy.
