May 26—JACKSON — Mississippi Auditor Shad White has demanded that Jacob Black, former deputy director for the Mississippi Department of Human Services, repay more than $2.6 million in allegedly misspent federal welfare dollars.

The demand letter on Thursday stems from the sprawling investigation that White's office has launched to investigate the purported misspending of millions of dollars with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

"My team will continue the work we started over two years ago on this case, and continue working with all our state and federal partners to make sure this case is fully investigated, top to bottom," White said in a statement.
