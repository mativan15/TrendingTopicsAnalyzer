Most builds in Cyberpunk aim for very familiar concepts: stealthy hackers, invincible punching machines, frighteningly accurate snipers, deadly fast katana wielding samurais, and many more. Those are all fun ways to play for sure, but if you want something that shows off smart choices in skill trees while still requiring a bit of marksmanship to get it right, this 'grenade trickshot' build is something you must try out.

While happy accidents in intense shootouts in Night City had me pretty sure you could shoot a bullet into a grenade for an early explosion, a recent video from YouTube channel KhrazeGaming confirmed it was possible by showing off how this simple quirk of the game's combat can become the basis for an entire character concept.
