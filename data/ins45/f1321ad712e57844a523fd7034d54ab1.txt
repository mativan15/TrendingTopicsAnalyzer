MILAN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Italy's Serie A sees scope to triple its international broadcasting revenue by 2030 in the face of sluggish growth at home, an internal document shows, reflecting its desire to narrow the financial gap on rival European soccer leagues.Serie A secured only around 670 million euros ($657 million) from the sale of overseas TV rights in the 2021-2024 period, a ninth of the sum earned abroad by England's Premier League, the world's most lucrative domestic soccer competition.To extract more value from the main foreign media markets, Serie A has opened a base in New York and plans to set up overseas offices in places including London and Abu Dhabi, an internal document seen by Reuters showed.
