Jose Altuve was more than happy to oblige when a fan ran onto the field and asked Houston's star second baseman to take a selfie with him during Game 2 of the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees on Thursday night. Security at Minute Maid Park had other plans, wrestling the man away from Altuve before he could click off the shot with his cell phone as the ninth inning was set to begin. 'He kind of hugged me and said something like: ‘OK, we better win today, because I spent all my money on the ticket,'' Altuve said.
