It is hard to put a finger on  Love, Death + Robots, the third season of the animated anthology, helmed by executive producers David Fincher and Tim Miller, streaming on Netflix. Sure, the title may have a philosophical and futuristic ring to it. But the shorts are so eclectic that the first one, about three robots out on a future earth, couldn't be any further removed from the last one set during historical times and featuring a deaf knight. Titled  Jibaro, this last short is distinct for its animation that is strikingly close to the real world.
