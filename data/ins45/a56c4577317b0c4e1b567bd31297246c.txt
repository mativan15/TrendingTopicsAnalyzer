As he elaborated on the use of drones in governance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he uses the technology for surprise inspections. With the use of drones, he added, it has also become easier for him to monitor the progress of government projects.'It is essential to constantly monitor the quality of government projects. But it's no longer necessary for me to inform (officials) in advance that I have to go there for an inspection. Everything will then be in place. If I send a drone, all the information that's needed is collected and people on the other side may not realise that it has already happened,' PM Modi said at the two-day Bharat Drone Mahotsav in Delhi, India's biggest drone festival.
