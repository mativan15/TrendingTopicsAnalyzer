Webb joined the Ravens as an undrafted rookie out of The Citadel after converting from defensive back to wide receiver.

FOXBORO — The New England Patriots began their Wednesday with the sobering news that special teams standout Cody Davis would miss the remainder of the season.

The 33-year-old suffered a non-contact knee injury while covering a kickoff return in the first half of last Sunday's 38-15 win over the Cleveland Browns.

While replacing Davis will be no easy task, the Pats began that process on Wednesday by signing rookie wide receiver Raleigh Webb from the Baltimore Ravens' practice squad to their active roster.
