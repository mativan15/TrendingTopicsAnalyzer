Jun. 5—Owensboro city officials are anticipating ending the 2021-22 fiscal year on June 30 with at least $2.6 million more in revenue than staff members projected when crafting the city's budget.

Meanwhile, the city will end the year with expenses lower than anticipated, largely due to the city having unfilled job openings.

"Now, it's looking like it might be anywhere from $2.6 million to $2.8 million" over estimates, city finance director Angela Waninger said.

The main driver is occupational tax revenue, which is paid by people working inside the city limits.
