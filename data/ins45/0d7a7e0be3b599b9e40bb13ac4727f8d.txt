Debatewise.org is a website that encourages people to get all perspectives on topics, one of which was the concept of having a 100 percent inheritance tax (IHT) rate, or essentially confiscating inheritance in the UK. The main argument for this concept is that it would succinctly remove the possibility of a person becoming rich from wealth that they didn't work to earn.More than 20 percent of the world's richest inherit their wealth.Some believe that narrowing the gap between the haves and the have nots could start with having the state confiscate all money being passed on in inheritance.
