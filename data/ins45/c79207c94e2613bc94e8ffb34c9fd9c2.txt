Sheryl Sandberg's exit from Meta Platforms Inc comes at a crucial time for the Facebook parent as it pivots to 'metaverse' in the face of slowing ad revenue, although Wall Street analysts say her departure will not be as significant.
As second-in-command to founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Sandberg transformed Facebook from a buzzy startup into a technology behemoth and helped grow its ad revenue to over $100 billion from $272 million in her 14 years with the company.
She was also the face of the company in dealing with regulators in Washington as the social-media network became embroiled in a series of controversies, including a data scandal that involved British firm Cambridge Analytica.
