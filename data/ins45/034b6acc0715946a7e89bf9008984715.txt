Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Strong Buy rating on the shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE: NCLH) and announced a price target of $32.

The analyst thinks the cruise line operator is best positioned to benefit from the post-pandemic recovery and increasing consumer spending on travel and outperform its industry peers led by its premium product offering and best-in-class fleet in the highly profitable luxury and ultraluxury market segments.

Record revenue and profitability are on the horizon as strong booking and onboard spending trends will drive a significant recovery in Business Performance trends, he adds.
