I first met Ted Nordhaus in a Manhattan coffee shop in 2008. I was there to write about him and his then-writing partner Michael Shellenberger for Time magazine's 'Heroes of the Environment' issue. 
It wasn't the most natural selection. Then, as now, Nordhaus was not your average environmentalist's idea of a hero. In 2004, he and Shellenberger co-authored the essay 'The Death of Environmentalism,' hitting the environmental movement with a message that was hard to hear. Despite all the money and the energy directed toward mainstream green foundations, 'modern environmentalism is no longer capable of dealing with the world's most serious ecological crisis': climate change.
