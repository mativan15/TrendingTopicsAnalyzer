After some speculation that The Callisto Protocol had been delayed, the official Twitter account reassured fans that it's still coming out this year--and has a 60fps performance mode.Yesterday, October 18, a thread on gaming forum ResetEra pointed out the Epic Games Store Halloween Sale page noted that The Callisto Protocol was set to release February 12, 2023. Many obviously took this as a sign that the store accidentally shared this information early, and that the game was receiving a two-month delay.
