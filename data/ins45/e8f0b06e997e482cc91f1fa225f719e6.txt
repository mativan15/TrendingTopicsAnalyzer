Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Polar Capital Holdings plc (LON:POLR) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 50%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 14%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 25% in that time. Furthermore, it's down 13% in about a quarter.
