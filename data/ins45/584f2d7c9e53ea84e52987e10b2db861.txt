Influenced by graffiti and text art, Markus Birdman has found a unique way of combining art school aesthetics with comedy. He first dabbled in music and performance poetry before finding a way of combining his humour with illustration. He then created a comedy show by rewriting Grimm's Fairy Tales. Armed with a projector, he toured Grimm Realities across the UK and has had audiences in stitches at the Edinburgh Festival and beyond.For someone so creative – but who has a need for solid tech to work as his stage partner at his stand-up gigs – the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 5G is a perfect match.
