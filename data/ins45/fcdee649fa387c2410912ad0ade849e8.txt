(Bloomberg) -- Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD Co. expects its third-quarter profit to climb as much as 365%, as the Warren Buffett-backed company aims to sidestep supply-chain snags and capitalize on strong demand.Net income will be between 5.5 billion yuan ($765 million) and 5.9 billion yuan, the Shenzhen-based company said Monday, which would be a record. BYD is benefiting from making its own batteries and semiconductors, helping it avoid disruptions that have hurt rivals, including Elon Musk's Tesla Inc.
