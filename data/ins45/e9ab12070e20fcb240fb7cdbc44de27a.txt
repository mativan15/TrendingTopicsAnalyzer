Forbes Media Editor-in-Chief Steve Forbes argued on Friday the U.S. economy is not a "good picture" because the Biden administration put up barriers to the recovery post-pandemic, with inflation and high gas prices."What the American economy is showing is that it's ready to roar if you remove these uncertainties and barriers," Forbes told host Gillian Turner on "The Faulkner Focus."He said the administration has been "scapegoating" companies as prices rise, warning about the Federal Reserve's plan for a "soft landing" in the form of a recession.
