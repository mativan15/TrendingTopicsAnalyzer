Voters are divided about whether or not Labor should stick with an election promise to keep the Morrison government's stage-three tax cuts, although prime beneficiaries of the change are more likely to argue Anthony Albanese should stick to his word.Asked about their attitude to election promises in general, 52% of respondents to the latest Guardian Essential survey said it was never acceptable for political parties to break election promises, while 48% said it was OK to break a promise if circumstances change.
