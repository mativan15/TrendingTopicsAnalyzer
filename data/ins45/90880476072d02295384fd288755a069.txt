The Vancouver Canucks are only three games into the 2022-23 NHL season, but the alarm bells are already ringing on full blast.

The Canucks picked up their third loss in as many games on Monday, falling 6-4 to the Washington Capitals at Capital One Arena. To make matters worse, Vancouver once again squandered a comfortable lead, allowing four unanswered goals in the third period.
