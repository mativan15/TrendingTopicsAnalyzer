This article is part of our Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on how museums, galleries and auction houses are embracing new artists, new concepts and new traditions.

In the fall of 1962, the African American artist Jacob Lawrence made a 10-day visit to the then newly independent West African nation of Nigeria.

The American Society of African Culture in Lagos had mounted a retrospective of Mr. Lawrence's work and invited him to lecture.

After his show closed, Mr. Lawrence briefly visited the city of Ibadan, meeting with local artists — particularly with members of the Mbari Artists and Writers Club, publishers of the influential literary magazine, Black Orpheus.
