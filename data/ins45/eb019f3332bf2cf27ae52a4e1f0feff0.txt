Grand Canyon will see how forgivable the NCAA Tournament committee is after melting down in Saturday's semifinal elimination game to fourth-seeded Abilene Christian in the Western Athletic Conference Tournament

After getting down 8-0 in the first three innings, with sophomore starter Carter Young unable to get through two innings, 25th-ranked GCU cut it to 8-6 in the top of the sixth, before suffering a fatal collapse in the bottom half of the inning.

GCU's bid to win a second straight WAC Tournament championship ended after giving up seven runs in a slew of base on balls and base hits in a 15-8 loss at Mesa's Hohokam Stadium.
