King Charles III won't invite the Duke of Sussex and his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, to his crowning if Prince Harry criticizes Queen Consort Camilla in his upcoming book, according to reports. King Charles' intense affection and emotions of protection for Camilla are responsible for this. The King and the Queen Consort's crowning will take place at Westminster Abbey in London on May 6, 2023. Penguin Random House plans to release Harry's memoir. All of his opinions on Camilla, his conflicts with Prince William, his troubled friendship with Prince Charles, and the ramifications of his and Meghan Markle's departure from the Royal Family in 2020 are all expected to be included in it.
