Oct. 15—HEGINS — Mahanoy Area's running attack can be tough to stop for opposing defenses.

Tri-Valley has it figured out.

The Dawgs stifled Mahanoy's veer from start to finish en route to a 21-6 victory Friday night in a Schuylkill/Colonial Blue Division game at Bulldog Stadium.

Kam Wetzel, Reese Huntzinger and Jacob Scheib each rushed for a touchdown as Tri-Valley improved to 8-0 overall and 3-0 in Blue Division action.

"We practiced their offense all week. Our scout team did a great job. We were ready," Tri-Valley coach Jeff Sampson said.
