The final two teams in the National League playoffs have survived: The Philadelphia Phillies will face off against the San Diego Padres in the 2022 National League Championship Series.
The winner takes the pennant and heads to the World Series against the winner of the American League Championship Series.
But before we get there, we've got a seven-game series we need to watch. And if you're here, you might be wondering: Who's on the mic for the games you'll be watching on FOX?
We have an answer: It's Joe Davis on play-by-play, John Smoltz is the analyst and both Tom Verducci and Ken Rosenthal will report from the dugouts.
