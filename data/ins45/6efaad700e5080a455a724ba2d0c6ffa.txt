The Oak Bay Tea Party festival returned for its 60th anniversary Friday after a two-year absence due to the pandemic. The festival features a midway, pancake breakfasts, a parade, live music, the Floating Teacup Race and, of course, tea will be served all weekend. Although the weather doesn't look promising, organizers aren't sweating it. "After two years I think people are going to come out, they're going to embrace it," said Sandy Germain, chair of the Oak Bay Tea Party Society as the sun struggled to break through the clouds on Friday.
