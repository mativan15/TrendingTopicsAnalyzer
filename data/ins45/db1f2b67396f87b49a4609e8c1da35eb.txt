Sutton's prediction: 1-1Because Wolves don't score many, it means they always have problems even in games where they are on top.Leicester have kept a couple of clean sheets in a row now, and Wout Faes has been playing well in their defence, but they have still conceded more goals than any other Premier League side this season.So, it's hard to make a compelling case for either side to win this one - instead I am going to cop out of calling it one way or another, and go with a draw.Whelan's prediction: 1-2 Leicester were a bit unfortunate earlier in the season when they were losing a lot of games.
