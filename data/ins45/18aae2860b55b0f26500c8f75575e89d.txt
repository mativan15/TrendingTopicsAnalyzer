Chief Minister and DMK president M.K. Stalin on October 16, 2022 said he still had the hope that Tamil Nadu would be exempted from the NEET for admission to medical colleges.'Do not come to the conclusion that it will not happen because there is a delay. The BJP is inflicting social injustice and the party would be taught a lesson in the [2024] Lok Sabha polls,' he said through a recorded question answer session Ungalil Oruvan.Mr Stalin said the goal of the DMK was to win all the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the Lok Sabha polls in 2024.
