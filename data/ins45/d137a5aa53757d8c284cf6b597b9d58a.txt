Homegrown telecom gear and optic fibre cable (OFC) maker HFCL is expecting a 20% year-on-year growth, driven by fifth generation or 5G technology-led optic fibre demand and indigenously-designed and developed products which it eyes to export worldwide. "We will be growing at 15-20% growth every year. With the increase in revenues and equipment orders, the order book will also keep on extending," Mahendra Nahata, managing director of HFCL said.

The Delhi-based company's order book currently stands at Rs 6,500-crore, and it said that exports are expected to contribute nearly 15% of the overall turnover this year.
