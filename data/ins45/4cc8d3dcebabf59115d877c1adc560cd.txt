The Ontario Provincial Police's intelligence division suggested that the force consider 'covert' surveillance into an anti-government group ahead of the Freedom Convoy's arrival in Ottawa, newly-released documents reveal.
The suggestion came as part of the OPP's Project HENDON, a more than two-year rolling investigation into 'criminal extremism' and 'large-scale protest' movements in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic.The previously secret intelligence reports were released as evidence in the Public Order Emergency Commission, which is examining the federal government's decision to invoke emergency powers during February's convoy protests.
