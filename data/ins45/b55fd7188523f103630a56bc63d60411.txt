There is no question that high inflation has taken a toll on many Edmontonians.
The price of groceries and gas has gone up, something which for many people means discretionary spending is down. Some say it is now harder to have fun as a result.'Everything is so expensive,' Kiana Boudreau said while hanging outside a a movie theatre with her friends in south Edmonton.'We don't really go out that often and just driving anywhere costs a lot of money,' said Avery Gogal, Boudreau's friend.These rising costs have led to some new choices that some say are not as fun as before.
