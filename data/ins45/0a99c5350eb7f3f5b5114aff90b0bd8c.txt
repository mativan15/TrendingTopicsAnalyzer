Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith had a much more down to earth game in his team's Week 6 win over the Cardinals. He posted less than 200 total passing yards, did not throw any touchdowns, got sacked five times and ended up with a QBR of just 40.0. For the game, Pro Football Focus only gave him a 60.3 overall grade.

Despite the bad score this week, Smith is still among PFF's highest graded players this season. In fact, he grades out among the top 10 for all offensive players. Meanwhile, Bills superstar QB Josh Allen is at the top.
