Srinagar: The recent spurt in targeted killings in the Kashmir valley has triggered a wave of concern among migrant labourers and Pandits working under the prime minister's scheme of 2012. Kashmiri Pandits have alleged that the J&K administration and the Centre have failed to ensure the community's safety. Scores of families have already left the Valley. The Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti - an organisation of Kashmiri Pandits who stayed back in the Valley even after the exodus in the late 1980s - has sought intervention of the high court.
