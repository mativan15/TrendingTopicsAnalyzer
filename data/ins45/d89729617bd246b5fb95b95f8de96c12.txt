The Karnataka Cabinet on Thursday decided to promulgate an ordinance to implement the revised quota for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) as the ruling BJP prepares to face a tough assembly election in about seven months. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai held an all-party meeting on October 7 and took the consent of all parties, including the Congress and JDS, to increase the reservation for SCs by 2% to 17% and for STs by 4% to 7%. The Cabinet gave its nod a day later.

The government, however, dropped plans to have its new reservation law inserted in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution to ringfence it from a judicial review in the immediate future.
