Leesburg's Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ: QUBT) said Friday it is planning a new manufacturing and research center to expand its current chip development efforts.

QCI said in an announcement it is 'negotiating several offers of federal, state and regional funding incentives' for the project, but did not say what states or localities are in play. Representatives for the company did not return multiple requests for comment.

'We believe the development of a commercially scalable quantum computing chip represents a massive opportunity, and one that QCI is ready to tackle,' CEO Robert Liscouski said in a statement.
