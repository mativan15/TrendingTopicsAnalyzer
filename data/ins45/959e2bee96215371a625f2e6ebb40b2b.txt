Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, convicted in two separate cases of murder, and a charge of rape, was released from Sunaria prison in Rohtak on a 40-day parole on October 14. This is the third time in the past year that Rahim has been released from prison, twice on parole and once on furlough (a parole is for a specific exigency; and a furlough, a general break from imprisonment, according to the Supreme Court). And like the past two times, this time too, there are elections involved in regions where Rahim still has some influence.
