(Reuters) - London-based real estate agent Foxtons Group has decided to appoint rival Chestertons' CEO Guy Gittins as its new CEO, Sky News reported on Sunday.

Gittins will take over from Nic Budden in the face of rising pressure from activist shareholders to sell the company, the newspaper reported https://news.sky.com/story/foxtons-gazumps-london-rival-chestertons-with-raid-on-ceo-gittins-12623917.

In March 2022, Converium Capital, a Montreal-based investment fund that has about a 2% stake in Foxtons, had sent a letter to the board urging it to begin a formal sale process.
