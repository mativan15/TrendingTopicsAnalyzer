MoreISO On October 12, 2022, short activist hedge fund Blue Orca Capital released a report on Enviva Inc (NYSE:EVA) attacking the company's sustainability claims and practices, and the company's financial health. In our opinion, the report is grossly misleading, as it conveniently excludes factual information and/or makes several stretched claims about the company and its financials. We give the authors credit for their ability to craft a story that is emotional, misleading readers with lots of seemingly in-depth research supporting their claims.
