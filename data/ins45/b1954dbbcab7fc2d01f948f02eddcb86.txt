The sessions court on Wednesday rejected the second anticipatory bail plea of suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Saurabh Tripathi, an accused in the Angadia extortion case. His previous plea was dismissed in the last week of March. His lawyer Vinod Chate contended that Tripathi was neither identified by the witnesses nor there was strong evidence against him. Other accused had already been granted bail and the chargesheet had been filed, the second application, filed on the ground of change of circumstances, said.
