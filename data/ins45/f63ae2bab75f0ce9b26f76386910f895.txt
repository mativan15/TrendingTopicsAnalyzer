If you want to know who really controls Pharos Energy plc (LON:PHAR), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

Pharos Energy is a smaller company with a market capitalization of UK£109m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
