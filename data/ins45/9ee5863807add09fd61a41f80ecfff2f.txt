Cats are a popular photography subject, but for Samsung, they are apparently also great test material for assessing the quality of its most ambitious camera sensor ever, and it's the one that will likely grace the Galaxy S23 series next year. Samsung's team took the company's in-development 200-megapixel smartphone camera sensor for a test run and ended up capturing and then printing a gigantic, 616-square-meter canvas of a cat's face, all to show the level of detail it can bring out. Just to be clear here, the sensor was not inside a phone.
