Whether it's forgetting to flush the toilet or to wash your hands after a particularly pungent one, we've all had bathroom accidents of some kind.

But one Japanese man's mishap has done far more damage than merely violating hygiene standards.

The 30-year-old, whose job is to conserve Japan's cultural heritage, accidentally rammed his car into the country's oldest toilet on Monday and broke down its wooden door in the process.

The bathroom is located in the 700-year-old Buddhist temple Tofukuji located in Kyoto prefecture, which is considered Japan's cultural capital.
