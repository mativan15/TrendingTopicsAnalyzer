The manufacturer and marketer of hinges, locks, door controls and exit devices last month named R. Johnston Hager III, known as Johnston Hager, as its new president and COO. He most recently was senior vice president of residential sales, national accounts and customer support.

He succeeds his cousin Josh Hager, who served as president and COO since 2017 after four years as COO, and who joined the company in 2002.
