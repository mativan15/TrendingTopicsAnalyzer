Terraform Labs CEO and co-founder Do Kwon is reportedly working on a new stablecoin built on top of the new Terra 2.0 blockchain, an insider claims.
Kwon, on May 13, broke the news that while Terra will move forward to a new blockchain and introduce a new version of its native token, it will no longer bring along TerraUSD (UST). "I still believe that decentralized economies deserve decentralized money – but it is clear that $UST in its current form will not be that money," Kwon said in a tweet.
A Twitter user who goes by the name FatManTerra, who previously revealed several insider information about Terra's collapse, shared a fresh set of interesting details about the Terra co-founder.
