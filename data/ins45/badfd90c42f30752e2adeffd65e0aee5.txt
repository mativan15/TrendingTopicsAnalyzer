The Saints ended their six-match winless run with victory over their rivals, in doing so keeping their first clean sheet since April to help ease the pressure on their manager.During the second-half of that match, Walker-Peters was forced off and it has now emerged that the 25-year-old has suffered a serious hamstring injury as he faces a long spell on the sidelines.It adds to Southampton's injury problems ahead of Arsenal's visit to St Mary's on Sunday, with Armel Bella-Kotchap, Tino Livramento and Romeo Lavia already out, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles not available against his parent club.
