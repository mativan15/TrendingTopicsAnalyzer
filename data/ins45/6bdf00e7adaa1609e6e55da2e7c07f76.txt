If you're a fan of old-school Big 12 shoot-outs, you'll want to plan your afternoon around the fireworks show Saturday between the slumping Oklahoma Sooners and surging Kansas Jayhawks in what should be one of the highest-scoring games of the weekend.
Oklahoma's defense has been a disaster in Year 1 under new coach Brent Venables, who hasn't been able to translate his coaching brilliance as an assistant at Clemson into his first stint as a head coach. The Sooners have allowed a stunning 48.3 points per game over the last three weeks, capped off by last week's humiliating 49-0 loss to rival Texas.
