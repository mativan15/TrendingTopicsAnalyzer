The first teams to find out where their paths begin are those in Pot 1, which includes the co-hosts — Australia and New Zealand — but also the United States, England, Germany, Sweden, Spain and France.

Australia and New Zealand already knew their positions before arriving at Aotea Center in Auckland for the draw. New Zealand will go in Group A, and Australia in Group B. That ensures both will play the group stage on home soil.
