Harry Kane's second-half penalty on his 400th appearance for Tottenham Hotspur helped them to a 2-0 win over Everton to cement their place in the Premier League top four on Saturday.
Everton had defended resolutely and wasted a couple of gilt-edged chances but when their goalkeeper Jordan Pickford brought down England team mate Kane just before the hour mark the striker made no mistake from the spot.
Tottenham dominated after the break and Kane was then involved in a flowing move that ended with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg wrapping up the points in the 86th minute.
