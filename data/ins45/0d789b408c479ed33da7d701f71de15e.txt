German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said he will extend the operation of Germany's last three nuclear power plants, in what's been described as a snub to the Greens in his coalition government.

Against the backdrop of an unprecedented energy crisis, the government had so far only agreed to keep two of the three power stations beyond the end of 2022, the date initially planned for a nuclear phase-out.

A letter from Scholz to the government asks the economy, environment and finance ministries to lay the legal framework to keep the country's three nuclear power plants — Isar 2, Neckarwestheim 2 and Emsland — operational until as late as 15 April 2023.
