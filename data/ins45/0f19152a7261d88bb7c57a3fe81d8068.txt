Ricky Gervais has joked about running for prime minister following the resignation of Liz Truss. Truss announced on Wednesday (20 October) that she was stepping down from the leadership position, marking the shortest-serving prime minister in the country's history.Shortly after the news was announced, Gervais shared a photoshopped image of himself outside 10 Downing Street on Twitter.'And it wouldn't even be in the top 10 weirdest news stories of the year,' wrote the Office star, alongside a 'crying laughing' emoji.
