Shashi Kapoor was born on March 18, 1938, to Prithviraj Kapoor in Kolkata (then Calcutta). He was the youngest brother of Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor. In his acting career, he has appeared in 160 movies—12 in English and 148 in Hindi. Kapoor has worked as a child artist in films like 'Aag' (1948), 'Awaara' (1951), 'Sangram' (1950) among others. At the age of six, he was certain that he wanted to be in show business. Shashi Kapoor joined theatre instead of wasting his four years in college, to which his father Prithviraj Kapoor willingly agreed.
