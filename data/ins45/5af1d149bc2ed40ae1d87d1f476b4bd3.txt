The post-June 1 designation date for player releases in the NFL has officially passed, meaning that the salary cap numbers for each team are in. As of June 4, the Carolina Panthers have the second-most available cap space in the league, with $25,063,534 left to spend according to Over The Cap.
Prior to June 1, NFL teams must pay any player released or traded their remaining salary cap allocation that offseason. That means that if a player carries a $1 million cap hit every season for the next five seasons, but their team releases them before June 1, the team must pay them all $5 million in this league year.
