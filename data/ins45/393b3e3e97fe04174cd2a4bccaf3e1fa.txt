The Larkins is finally back on our screens for a brand-new season.
The beloved series is a fresh take on the 90s series, which tells the story of a working-class family with six children led by Pop and his wife Ma.
The reboot has a wealth of talent behind it, with Simon Nye (The Durrells, Men Behaving Badly) and Abigail Wilson (Stella, Trollied) writing the show.
Sir David Jason, Pam Ferris, and Catherine Zeta-Jones starred in the original series which followed the Larkins, a working-class family in rural 1950s Kent, with six children led by Pop (Sir David) and his wife Ma (Pam).
