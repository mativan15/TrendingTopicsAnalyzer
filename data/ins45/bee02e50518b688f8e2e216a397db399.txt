Most Americans think former President Donald Trump should be forced to testify to a House committee investigating last year's assault on the US Capitol, and they want the questioning to be conducted in public view, a new poll showed.The Monmouth University survey also found that opinions about Trump's involvement in the attack on the Capitol have not been significantly impacted by the televised public hearings the committee held from June 9 to July 21. It also found the country is evenly split on whether they believe Trump's continued presence in political life poses a danger to democracy: 47% say it does, while 50% it doesn't.
