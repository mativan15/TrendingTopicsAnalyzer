DX (Group) plc (LON:DX.) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 27% share price drop in the last month. Instead of being rewarded, shareholders who have already held through the last twelve months are now sitting on a 25% share price drop.

After such a large drop in price, given close to half the companies in the United Kingdom have price-to-earnings ratios (or "P/E's") above 12x, you may consider DX (Group) as an attractive investment with its 8.2x P/E ratio.
