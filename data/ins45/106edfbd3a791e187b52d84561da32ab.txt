Amazon and the N.F.L. tried to spice up this year's Thursday night lineup by spotlighting 'story line' quarterbacks: Russell Wilson and Matt Ryan leading their new teams in Week 5, the multitalented youngster Justin Fields versus the downright Shakespearean Carson Wentz in Week 6, and so forth. That programming tactic backfired, however, as none of those quarterbacks have lived up to their billing.

The league's Friday news cycle has therefore become a weekly referendum on unfulfilled expectations, which would not happen if Wilson and the others were merely disappointing local fans during regional Sunday telecasts.
