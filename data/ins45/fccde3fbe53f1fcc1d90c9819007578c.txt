After 5 semesters of teaching creativity and design thinking in Ateneo de Manila University, I'm now taking a much needed hiatus to recuperate and up-skill myself. Along the way, I was able to teach 100+ sophomores and juniors. They came from various management courses such as Management Engineering (ME), Communications Technology (ComTech), Legal Management (LM), Information Technology and Entrepreneurship (ITE) and more.One of my top performing classes. A class full of Legal Management sophomores.
