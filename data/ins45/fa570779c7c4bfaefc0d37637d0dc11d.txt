Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan says the Federal Reserve's dramatic interest rate hikes will positively influence the bank's profits headed into 2023.

"One of the things that people know about banking is a core way we make half our money or more is through what they call a spread, i.e. the difference between what we lend a customer money at and what we pay on the deposits, and the money customers give us or we can borrow on the market," Moynihan said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).
