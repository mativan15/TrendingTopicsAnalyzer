Securities codes in Japan, the four-digit symbols used to identify publicly traded stocks and other investment products, will include English characters, beginning with securities approved for exchange listings, on Jan. 1, 2024.
The Securities Identification Code Committee, made up of representatives from the Tokyo Stock Exchange and others, announced the schedule for the revision in May this year. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software. Please add japantimes.co.
