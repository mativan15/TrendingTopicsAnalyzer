Gambling firm 888 said it has made 'rapid progress' integrating the William Hill operations it bought for £1.95 billion earlier this year as it also revealed a decline in sales over the past three months.The London-listed firm revealed total sales fell by 7% to £449 million over the quarter to September 30, compared with the same period last year.888 said lower revenues were primarily driven by 'enhanced UK online player safety measures' and the closure of operations in the Netherlands.The company added that retail revenues were stable for the period at £124 million, despite a £4 million impact from closures due to national mourning following the death of the Queen.
