On Thursday, Forbes estimated the Los Angeles Lakers star's net worth at $1 billion. He is the first active NBA player to reach the status. Michael Jordan, whose net worth Forbes has pegged at $1.7 billion, didn't reach billionaire status until 11 years post-retirement. Forbes estimated James earned $121.2 million last year. Becoming a billionaire is a feat James spoke of in a 2014 interview with GQ.
