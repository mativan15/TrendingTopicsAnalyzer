A father forfeited his AR-15 rifle to the police after the Texas school shooting, explaining, "It's the only thing I can do." Former Marine Ben Beers grew up shooting guns recreationally and learning about gun safety. Now, raising two daughters in Oregon, he's always kept his weapons, including a custom-built AR-15 gun, locked in a safe. However, school shootings have made Beers reconsider gun ownership. "With AR-15s constantly in the news (it made me think), why do I have these in my home?" Beers told TODAY Parents.
