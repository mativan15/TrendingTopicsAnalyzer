An outdoor screening of a popular Batman film in Hong Kong was cancelled because it contained violent scenes, the event's organisers have said, quashing speculation about any link to national security concerns. A government spokesman also called a foreign media report which suggested authorities had banned the screening of The Dark Knight at the event in Central Harbourfront as "groundless", explaining organisers had made the decision to replace the movie after receiving advice from the city's film regulatory body.
