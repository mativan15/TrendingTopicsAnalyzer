Over the last month the CalAmp Corp. (NASDAQ:CAMP) has been much stronger than before, rebounding by 31%. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. In that time the share price has delivered a rude shock to holders, who find themselves down 63% after a long stretch. So is the recent increase sufficient to restore confidence in the stock? Not yet. However, in the best case scenario (far from fait accompli), this improved performance might be sustained.

The recent uptick of 14% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a lot at historical fundamentals.
