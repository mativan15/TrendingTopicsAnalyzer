The distance from the Earth's surface to its center is almost 4,000 miles—but our planet's structure is not uniform and is actually made up of several different layers, some of which are hotter than others.The Earth's cool, thin outer layer, known as the crust, mostly consists of solid rock and is generally around 20-30 miles thick in continental areas, although in oceanic regions the average thickness is roughly four miles.Below the crust lies the mantle, which extends downwards for roughly 1,800 miles, making up 84 percent of the Earth's total volume.
