TAURUS (Apr 21-May 20) Avoid being rigid and hasty today. Unnecessary issues may bother you which may distract you from your goals. Some of you may witness ups and downs in your career. This will be a time where you have to put in hard work without expecting too much in return. But from the middle of the day, you will feel a positive change in your surroundings. That period will be auspicious for your financial matters. Social activity with family would keep everyone in a relaxed and happy mood. Romantic imagination is set to soar as your dream person is likely to reciprocate feelings.
