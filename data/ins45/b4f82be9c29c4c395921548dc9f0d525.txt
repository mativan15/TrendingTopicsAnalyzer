(4th LD) Opposition leader proposes special counsel probe into Seongnam development scandal(ATTN: UPDATES with presidential office's response and background info in paras 7, 8, 11-13)By Kim Na-young SEOUL, Oct. 21 (Yonhap) -- Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung called Friday for an independent counsel investigation into a corruption scandal that led to an arrest warrant request for one of his closest aides, claiming his innocence as a prosecution probe closes in on him. Lee of the main opposition Democratic Party made the remark after prosecutors sought the warrant for Kim Yong, a longtime confidant of Lee, for allegedly receiving 847 million won (US$593,552) in illegal political funds from real estate developers involved in a corruption-laden project in the city of Seongnam.
