Flooding across Nigeria has hobbled gas production and decimated thousands of square kilometers of farmland, the country's government said Wednesday, aggravating fuel and food shortages across Africa's most populous nation and potentially affecting gas exports to Europe as it braces for energy shortages this winter.

Several weeks of flooding have hit 33 of Nigeria's 36 states, uprooted more than two million people from their homes and killed more than 600 people. More than 200,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged, making the floods the worst to hit Nigeria since 2012, and one of the worst for decades, according to the country's humanitarian affairs ministry.
