It was a volatile session for Silvergate Capital (SI -0.33%) on Wednesday. The stock price dropped by some 5.2% in the morning, but bounced back into positive territory late in the day before ending the day down just 0.3%. 
That final result was in line with the broader market, which was down across the board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%, the S&P 500 fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite was off by 0.9%.
So what
It appears that the cryptocurrency-focused bank's shares bounced around primarily in response to the release of several notes from analysts that cover it.
