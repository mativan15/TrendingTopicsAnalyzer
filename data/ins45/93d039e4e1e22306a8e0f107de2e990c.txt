President Joe Biden is expected to sign a national security memorandum Tuesday that aims to ensure the U.S. is ready to detect and respond to the next large-scale viral or biological threat.

The memo will direct officials across 20 agencies, including in the intelligence community, to prioritize biodefense and pandemic preparedness, according to a senior administration official.

The plan pulls from goals set by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy that focus on the U.S. investing in research and development of tools that would help expand the country's early warning systems.
