By Reuters Published: 21:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 21:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 Pittsburgh and host Louisville bring plenty of momentum into play when they square off on Saturday evening. Both the Panthers (4-2, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) and the Cardinals (3-3, 1-3) had last weekend off after producing solid wins on Oct. 8. Pittsburgh last visited Louisville in 2011 when the teams played in the Big East. The Panthers won that contest 21-14. Pittsburgh was the talk of the conference after a 45-29 win at home over hapless Virginia Tech two weeks ago.
