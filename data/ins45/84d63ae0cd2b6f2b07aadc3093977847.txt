Bye-bye: Meta has again been ordered by the UK's competition watchdog to sell animated GIF platform, Giphy. And this time it's final.
The decision follows a ‘stay of execution' for Meta this summer, after the U.K.'s Competition Appeal Tribunal sent the case back to the antitrust regulator to be reassessed following a procedural finding that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had not provided full, un-redacted disclosure to Meta representatives of documents related to its decision.
But the tribunal upheld the CMA's decision on five of the six challenged grounds — saying it had 'no hesitation' in concluding that the regulator's finding that the merger substantially reduced dynamic competition was lawful.
