By Joe Hoppe Ithaca Energy Inc. said Tuesday that it is considering floating on the London Stock Exchange, raising an undisclosed amount. The oil-and-gas company didn't provide the number of shares nor the price per share expected for the potential initial public offering, nor a planned timetable for admission. Ithaca said net proceeds will be used to repay existing shareholder debt, and pay IPO expenses, with all net proceeds ultimately received by controlling shareholder Delek Group Ltd. Immediately after admission, Ithaca intends to have a free float of at least 10% of its issued share capital, and up to a further 15% of the offer will be available pursuant to an over-allotment option.
