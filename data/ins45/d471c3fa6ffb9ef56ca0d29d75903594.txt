Who is spending? Kim's race is the most expensive House race in the state right now — through primary day, AdImpact has tracked $2.4 million in spending in the race, about as much as the next three most expensive California House races combined. The congresswoman's campaign has booked and spent almost $1.4 million, with $475,000 of that slated to come in the final week.
