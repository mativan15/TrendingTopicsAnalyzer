Oct. 20—Two local athletes are receiving a high honor this weekend with their induction into the Special Olympics of Missouri Hall of Fame.

Simon Caldwell of Savannah and Tanner Hrenchir of Wathena, Kansas, have been involved with Special Olympics for decades. The two are set to head to Jefferson City on Saturday for their induction into the Special Olympics Hall of Fame Class of 2022.

Hrenchir, who has done sports including basketball, powerlifting and flag football during his 31 years in Special Olympics, said he was surprised about his nomination to the Hall of Fame.
