The quintessential Paul Trible moment for 26 years at Christopher Newport University is not about new buildings or endowment ballooning or graduation rates soaring. It looks like this:

'I've seen him so many times, when an old student is visiting, walk up, call them by name, shake hands, ask them how they are doing,' said Jay Paul, director of CNU's distinctive Honors Program.

CNU's recent commencements have distinct Trible style, too.

Instead of the usual long speeches and parade of students getting a diploma and a quick handshake, the past two featured a three-minute Trible speech — 'probably my shortest' — before sending students and families on a ceremonial tour.
