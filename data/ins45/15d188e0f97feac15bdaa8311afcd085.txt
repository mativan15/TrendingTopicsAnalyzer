The opponents of what's known as the 'millionaires tax' just had their most productive two weeks of fund-raising, collecting some $3.7 million largely from business executives.This marked the first reporting period in which the Coalition to Stop the Tax Hike Amendment outpaced the Fair Share Massachusetts committee, which supports the income tax surcharge that will go before voters next month. Fair Share raised nearly $3.2 million over the same two weeks, primarily from the National Education Association.
