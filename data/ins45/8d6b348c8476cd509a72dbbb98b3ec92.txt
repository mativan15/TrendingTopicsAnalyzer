Elon Musk's latest internet jest has taken the form of a perfume with an unsavory scent: "Burnt Hair." The tech mogul, entrepreneur and sometimes internet troll announced the launch of the product on Twitter on Tuesday, calling it "the finest fragrance on Earth." The perfume is apparently being sold on The Boring Company's website for $100 and will ship in the first quarter of 2023. But now The Boring Company – a Musk venture that started as a Twitter joke about traffic – appears to actually be selling the perfume.
