Ikea has admitted its cut-price ethos is under strain after some products were found to have become 80% more expensive in under a year.
Price growth on more than a dozen items has outstripped inflation by at least twofold since December last year, according to a new study by Retail Week.
They include the Jokkmokk set of a table and four chairs, which rose from £99 to £179.
A two-seater Glostad sofa went up by two-thirds from £90 to £150, while a Slattum double bed frame rose nearly 50% from £129 to £189.
