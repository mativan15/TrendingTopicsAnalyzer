Arsenal left-back Kieran Tierney has been warned now is the time to "stand up and fight" for his place in Mikel Arteta's starting XI having lost his place in recent weeks. The Scotland international was once viewed as one of the most important players in Arteta's Gunners system, but the arrival of former Manchester City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko in the summer has dealt a blow to Tierney's playing time. However, the Ukrainian left-back has not been available for the last few weeks due to an injury, which led to many assuming Tierney would finally get a sustained run of games in the side.
