Chloe Grace Moretz's new show may be set in the future, but it's a future where progress is still sadly lacking when it comes to girls and gaming.In The Peripheral, an eight-part Amazon series based on the book by science fiction author William Gibson, the actress plays Flynne Fisher, a talented gamer who uses her brother's avatar because it commands more respect from the wealthy clients who pay them to play on their behalf.
Moretz told Sky News's Backstage podcast it's frustrating that women aren't given more credit for their abilities.
