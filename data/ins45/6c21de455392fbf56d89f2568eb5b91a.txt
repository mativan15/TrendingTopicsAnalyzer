HONOLULU (AP) — A judge has set a new sentencing date for former Hawaii state Rep. Ty Cullen, who earlier this year pleaded guilty to one count in connection with his acceptance of bribes when he was a lawmaker.He's now due to be sentenced on Oct. 20 instead of July 5. Cullen's attorney, Birney Bervar, declined to comment. Former Senate Majority Leader Kalani English, who also pleaded guilty in a related case, is still scheduled to be sentenced on July 5. The two Democrats each face up to 20 years in prison, but their sentences will depend on various factors.
