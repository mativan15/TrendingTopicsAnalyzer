The software entrepreneur who is trying to buy advertising agency M&C Saatchi has been kicked off the company's board.The firm said directors thought it would not be appropriate for Vin Murria to continue in the position.She has made several bids to take over the business, but her latest £254 million approach was rejected by the board, who called it 'derisory'.The bid undervalued M&C Saatchi, board members said at the time, and they later opted instead for a higher bid of £310 million from Next Fifteen Communications.
