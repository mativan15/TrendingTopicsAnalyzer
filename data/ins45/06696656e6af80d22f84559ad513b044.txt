The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a Texas law that would restrict the ability of popular social media companies to control the content of their own sites.Under the law, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and other sites would be unable to block content based on its viewpoint. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the law was a response to 'a dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas.'But two big tech trade groups said it was an attempt to censor the content of private social media sites.
