BEIRUT, Lebanon — Last month a photo of 28-year-old Sali Hafiz went viral. In the image she was standing on a desk, dressed in black with yellow sneakers, a gun — a realistic toy — in one hand and a phone in the other. She was in the middle of robbing a bank. Though, maybe 'robbing' isn't the right word for it: She wanted to make a withdrawal; she was just done asking politely.

Ms. Hafiz was not the first account holder in Lebanon to resort to these tactics; there has been a spate of similar holdups at banks across the country since January.
