The global economy apparently has the world's wealthiest man pretty concerned. An email with 'pause all hiring worldwide' in the headline was reportedly sent to executives at electric-car giant Tesla TSLA, +4.68%, Reuters reported late Thursday. In the email, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he had a 'super bad feeling' about the economy, and that employee headcount needed to be cut by 10%. Tesla employed around 100,000 people at the end of 2021, according to its annual SEC filing. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
