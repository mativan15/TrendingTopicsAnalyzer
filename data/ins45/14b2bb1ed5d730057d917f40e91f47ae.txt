A Highland Park resident reported an unknown man said he needed to check underground lines and dig in the backyard of a residence in the 500 block of Chicago Avenue Oct. 5. The man coaxed the homeowner into the backyard. The resident later learned rooms on the second floor of the home were rummaged through and jewelry was missing.
