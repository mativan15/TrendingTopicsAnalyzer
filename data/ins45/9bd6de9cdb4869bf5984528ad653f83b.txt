Stock splits have become all the rage again, fueled by a bull run that put the prices of some equities out of reach of many individual investors. One such stock is e-commerce platform provider Shopify (SHOP 10.33%).
After the stock's eye-popping run that saw it gain as much as 6,350% since its initial public offering in 2015, management announced plans for a 10-for-1 stock split. The measure, which requires an amendment to its articles of incorporation, will be voted on at the company's upcoming annual and special meeting of shareholders, scheduled for June 7.
