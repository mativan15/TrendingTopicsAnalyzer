Recently, the state government released a draft ‘Rajasthan Virtual Sports (Regulation) Bill' for public consultation. The bill suggests that all gaming service providers will need to obtain a licence to be able to operate in the state. The state is planning to bring a legislation in order to regulate online skill-based games specifically fantasy games. Industry bodies in the sector like the Skill Games Council of India and E-Gaming Federation (EGF) said that the government should make the draft more inclusive by incorporating regulations for all online skill games equally and not just fantasy gaming.
