Laws compelling people in positions of trust to report child sexual abuse and a national compensation scheme for victims should be introduced, a seven-year inquiry into institutional failings in England and Wales concluded.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) described the sexual abuse of children as an 'epidemic that leaves tens of thousands of victims in its poisonous wake', as its final report was published on Thursday.

But the inquiry's chairwoman said it was 'unfortunate' the Prime Minister's resignation on the same day may take attention away from the work.
