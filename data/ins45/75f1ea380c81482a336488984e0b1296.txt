It's hard to say where Snap will go from here after its third-quarter results, according to Bernstein. Analyst Mark Shmulik downgraded the social media stock to market perform from outperform, after Snap reported a disappointing third-quarter revenue results and softening user engagement numbers. The analyst also lowered his price target and estimates on Snap. "With a stock down -85% over the past 12 months, suggesting that investor expectations were low going into earnings is an understatement. Yet low expectations offered no support for a company that seems to have lost all momentum," Shmulik wrote in a Friday note.
