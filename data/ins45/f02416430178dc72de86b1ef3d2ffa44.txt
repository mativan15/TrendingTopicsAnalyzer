Ryan (played by James Moore) was unveiled as one of the new owners of the Woolpack pub earlier this year, with the tech-genius going into business with his birth mother and Emmerdale stalwart, Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). The villager has also been busy at home as he agreed to let Ethan Anderson (Emile John) come and live with him as the lawyer wanted his own place. However, as Marcus Dean (Darcy Grey) and Ryan end up spending more time together in upcoming scenes on the ITV soap, the latter could be placed in a whole heap of trouble.
