LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The Lundquist Institute, a nonprofit research organization affiliated with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, announced Tuesday it has received a $112,000 grant from the Johnny Carson Foundation to support the study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- the condition from which the late  "Tonight Show" host suffered before his death in 2005. The money will be ticketed for training "the next generation of COPD researchers" at its Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, according to a statement from the Lundquist Institute.
