A day after the Maharashtra government rejected the Colaba police's proposal to prosecute senior IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in an alleged phone-tapping case registered in Mumbai, the investigators submitted the application at Esplanade court on Friday and sought to not proceed with the case. The Colaba police had registered a case against Shukla in March for allegedly tapping the phone conversations of NCP leader Eknath Khadse and Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut. © The Indian Express (P) LtdFirst publish
