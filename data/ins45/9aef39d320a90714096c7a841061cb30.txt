May 27—MITCHELL — A Mitchell woman claims that after suing a renter of hers who operates a neighboring business, the tenant intentionally organized a food truck to station outside her daughter's eatery.

During the Mitchell City Council's May 16 regular meeting, Roxie Ackman, former owner of Mitchell's Zesto, used a period of public commentary to request the council explore options limiting where food trucks can operate. Ackman said a food truck was selling product just feet away from Zesto recently.
