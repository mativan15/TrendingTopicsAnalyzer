tifonimages/iStock via Getty Images Copper Mountain Mining (OTCPK:CPPMF) made a major strategic decision, as it announced the sale of the Eva copper project to Harmony Gold Mining (HMY), for a total consideration of up to $230 million. Harmony agreed to pay $170 million on the closing of the transaction, and further $60 million in contingent payments tied to future copper prices and potential new discoveries on the property. Copper Mountain acquired the project in 2018, when it acquired Altona Mining.
