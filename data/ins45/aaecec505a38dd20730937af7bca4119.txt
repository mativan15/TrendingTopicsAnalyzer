The government has won a key vote on fracking – seen as a test of Liz Truss's authority – but its victory was overshadowed by claims that Tory whips had physically manhandled and bullied backbenchers into backing the prime minister's administration.A Labour former minister urged the Deputy Speaker to launch an investigation, and one Conservative MP described the chaos in the House of Commons as 'inexcusable' and an 'absolute disgrace'.Other MPs spoke of 'total carnage' and 'utter madness', as Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg reportedly shouted 'it's not a confidence vote' and Tory colleagues reportedly used four-letter words to tell him where to go.
