Sheryl Sandberg announced today on Facebook that she is leaving Meta after more than a decade as the company's chief operating officer.
Sandberg joined Meta, then Facebook, as COO in 2008. Over the course of 14 years, Sandberg steered the company through an IPO, an unprecedented period of explosive industry growth and its at-times rocky path to becoming one of the most socially impactful and valuable tech companies in the world.
Meta's Chief Growth Officer Javier Olivan will step into the COO role as Sandberg departs.
