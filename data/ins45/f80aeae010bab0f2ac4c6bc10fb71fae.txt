Cristiano Ronaldo has been told by Gabby Agbonlahor to follow the example of his long-term adversary Lionel Messi to come to terms with his reduced role at Manchester United. Ronaldo – an unused substitute during his side's dominant two-goal victory over Tottenham – was filmed walking off down the tunnel and subsequent reports claimed that he departed Old Trafford before his triumphant teammates returned to the dressing room after the match. The Portuguese star has been widely criticised for his actions at the end of the encounter.
