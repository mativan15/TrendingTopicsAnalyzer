Because she's an amateur, Lindblad wouldn't be able to collect the record $1.8 million first-place prize if she wins. She would have had to declare as a professional before the tournament began.When asked if, in hindsight, that was a mistake, the LSU junior known to her friends as 'Iggy' paused and said with a smile, 'I'm going to stay in college for like another year or so."But when you say it, yeah ... it would have been fun to win a little bit of money,' she said.She has a 54 holes to navigate, but Lindblad has a chance to become only the second amateur to win the US Women's Open.
