WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden warned Friday that Republicans will "crash the economy next year" if they take control of Congress, looking to blunt the edge that growing fears of a recession have given Republicans less than three weeks before the midterm elections.Biden took aim at House Republican leaders who have suggested they might use the debt ceiling as "leverage" to achieve their budgetary goals on entitlements. "If you're worried about the economy, you need to know this," Biden said in a White House speech.
