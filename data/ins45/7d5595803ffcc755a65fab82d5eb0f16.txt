The 2022 Memorial Day sale event means epic deals on tech items, and we've just spotted a record-low price on the best-selling Apple Watch 7. Amazon has Apple's latest and greatest smartwatch on sale for $329 (was $399.99) right now (opens in new tab). That's a $70 discount and the best deal we've ever seen.

The Apple Watch 7 was released in October of last year and features a 70% brighter Always-On display, faster charging, and 20% more screen area, making it easier to use and read.
