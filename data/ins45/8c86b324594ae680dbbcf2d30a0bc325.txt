BT has just announced a brand new discount that is offering customers full broadband and TV access for just £6 per month.

Along with beaming the web into homes, the new deal also features full Netflix access and even a swathe of premium channels from Sky including Sky Atlantic, Sky Max and Sky Witness.If you thought that was good things get even better as there's also a BT TV Box Pro thrown in as well with this device offering the ability to record 600 hours of content along with beaming shows to the big screen in full 4K definition.
