Just hours after a Surfside condo building collapsed and buried 98 people last summer, the first of many lawsuits that would turn into one of the biggest class-action cases in Florida was filed.

On Friday, less than a month before the one-year anniversary of the Champlain Towers South tragedy, a team of lawyers representing family members of the deceased submitted a settlement agreement totaling $1,021,199,000 to Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman, who is expected to give his preliminary approval on Saturday after a final court hearing with the plaintiffs' lawyers.
