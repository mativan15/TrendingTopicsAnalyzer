The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a plea of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights challenging the Punjab and Haryana High Court order that a minor Muslim girl can marry a person of her choice. A bench of Justices S K Kaul and Abhay S Oka issued notice and appointed senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao as amicus curiae in the matter to assist the court. "This matter needs to be considered," the bench said. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the NCPCR, submitted that this is a "serious issue" and sought a stay of the observations in the judgment.
