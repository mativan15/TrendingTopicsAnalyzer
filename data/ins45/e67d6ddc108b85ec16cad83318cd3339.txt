Earlier in the week, it was reported that Chelsea had agreed personal terms with Nkunku ahead of a big money transfer in 2023.
The French forward was the subject of much interest over the summer from many big clubs across Europe, but was convinced to pen a new deal with Leipzig – though it does now include a release clause which will become active at the end of the season.
