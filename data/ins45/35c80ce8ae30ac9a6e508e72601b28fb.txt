According to the new plans around the Digital Real project, the tests that were supposed to commence later this year have been pushed to 2023. This is due to a workers' strike at the Central Bank, which impacted the original schedule. During an event about the topic promoted by the Brazilian Banking Federation (Febraban) on Monday (30), the bank's representatives said the intention was to start the pilots towards year-end, but the timescales were significantly delayed.
