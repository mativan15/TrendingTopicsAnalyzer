Alison Hammond looks happy and healthy in some new snaps shared on Monday [October 17]. The This Morning presenter, 47, took to her Instagram Stories to repost some pictures of herself showing off her slimmed-down figure as she posed backstage at the ITV show, after recently losing weight thanks to changing her lifestyle following a pre-diabetic condition diagnosis in 2020. Beaming as she posed for some snaps taken by her makeup artist, Alison looked stunning as she wore a gorgeous green and cream silk trouser suit - completing her outfit with a pair of nude court shoes, a silver watch and hoop earrings.
