Laverne Cox is 50 and fabulous as ever. Just days after celebrating a milestone birthday and the launch of her own Barbie as part of Mattel's Tribute Collection, the actor and activist set the tone on the decade ahead with one thing: gratitude. Known for breaking barriers, Cox traced her journey back with an optimism that's inspiring. 'I'm so grateful for every single painful, traumatic moment I've had in my life, believe it or not, because I have learned from it,' the four-time Emmy nominee told TODAY via Zoom.
