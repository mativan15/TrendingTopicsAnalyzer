KENNER, La. (AP) — After nearly 30 years, a floating casino in suburban New Orleans is poised to relocate to land.

Treasure Chest Casino officials broke ground Tuesday on a new site, which will house a development of more than $100 million. It will replace the current riverboat when it opens in 2024.

The new facility, owned by Nevada -based Boyd Gaming, will include a 47,000-square-foot gambling hall and 10,000 square feet of convention space as well as new restaurants, bars and a FanDuel Sportsbook.
