Simon Cowell rather surprised Britain's Got Talent viewers during Friday's semi-final when he whipped out a pretty serviceable impersonation of Sir David Attenborough.
Judges Simon, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and David Walliams gave glowing feedback to seven-year-old mini-environmentalist Aneeshwar Kunchala, who returned to the show with another poem about the importance of looking after the planet.
