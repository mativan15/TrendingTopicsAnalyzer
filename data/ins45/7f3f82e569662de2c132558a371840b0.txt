Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) not only said this week that he opposes any new gun laws to address mass shootings, but he also blamed critical race theory and 'wokeness' for the horrific Uvalde school massacre that left 19 young children dead.

Following the tragic Robb Elementary school slaughter, pro-gun conservatives have suggested everything from 'man traps' to 'ballistic blankets' to door control to address the never-ending scourge of American mass shootings. At the same time, they've routinely ignored the need for common-sense gun safety measures, even going so far as to claim gun control caused the Uvalde tragedy.
