On the star-studded panel were Jimmy Carr, Alison Hammond, Amanda Holden and special guest, Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley. Unable to resist teasing his BBC co-stars, Jimmy took a brutal jibe at Amanda's appearance.Last night's contestants saw Glenda and Paul from Essex work together to eliminate the fake singers and win £10,000.
