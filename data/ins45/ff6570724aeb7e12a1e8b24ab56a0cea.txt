York, Pa., May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Innovative, voice-activated technology is allowing WellSpan physicians to automatically transcribe patient visits, providing a better connection as well as a thorough documentation of the encounters.Nicknamed DAX, short for Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience, the artificial intelligence technology uses voice recognition to listen to and document the conversation between a physician and a patient, converting it into clinical notes. This means a physician no longer needs to manually enter information into the patient's electronic medical record by typing on a computer.
