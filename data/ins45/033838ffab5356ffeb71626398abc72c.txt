Zocha_K/E+ via Getty Images Around 10 months ago, I wrote a bearish article on SA about Canada-focused lithium miner Sayona Mining (OTCQB:SYAXF) and I think that this is a good time to revisit the company as it just released a pre‐feasibility study (PFS) for its flagship North American Lithium (NAL) project. I think the key financial figures of the project are compelling, but I'm concerned that Sayona Mining used high lithium spodumene prices in the base case for the study. Lithium demand is expected to increase fast over the next several years, but I expect prices to decline significantly in a year or two as the structural deficit in the market eases.
