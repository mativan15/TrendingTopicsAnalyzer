BP PLC (NYSE: BP) expects biogas to be a significant part of its energy transition portfolio by 2030, CEO Bernard Looney said.

The London-based energy supermajor is growing its existing bioenergy footprint through the acquisition of Houston-based renewable natural gas producer Archaea Energy Inc. (NYSE: LFG). The deal is valued at around $4.1 billion and includes about $800 million in net debt.

The Archaea deal, slated to close by the end of the year, should double the earnings BP expects to generate from biogas to around $2 billion by 2030, the company said Oct.
