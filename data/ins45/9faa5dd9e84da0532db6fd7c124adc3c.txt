This week in Beijing, Xi Jinping will preside over one of his country's great shows of political theatre and seal a long-planned political triumph, consolidating his power and extending his rule.The Chinese Communist party is poised to formally hand Xi another five years as party boss, and therefore leader of the country, at a summit that will also move his allies into key roles and elevate the status of his writings on power and government.The 20th Party Congress will – barring unprecedented last-minute drama – confirm him as the most powerful man in China since Mao Zedong, and probably enshrine him and his personal ideology in the party's constitution.
