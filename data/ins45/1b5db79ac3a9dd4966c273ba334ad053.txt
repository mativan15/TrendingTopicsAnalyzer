JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have been cut in half, as they declined -51.44% YTD. You would need to go back to the spring of 2014 to find the last time shares of INTC traded at this low of a valuation. INTC doesn't resemble one of the largest companies in the S&P 500 but rather a profitless tech company. Due to many issues, from a softening PC market to supply chain issues, INTC missed the consensus earnings estimates on the top and bottom line in Q2 and guided for lower-than-expected results in Q3, which will be reported next week on 10/27.
