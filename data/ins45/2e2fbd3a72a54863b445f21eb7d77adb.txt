JK Rowling has accused Nicola Sturgeon of "riding roughshod" over women's rights and has said the First Minister will be personally responsible if her overhaul of transgender laws leads to attacks on girls.
The Harry Potter author said that Ms Sturgeon would be to blame for cases of 'voyeurism, sexual harassment, assault or rape' that she believes could result from allowing Scots to change their legal sex simply by signing a declaration.
It is the latest escalation in a remarkable rift between the First Minister and one of Scotland's prominent residents.
