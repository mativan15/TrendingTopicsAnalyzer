Agencies The Congress MP wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker, "Shockingly even my draft notes and questions which I had intended to ask witnesses summoned to the committee were also seized. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram has complained to the Lok Sabha Speaker that he and his family have become "targets of a relentless campaign" by the Centre and investigating agencies and that such "targeted intimidation" and "foisting of fake cases" on a member of Parliament amounted to a breach of privilege. He also alleged that during the raids at his house the Central Bureau of Investigation officials seized sensitive documents related to a parliamentary standing committee which too amounted to breach of his privilege as an MP.
