Russell Crowe made it red carpet official with his girlfriend Britney Theriot on Sunday night as they attended the premiere of his new film Poker Face in Rome, Italy, together.
The 58-year-old Gladiator star was all smiles as he posed with his arm around Britney, 31, for photos ahead of the screening.
Dressed in a dark charcoal suit and black T-shirt, Russell had his hair slicked back and his grey beard neatly trimmed.
Actress-turned-estate agent Britney opted for a knee-length, A-line grey satin dress with a striking geometric design.
