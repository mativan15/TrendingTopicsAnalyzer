Real Madrid could get one over on Liverpool for the second time in a matter of days after initiating 'direct contact' with Monaco over the signing of Aurelien Tchouameni. The Reds are reportedly among the interested parties trying to rival Los Blancos for the midfielder's signature, but may need to get a move on to avoid missing out.Top clubs from around Europe began to seriously take note of Tchouameni's potential last summer, and Chelsea supposedly came close to pulling the trigger. With another year of experience under his belt, the Frenchman's stock has only increased and he looks certain to leave Monaco over the coming weeks.
