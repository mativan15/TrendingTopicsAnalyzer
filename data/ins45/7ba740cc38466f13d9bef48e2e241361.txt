ClaudineVMEarnings of Cathay General Bancorp (NASDAQ:CATY) will most probably surge this year on the back of healthy loan growth. Robust economic activity in the company's markets will drive loan growth. Further, interest income will benefit from the rising rate environment. Overall, I'm expecting Cathay General to report earnings of $4.59 per share for 2022, up 21% year-over-year. For 2023, I'm expecting earnings to grow by 13.7% to $5.22 per share. The year-end target price suggests a moderate upside from the current market price.
