 Indian manufacturers secured new orders in May at virtually the same pace as April despite raising prices at the fastest rate in more than eight-and-a-half years amid an acute surge in input costs, as per the S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). The index stood at 54.6 in May, down marginally from 57.4 in March. A reading of over 50 on the index indicates growth in activity levels.
