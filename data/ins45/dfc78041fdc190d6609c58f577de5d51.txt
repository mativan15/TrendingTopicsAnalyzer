Carl Gotsch, professor emeritus of food research at the School of Humanities and Sciences and a self-described tech junkie who promoted the use of microcomputing to improve agricultural management, died June 12 at his home in Palo Alto. He was 89. Gotsch joined the faculty of Stanford's Food Research Institute in 1976 and became its associate director in 1992. He played a key role in augmenting the institute's master of arts program to emphasize the practical techniques of agricultural policy analysis and how to promote the results through effective writing and presentation, said Scott Pearson, who directed the institute from 1992 to 1996.
