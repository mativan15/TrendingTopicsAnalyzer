In another video posted by the campaign group, a protester describes how Harrods "also have shares in oil and gas companies" and refers to how millions of people "have lost their homes" in Pakistan before being removed from outside the doors by security guards. 
A Harrods security guard, who did not want to be named and was not working at the time of the protest, said he respects both sides of the argument but felt it was wrong the group had tried to damage something. 
He said: 'I've got no problem with it but that's because I don't know anything about it, to be fair.
