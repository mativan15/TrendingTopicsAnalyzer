SeaPort Manatee in Palmetto has doubled its cargo throughput in two years, according to new numbers released last week.

The growth reflects the rising consumer demand from Florida's growing population and the increasing likelihood of companies investing in Central American production capacity, port President and CEO Carlos Buqueras said from Brazil.

"We're looking to bring in anything and everything that has been made in Central America," said Buqueras, who also serves as vice chair of the Florida Ports Council.
