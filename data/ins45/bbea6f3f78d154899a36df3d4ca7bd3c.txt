metamorworks The bullish path for stocks may be pushed out to next year, J.P. Morgan global market strategist Marko Kolanovic says. Kolanovic, who has remained bullish through the stock selloff, is now trimming risk for his model portfolio, citing increasing chances of central banks making a hawkish policy mistake. "Recent developments on these fronts - namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine - are likely to delay the economic and market recovery," Kolanovic wrote in a note.
