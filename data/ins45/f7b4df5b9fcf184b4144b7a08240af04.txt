Amid market carnage, the crypto-native venture firm Volt Capital announced a new $50 million fund on Wednesday, backed by industry heavyweights like Tiger Global and Brevan Howard.  Volt's thesis, founder Soona Amhaz said, is that volatility in crypto markets isn't going away anytime soon. "So you need to have battle-hardened VCs who are going to stay disciplined, take the long-term view, and not forget the fundamentals when the market gets frothy," Amhaz told Insider. The $50 million raise will go towards plays in decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations, and its related infrastructure.
