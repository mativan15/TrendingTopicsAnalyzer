Animal rights charity PETA has hit out at China's decision to gift Qatar two giant pandas ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, calling the gesture "out of touch."The two pandas — known in Chinese as Si Hai and Jing Jing — arrived in Qatar on Wednesday and will spend the next 15 years in an indoor enclosure, which is designed to duplicate the climate of the western Chinese forests where the animals are native.After a 21-day quarantine, the pair will be available for public viewing by the time the World Cup starts on November 20, with Qatar expecting more than 1.
