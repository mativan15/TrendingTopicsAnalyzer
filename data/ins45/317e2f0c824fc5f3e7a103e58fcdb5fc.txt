JasonDoiy Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares just keep dropping and now yield nearly 6%. It's been a disastrous year for shareholders, and it seems like there is always another shoe to drop. The most recent one being the warning from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in which it guided for a much bigger than expected drop in revenues. It is getting to the point whereby the shares of chip stocks are dropping over and over again on even the same news and news that was not at all unexpected. It should not surprise anyone that the chip industry has a glut of inventory and that revenues and margins are declining.
