Lisa Smith has been found guilty of membership of the terrorist organisation Isis by the Special Criminal Court. Mr Justice Tony Hunt revealed the verdict of the three-judge, non-jury court in a detailed judgment this morning. Having first revealed that the court found her not guilty of funding terrorism, he then went through the evidence relating to membership and said that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Smith travelled to Syria 'with her eyes open' and pledged allegiance to the organisation led by terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
