Snap reported its third quarter earnings Thursday, the first social media company to offer a financial update amidst ongoing economic tumult this quarter.
The company, which has seen its stock price plunge to a fraction of what it was worth during 2021's highs, missed analyst expectations on revenue, bringing in $1.13 billion compared to the $1.14 billion anticipated. Snap's stock dipped from around $11 per share to $8 in late trading following the report.
Snap's revenue is up 6 percent this quarter, a number that doesn't compare favorably to previous periods of double digit growth.
