Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has declared he will seek only one nominee to the board of power giant AGL instead of two, so long as he is confident the vacated positions are filled by candidates with suitable experience, expertise and vision for the company's future.AGL, the nation's largest carbon emitter, was plunged into crisis this week after a shareholder push, led by Cannon-Brookes, scuttled the proposed break-up of its retail and power generation businesses.The announcement forced the resignations of AGL chief executive Graeme Hunt and chairman Peter Botten as well as independent directors Diane Smith-Gander and Jacqueline Hey, with remaining board directors set to conduct a strategic review into the future of the 180-year-old company.
