Junior outside hitter Alayna Pierce packs a powerful punch for Genoa-Kingston.

And even if the opposing defense is properly set up to block the Tennessee Tech recruit, coach Keith Foster still feels confident the Cogs will win the point.

'Even if you do get her, she's got a hammer of a swing,' Foster said. 'If you're going to block her, you better block her with everything you've got.'

Foster credits a wide variety of shots for helping Pierce already surpass her totals in kills and digs from last year with one regular-season match and playoffs still to come.
