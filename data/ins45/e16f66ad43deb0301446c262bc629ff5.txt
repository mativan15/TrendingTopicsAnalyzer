Over the last several months, JohnWallStreet has chronicled several attempts—including the Big 3's successful effort—to decentralize sports team ownership. Ryan Sweeney (general partner, Accel) says those projects are steps on the road to 'the fractionalization of everything. It started with Uber, where your car effectively is split into pieces.
