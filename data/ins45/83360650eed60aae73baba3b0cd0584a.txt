Xi Jinping opened the 20th congress of the Chinese Communist Party yesterday with a 104-minute speech in which he set out his stall for another five years in power. That the party will rubber stamp his continuation in office, making him the first leader to serve more than ten years since Deng Xiaoping introduced term limits in 1982, is a foregone conclusion. That will make Mr Xi, whose political ideas have already been included in the constitution as 'Xi Jinping thought', the most powerful leader China has had since Mao Zedong.
