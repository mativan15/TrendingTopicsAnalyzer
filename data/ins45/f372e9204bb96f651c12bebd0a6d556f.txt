Britain's new finance minister has outlined fresh tax and spending measures — two weeks earlier than a scheduled full statement — in a bid to quell turbulent markets.

The statement by Jeremy Hunt, who was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on Friday, represents a complete reversal of Liz Truss' controversial "mini-budget" that caused economic and political turmoil.

It comes amid reports of a growing revolt among ruling Conservative MPs against the prime minister, following the fiasco surrounding her economic plans.
