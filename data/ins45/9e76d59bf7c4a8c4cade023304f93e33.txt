Michael Avenatti, the once high-profile attorney who represented Stormy Daniels in court, has been sentenced to four years in prison for defrauding her.

In February, Avenatti was found guilty for pocketing $300,000 from the adult film star's $800,000 book deal advance, having forged her signature and skirted questions when she brought up the missing money.

He was convicted of wire fraud and identity theft after representing himself in court.

Avenatti — who has been in prison for the past two and a half years for trying to extort Nike — will serve another two and a half years for this conviction, according to the Associated Press.
