By Reuters Published: 09:43 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 09:43 EDT, 3 June 2022 SAO PAULO, June 3 (Reuters) - Brazil's Localiza Rent a Car SA said on Friday it was in talks to sell about 3.5 billion reais ($730 million) of assets to an investment fund managed by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Asset sales are a requirement of Localiza's tie-up agreement with rival Unidas, formally known as Companhia de Locacao das Americas. Brazil's antitrust regulator approved the tie-up late in 2021, but demanded the companies divest assets including the Unidas brand to avoid dominating the market.
