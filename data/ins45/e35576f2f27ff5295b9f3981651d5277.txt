The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week pushed back on a claim made by Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who said on his show that a CDC decision was likely coming to force kids to get COVID-19 vaccines in order to attend school.

But that's not technically within the CDC's authority, as the CDC pointed out in a rare tweet on Wednesday correcting a recent segment by Carlson, who has a history of criticizing COVID vaccine policy or sharing incorrect information about the shots.

Twitter also included a disclaimer along with the video from his show.
