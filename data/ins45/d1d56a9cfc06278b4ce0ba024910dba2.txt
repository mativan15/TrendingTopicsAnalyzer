A newly identified cohort of ultra-rich people called 'centi-millionaires' is growing worldwide, according to a report by Henley & Partners. The London-based firm, which focuses on global residence and citizenship investment planning for elite clients, describes the emergence of this class of wealthy individuals in a study entitled 'The Centi-Millionaire Report: The Emergence of a New Class of Super-Rich,' released Tuesday. 'A new landmark report on the rise of the centi-millionaire reveals that although a handful of the world's billionaires such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Roman Abramovich, and Bill Gates dominate the news headlines, their wealth cohort is outnumbered nearly 10-to-1,' the press release from Henley & Partners reads.
