Scott Darby reckons the telltale sign of his colt Insurrection's ability might not be his race record, but rather the names in the ownership group.

'I've got 10 per cent myself actually,' the Darby Racing boss and leading syndicator joked. 'I didn't mind him at all. You can't stay in them all, so you've got to pick and choose. Generally, some of our better colts I'll keep five or 10 per cent and the dream is always there. But it's very difficult to do.'

Insurrection might never forge a career as a commercial stallion, hence Darby's prophecy that hitting racing's version of lotto could be beyond reach.
