Oct. 21—Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich wants an audit of the financing and communication related to Camp Hope.

In a letter to the Washington state Auditor's Office, Knezovich named two homeless service providers, Jewels Helping Hands and the Guardians Foundation, along with state agencies playing a role at Camp Hope. Those include the state departments of Transportation, Commerce and Licensing.

The request was sent as part of his office's investigation into allegations regarding the funding and background of the homeless encampment on state property near Interstate 90, the sheriff's office said in a news release.
