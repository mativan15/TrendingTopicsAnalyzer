New York baseball legend David Cone is striking back against allegations his longtime love Taja Abitbol intentionally started a fire in their Upper West Side apartment to land a role on 'Real Housewives of New York.' 
He called such charges — which stemmed from the small, November 2019 blaze — 'surreal.' 
A neighbor, Daniel Rice, accused her in a July lawsuit of setting the blaze intentionally, so she'd have a story to share during an appearance on ABC's 'Tamron Hall Show' the next day. 
Heavy water damage from the incident caused $320,000 damage to Rice's apartment below Abitbol and Cone's.
