Irish publicly listed companies are on track to spend more than €1.9 billion buying back their own shares this year amid a slump in stock prices and a growing reticence among businesses globally to make acquisitions and invest in expansion in a slowing economy.The Irish list is led by CRH, which is on track to spend $1.2 billion (€1.23 billion) buying back its own shares this year, bringing the total it has spent repurchasing stock since 2018 to $4.1 billion, despite pausing its programme to conserve cash at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
