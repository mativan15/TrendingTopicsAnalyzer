The SQ7 has a more aggressive look than the standard Q7. The S-specific bumper has larger air intakes, and standard 21-inch wheels give this thing some great curb appeal -- as do the quad exhaust tips. Those who want a broody look can opt for the Black Optic package to add a darker vibe to the grille, mirror housings, door blades, window surrounds, bumper details and roof rails.The heart of the SQ7 is a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 that growls to life on startup. This is the same engine used in the aggro RS Q8, but it's detuned here to 'only' produce 500 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque.
