peterschreiber.mediaFirst American Financial (NYSE:FAF) is America's second-largest title insurance company. Historically, title insurance has been one of the better ways to profit from the housing market. Title insurance is a niche service which is vital for buying homes, in particular for securing a mortgage. A bank typically won't lend against a property without making sure that the underlying title is free and clear of all potential defects. As buyers have to secure title insurance to get mortgages, it serves as a sort of transaction fee on virtually all residential property sales in the United States.
