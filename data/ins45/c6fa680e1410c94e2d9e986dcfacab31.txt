A pessimistic Elon Musk told his executives that he wants Tesla to cut 10 percent of its workforce and pause all hiring because he has 'a super bad feeling' about the economy, according to a memo seen by various news organizations. The cut would be massive, considering Tesla employs around 100,000 people worldwide. The memo came a day after Musk told employees it was time to return to in-person work, or not return at all. Top executives at J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have been predicting a gloomy economic future, but Musk is the highest-profile non-finance executive to give such a forecast, Reuters reports.
