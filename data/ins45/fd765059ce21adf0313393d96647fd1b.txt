Benzinga traveled to Medellin, Colombia to attend Cosmoverse 2022. The event curated the brightest minds in the Cosmos ecosystem––from developers putting carbon credits on-chain, to industry leaders in interchain security. Among the speakers at the conference was Ethan Buchman, CEO of Informal Systems and co-founder of Cosmos.

Cosmos is a technology focused on interoperability, blockchain sovereignty, and scalability. Although Cosmos has a long history, mainstream investors began taking the protocol seriously in 2021, with the token's market capitalization reaching over $10 billion at the start of this year.
