A Palm Beach gallery owner has been arrested on federal charges for peddling fake art pieces, claiming the cheap reproductions were in fact originals by Andy Warhol, Banksy, Roy Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat and others, federal prosecutors said. A complaint filed in South Florida federal court Thursday accuses art dealer Daniel Elie Bouaziz of mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in his alleged scheme to sell forged copies of high-end art. Bouaziz, a French citizen of Algerian descent, was ordered released on $500,000 bail after an initial hearing Friday.
