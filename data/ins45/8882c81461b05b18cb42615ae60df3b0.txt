Thai YouTuber Bankii is a huge Star Citizen fan and has apparently spent an insane amount of money remodelling his gaming room to resemble his favourite ship, the Crusader Hercules. The Star Citizen fan went through multiple processes in building this room, especially when it came to capturing the space shuttle vibe. The construction of the room involved an ungodly amount of wooden panels attached to welded steel frames. Bankii pointed out in the video that the assembly of each part was done in the architect's workshop before it was moved to his studio.
