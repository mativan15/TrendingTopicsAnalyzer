The stock market is poised to erase all of its losses and finish the year flat, according to JPMorgan's quant guru Marko Kolanvoic.That would be quite the feat, given that the S&P 500 was down nearly 20% at its low last month as investors worry about rising inflation, higher interest rates, and the potential of an economic recession .But Kolanovic reiterated his view in a note on Wednesday that the US will avoid a recession this year thanks to a strong US consumer, a continued post-COVID economic reopening around the world, and the reopening of China's economy following stringent COVID-19 shutdowns.
