Manitoba is spending over $292,000 on employment program support in Thompson, families minister Rochelle Squires announced Monday.
The money is going towards two programs designed to help Thompson and district residents who are on employment and income assistance (EIA) find employment.'Our government is committed to modernizing EIA to ensure that clients, especially those farther from labour markets, are fully supported on a clear pathway toward greater independence and more fulfilling lives,' said Squires.
