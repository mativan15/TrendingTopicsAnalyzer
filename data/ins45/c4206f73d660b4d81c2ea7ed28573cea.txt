Tweddle, then 21, had fallen from the bars in the all-round section of the championships in the previous day's events, but produced her best form when it mattered in the individual competition. A score of 16.2 points saw her finish ahead of America's reigning champion Anastasia Liukin with Italy's Vanessa Ferrari taking bronze.
