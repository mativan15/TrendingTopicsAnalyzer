Chloe Brown is running to be mayor of Toronto. But if that doesn't happen the 31-year-old policy analyst says she's not sure she'll stay.

'I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with my city where I keep telling it what I want and what I need, and it ignores me,' she said.

For many young adults like Brown, clean, safe and affordable housing is high on the list of civic wants and needs. Toronto, she says, is undersupplied and overpriced making the future looking uncertain even for those with good jobs.
