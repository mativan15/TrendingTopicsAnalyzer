Businesses in Massachusetts are floundering due to the increased cost of energy in the state. Commercial electric rates went up 60% in 2021, while industrial rates rose 125%. And National Grid announced recently that the rates will spike again starting next month, with natural gas also expected to rise.

In fact, Massachusetts has long had among the highest electric rates in the nation when it comes to businesses. Commercial rates were 58% higher than the national average last year, according to an August report from the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which also points to one of the reasons why: Namely, the state imports all of its natural gas, having no reserves or means of production.
