Royal Mail is set to drop out of London's leading share index in the next quarterly reshuffle.Shares in the postal services group, which this month said that it expected its profits to fall in 2022 as a result of slowing demand, have fallen by more than 43 per cent over the past year, putting it at risk of being demoted from the FTSE 100 index.ITV, the broadcaster, is also facing demotion from the Footsie, while Centrica, which owns British Gas, and Johnson Matthey, the chemicals group, are set to be promoted from the midcap FTSE 250 to the top 100.
