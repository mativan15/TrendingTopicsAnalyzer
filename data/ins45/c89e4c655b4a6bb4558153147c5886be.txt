In-helmet communications systems - I call them 'comms' - are gaining in popularity among many motorcycle riders. Recently, I installed Cardo's top-of-the-line system, the Packtalk Edge, in Bell's MX-9 Adventure MIPS dual-sport helmet and used it on several long trips. I've been using Cardo's similar but older Bold comms system in a street helmet for a couple of years now, so I was familiar with the Edge's basic operational systems and features since they are very similar to the Bold's.
