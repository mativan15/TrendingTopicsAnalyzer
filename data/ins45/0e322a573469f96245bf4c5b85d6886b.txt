Published: 10:29 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 10:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 Distillers, brewers and pubs have said the Government's decision to scrap plans to freeze alcohol duty is a 'huge blow' amid pressure from soaring costs and softer consumer sentiment. New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed on Monday that the Government will reverse a raft of tax cuts promised by predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng in the mini-budget last month. This included a commitment to freezing alcohol duty, which was due to come into force in February 2023.
