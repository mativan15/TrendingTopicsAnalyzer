 A Montreal man wanted on a Canada-wide warrant was picked up by Mounties Friday morning after the person he was with engaged in a series of attention-piquing acts.
It was around 2:35 a.m. Friday when RCMP said a man first got their attention by standing at the driver's side window and chatting with the driver of a truck that was blocking traffic on Bernard Avenue.'After the truck drove away the (man) got into the driver's seat of a black Jaguar with an Ontario license plate and drove away without headlights,' Kelowna RCMP said in a press release.
