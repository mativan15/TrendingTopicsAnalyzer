For the second consecutive year, Patriot Golf Days are returning for Memorial Day weekend. What's PGD you may ask? Well, it's a fantastic opportunity to thank our nation's heroes with the game of golf.

PGA REACH, and Folds of Honor, a nonprofit that provides educational scholarships to spouses and children of fallen or disabled service members, co-host the nationwide fundraiser that started in 2007. PGA members across the country are playing a huge part this year, too.

PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) introduces golf to veterans to enhance their physical, mental, social, and emotional well-being.
