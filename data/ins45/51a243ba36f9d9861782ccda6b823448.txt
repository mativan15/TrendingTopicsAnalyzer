Galeanu Mihai The Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (NYSEARCA:VT) provides a low-cost way to invest in leading global companies. Although it delivers respectable standalone returns, structurally, the U.S. market continues to outperform the rest of the world at the moment. Without catalysts, I would recommend investors stick with Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) as their core equity exposure. Fund Overview The Vanguard Total World Stock ETF gives investors a low-cost method to invest in both U.S. and foreign stocks.
