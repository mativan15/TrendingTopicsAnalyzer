By Will Feuer American depositary shares tied to Zhangmen Education Inc. will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and trading of the ADRs has been suspended, the exchange said. The NYSE said its staff decided to delist Zhangmen Education's ADSs because the company failed to keep its average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30-trading-day period above $15 million. Zhangmen Education has a right to review the NYSE's determination and could appeal the staff's decision. The NYSE said it will apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the ADSs.
