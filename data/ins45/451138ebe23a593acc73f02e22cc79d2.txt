By Gireesh ShrimaliClean hydrogen will play in key role in net-zero transitionsIn a previous article we examined the clean – blue and green – hydrogen opportunity [1]. Our key assertions were as follows.First, clean hydrogen may play a role in decarbonizing many of the sectors that have historically been hard to decarbonize, such as long-distance and heavy duty transportation, shipping, district heating, seasonal energy storage, and heavy industry [2]. In addition, clean hydrogen can play a key role accelerating renewable energy integration; distributing energy across sectors; and acting as resilience buffer [3].
