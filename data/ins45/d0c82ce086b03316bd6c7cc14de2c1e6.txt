Three quarters into 2022 and it seems this year is bringing as much change as the two prior years.

But I feel like there's much more positivity now than there had been in the early days of the pandemic. Nationally and globally, there are still things to worry about — inflation and economy, war in Europe, disrupted supply chains and looming elections and the ugliness that tends to bring out of people. But locally, it does feel as if Louisville has turned a corner thanks to increased activity in Downtown Louisville and the return of major economic events such as Bourbon & Beyond.
