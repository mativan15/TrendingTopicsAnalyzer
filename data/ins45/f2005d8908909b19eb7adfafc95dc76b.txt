President Joe Biden does not support 'hardening schools' against potential school shooters following the massacre at a Texas elementary school last week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday.
'I know there's been conversation about hardening schools, that is not something he believes in,' Jean-Pierre told reporters at a White House press conference. 'He believes that we should be able to give teachers the resources to be able to do their job.'
Jean-Pierre's comments came as Biden has promised to meet with congressional leaders about possible bipartisan legislation to address gun violence after an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 students and two adults in the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde.
