Without India, a discussion on monopolies and how they impact the availability, supply, and access of medicines, vaccines, and other essential medical products rarely happens. The country — a key manufacturer and actor in global supply chains — plays a pivotal role in international negotiations at the World Health Assembly and the World Trade Organization.India did this early in the pandemic.
