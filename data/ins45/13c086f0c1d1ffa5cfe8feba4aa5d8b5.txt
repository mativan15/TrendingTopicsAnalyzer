ST. PAUL, Minn. -- — Colorado's stars have picked up where they left off last season, even with the captain sidelined. The defending champion Avalanche are a lot to defend, a vital trait that has so far eluded the division rival Minnesota Wild. Mikko Rantanen scored the go-ahead goal midway through the second period and Nathan Mackinnon and Valeri Nichushkin each had a goal and two assists for the Avalanche, who beat Minnesota 6-3 on Monday night to keep the Wild winless. Ben Meyers and Samuel Girard scored in the first period for the Avalanche to put the first start for Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson with his new team in immediate trouble.
