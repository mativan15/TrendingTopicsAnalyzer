Matt Harmon kicks off the show with the late-breaking news that the Carolina Panthers have traded star RB Christian McCaffrey to the San Francisco 49ers.

After that, we dig into the meat of the show, where Matt is joined by Andy Behrens and Dalton Del Don to preview all of the Sunday and Monday games for week 7 in the NFL.

The guys predict that the week's best fantasy RB performance would come from the Chargers/Seahawks game, whether that's from Austin Ekeler or Ken Walker, and discuss how the Baltimore Ravens offense will change when Rashod Bateman returns from injury.
