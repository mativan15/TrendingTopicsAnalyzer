Browne floored highly-rated New Zealander Junior Fa with a huge right hand and, while his rival was allowed to continue, another big blow finished him off one minute and 58 seconds into the heavyweight fight. Known as Big Daddy, Browne yelled "Better than ever!" to the swelling Marvel Stadium crowd after the bout.
