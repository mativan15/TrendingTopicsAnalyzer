Kanye West, recently put in a penalty box on Instagram and Twitter after posting antisemitic comments to both platforms, made a 44-minute appearance on the podcast Drink Champs to prove he is eager to continue spreading conspiracy theories of a kind that have existed for centuries.In this clip, you can see Kanye discussing 'Jewish business secrets,' and perpetuating the notion of Jews controlling the media, both central tenets of the antisemitic tract The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
