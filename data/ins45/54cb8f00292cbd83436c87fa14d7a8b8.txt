When former All Black John Kirwan sat down to write his autobiography he realised he did not own the copyright to many images of himself during his playing days. The realisation is a common one for many ex-sporting stars, and a reason why many are becoming interested in NFT technology, Kirwan​ says. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of computer code used to prove ownership of a digital item such as a picture or audio file. Something non-fungible is unique, like a signed album or an original artwork.
