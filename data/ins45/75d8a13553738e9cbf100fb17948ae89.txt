Japan is planning to export to India stealth antennas, a system that is already equipped on a new Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer, as the two countries strengthen security cooperation, government sources said Saturday.
If realized, it would be the first export case under a Japan-India agreement on defense equipment and technology transfer signed in 2015. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software. Please add japantimes.co.jp and piano.io to your list of allowed sites.
