The dementia drugs market is expected to expand due to the rising prevalence of dementia and neurological disorders, such as vascular dementia, along with the rise in healthcare expenditure by the government for promoting research and development activities and partnerships between the key players to facilitate drug development. In addition, factors such as the increasing approval of various drugs for dementia and the rising geriatric population will play a crucial role in establishing an upward growth trend in the dementia drugs market during the forecast period from 2022 to 2027.
