Peruvian Connection is embarking on its first major product collaboration since its founding in 1976.

With a little glitz and glamor, the artisan apparel company has launched the PC x GB collection, which features 74 items ranging from $88 to $3,800. Peruvian Connection is an international, multichannel retailer of original design luxury fiber knit and woven women's apparel.

On Thursday, the Tonganoxie-based company's private cocktail party brought out high-profile guests like actress Demi Moore and actor Alan Cumming.
