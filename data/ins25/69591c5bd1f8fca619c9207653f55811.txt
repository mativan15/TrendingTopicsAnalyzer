India should consider taxing passenger vehicles based on emissions rather than length and engine size of vehicles, for a cleaner environment, Nissan Motor India MD Rakesh Srivastava said on Tuesday. Nissan, which is looking to drive in its global sports utility vehicles, including X-Trail into the Indian market to strengthen its presence in the country, said multiple technologies such as hybrids must also be considered to curb air pollution through automobiles.
