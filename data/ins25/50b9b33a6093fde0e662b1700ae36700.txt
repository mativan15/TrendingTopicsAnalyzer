TUCSON, AZ — Tucson police are asking for the public's help in identifying and finding a man who crashed a stolen truck into a Circle K store on April 22, then robbed the store and fled, police said. After ramming the truck into the doors of the locked building at 1909 S. Craycroft Road early that morning, the man stole merchandise, a cash register and an employee's purse, according to police. It's estimated that the driver caused around $10,000 in damage to the business. He then left the scene, but police later found the truck abandoned nearby after the driver apparently crashed into another vehicle.
