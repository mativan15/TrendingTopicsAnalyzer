CHANDLER, Ariz., Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —  Wireless connectivity has become a mandatory feature for many products but often increases the cost and complexity of system design since it generally must be added as part of the larger application. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP) is introducing its first Arm Cortex®-M4F-based PIC microcontroller (MCU) family today that solves this wireless connectivity design challenge by integrating Bluetooth Low Energy functionality directly into one of a system's most basic components, supported by one of the industry's most comprehensive developer ecosystems.
