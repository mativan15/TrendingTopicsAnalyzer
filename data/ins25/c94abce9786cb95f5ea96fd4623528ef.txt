Paterson said the Greens faced 'a real test' over whether they would send the matter to the National Anti-Corruption Commission when it is operational next year.Under the government's legislation before parliament, the NACC will have 'broad jurisdiction to investigate serious or systemic corruption, including criminal and non-criminal conduct and conduct that occurred before it was established'.This will include the power to investigate MPs, and any person will be able to refer a corruption complaint to the commission, or it can decide to conduct an investigation on its own motion.
