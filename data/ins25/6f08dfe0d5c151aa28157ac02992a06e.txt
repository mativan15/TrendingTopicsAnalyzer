Snap Inc.'s stock dropped sharply Friday as Wall Street took a hard look at the company's latest string of disappointing news, which has the potential to rattle the broader internet sector as well.Shares of the Snapchat parent SNAP, -30.17% were off more than 30% in morning trading Friday following the company's latest earnings report, but sharp stock moves have become familiar to Snap investors this year. Should the current declines carry through to the close, Snap shares would log their worst single-day percentage drop since July 22, when they lost 39%.
