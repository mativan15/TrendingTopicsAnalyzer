Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management has had quite a 2022. In August, the B-school's dean, Mark Nelson, announced that he would step down at the end of the school year. The next month the school released its MBA class profile showing a 20% year-over-year growth in applications — a feat that became more astonishing as, one by one, each peer school posted app volume losses. Among the top 25 U.S. B-schools, only two others this fall — UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School and USC Marshall School of Business — have reported app growth in the 2021-2022 cycle.
