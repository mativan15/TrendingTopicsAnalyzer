Sin Cars Industry AD, a Bulgarian maker of racing cars, may sell shares in Amsterdam in two years to bolster a push into electric vehicles as it deals with rising restrictions on traditional motor sports.

Sin Cars, which makes models that compete in the GT4 championship, this week started a €8 million ($7.9 million) capital increase on the Bulgarian stock exchange to fund production of the L-City, its multi-purpose EV for urban chores. The manufacturer plans to build a factory in Romania and may raise at least €100 million via an Amsterdam listing in late 2024, said founder and majority owner Rosen Daskalov.
