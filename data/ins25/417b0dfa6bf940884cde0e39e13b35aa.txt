Sitting at 1-4 is not ideal. And though five games leaves a lot of season still to go, it is the bye week so let's check in on the Ballers & Busters thus far and see how the Raiders got here.

Ballers

RB Josh Jacobs

Four time since this season Jacobs has been a Baller and twice a Top Baller. He has set new career highs in each of the past two games, first running for 144 yards and then for 154 yards. He has averaged nearly 100 yards per game so far, putting him on pace for over 1600 yards this season.
