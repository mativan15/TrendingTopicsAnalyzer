Manish Sisodia (File photo)New Delhi: Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday called for adopting the Delhi electricity model across the country, observing that focus should be on providing affordable or free supply to people, an official statement said. Participating in the state power ministers' meet at Udaipur, Sisodia said making electricity prices flexible like that of petrol and diesel will prove to be harmful for the people and power tariff will never come under control, it said. "If the electricity rates fluctuate on the basis of prices of other commodities in the market, this step of the central government can prove to be dangerous and all the burden will come on the common people," the statement quoting Sisodia said.
