Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has more than doubled his spending on California's Proposition 31, a measure that would ban in-person sales of flavored tobacco products.

On Thursday of last week, campaign finance records reviewed by SFGATE showed that of the $17.3 million raised by the "yes" on Prop. 31 committee, $15.3 million had come from Bloomberg, a billionaire and former presidential candidate. Because the "no" committee had raised just $2.1 million, it meant that Bloomberg had spent 79% of the money in the race.
