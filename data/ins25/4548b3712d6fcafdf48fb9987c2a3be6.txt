Howard Stern lashed out at Kanye West during the Oct. 19 episode of his SiriusXM radio show (via Mediaite). West has courted controversy in recent weeks for making antisemitic statements, most recently in an interview with Chris Cuomo where the rapper cited the 'Jewish underground media mafia.' Stern compared West to Hitler and criticized his defenders who cite mental health issues as the source of West's antisemitic behavior. 'I almost don't want to give any energy to this Kanye West character,' Stern said.
