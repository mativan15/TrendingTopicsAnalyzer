The eagerly anticipated Sky Stream puck has finally gone on sale today, enabling UK consumers to stream Sky's services into any TV they like without needing a satellite dish. The strikingly small Sky Stream puck can be ordered now on a next day delivery basis for a £39.95 set up fee (which drops to £20 if you take an 18-month contract), and once it arrives you just need to plug it in, hook it up to your TV via its HDMI port, and connect it to your broadband. Unlike Sky Q or Sky Glass there's no need for an installation team to come to your door.
