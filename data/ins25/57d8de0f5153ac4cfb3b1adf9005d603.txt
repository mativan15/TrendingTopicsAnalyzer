In Russellville, Alabama, more than half of the 2,500 students in the city's small school district identify as Hispanic or Latino, and about a quarter are English language learners, or EL students. The district at times has struggled to find the people and funding necessary to help EL students achieve. It typically takes five years of intensive, small-group instruction, on top of regular classes, to help a student learn English and perform well in a regular classroom. The advice to educators is clear: Don't use pandemic funds, which will run out, for salaries.
