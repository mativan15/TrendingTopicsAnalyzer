Fifteen minutes after entering her hotel suite I find myself standing on one leg beside Trinny Woodall in the bathroom trying not to headbutt the basin as I massage my face. I have also fallen a little in love.No safe word is required. I am willingly subjecting myself to a skincare regime with the product range Trinny London, launched in 2017 by the former fashion advice guru of television's What Not To Wear . I am also praying that the one-legged part of the routine is to strengthen my core and not a Brit in-joke, like Monty Python or how to pronounce 'Belvoir'.
