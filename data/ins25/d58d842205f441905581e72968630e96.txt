Kelly Rowland has recalled a not-so-golden moment in which she was scolded by Tina Knowles – AKA Beyonce's mum – over what she'd dubbed a ‘bad parenting moment'.
The 41-year-old pop star shares two children, Titan, seven, and 21-month old Noah, with her husband Tim Weatherspoon, and has conceded there have been decisions she's made that Tina hasn't looked so kindly upon.
Such as taking her eldest to a horror film.
Kelly joked it was a move which led her former Destiny's Child bandmate Beyonce's mum to question her actions, after she took him to her new comedy horror film The Curse of Bridge Hollow, in which she stars alongside Marlon Wayans.
