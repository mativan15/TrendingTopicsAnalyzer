Amazon rallied 3.1% and Apple added 1.7%.Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, 10 rose, led by Consumer Discretionary, up 3.03%, followed by a 2.69% gain in Materials. US stocks recovered from a drop earlier in the day after Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said she backs at least a couple more half percentage point interest rate hikes, and sees little case for pausing rate hikes in September if price pressures fail to cool.
