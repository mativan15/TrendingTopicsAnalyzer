Former President Donald Trump's political committees raised about $24 million in the last three months, an eye-popping sum to be sure. But an analysis of his filings shows that the embattled ex-president also spent more than $37 million over the same period, coming out with a net loss of around $13 million.In real terms, Trump's fundraising last quarter was actually something closer to $3.6 million—that's how much he actually raised for his two main committees, which he can use for things like political activity, events, legal fees, and enriching his businesses.
