Despite shaky markets, a steady stream of investors continue writing big checks for blockchain infrastructure providers.

InfStones, which aims to help clients build applications across a number of blockchain platforms, closed a $66 million round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and GGV Capital, the company announced on Wednesday.

Other investors in the raise include INCE Capital, 10T Fund, SNZ Holding and A&T Capital. This funding round follows shortly after its $33 million Series B three months ago and brings its total funding to $111 million.
