It appears Mexican Pizza is off the Taco Bell menu. Again.Weeks after bringing back the beloved item, Taco Bell said it's temporarily removing Mexican Pizza from its menu until the fall because of high demand.Taco Bell cited one restaurant in California which sold more than 1,000 Mexican Pizzas in one day, and an order from a customer which included 180 Mexican Pizzas."While we're currently selling out, for now, we're working diligently with our restaurants and suppliers to get more back in the hands and stomachs of our biggest fans by this fall," said the fast food chain in a letter to fans Tuesday.
