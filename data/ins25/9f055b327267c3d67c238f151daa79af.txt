Central American countries have shifted their voting records on United Nations resolutions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine during the past months, underscoring their complex relationships with global superpowers and each other, according to analysts.
Nicaragua was one of only five countries to vote against a UN resolution last week calling for non-recognition and a reversal of Russia's 'attempted illegal annexation' of four regions in Ukraine. Russia, Belarus, Syria and North Korea also voted against the resolution.
