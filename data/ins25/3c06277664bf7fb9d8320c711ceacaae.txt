Online shopping networks have been around for decades, with HSN and QVC holding their own as two of the top competitors in the space. What's now known as HSN debuted in 1982 as HSC. In 1985, the network changed its name to HSN. About a year later, in 1986, QVC began broadcasting its home shopping network on TV. While QVC and HSN have long competed in the home shopping industry, QVC came out on top in 2018 when it bought HSN for $2.1 billion. However, the two still function as separate brands.
