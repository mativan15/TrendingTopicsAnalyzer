AgenciesThe word-guessing game Quordle came up with new challenges for its users on May 29. If you are a new player in this Quordle's arena, then, to give you a heads up, it is a word-guessing game similar to the New York Times-owned game Wordle that has become a global hit.

On the other hand, Quordle asks participants to correctly guess four 5-letter words at once in only nine attempts.
