Shares of beverage company Celsius Holdings (CELH 7.43%) are up roughly 2,500% over just the past three years. The stock skyrocketed from less than $4 per share before the COVID-19 pandemic, landing where it trades today at over $85 per share. During the furious stock market rally of 2020 and 2021, stocks often jumped this much. But many gave back their gains, making Celsius stock a rare exception.
Investors may think it's too late to buy Celsius stock considering that it's already up so much. But management believes its growth story is far from over, in part thanks to its recent partnership with PepsiCo.
