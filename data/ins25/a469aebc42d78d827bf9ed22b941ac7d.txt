Apple has a few different models of the iPad, but the iPad Pro line is by far its most advanced. Its high-tech hardware lets it compete with some lower-level laptops. It's sleek and versatile, but also quite pricey -- a problem that's not helped by the fact that Apple almost never drops the price on its products directly. With the impending release of the iPad Pro M2, if you're looking to snag one of these powerful tablets for less, your best bet is to opt for a previous generation. They're not very easy to track down new, but right now, Woot has a selection of factory reconditioned models that you can pick up at a significant discount.
