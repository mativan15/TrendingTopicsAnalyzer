(Bloomberg) -- Janet Yellen, worried by the specter of inflation, initially urged Biden administration officials to scale back the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan by a third, according to an advance copy of a biography on the Treasury secretary.'Privately, Yellen agreed with Summers that too much government money was flowing into the economy too quickly,' writes Owen Ullmann, the book's author and a veteran Washington journalist, referring to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who severely criticized the size of the aid plan.
