Motorola has teased what appears to be a rollable smartphone that changes size with a press of a button. The company briefly demoed the device at Lenovo Tech World. With a press of a button, the screen of the smartphone expands and contracts.
The phone uses a flexible OLED display, measuring 6.5-inches when extended and becomes 'just over' 4-inches when retracts to its original form with a click of a button. The device is actually packable at 4-inches high. What is also interesting about this concept phone is that the content on the screen adapts to the size, which includes the home screen and video.
