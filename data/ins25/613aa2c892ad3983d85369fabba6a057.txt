Sarah Jessica Parker wants to make one thing clear — there's no 'catfight' going on between her and her former 'Sex and the City' co-star, Kim Cattrall.There's no fight at all, the star says of the rift between them. That's because, according to her, it's been too one-sided to even qualify as any kind of back-and-forth. At least, until now. In a new interview, the 57-year-old has spoken out at length for the first time about Cattrall's very public split with 'Sex and the City' and with Parker herself.
