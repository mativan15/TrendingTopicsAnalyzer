Good morning,This afternoon Liz Truss will take to her feet in the House of Commons for only her third Prime Minister's Questions. She does so under excruciating pressure after a dizzying series of U-turns and a 'lengthy discussion' (a row) with her cabinet on Tuesday about NHS and defence spending.There is temporary relief from market pressure, but she is now struggling to maintain anything like cohesion within her government. There is open talk of resignations from cabinet as budget cuts rear into view.
