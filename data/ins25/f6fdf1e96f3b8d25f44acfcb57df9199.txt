Asda's chairman has described a government consultation seeking to bring back imperial measurements to shops across Britain as "complete and utter nonsense".The supermarket's chairman and Tory peer Lord Rose said the consultation, which launches on Friday, would only please a "small minority who hark for the past".
In 2000, the European Union weights and measures directive forced UK traders to use metric when selling packaged or loose goods such as fruit and veg.They can still use pounds and ounces but must also list grams and kilos, except for a few items.
