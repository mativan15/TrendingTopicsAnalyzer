Double-digit inflation rates in Europe have clipped early market sentiment Wednesday, but solid earnings could keep Wall Street's two-day rally on the rails.

U.S. equity futures edged modestly higher Wednesday, with stocks looking to extend their two-day rally in the face of another set of disappointing U.K. inflation data that clipped investor sentiment and pushed the dollar higher against its global peers.

Britain's September inflation rate jumped to a fresh 40-year high of 10.1% last month, official figures indicated Wednesday, in a move that is likely to trigger faster and deeper rate hikes from the Bank of England.
