Warning: This post contains spoilers for the penultimate episode of season 1 of House of the Dragon.
 
The king is dead — seriously, this time. King Viserys I (Paddy Considine) bought the farm in the last episode of House of the Dragon, and the scene was set in this week's episode — titled "The Green Council" — for all hell to break loose concerning his succession.
 
The penultimate episode for the first season of HBO's Game of Thrones prequel series opens with Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and Hand of the King Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) discovering Viserys died.
