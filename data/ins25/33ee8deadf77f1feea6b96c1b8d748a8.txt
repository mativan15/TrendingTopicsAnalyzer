Trojans Wire talked to Ducks Wire and editor Zachary Neel about Pac-12 midseason awards, impressions, and storylines.

Here's our big Pac-12 surprise, as told to Ducks Wire:

There are lots of big surprises in the conference. I didn't think Utah would lose twice in the first six weeks. I didn't expect Arizona to win at San Diego State, but the Aztecs' offense is as bad as Iowa's offense, which is really saying something.

Bo Nix, I have to admit, has greatly exceeded my expectations. I was not high on him and was not shy about saying so.
