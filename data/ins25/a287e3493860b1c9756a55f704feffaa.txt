Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (BYDDY -2.03%) is reportedly in talks to buy six lithium mines in Africa, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The news agency said that it had not verified the story, which it sourced from the Chinese government-backed The Paper. 
Before we dive into this topic, investors should know that investing legend Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a big stake in BYD. That fact alone would seem to make BYD stock well worth putting on your watch list.
