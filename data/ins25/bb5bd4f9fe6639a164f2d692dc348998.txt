A humidifier can be a big investment, so you want to make sure you're buying right and that you'd actually benefit from it.
The good news is, there are health gains that come form owning one.
Abbas Kanani, a health adviser for Chemist Click, says: ‘Using a humidifier whilst you sleep in summer is recommended as air-conditioned air can actually dry out your sinuses, throat and nasal passages.
‘This can promote irritation, swelling, inflammation and a general feeling of being unwell. 
‘This can then leave you to feel slightly under the weather the next day.
