When Hurricane Charley hit Punta Gorda, Fla., with 145 mph winds in 2004, the storm demolished Diane Caputo's restaurant, Monty's. It took her more than three years to reopen at the original location. When Hurricane Ian made landfall last month at similar strength, Monty's fared much better.

'I have an outdoor bar patio that took a pretty bad hit, we have water in here and we've been cleaning up ever since Ian passed,' Caputo says. But, within a week, she was able to reopen the Italian eatery, which has been a Punta Gorda fixture since 1983.
