Living in Kyiv, Ukraine, during wartime, Valerii Veduta has become accustomed to the daily sounds of airstrike alerts and the sight of tanks and rocket launchers. The artist, however, has what he calls his own "weapon of choice": photography. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, he's been documenting his family's life through a photographic diary shot with a large-format film camera and a tripod. He processes the photos in his bathroom using Ukrainian soil as a pigment to give them a dreamlike, almost nostalgic feel.
