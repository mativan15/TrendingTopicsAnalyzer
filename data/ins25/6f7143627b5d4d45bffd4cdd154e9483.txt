Long before marrying China's most powerful man, Peng Liyuan already knew what kind of husband she was after. In a 1999 interview with a Hong Kong talk show, the famous folk singer said she wanted a man who was "successful, ambitious and bossy in relationship".And when asked if her husband Xi Jinping — who was still far away from the pinnacle of China's leadership — met her requirement, Peng didn't hesitate. "I've been married to him for over a decade, of course he's successful," she said.Peng's faith in her husband's future turned out to be right.
