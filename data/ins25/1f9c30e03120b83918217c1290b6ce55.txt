Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has hit out at what he called the "grotesque chaos" of chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's sacking, as he accused Liz Truss of putting "party first and country second".Giving a speech in Barnsley after a day of upheaval in Westminster, Sir Keir said the damage caused by last month's mini-budget was "unprecedented" as he repeated calls for a general election.
He pointed to the "grotesque chaos of a Tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor".Politics live: New chancellor warns of 'tough decisions' over tax"This lot," Sir Keir said.
