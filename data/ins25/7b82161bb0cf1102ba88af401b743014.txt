A Wisconsin judge has dismissed a lawsuit from a conservative legal group arguing that an elections assistance grant, partially funded by Facebook, amounted to bribery.Dane County Circuit Court Judge Stephen Ehlke on Wednesday threw out the challenge from Erick Kaardal, a lawyer for the Thomas More Society. The lawsuit took issue with a grant from the Chicago-based Center for Tech and Civic Life to help the city of Madison, a Democratic stronghold in a key swing state, conduct its election during the pandemic.
