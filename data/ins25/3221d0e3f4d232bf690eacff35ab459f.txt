Anthony Joshua could be forced to wait another two weeks to face Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight world title rematch. The pair first met for the belts back in September, and even though Joshua almost immediately invoked his rematch clause, the fight has yet to happen. The war in Ukraine pushed Usyk away from the sport for some time, but he has left the frontlines and now is laser-focused on defending his belts against the Brit. Saudi Arabia is going to host the mega-money fight, with Joshua and Usyk both expected to make tens of millions for their participation.
