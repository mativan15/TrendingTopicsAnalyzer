Rundown Victorian prisons raise an escape risk as prisoners are able to remove cell windows with their bare hands, a watchdog has revealed.

The Victorian brickwork is so dilapidated that prisoners are creating holes in their cell walls by scraping, banging or scratching, according to the watchdog report on Winchester prison which dates back to 1846.

'One C wing prisoner managed to remove the whole of his window,' said the report by the prison's independent monitoring board (IMB).
