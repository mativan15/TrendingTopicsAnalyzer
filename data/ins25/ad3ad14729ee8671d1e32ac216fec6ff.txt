Foreign Minister Penny Wong says Australia continues to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite the government scrubbing a reference to the highly contested issue from a government website.

Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham accused the government of sending out confusing messages on a sensitive topic, saying Labor was 'hiding from its own policy on Israel'.

When former prime minister Scott Morrison recognised West Jerusalem in 2018, Labor decried the decision as 'risky' and vowed to unwind it if elected.
