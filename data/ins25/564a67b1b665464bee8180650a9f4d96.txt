Behind the scenes, however, it appears there may have been a conflict of interest in how Fixler's claims were investigated. 
While PwC was brought in to examine Fixler's accusations, the accountancy firm did not contact her and concluded its report based solely on data collected from DWS, reported the Financial Times. In a separate matter, the 'Big Four' firm received €300,000 for consulting DWS on its net-zero strategy while setting up its probe.  
Controversially, outgoing chief executive Woehrmann fired Fixler in March 2021 on the basis that her division had not made sufficient progress toward the asset manager's green investment goals.
