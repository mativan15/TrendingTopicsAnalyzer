'The elephant in the room here is capital controls,' says Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank. 'Hundreds of foreign firms said that they're pulling out of Russia, because of this war – I'm sure a lot of them would sell assets if they could.'

'They're fine with people fleeing Russia, but money's more important to them,' according to the European bank economist.
