Businesses will benefit from a further discount

Almost 850 businesses have received up to an extra £2,519 business rates rebate as part of the Mayor's Covid Additional Relief Fund and a commitment to support businesses still dealing with the on-going impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Previously businesses identified as eligible for the scheme were awarded a 100% business rate discount capped at £15,000 per property. This has now been extended to be capped at £17,519 to use the remaining budget of the fund.
