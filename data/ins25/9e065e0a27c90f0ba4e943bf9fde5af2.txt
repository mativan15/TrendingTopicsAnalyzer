The Giants trailed, 20-10, early in the fourth quarter Sunday when Saquon Barkley ripped off an 8-yard run, which is modest, by his standards, but ended up being his longest run of the game. 
Barkley was slammed to the turf on the play and went to the sideline, paced for a bit and then nearly doubled over, looking as if he had tweaked the sore shoulder he left London with last week in the victory over the Packers. 
Barkley was not out for long. He ran for 3 yards, and on the next play, Daniel Jones hit rookie tight end Daniel Bellinger on an 8-yard touchdown hookup.
