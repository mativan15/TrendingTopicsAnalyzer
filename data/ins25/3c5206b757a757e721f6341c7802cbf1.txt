'Potentially hazardous' asteroid Phaethon's rotational period is decreasing by 4 milliseconds per year. It's the 11th known asteroid to show a change in its spinning period.
 The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is planning to launch its DESTINY+ mission to fly by the near-Earth asteroid Phaethon in 2024. The spacecraft aims to fly by the space rock in 2028. However, scientists have detected a shocking fact about the "potentially hazardous" asteroid's speeding spin. According to the recent study led by a team of researchers, the asteroid's rotational period is decreasing by 4 milliseconds per year.
