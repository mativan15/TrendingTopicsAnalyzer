FILIPINOS' positive experiences with online transactions have led to the increase in the purchases of insurance and investment products, a recent study of an insurance firm showed.



The new study, 'The Modern Filipino Family: Exploring family dynamics and digitalization in the new normal,' by Manulife Philippines showed that most Filipinos recognize the convenience (45 percent), sense of security (22 percent) and protection (17 percent) that buying insurance online offers.



In the past 12 months, 25 percent of Generation X (those born between mid-60s and early-80s) and 33 percent of millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) bought insurance products online, while 41 percent of Generation Z (those born from 1997 to 2012) intend to purchase insurance products in the next 12 months.
