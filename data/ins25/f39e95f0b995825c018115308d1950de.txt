Hundreds of large privately-owned companies will escape tougher corporate governance requirements under watered-down government plans to reform the audit profession in the wake of scandals at Carillion and BHS.

Sky News has learnt that ministers will this week publish their long-awaited response to a consultation on the future of auditors and boardroom governance.

Insiders said the plans, which are expected to be unveiled on Tuesday, would increase the threshold for companies to become defined as public interest entities (PIEs), which carry enhanced disclosures requirements and fall under the remit of the audit regulator.
