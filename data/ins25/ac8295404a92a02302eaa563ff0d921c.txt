THE Honorable James E. Watson, Senator from Indiana, is one of the most colorful characters on the American political stage, upon which he has strutted for a great many years. He has represented his state in the Senate since 1916. Twice he has aspired to the Presidency — once covertly in 1920, once openly in 1928. His name was presented for the Vice Presidential nomination at the 1924 convention of his party, and he is now the Republican leader of the Senate. It can hardly be denied that these things make him a national figure.
