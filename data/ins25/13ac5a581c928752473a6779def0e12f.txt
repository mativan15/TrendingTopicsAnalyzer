alvinburrows/E+ via Getty Images Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) has been underperforming for a while, and we expect it to continue due to a lack of value creation opportunities for investors. However, based on our valuation assessment, we think the stock can potentially return 75% from current levels should it see significant M&A interest from a financial buyer. If the management continues on course, we see value emerging in the stock closer to $20 levels. Business Open Text is a provider of information management software and associated services.
