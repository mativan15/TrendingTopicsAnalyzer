The policies that informed the abandoned Budget were not called Kwasinomics. Nor did they go by the name of Philponomy. To advocates and sceptics alike, they were known as Trussonomics. Yet while Kwasi Kwarteng and Chris Philp have been relieved of their duties in the Treasury, the true author of the disastrous experiment – the Prime Minister – remains in Number Ten.
Liz Truss has sacked her Chancellor, accepted the critique of her leadership rival, Rishi Sunak, and abandoned her policies. She has replaced Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, who promises an entirely different fiscal prospectus, and in so doing has made Hunt the most powerful figure in Whitehall.
