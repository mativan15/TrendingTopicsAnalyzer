When developer Michael Van Every began construction on the new offices of Republic Urban Properties in downtown Willow Glen early last year, he said he wanted the mixed-use building to be something special.
Willow Glen Neighborhood Association (WGNA) member Mary Kenter Fox was also looking to create something special on Lincoln Avenue. Fox proposed a community clock to serve as a landmark for the neighborhood.
At the suggestion of Brian Yi, Republic's director of investments and a WGNA board member, an LED clock, 7 feet in diameter, was installed on the 50-foot tower of the developer's new offices at 1098 Lincoln Ave.
