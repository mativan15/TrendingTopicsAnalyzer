Despite the steep price of gasoline, millions of Americans are expected to head out this holiday weekend. More than 39 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home on Memorial Day Weekend, an increase of over 8% compared to last year, according to AAA.

The cost of filling up the tank is at record-high prices. Nationwide, AAA reports a gallon of regular gas costs an average of $4.60.

AAA Spokesperson Andrew Gross told CBS News' Michael George that Americans are on the road again and are choosing to head right into the glare of higher costs.
