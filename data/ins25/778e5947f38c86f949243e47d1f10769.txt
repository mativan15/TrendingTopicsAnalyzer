Unless you're worried about getting struck by lightning, being out in an open field used to be your best bet to avoid ticks.

Now the open field is fair game.

In 2017, the Asian longhorned tick was discovered in the United States. Dr. David Gaines, state public health entomologist at Virginia Department of Health, thinks that it's been here for more than a decade.

'This new tick is found both in the woods and in open fields ... found in both habitats,' warned Gaines.

There are 17 species of ticks in Virginia, and each one has a different habitat.
