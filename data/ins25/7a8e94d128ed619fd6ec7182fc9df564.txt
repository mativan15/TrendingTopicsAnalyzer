SpaceX's Starlink signals have been long seen as a possible alternative to GPS.

In 2020, Elon Musk and SpaceX declined a US Army proposal to develop the tech for that purpose.

Researchers have succeeded in reverse-engineering the signals, MIT Technology Review reported.

After SpaceX declined to continue researching Starlink as a possible military alternative to GPS in 2020, a group of researchers found a way to do it without the help of Elon Musk — or his company that created the constellation of internet satellites.
