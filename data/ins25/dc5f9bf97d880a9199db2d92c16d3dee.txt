When a company tells me it's found a way to not only create a new form of public transport, but also make it financially viable without city funding, I'm skeptical.
Silicon Valley company Glydways wants to turn conventional mass public transport on its head, by introducing small, electric automated vehicles or 'pod cars' that can carry four people and operate on a network of specially built guideways. They run on-demand (instead of on a timetable) and travel point-to-point with no stops in between.
