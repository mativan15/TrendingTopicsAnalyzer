Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has defended his players after they confronted the referee during Sunday's goalless draw against Newcastle United, saying the reaction was not too strong despite the club being charged by the Football Association.
The FA charged United on Tuesday for failing to control their players, who surrounded referee Craig Pawson after he disallowed a goal by Cristiano Ronaldo in the Premier League clash at Old Trafford.
Ronaldo claimed Newcastle had taken a free kick before he raced to take the ball away from goalkeeper Nick Pope and slotted it into an empty net, but Pawson disallowed the effort and booked the Portuguese forward as he led the players' reaction.
