Cath Cardiff has been with arts funding entity Creative New Zealand for 22 years, most recently as senior manager of arts development services, having a leading say in which organisations and artists receive money. She leaves her role in August. What part of Wellington do you live in, and why? CC: I live in Thorndon which is the very best suburb of Wellington – so beautiful with all the old buildings and the Botanic Garden, plus 10 minutes' walk to the city and waterfront. I went to school in this suburb many years ago and when I came back it was like coming home.
