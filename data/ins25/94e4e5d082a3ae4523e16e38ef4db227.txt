LONDON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The dollar hit the symbolic level of 150 yen for the first time since 1990 on Thursday as the greenback was supported by Treasury yields trading at multi-year highs, keeping markets on high alert for intervention from Japanese authorities.

Moves among other major currencies were muted by recent standards. The euro up 0.5% at $0.9826, regaining a little of the ground it lost during a dollar surge the day before, while turmoil in British politics meant sterling stayed soft.
