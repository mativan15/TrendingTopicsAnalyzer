Ayro Inc. CEO Tom Wittenschlaeger can't help but feel great.

Five years after the Round Rock-based electric vehicle company was launched, Ayro executives are gearing up for what they call its "next phase." That involves next-generation EV technology and a shift to handling all engineering and production at its headquarters north of Austin.

The new course is represented by the Oct. 18 launch of its new low-speed model, the Ayro Vanish. Leaders hope it captures part of a multibillion-dollar market that has no clear-cut leader.
