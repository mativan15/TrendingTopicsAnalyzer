Labour peers are to step up their campaign to stop the 'reckless' Northern Ireland protocol bill being passed with demands for more than 20 changes.Jenny Chapman, the shadow cabinet minister in the Lords, told the Guardian the bill was 'an abomination, undermining the UK's hard-won reputation as a responsible, trustworthy partner' and called on the government to 'scrap this reckless legislation'.When the committee stage begins in the Lords on Tuesday, Labour peers will put the government on notice that the bill will not proceed to the next stage until a variety of conditions are met.
