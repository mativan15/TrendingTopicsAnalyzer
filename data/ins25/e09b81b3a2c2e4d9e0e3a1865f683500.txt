For the most part, I've stopped riding the scariest roller coasters.I used to like the exhilaration of the climb and the emotional high of screaming as the ride plunged down and around curves at hair-raising high speeds. But then I started to get headaches from the tension of anticipating the stomach-churning steep drops.
