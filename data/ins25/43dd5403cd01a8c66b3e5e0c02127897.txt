During the COVID-19 pandemic, India and the US played a critical role in supporting each other, New Delhi's top envoy in Washington Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said. Over the last two years, there has been a tremendous challenge due to the disruption in global supply chains and like the US, India has also been affected, he said in his address to the Indiana Economic Summit in Indianapolis. However, through careful policies and a concerted focus on rebuilding their capabilities, they have managed to emerge from the pandemic stronger, Sandhu said this week.
