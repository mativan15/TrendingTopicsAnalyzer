Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan warned social media companies and other digital advertisers that the agency is considering new rules to protect American children from 'stealth' digital advertising that is 'designed to exploit [their] insecurities for commercial gain' during a virtual event on the topic Wednesday. Khan said that 'privacy, psychological, physical, economic and other harms…can arise from predatory advertising directed at children,' and the event convened experts to discuss what new rules on advertising found on social media, online games and virtual reality could mitigate those harms.
