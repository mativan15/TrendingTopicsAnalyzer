Culture is making a comeback with the return of the SubZERO festival in downtown San Jose this weekend. It's been three years since the DIY indie arts and music fest filled South First Street with sights and sounds, but organizer Cherri Lakey of Anno Domini gallery and Twofish Design says nobody should think the scene ever went away.
'San Jose is not a cultural wasteland,' she said. 'The artists and performers are here. Perhaps a bit underground from working two jobs, going to school and taking care of family, but they are resilient and dedicated to being amazing artists that enrich our lives and our city with their beauty and creativity.
