Love Is Blind season three has finally dropped on Netflix, transporting viewers back to those iconic pods.
The third series has a fresh batch of singletons ready to fall in love and get engaged, without having ever met the person they want to spend the rest of their life with.
However, while we're all marveling at how fast and deep those connections are, fans have questioned if there is any connection between new contestant Cole Barnett and season one star Matthew Barnett, who eventually married Amber Pike.
