Just Stop Oil protesters have sprayed orange paint on the front of Harrods as they continue to call on the Government to end all 'new oil and gas'.

Around 20 demonstrators gathered at the department store in Knightsbridge, central London, at around 9am on Thursday for a 20th day of disruption to the capital.

A video shared on Just Stop Oil's Twitter account shows two protesters spraying paint on the windows of Harrods as members of the public ask: 'What are you doing?'

A second clip appears to show the pair being taken inside the store by security guards.
