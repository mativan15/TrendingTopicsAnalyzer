Published: 12:57 EDT, 1 June 2022 | Updated: 12:59 EDT, 1 June 2022 Walking more slowly in old age could be a warning sign for dementia, a major study has suggested.Researchers from the University of Minnesota and Monash University, Australia, monitored people over 75 years old and found that those who lost 0.05 meters per second from their pace every year and had signs of mental decline were most at risk.The international team said this was likely because as the the brain declines in the debilitating condition it also affects the areas involved in walking.
