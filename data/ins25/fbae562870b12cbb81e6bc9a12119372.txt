British politics is famously the democracy of the club not the mob. The electorate – the 'mob' – may every five years choose the club, but from then on the club rules. It decides who should be most worthy of its loyalty as the nation's leader. It decides when the loyalty has been tested to destruction. Graham Brady is the custodian of that test.Liz Truss this week reached the point of destruction. The result was uproar and defenestration. The club, exclusive and rule-bound, has descended into a bar-room brawl, as it often does at such moments.
