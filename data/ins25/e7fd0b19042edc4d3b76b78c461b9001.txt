The Home Secretary is facing calls to ban sales of laughing gas.The British Compressed Gases Association (BCGA) has written to Suella Braverman, urging her to scrap direct-to-consumer retail sales of nitrous oxide.The drug is typically used by being released into balloons from small silver cannisters and then inhaled, giving temporary feelings of relaxation and euphoria.But prolonged use of nitrous oxide can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia and nerve damage.Last month doctors warned that using laughing gas could lead to spinal injuries.
