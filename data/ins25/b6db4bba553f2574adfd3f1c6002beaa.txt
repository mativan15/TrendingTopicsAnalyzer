I AM a woman of forty-three, Catholic and ‘Aryan.' My family lived in Vienna. At the Sacré Cceur school the two most important things I learned were good French and good manners.In 1922 I married a young Viennese physician. Fritz was Catholic, but nonAryan. He had a good practice, and with what I earned we were very happy.We were not much interested in politics. We regarded ourselves as liberals, but since there was no liberal party we sometimes voted Christian Socialist and sometimes Social Democratic.
