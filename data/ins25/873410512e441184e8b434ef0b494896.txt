(RTTNews) - The services sector in Australia continued to expand in May, albeit at a slower pace, the latest survey from S&P Global revealed on Friday with a services PMI score of 53.2. That's down from 56.1 in April, although it remains above the boom-or-bust line of 50. This marked the fourth consecutive month in which business activity in the Australia service sector rose, albeit at the slowest pace in the current sequence. Growth of new work was sustained for a fourth straight month in May, boosted by the reduction in COVID-19 disruptions.
