Oct. 16—One question that arises in the wake of Honda's historic announcement last week of a $4.4 billion Dayton region investment in electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries to power them — where will Honda find the workers?

"The one thing that could put the brakes on Ohio's manufacturing momentum, in my opinion, is a continuing or worsening labor shortage," said Ryan Augsburger, president of the Ohio Manufacturing Association.

It's a question that has been asked of Intel near Columbus, where at least 3,000 workers are planned, of Amazon near Union (about 1,800 workers) and of SEMCORP in Sidney (1,200 workers) — all big companies establishing big operations in rural areas near urban centers.
