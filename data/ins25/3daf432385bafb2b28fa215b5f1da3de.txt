A cabinet minister has told Sky News they believe Boris Johnson could secure the 100 nominations from Conservative MPs he needs to stand in the second Tory leadership race in three months.The contest got under way on Thursday after the extraordinary resignation of Liz Truss, who was forced from office 44 days into her tenure after a seismic few weeks in Westminster in which her tax-slashing mini-budget crashed and burnt.
All eyes are now on who could replace her - with speculation mounting that Mr Johnson could launch a comeback to frontline politics, six weeks after he was officially ousted from the top job.
