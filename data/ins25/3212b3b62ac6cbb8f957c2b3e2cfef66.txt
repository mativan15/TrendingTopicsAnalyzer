Joe Lauzon fulfilled all of his UFC 274 pre-fight obligations to step into the cage, but at the last minute, his opponent Donald Cerrone was unable to compete.
When a fight gets canceled hours before the scheduled time, the focus turns to sort out what portion of their purse, if anything, the fighter that was ready to compete will receive. Cerrone (36-16 MMA, 23-13 UFC) came down with a non-COVID-related illness on the day of the fight, thus forcing the bout to be scrapped at the last minute. The announcement was made during the early prelims of the pay-per-view event, leaving Lauzon (28-15 MMA, 15-12 UFC) without an opportunity to compete on the main card in what could have been one of the final fights of his lengthy professional career.
