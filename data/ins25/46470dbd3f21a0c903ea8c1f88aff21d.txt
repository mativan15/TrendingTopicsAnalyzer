Published: 12:35 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 00:50 EDT, 16 October 2022 NSW Labor leader Chris Minns says "it's time for change" for the state after nearly 12 years of coalition government. He used a speech to a NSW Labor conference to galvanise party faithful before the state election in 160 days. Mr Minns pledged a locally built fleet of trains to replace NSW's ageing rail stock and 10,000 extra teachers. "We are ready for the challenge, we want the responsibility and we're prepared for the long hours," Mr Minns said on Sunday.
