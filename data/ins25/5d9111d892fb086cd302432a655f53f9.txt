Stocks are expected to take their cue from the bond market in the week ahead, as investors weigh earnings from bellwethers Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Strategists continue to watch the market's trading patterns for signs a bottom is forming after the Oct. 13 washout, when the market first fell and then surged following a hotter-than-expected September consumer inflation report. Some strategists also say it appears Treasury yields may have peaked — at least temporarily — and that could help stocks.
