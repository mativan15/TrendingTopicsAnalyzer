The dollar hovered near a 32-year peak above 149 yen on Tuesday even as it took a breather from a rally against other major peers, with traders bracing for possible further intervention by Tokyo to support its currency. The Aussie strengthened after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's last meeting showed the decision to slow the pace of rate hikes to a quarter point instead of delivering another half point increase was "finely balanced."
 The New Zealand dollar surged after a hotter-than-expected consumer price report boosted expectations for further policy tightening.
