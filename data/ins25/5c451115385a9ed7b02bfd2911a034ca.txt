Yesterday, shares of electric car leader Tesla (TSLA 4.68%) took a 2.4% tumble as U.S. media obsessed over Elon Musk's emailed ultimatum: Tesla office workers must cease working from home and report to the office, or else find a new job and "pretend to work somewhere else."
Today, though, Tesla's stock took a turn for the better, rising 4.7%, as investors reacted positively to news that the company is delaying delivery of longer-range electric vehicles in the U.S. Why is that?
