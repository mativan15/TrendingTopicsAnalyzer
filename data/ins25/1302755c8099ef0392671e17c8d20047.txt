CNN anchor Jake Tapper confronted Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Sunday over the country's rising inflation, but could not get her to admit, as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did, that she underestimated how bad it would get.

'As recently as six months ago, you were calling inflation a ‘short-term problem, not a long-term problem,'' Tapper said. 'So you got it wrong, too.'

Raimondo, appearing on CNN's State of the Union, told Tapper the country could not have predicted Russian President Vladimir Putin's assault on Ukraine would drive up gas prices or the long-term impact of the COVID-19 recovery.
