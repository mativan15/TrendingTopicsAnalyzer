ET Canada Kanye West addressed his recent antisemitic remarks in a new interview with Chris Cuomo.While speaking to the ex-CNN host, who now works at NewsNation, West, who did the interview remotely from a vehicle, said, 'I don't like the term antisemitic' following a series of previous hurtful comments he made about Jewish people.'It's been a term that's allowed people, specifically in my industry, to get away with murder — sometimes literally — and get away with robbing and doing bad [to] people,' the rapper continued.
