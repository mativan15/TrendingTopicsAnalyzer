The talk surrounding a managerial change at Anfield has been gathering pace as Liverpool's inconsistent season continues.

The Reds are winless in three Premier League games and enter the weekend sitting in 11th. Manager Jurgen Klopp has since ruled his side out of title contention, saying in his press conference: 'We're not in the race.'

Klopp's men take on a red-hot Manchester City side this weekend as they look to back up their 7-1 Champions League thrashing of Rangers.
