Logitech and Razer might not be the only webcam manufacturers, but theirs are among the best. Logitech's webcams were in such high demand during the pandemic that they were sold out for months. They still are, especially with people switching to a hybrid working setup and still need to jump on video conferences. Razer's feature-rich webcams, on the other hand, are popular with gamers and streamers.

The question now is, which manufacturer offers the best webcams ? It's not a matter of quality, as both Logitech and Razer are well-known for making excellent computer peripherals.
