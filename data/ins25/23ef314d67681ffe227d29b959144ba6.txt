I owe you all an apology. I have been part of a movement which has encouraged people to just go for it. Believe in yourself. Ignore the critics. Just plough on through. That was pre-Liz Truss, though. We now have a Prime Minister who is basically a female David Brent but without the charm — for all his faults, he never tanked the pound. Let's pray she doesn't release a single as part of the fightback strategy. Truss is so unsuited to the job that she makes you yearn for Theresa May. She is terrifyingly out of her depth, she has the communication skills and charisma of a stapler and is such an amateur that it feels like we have a random competition winner at the helm of British politics.
