Gracie's Corner, the children's entertainment company behind the popular animated YouTube series of the same name, has signed with UTA and Underscore Talent. In 2020, the Hollingsworth family — parents and educators Javoris 'Jay' Hollingsworth and Arlene Gordon-Hollingsworth and daughter Graceyn 'Gracie' Hollingsworth — were inspired by the lack of diverse children's entertainment to create an animated show that featured their daughter and used music and dance to educate young viewers. Using their in-home studio, father Jay and daughter Gracie, now 10 years old, created original songs for the show with an educational bent — 'Workout Song' encourages exercise and movement, while 'Deep Breath' teaches viewers how to cope with stressful situations — and have produced episodes with lessons about Juneteenth and Black hair.
