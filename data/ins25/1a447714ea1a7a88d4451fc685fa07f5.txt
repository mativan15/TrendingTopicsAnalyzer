The anti-dog movement does not advocate for the killing of dogs. That is the first rule emblazoned at the top of the r/Dogfree subreddit, where 46,000 subscribers gather every day to dream of a better world. There shall be no 'suggesting, joking, wishing for, or celebrating' the destruction of canines; all cruelty, even in hypothetical terms, is a no-go. That said, you shall also not include mealy-mouthed clauses like 'I love dogs, but,' or 'I don't like dogs, however,' at the top of your posts, for that demonstrates a fundamental misreading of the community.
