President Biden will meet Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday to discuss the national economy amid high inflation, which has hurt Biden's job approval rating.

It's the first meeting between Biden and Powell since November, Bloomberg noted.

A schedule released by the White House said they will 'discuss the state of the American and global economy.'

The meeting comes while the country continues to struggle with rising prices in many sectors of the economy.

The price of oil has risen to its highest level in two months since Biden announced in late March that he would tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.
