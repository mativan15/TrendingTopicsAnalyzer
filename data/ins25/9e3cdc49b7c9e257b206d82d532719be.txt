Suffern, New York --News Direct-- Shifl

Digital forwarding and supply chain platform Shifl has announced the launch of SHIFEX, an Ocean Spot Freight Rate Index for container shipments which is now available on their website (https://shifl.com/index).

The recent and continuing unprecedented chaos in the freight markets has brought the dire need for transparency and visibility into actual ocean freight rates.

Shabsie Levy, CEO and Founder of Shifl, said he often found thousands of dollars of disparities between reported and actual freight rates on the market.
