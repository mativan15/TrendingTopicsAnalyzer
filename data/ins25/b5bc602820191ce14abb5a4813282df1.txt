Veteran politician Mallikarjun Kharge is the frontrunner to win the internal election to become the president of India's main opposition Congress party.

He is competing against charismatic MP Shashi Tharoor but media and experts believe that Mr Kharge is likely to get enough votes to secure a win.

This is the first time in more than 20 years that the party will have a non-Gandhi at the helm - the last such chief Sitaram Kesri was unceremoniously removed in 1998 just after two years into his five-year term.
