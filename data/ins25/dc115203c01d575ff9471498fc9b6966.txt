ISLAMABAD — Former Pakistani leader Imran Khan has been disqualified from holding public office — at least in the near future — after a ruling from Pakistan's Election Commission Friday charged him with unlawfully selling state gifts, according to senior members of his party.Khan was found to have 'made false statements' and to have committed 'corrupt practices' according to a copy of the commission's ruling seen by The Post. Khan has denied any wrongdoing.The case is just the latest in a number of charges against the former prime minister by the government in an attempt to prevent Khan from running again after his ouster earlier this year.
