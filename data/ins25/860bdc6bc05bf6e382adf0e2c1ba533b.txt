One of the Triangle's largest technology employers is trying to make a name for itself in the metaverse.

Lenovo, which has its U.S. headquarters in Morrisville, envisions an increasingly virtual world where someday even factory workers can be a part of the 'work-from-home' trend. At a media event in advance of the product announcements at Lenovo Tech World '22, CEO Yuanqing Yang told reporters the Chinese firm's commitment to innovation 'remains unchanged.'
