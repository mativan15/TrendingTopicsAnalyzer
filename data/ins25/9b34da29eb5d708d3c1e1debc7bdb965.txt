Samsung's latest trio of phones – the Galaxy S22, S22+ and S22 ultra – fall into its high-end S series.The ultra is the most advanced, and therfore, priciest of the bunch, costing around £1,149. But the S22 and S22+, differentiated from each other mostly by size, are still premium devices, though noticeably more affordable starting at £949 – a £200 saving.That extra money buys you a bigger display, more cameras and even a smart stylus for extra productivity, which fits right into the body of the phone.
