Part-time nannies are particularly in demand, according to Nannytax, a payroll firm, because of the rise of home- working which allows parents to do more childcare. Others have lost nursery places or removed their children from daycare over health fears in the past two years of the pandemic.
Full-time nursery for children under three costs about £14,000 a year, according to the Coram Family and Childcare Trust, a charity. Once a nanny earns £10,000 a year an employer also need to provide them with a workplace pension which complies with strict rules.
