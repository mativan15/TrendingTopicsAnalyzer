Russian-born NHL star Artemi Panarin has become the first New York Rangers player to level a longstanding record, by becoming the first player to record five assists in the first three games of the seasons since both Mark Messier and Brian Leitch achieved the same feat in the 1992-93 season.It was a bittersweet moment on Friday for the 30-year-old forward, though, as his assist for Rangers teammate Dryden Hunt was the only goal his side were able to muster in what was a 4-1 loss to the Winnipeg Jets at the Canada Life Center in Manitoba.
