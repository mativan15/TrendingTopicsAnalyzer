Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has filed a lawsuit pushing back against federal agencies seeking to force removal of 130 shipping containers used as a makeshift wall at Arizona's border with Mexico.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court on Friday, asks a judge to allow the state to continue placing shipping containers at the border and to stop the federal government from intervening.

In the past two weeks, Ducey's administration and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have sparred over whether Arizona had the legal authority to put the containers in gaps where the federal government, though having plans to build a barrier, had not yet done so.
