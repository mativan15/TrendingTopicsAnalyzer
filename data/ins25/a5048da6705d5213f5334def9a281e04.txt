Marje/iStock via Getty Images Equity LifeStyle Properties (NYSE:ELS) stock has climbed 4.2% in Monday after-hours after the REIT posted better than expects Q3 earnings even as the company reduced its full-year guidance due to damage caused by Hurricane Ian at some of its properties. The owner of manufactured housing communities, RV parks, and marinas now expects 2022 normalized FFO per share of $2.64-$2.70, down from its prior range of $2.68-$2.78. That's less than the $2.73 per share consensus. The most significant damage occurred at six properties in or near the Fort Myers, Florida, area.
