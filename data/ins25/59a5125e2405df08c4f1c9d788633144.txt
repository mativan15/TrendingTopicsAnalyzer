British actor Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter film franchise, credited his co-star and longtime friend Emma Watson with encouraging him to write about his struggles with alcoholism and multiple stints in rehab in his new memoir.

In Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard, Felton says he began drinking more heavily after he moved to Los Angeles, 'craving normality' in the thick of Hollywood.
