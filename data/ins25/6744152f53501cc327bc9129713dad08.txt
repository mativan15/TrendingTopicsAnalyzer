Truss's departure after 45 days in office makes her the shortest-serving PM in UK history. The reason for her exit, she said, is because she could not deliver the mandate on which she was elected as Tory leader.Allardyce, colloquially referred to as Big Sam, was the England manager, though he left the role by mutual consent after just 67 days following allegations of malpractice. Since then, the former Bolton, Newcastle and Blackburn manager has enjoyed stints at Crystal Palace, Everton and West Brom, and has even taken command of a few more England games.
