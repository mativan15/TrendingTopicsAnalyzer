Michigan State football has cracked the top seven for a Georgia cornerback in the 2023 class.

Brice Pollock of Snellville, Ga. announced earlier this week his top seven schools, with Michigan State making the cut. The Spartans were joined by Pitt, Mississippi State, Georgia Tech, Ole Miss, North Carolina and Vanderbilt.

Pollock isn't ranked by 247Sports but has received a ton of interest in the recruiting cycle. He holds offers from more than 25 schools, including six of the seven in his top sevens schools list, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas State, Kentucky, Nebraska, Penn State, UCF, Wake Forest and West Virginia.
