North Carolina guard Anthony Harris scores on an uncontested layup during a game in January. He announced on Monday his transfer to URI.

Monday just might have brought an end to this offseason's roster makeover at the University of Rhode Island.

Anthony Harris and KC Nwafor both committed to the Rams within a 24-hour period. Harris posted his announcement on his personal Instagram page while a URI source confirmed Nwafor's pledge to The Journal.

Harris is a North Carolina transfer and former top-100 prospect who offers yet another option in the URI backcourt.
