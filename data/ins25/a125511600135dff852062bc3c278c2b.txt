Manchester United have been told that Erik ten Hag is not 'entirely convinced' by his defence ahead of the Red Devils' visit of Newcastle on Sunday. The Dutchman's side have won four of their last five Premier League games, the sole defeat coming against local rivals Manchester City, but the boss may only particularly favour one member of his back four.Ten Hag has almost settled on a first-choice backline, as Diogo Dalot along with centre-backs Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martnez have played the majority of games, and Luke Shaw has battled with Tyrell Malacia for the left-back position.
