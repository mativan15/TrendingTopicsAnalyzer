SALEM, Oregon — Creekside Golf Club, a country club in the Oregon state capital less than an hour from downtown Portland, is again asking an adjoining neighborhood to prop up its bottom line.
In return for an estimated $4.2 million, the club's owners will pause plans to develop the property into housing for five years, according to a proposal sent to homeowners last week.
During the first year, 65% of the money raised would go toward deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvements at the golf club, such as replacing pond liners, upgrading the irrigation system and deferred pool maintenance.
