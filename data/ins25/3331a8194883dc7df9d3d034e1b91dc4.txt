On Wednesday, the City of Regina held public consultations on a proposed outdoor baseball and soccer facility, one of several catalyst projects under construction. It's what Regina's baseball community has long been pushing for, a new stadium to replace Currie Field. 'A very great plan that we finally put Regina on the map,' said Steve Hom of Baseball Regina. The original pitch was for a 3,500 seat ball stadium on the former rail yard downtown. It is being scaled back to 2,000 seats with an adjacent soccer stadium of similar size.
