Following reports that the company as a whole had been acquired, Gowalla today announced that its founders and several team members have joined Facebook and will move to its Palo Alto headquarters. The Gowalla service 'will be winding down at the end of January', and options will be made available for users to export their data. Gowalla CEO Josh Williams says his company was impressed by what Facebook revealed at f8, and soon after he and other team members were asked to join the social network's team.
