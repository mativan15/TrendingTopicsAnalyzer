gorodenkoff/iStock via Getty Images Fate Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FATE) is a good biotech to look into because it had established proof of concept in two studies using its drugs FT516 and FT596 for patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas. Not only that, but I think what's even more important is that this biotech has a potential speedy pathway of approval for FT516 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It expects to initiate a pivotal study for this patient population in the second half of 2022 and will be able to possibly get expedited review because of the RMAT designation the FDA gave FT516 for the treatment of this patient population.
