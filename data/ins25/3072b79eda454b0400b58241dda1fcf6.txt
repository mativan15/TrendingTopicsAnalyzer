Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan won the majority of seats in by-elections, building momentum in his campaign to pressure the six-month-old government into calling an early national vote.

Khan is contesting seven of the eight seats and has won five, according to Election Commission of Pakistan data with more than 90% of the votes counted. The Pakistan Peoples Party, a member of the ruling coalition, took two seats, while the result of the final seat is still being tallied, with Khan leading.
