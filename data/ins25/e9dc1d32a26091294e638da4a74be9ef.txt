Kylian Mbappe feels Neymar lacks ‘vigour' at Paris Saint-Germain as the duo's relationship worsens behind the scenes, according to reports. The pair used to be close at the Parc des Princes. But that's no longer the case, with the 2018 World Cup winner eyeing a January move away - despite insisting he's content with life in the French capital.Mbappe was expected to leave PSG for Real Madrid back in the summer, with his contract due to expire at the time.But the France international ended up staying put instead, dealing a huge blow to Real president Florentino Perez in the process and penning a new contract that runs until 2025.
