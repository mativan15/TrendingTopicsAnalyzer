A brand-new Mortal Kombat is in the works, and it's coming out relatively soon.
On Tuesday, NetherRealm Studios announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG that'll arrive sometime in 2023. It'll emphasize cinematic storytelling and let players put together teams of fighters for massive real-time brawls. Outside of these light details, there's no other information on Mortal Kombat: Onslaught thus far.
'We are pushing the boundaries of Mortal Kombat to allow players to experience the franchise in new ways, while still staying true to its core visceral nature,' Ed Boon, CCO of NetherRealm Studios, said in a press release.
