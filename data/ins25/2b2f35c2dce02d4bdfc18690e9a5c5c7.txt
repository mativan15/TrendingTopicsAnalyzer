LONDON, October 17, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hardening reinsurance market conditions in the Middle East and North Africa region, as well as changes in reinsurers' appetites as to where they deploy their capital, have sustained the positive price momentum over recent renewal seasons, according to an AM Best report.

The Best's Market Segment Report, "Opportunities Arise for MENA Reinsurers Amid Divergent Economic Conditions," notes that reinsurance capacity in the region continues to be highly changeable and dynamic against a backdrop of divergent economic conditions across the region for oil-exporting and oil-importing countries.
