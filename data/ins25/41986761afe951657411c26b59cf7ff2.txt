The "Congratulations" rapper was spotted at dinner in Dallas on Thursday (October 20) with Cowboys legends Michael Irvin, Drew Pearson and Dez Bryant. Irvin posted a video on Twitter of the group at the Tower Club in downtown Dallas taken by entertainment reporter Paul Salfen. You can see the group toasting to "replicating the dinner" again in Arizona at the end of the season if the Cowboys make it to the Super Bowl.
