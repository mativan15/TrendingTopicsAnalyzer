Farmer leader and former MP Raju Shetti Saturday demanded Rs 350 per tonne over the government-declared fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first instalment payment for sugarcane sold to mills in the upcoming 2022-23 crushing season. Shetti made the demand while addressing the 21st Oosh Parishad in the town of Jaysingpur in the Shirol taluka of Kolhapur district.
The upcoming cane crushing season, which was supposed to start on October 15, has been delayed due to heavy and incessant rain which continues in many parts of the state.
