The 20 young footballers went to Poland for a football tournament in February, but were never able to return home. Wales lost 2-1 to Poland in Wroclaw on Wednesday in the Nations League and face Ukraine for a place in the 2022 World Cup on Sunday. The visiting supporters raised about 5,000 zloty (£930) to help support the refugees.
