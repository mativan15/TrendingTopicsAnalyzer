Navy eyes creation of unmanned command in 2040s SEOUL, Oct. 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's Navy is seeking to create a new command running unmanned ships, submarines and aircraft in the 2040s, the armed service said Friday, in an effort to address a potential troop shortage caused by the country's low birthrate. During a parliamentary audit, the Navy unveiled a series of policy goals, including removing one of the three fleet commands and creating the new command employing unmanned naval assets. The envisioned command is to comprise three units -- the unmanned surface ship, submarine and aviation groups -- the Navy said.
