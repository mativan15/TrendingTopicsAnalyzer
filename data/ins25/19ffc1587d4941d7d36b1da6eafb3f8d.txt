The hype has so far not been overstated, all the glowing talk and praise on target. Jalen Brunson has absolutely looked the part as the floor general the Knicks have been so desperately lacking, a player who is ready to meet the pressure of that $104 million contract.
The Knicks outscored their opponent by a whopping 63 points when Brunson was on the floor during the preseason. He has scored and distributed at a high level — averaging 17.7 points, 4.2 assists and shooting 49 percent from the field.
