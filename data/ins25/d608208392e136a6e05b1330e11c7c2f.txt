Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo admitted on Sunday that she only learned about the ongoing shortage of baby formula in April. Mrs. Raimondo told CNN's 'State of the Union' that she was not directly involved in the White House's response to the crisis. 'I first learned about it a couple of months ago … probably April,' she said. 'I'm not involved in the administration's response here, I should say.' The remarks quickly sparked an outcry from Republican lawmakers, who questioned why a key member of President Biden's Cabinet was left unaware.
