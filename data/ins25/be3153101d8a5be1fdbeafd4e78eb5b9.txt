Projected No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama is the real deal.
He proved that earlier this month when he and Metropolitans 92 traveled from France to face the NBA G League Ignite for two exhibition games.
Wembanyama averaged 36.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.5 blocks and two assists in those games. He wrapped up his trip to the U.S. leaving little doubt about who the No. 1 pick should be next year. Some execs even believe he should sit this season because he is a lock to be the top pick.
