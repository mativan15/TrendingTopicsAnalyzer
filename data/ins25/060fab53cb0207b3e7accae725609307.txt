The gruesome Bilkis Bano case is in a perverse light with a new development that the centre backed the release of alleged rapists and murderers. A fresh affidavit filed by the Gujarat government in the Bilkis Bano case mentions that the centre had approved the remission and premature release of the 11 convicts on the account of their good behaviour. On October 17, the Gujarat government informed the Supreme Court that the men had been released since they had served 14 years in prison and had displayed good behaviour.
