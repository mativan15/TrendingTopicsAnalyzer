Wells Fargo is one of the oldest and most powerful banks in the United States. Its reputation today is in tatters, following a notorious scandal that is still unfolding.
Reports of fraudulent activity in Wells Fargo's sales department first surfaced in 2013. The bank opened at least 3.5 million fraudulent accounts for unwitting customers, according to researchers at the Harvard Business School. This and other issues have led the government to fine the bank repeatedly.
Regulators for banking, consumer protection, trading, and workplace safety continue to keep a close watch on Wells Fargo.
