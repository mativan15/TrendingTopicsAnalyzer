To rub salt into the wound, Adele Ferguson acted as any responsible journalist should. In the days that preceded Ajaka's application, she gave him an opportunity to give any appropriate denial or explanation on the subject matter of the 60 Minutes story. Ordinarily, that has some significance for publishers as it bears upon a specific defence. Unfortunately, it seems that very line of inquiry precipitated Ajaka's application and was used against Nine and Ferguson in argument. Hopefully, this will not deter responsible journalism in the future.
