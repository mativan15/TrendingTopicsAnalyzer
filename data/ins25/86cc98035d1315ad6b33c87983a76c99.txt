General Motors' fleet of self driving vehicles isn't the best at handling run-ins with California police, but that didn't stop the state's regulators from approving the company to start charging passengers for driverless rides across San Fransisco.As Cruise Chief Operating Officer Gil West boasted in a blog post about the news, the company is the first to be granted the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) 'Driverless Deployment Permit,' which lets Cruise charge fares for driverless rides in the same way a regular taxicab would.
