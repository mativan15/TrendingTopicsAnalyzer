The news is likely to thrill Michael Jackson fans: the so-called jukebox musical, which follows the making of Jackson's 1992 Dangerous World Tour, packs in his hits, and has won four Tony Awards (including for Best Choreography, Best Lighting Design and Best Sound Design) since its Broadway premiere in February 2022.But excited fans will have to wait for a little before they can bag their spot - tickets go on sale in Spring next year.The musical, which is being presented by Lia Vollack Productions and The Michael Jackson Estate, has a stellar team behind it: the book (the non-sung part of the musical) has been written by Lynn Nottage, the first and only woman to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for drama (for 2009 play Ruined and 2017 play Sweat) and the musical has been directed and choreographed by Royal Ballet Associate Artist Christopher Wheeldon OBE, who brought the Tony Award-winning American In Paris to the West End.
