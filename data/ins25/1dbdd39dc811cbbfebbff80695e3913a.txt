The story of the night in the baseball world continued Saturday, when Tommy Pham addressed why he slapped Joc Pederson over a fantasy football dispute.
Pham confronted Pederson during batting practice on Friday and slapped him across the face with his hand open, an action Pederson did not respond to. After an MLB investigation, the league suspended Pham for three games for his 'inappropriate conduct' prior to Friday's game, which Pham agreed to sit out.
After Pederson gave his side of the events that caused the fracas Friday night, Pham told media in Cincinnati before Saturday's game that Pederson had made 'disrespectful' comments towards Pham's old team, the San Diego Padres, in a group text message.
