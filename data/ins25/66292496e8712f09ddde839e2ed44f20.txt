The 2022 stock market sell-off has been broad, but it has been particularly brutal for the technology sector. While the benchmark S&P 500 index is down by 25% year to date as of this writing, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has lost 34%.
But when you zoom out and compare their performances over the past five years, the picture looks very different. The Nasdaq-100 is up by 77%, which is nearly double the S&P 500's gain of 40%. This supports the widely held view that investing for the long term typically delivers the greatest benefits.
