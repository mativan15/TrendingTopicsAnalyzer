The Russian government on Sunday blocked access to a Ukrainian site for soldiers who want to surrender.

The "I Want to Live" site has received 2,000 requests to surrender, the Kyiv Independent reported.

The Roskomsvoboda Project, a Russian anti-censorship organization, reported the Prosecutor General's Office blocked the site.

The Russian government on Sunday banned users nationwide from accessing a Ukrainian website that encourages Russian military members to surrender.
