DEAR ABBY: My adult son got so furious with me that he called me, yelled vicious things and threatened to cut me out of his life.
 I've never been spoken to that way before. It was so traumatic that I was shaking after I hung up on him.
What made him so angry was that I didn't thank his mother-in-law for an email she sent wishing me happy birthday.
I had received 30 email birthday wishes that day and didn't acknowledge any of them. I would have thanked someone who'd gone to the trouble of calling or sending an actual card.
