Bailey Zappe's fast start in New England may have come as a shock to the NFL community, but not to the Patriots and his agent, Nicole Lynn.
Taking to Twitter on Monday, one day after Zappe threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns and the Patriots demolished the Browns, 38-15, Lynn called out the rookie quarterback's naysayers.
'Trying to restrain myself from texting every team who told me Bailey Zappe couldn't play in the NFL,' she tweeted.
Zappe, a fourth-round pick out of Western Kentucky in the 2022 NFL Draft, has continued to thrive since taking over the Patriots' offense with starter Mac Jones injured.
