AlexLMX/iStock via Getty Images Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS) +4.2% in Thursday's trading after reporting record quarterly revenues of $5.86B, up 70% Q/Q, and production of 557K boe/day, up 52% Q/Q, thanks in part to strong natural gas prices. The Q3 results reflected the first full three months of contribution from the former BHP petroleum business. Australia's largest oil and gas producer said Q3's strong operational performance across its portfolio prompted an upgrade of full-year production guidance to 153M-157M boe.
