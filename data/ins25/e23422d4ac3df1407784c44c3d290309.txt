Ukrainians who have fled to Canada due to the Russian invasion of their home country will begin receiving financial support from the federal government in the next five days, Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said Thursday.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in early April that Ottawa planned to offer money to newly arrived Ukrainians to help them settle in Canada.The Ukrainian Canadian Congress has criticized the government for not acting on those promises sooner, as thousands of Ukrainians – some without a previously arranged place to stay or much money – have already arrived in the country.
