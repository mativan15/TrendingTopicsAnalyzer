Though he played the title character in the John G. Avildsen film, Macchio made it to his seat 'fairly unnoticed except for a few random audience members' who recognized him from his work in Francis Ford Coppola's recent film The Outsiders.By the time the movie ended and the last credit had rolled across the screen, anonymity essentially evaporated for Macchio, who, nearly forty years later, is still best known as Daniel Larusso, a character close to his heart and one that has found new generations of fans thanks to the resurgence of Cobra Kai on Netflix.
