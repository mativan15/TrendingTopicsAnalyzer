The fifth series of The Crown is set to hit screens next month, but many viewers are boycotting the streaming platform before its highly anticipated release date. It comes after fans have slammed the depiction of royal and political figures and have called for a disclaimer before episodes. However, with Netflix having no plans to add a statement highlighting the show is fiction not fact, people have started cancelling their subscriptions.Since The Crown first aired in 2016, viewers have watched as the TV show portrays a dramatised series of true events in the life of Queen Elizabeth II and the monarchy.
