Micron Technology 's exposure to consumer markets such as smartphones and personal computers could prove problematic in the near term, according to Piper Sandler. Analyst Harsh Kumar downgraded the semiconductor stock to underweight from neutral, citing risks from cyclical consumer products markets and pricing headwinds within the dynamic random-access memory market. "Our downgrade is largely due to the company's oversized exposure to mobile, PCs, and other consumer end-markets and the associated trends in the macroeconomy," Kumar wrote.
