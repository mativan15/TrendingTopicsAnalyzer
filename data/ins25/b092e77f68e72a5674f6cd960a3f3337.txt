Brendon Lewis, the Colorado Buffaloes' starting quarterback for the season opener, announced his decision to enter the transfer portal on Tuesday.

After starting all 12 games last season, Lewis was unable to fully maintain the starting job this year, and here at the halfway mark, he's now stuck behind JT Shrout and new true freshman starter Owen McCown.

The former four-star recruit out of Texas threw for 1,540 passing yards and 10 touchdowns last season but was unable to eclipse 100 passing yards in his sophomore campaign.
