The Bangladesh government denied a Bollywood actor Nora Fatehi permission to perform at an event in the capital Dhaka in a bid to save dollars as part of austerity measures.
Nora, known for her work in the Indian film industry, wasn't granted permission 'in view of the global situation and with the aim of maintaining the foreign exchange reserves,' according to a notice issued by Bangladesh's Ministry of Cultural Affairs on Monday.  Nora was scheduled to dance and hand out awards at an event organized by the Women Leadership Corporation.
