Just Stop Oil activists have sprayed paint on Harrods to protest the UK government's new oil and gas licences.

The climate justice campaign group says that at 9am on Thursday, 20 supporters walked onto Knightsbridge in west London and disrupted traffic by sitting in the road with banners.

Some supporters glued their hands to the Tarmac and two others sprayed the outside of the high-end department store with orange paint.

The Met Police said the protesters were being removed by specialist officers, and the force confirmed two people have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.
