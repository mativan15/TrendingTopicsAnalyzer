Antonio Conte declared himself proud of Tottenham's development after they closed in on the Premier League summit by beating Everton 2-0 on Saturday.

The Toffees turned in a stubborn first-half display in Conte's 50th match in charge of Spurs, who were fortunate not to fall behind when Amadou Onana and Demarai Gray squandered glorious chances.

However, Tottenham ultimately came good after the break. An injury to former Everton talisman Richarlison led to Yves Bissouma's introduction, and Spurs' change in shape overwhelmed Everton.
