For the chaotic 44 days Liz Truss spent in office, she is now eligible to collect an annual £115,000 ($128,000) allowance from the U.K. government for the rest of her life. The money for Truss will come from the country's Public Duty Costs Allowance scheme, which allows anyone who served as Prime Minister, no matter the duration, to claim the payment to cover the costs arising from their 'special position in public life.' The scheme, established in 1991 in the wake of Margaret Thatcher's resignation, is meant to assist an ex-Prime Minister if they are 'still active in public life.
