Australia's television and publishing broadcasters are asking the federal government to consider strengthening parts of the proposed national anti-corruption commission legislation to ensure journalists can protect their sources and report on the proceedings.The joint select committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) received a submission from Australia's Right To Know Coalition on Friday, which welcomes the bill but asks for stronger powers to protect journalists from search warrants and measures to ensure journalists' sources are not revealed.
