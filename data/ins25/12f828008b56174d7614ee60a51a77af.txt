Long-time Chicago entrepreneurs Josh and Tara Joseph made history in 2020 when the company they founded in 2014, Grassroots Cannabis, was sold to Curaleaf for a reported $850 million. Then they moved to Nashville and created Big Plan Holdings as an umbrella for the family's business ventures, but especially to focus on helping others, in particular minorities and women, successfully enter the cannabis business.The Josephs, whose enterprises included commercial real estate development, music and entertainment, branding and licensing, and philanthropy, added cannabis shortly after Illinois legalized medical marijuana in 2014.
