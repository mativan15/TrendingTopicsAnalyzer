Jordan Gray proved she's quite the icon after ending her Friday Night Live performance completely, entirely, butt-naked.
The comedian, who was the first ever transgender person to appear on The Voice back in 2016, appeared on the Channel 4 celebration special, which also saw the likes of Rosie Jones and Mawaan Rizwan.
And of course Ben Elton kicking things off with a brutal dig at Liz Truss following her resignation.
But perhaps the most iconic moment of the night was when Jordan finished her performance by stripping off entirely.
