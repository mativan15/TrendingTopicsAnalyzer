By Will Feuer Schlumberger NV and nonprofit research institute RTI International are partnering to accelerate the scaling and industrialization of RTI's carbon-capture technology, the companies said. The agreement will focus on the adoption of RTI's proprietary non-aqueous solvent technology, which enhances the efficiency of absorption-based carbon capture, the companies said. The companies hope the technology will be used to capture carbon dioxide across a variety of industrial emissions. "RTI has developed the innovative NAS technology over the past 12 years, progressing from lab scale to large engineering scale," said Marty Lail, senior director of RTI's Decarbonization Sciences program.
