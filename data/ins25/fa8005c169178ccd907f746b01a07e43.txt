Chad's new prime minister has said that uniting the population 'is the only way forward' for the chronically unstable African country after its president, Mahamat Idriss Déby, appointed him to head an interim national unity administration.Saleh Kebzabo, 75, a former opposition figure and journalist, has been tasked with leading the country towards the first free and fair elections in its political history.Several former rebels were appointed to ministerial posts in the government, which was formed last Friday, and will lead Chad until its next elections in two years.
