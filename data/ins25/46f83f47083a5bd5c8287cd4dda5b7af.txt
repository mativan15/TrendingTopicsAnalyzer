Hundreds of Lithuanians are chipping in together to buy an advanced military drone for Ukraine in its war against Russia in a show of solidarity with a fellow former Soviet Union country.Some €3 million have been raised in just three days — out of the €5m needed — largely in small amounts, according to Laisves TV, a Lithuanian internet broadcaster that launched the drive."Before this war started, none of us thought that we would be buying guns. But it's a normal thing now. Something must be done for the world to get better," said Agne Belickaite, 32, who sent €100 as soon as the fundraising launched on Wednesday.
