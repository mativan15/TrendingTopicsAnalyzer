LAS VEGAS – Movsar Evloev is determined to get a high-profile fight in the featherweight division after dispatching Dan Ige in Saturday's UFC Fight Night 207 co-main event.
Evloev (16-0 MMA, 6-0 UFC) added a signature win to his flawless record with a dominant unanimous decision win over Ige (15-6 MMA, 7-5 UFC) at the UFC Apex. He showed solid striking and overwhelming grappling as the Russian continues to flourish into a title threat.
After the win, Evloev declared in the octagon that he's the 'next champion' at 145 pounds, and he stands behind that statement.
