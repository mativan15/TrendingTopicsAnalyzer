Best known for selling cowboy boots and leather jackets, Keleher's is closing its doors for good. The store, which specializes in western and motorcycle apparel, was founded more than half a century ago by Wilfrid Keleher. The business started in the basement of his Puslinch home before moving to Townline Road in Cambridge. One final move in 2012 brought the business to its final location on King Street East. Keleher's daughters Shirley and Connie Cosman, who now run the business, said it's time to retire.
