Russian oil major Rosneft is expanding its tanker chartering business in a bid to simplify oil delivery to customers ahead of the EU sanctions, which include a ban on insuring Russian oil shipments, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.Prior to sanctions, Rosneft was using the free-on-board (FOB) scheme in oil sales, offering the crude at port, while the buyer had to charter tankers, pay freight, insurance, and delivery costs. Previously, the company had long-term contracts with major trading groups that covered most of the operational costs.
