The 21-year-old Robertson faced 23-year-old brother Jason for the second time in his career. The Robertson brothers also shared the same NHL ice last March when Toronto beat Dallas 4-0 at Scotiabank Arena.

Jason Robertson signed a four-year, $31 million contract with the Stars this month after sitting out most of camp as a restricted free agent.

Alexander Kerfoot also scored for Toronto (3-2-0). Ilya Samsonov stopped 26 shots, and Michael Bunting added two assists.

Tyler Seguin and Luke Glendening scored for Dallas (3-0-1), which got 40 saves from Wedgewood in his first action of the season.
