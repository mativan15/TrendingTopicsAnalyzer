On October 7 2021 British subscription satellite broadcaster Sky stunned the AV world by unveiling Sky Glass: A genuine potential ‘next step' in the evolution of TV technology capable of delivering a 'live' TV service sporting more than a hundred channels all via streaming. The old dish for receiving Sky's traditional satellite broadcasts was no longer required, and the switch to all streaming opened the door to a brave new world of seamlessly blended on-demand and live entertainment. Sky Glass subsequently went on sale on October 18, and since then has, according to Sky, gone on to become the third biggest selling TV brand in the UK.
