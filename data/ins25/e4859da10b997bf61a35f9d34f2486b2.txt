Sheatufim, a non-profit organization that leads major social projects at a national level using the Collective Impact model, is leading a campaign requesting the media to focus on social issues that are truly critical – education and the fight against violence.

The campaign includes billboards and newspaper ads calling on the parties to express a clear position on social issues and requesting journalists and leading presenters to challenge the interviewees who are contesting the elections and demand answers on these issues - and not only on the recurring political questions.
