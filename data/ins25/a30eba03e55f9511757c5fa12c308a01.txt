NEW YORK (AP) — Lucy Simon, the composer who received a Tony nomination in 1991 for her work on the long-running Broadway musical 'The Secret Garden,' has died. She was 82.

Simon, sister of pop superstar Carly Simon, died Thursday at her home in Piedmont, New York, a family spokesperson said. Simon had breast cancer.

'The Secret Garden,' with a book by Marsha Norman, opened in New York in 1991. Reviews were mixed, but it won a Tony for best book of a musical and went on to play for almost two years.
