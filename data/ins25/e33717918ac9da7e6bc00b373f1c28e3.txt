After a small slate of two games on opening night, NBA fans are in for a treat with 12 games on the schedule for Wednesday night. One of those matchups includes the Chicago Bulls traveling to Miami to take on the Heat.

And while Chicago is looking to build off a 46-win season and first postseason berth in five years, sportsbooks expect it to take a step back.

The Bulls entered the campaign with a projected win total of 41.5 games. A knee injury to Lonzo Ball could keep the starting point guard out until next year.
