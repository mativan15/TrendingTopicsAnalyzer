SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Labor government of Australia's Victoria state said on Thursday it would raise its renewable energy targets and proposed government ownership of future power generation if it wins local elections due to be held next month.

The government said it would take steps to source 65% of its electricity from wind and solar energy by 2030, up from the current target of 50%, and 95% by 2035, effectively replacing dirty fuels from the state's power generation mix.

It said it would also make an initial investment of A$1 billion ($626 million) towards delivering 4.
