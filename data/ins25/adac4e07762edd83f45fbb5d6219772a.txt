The Canadian men's national team refused to play Sunday's friendly against Panama amid a contract dispute with Canada Soccer.
Just hours before kickoff at BC Place in Vancouver, Canada Soccer announced that the game had been cancelled.
Canada had previously cancelled training sessions on Friday and Saturday ahead of the match amid discussions with the federation.
Prior to kickoff on Sunday, Canada released a statement explaining why the team was refusing to play the match.
Among the team's demands was 40 percent of the team's World Cup prize money, a better package for friends and family traveling to the 2022 World Cup, more leadership positions for players on Canada Soccer's board, and an equal percentage of prize money going to the men's and women's team.
