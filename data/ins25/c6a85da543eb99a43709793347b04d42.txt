It's been a difficult few weeks for the Phoenix food community as three beloved vendors were in serious car accidents that resulted in damage to part or all of their businesses and major injuries for two of them.

Husband and wife James and Jawn Golo run a stand at the Downtown Farmers Market selling produce and honey every Saturday.

Richie Vaia or Richie V. also known as the Valley's "Chicago Hot Dog Guy" sold Chicago style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches and pizza in Chandler.

Although the two accidents happened in different cities at different times, the result was the same: lost vans and trucks that meant loss of livelihood.
