MOSCOW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Russia plans to set aside 1.4 trillion roubles ($22.7 billion) from its sovereign wealth fund to replace foreign aircraft with domestic models, as Western sanctions make it hard to get spare parts to fix foreign planes.Aircraft leasing companies will be given money to replace Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) airliners with new Russian-built planes, including Sukhoi's Superjet New and Irkut's MS-21."Our aircraft manufacturers will be guaranteed demand for leasing, which will then be used for our domestic airlines," Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said at a budget committee meeting on Monday in parliament's lower house, the Duma.
