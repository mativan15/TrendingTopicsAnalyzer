Ontario is planning to double the maximum fines for new homebuilders and sellers who unfairly cancel a project or purchase agreement. The proposed changes to the New Home Construction Licensing Act would, if passed, increase penalties to a maximum of $50,000, up from $25,000. As well, individual developers who repeatedly violate the New Home Construction Licensing Act would face fines of $100,000, up from $50,000 and corporations would face fines of $500,000, up from $250,000. Those developers could also permanently lose their builder's licence.
