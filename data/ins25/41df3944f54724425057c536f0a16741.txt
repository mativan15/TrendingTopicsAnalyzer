R.M. Nunes Will regional banks continue the Q3 winning streak for the financial sector tomorrow? Truist Financial (TFC), Silvergate Capital (SI), Signature Bank (SBNY) and Commerce Bancshares (CBSH) are set to report their Q3 earnings results tomorrow, Oct. 18, before market open, while First Horizon (FHN) will report it after market close. With net interest income playing a dominating role in the revenue structure of all the banks, the trend is expected to be continued. Banking and broad spectrum financial-based exchange traded funds showed strength in Monday's early trading after they received a boost from Q3 earnings figures delivered by Bank of America.
