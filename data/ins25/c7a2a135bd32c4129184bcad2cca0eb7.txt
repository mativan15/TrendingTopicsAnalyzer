From Satya to Rangeela, from Company to Sarkar, Ram Gopal Varma has given some cult films to Bollywood. Not for his films anymore, the man is known for his controversies now. His last hit film was Phoonk which he released 14 years ago. RGV even admitted that it was his arrogance that led to his downfall.  Twitter"There were various factors, but one factor predominantly was my arrogance which caused all the failures. Arrogance is nothing but you taking certain things for granted, taking whimsical decisions assuming that every decision of yours will work," he was quoted as saying by TOI in 2017.
