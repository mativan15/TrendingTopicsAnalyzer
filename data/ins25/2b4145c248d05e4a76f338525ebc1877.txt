Chicago White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Moiran just hit a grand slam with his latest home purchase.

The waterfront mansion in Weston, FL, sits on nearly 1.5 acres along the waterway of west Broward County.

Professionally known as Luis Robert, the outfielder, who is just 25, splurged on the seven-bedroom mansion for $12.25 million.

The deal comes after the Cuban-born pro signed a six-year, $50 million contract with the White Sox in 2020. The contract includes two options that could bring the total haul to as much as $88 million.
