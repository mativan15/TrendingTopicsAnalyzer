Not even the rain could stop celebrations for 70 years of reign.Preston's Platinum Jubilee party was completely packed out as people across different communities came together in with 'The Big Lunch'.
It was just one of the 85,000 lunches taking place across the country, but the organisers say it was the biggest in the country with thousands turning out to enjoy foods and entertainment from so many cultures.It's hard to ignore the backdrop with which the Platinum Jubilee falls on - a deepening cost of living crisis.
