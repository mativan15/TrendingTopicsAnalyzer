Every investor in Johns Lyng Group Limited (ASX:JLG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

Johns Lyng Group isn't enormous, but it's not particularly small either. It has a market capitalization of AU$1.5b, which means it would generally expect to see some institutions on the share registry.
