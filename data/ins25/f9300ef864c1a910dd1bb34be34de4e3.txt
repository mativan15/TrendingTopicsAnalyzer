New Delhi: Up until the last quarter, shares of Kalyan Jewellers since their listing in March 2021 remained lacklustre. The gems and jewellery player, however, has risen more than 60% in the last three months, the data suggests. The stock has almost doubled from its 52-week low of Rs 55.2 hit in May this year. Despite a stellar and secular rally in the stock, a number of brokerage firms remain bullish on the stock and see another 35% rally led by increased business momentum and rapid expansion. However, brokerage firms have flagged various risks for the company, including potentially higher competitive intensity in core South India markets, volatility in the bullion markets and execution risks in expansion.
