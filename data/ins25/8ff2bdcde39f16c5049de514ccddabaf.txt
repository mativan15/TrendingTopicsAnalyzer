Would you buy a lab-grown diamond that is priced at just a fraction of the value of a natural diamond? It is visually alike, chemically similar and produced more sustainably than a mined diamond. Only, it is not as rare.Over the years, the ecological and economical allure of lab-grown diamonds (LGDs) has attracted dazzling investments from leading jewellery brands across the world.
