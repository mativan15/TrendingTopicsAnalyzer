UK Prime Minister Liz Truss said she intended to lead the Tories to the next general election even as few MPs are already mulliganing a leadership change and invoking the rules. PM Liz Truss is on a tight wicket, having had to implement "U-Turns" of £32 billion, out of £42 billion suggested initially based on the mini-budget. Having shown Kwasi Kwarteng the door about slashing taxes on the UK public, the embattled prime minister apologised to the nation for her mistakes.
 PM Truss agreed that she had handed over the responsibility to a new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who has an entirely different strategy for addressing the debt burden of the UK.
