LOS ANGELES — Garrett Adelstein was four months out of college, grinding his way through thousands of online poker hands a day while he figured out what he wanted to do with his life.He was winning an average of $500 an hour and had calculated that he could make as much as half a million dollars over the next year if he kept at it. But Adelstein was conflicted, turning one afternoon to poker forum Two Plus Two to solicit advice."The main problem with poker for me is that day to day, I have mixed feelings about how happy I am doing this as a living," he wrote in the 2008 post.
