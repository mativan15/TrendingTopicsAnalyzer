Turkish security forces raided sites in 38 of the country's provinces with arrest warrants for 143 people suspected of dealing in stolen antiquities from illegal excavations on May 31 in one of Turkey's largest antiquities theft operations.

According to the English language Daily Sabah, neither the number of people arrested nor the number of artifacts was seized during the raid was released.

The operation, dubbed 'Operation Heritage,' was the culmination of a year-long investigation of a well-organized antiquities theft ring by the Seydişehir district police anti-smuggling and organized crime unit in the Konya province.
