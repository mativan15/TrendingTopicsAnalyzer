While Memorial Day is the unofficial start of summer, celebrated by many with cookouts and pool parties, the holiday's purpose is one of remembrance for the country's fallen soldiers.

This year, the USAA Poppy Wall of Honor -- a temporary installation honoring the more than 645,000 Americans who, since World War I, have been killed in military service -- has returned to the National Mall in Washington.

The tribute, a lightly reflective display of shocking red petals, is on display between the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Constitution Gardens pond.
