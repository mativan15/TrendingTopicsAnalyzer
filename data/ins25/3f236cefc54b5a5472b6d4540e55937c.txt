The population of Cobden nearly quadrupled on Saturday as people from across the region attended the final Taste of the Valley farmers market. The event was the sixth Taste of the Valley event in 2022 after being postponed during the pandemic. "Cobden was the originator for Taste of the Valley, and it's always the largest," says David Wybou, a business development officer with the County of Renfrew. One hundred and three local vendors brought their goods to sell, with nearly 3,000 people attending the market.
