The newly announced inclusion of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in mainland China's stock connect scheme with Hong Kong will help consolidate the city's role as a financial hub and bridge between China and the rest of the world, according to experts.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission have reached an in-principle agreement on the inclusion, with the goal of deepening mutual market access between the mainland and Hong Kong, according to an announcement posted on the CSRC website on Friday night.
