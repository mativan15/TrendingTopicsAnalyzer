WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. farmers in economic distress have received nearly $800 million in loan relief from the Department of Agriculture (USDA)using funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Deputy Secretary Jewel Bronaugh announced on Tuesday.

The new law allocates $3.1 billion for USDA to make loan adjustments or payments for financially distressed farmers.

USDA has paid off arrears and paid the next upcoming loan payment for roughly 11,000 farmers who were 60 days or more behind on their direct and guaranteed loans as of Sept.
