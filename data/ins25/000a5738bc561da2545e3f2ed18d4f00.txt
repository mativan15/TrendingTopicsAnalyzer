U.S. stocks traded higher on Friday in choppy trade as investors reacted to a story from the Wall Street Journal suggesting that the Federal Reserve might shift to smaller interest-rate rises after its November meeting, while also weighing some poor earnings results. Investors were also bracing for more intraday volatility in stocks as more than $1.7 trillion in notional value of options on stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds have expired, or will expire, on Friday, according to Goldman Sachs.
