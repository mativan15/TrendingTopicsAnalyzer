EDITED BY M. A. DEWOLFE HOWEFOR four years from the establishment of the Atlantic Monthly, sixty-five years ago, James Russell Lowell was its editor. His immediate successor was his friend and publisher, James T. Fields. The diaries which Mrs. Fields was writing through most of the ten years of her husband's editorship, and for some time thereafter, were full of allusions to Lowell which have not hitherto been printed. Among the many letters which she preserved there is, besides, a surprising number of characteristic communications from Lowell, both to Fields and to his wife, which Norton did not include in his Letters of James Russell Lowell, nor Scudder in his biography of Lowell.
