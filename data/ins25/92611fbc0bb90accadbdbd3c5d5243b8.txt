By Obafemi Oredein Special to Dow Jones Newswires IBADAN, Nigeria--Nigeria's inflation rate rose to 20.77% in September from 20.5% a month earlier, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. The increase marks the eighth consecutive rise this year. Inflation stood at 15.6% in January and 15.7% in February. Food-supply disruption, import-cost increases due to persistent currency depreciation and a general increase in the production costs were responsible for the rise, the NBS said in a report.
