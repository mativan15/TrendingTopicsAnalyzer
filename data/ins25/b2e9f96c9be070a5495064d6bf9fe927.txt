ErikdeGraaf/iStock via Getty Images Indonesia Energy Corp Ltd. (NYSE:INDO) is a tiny Indonesian oil company that got the attention of meme investors earlier this year as oil prices soared. Buyers of this stock clearly didn't actually do any research before buying and were only looking at it as a vehicle to trade oil prices. At the yearly high in March, their total capitalization was $665 million and that does not even factor in shares potentially used for debt payments, compared to a loss of over $6.
