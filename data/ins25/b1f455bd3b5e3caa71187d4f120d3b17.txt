The Delhi police arrested nearly 3,502 people involved in a total of 1,489 organised and unorganised betting rackets in the city this year, according to the data available till May 15. A large number of these rackets were believed to have been involved in betting on the IPL, whose 15th season came to a close on Sunday. All the arrested were booked under the Delhi Public Gambling Act. A glance at the Delhi police's data on betting rackets for the past few years suggests a constant decline in the number of such rackets operating in the Capital.
