By Joshua Kirby Shares in Adidas AG lost ground in early trade Friday after the German sporting-goods company again cut financial guidance for the year, blaming major one-off costs and slowdown in Western markets that add to existing problems in China. At 0810 GMT, shares traded 9% lower at EUR104.48. Smaller peer Puma fell 6% to EUR44.48. Late Thursday, Adidas warned that it expects a big hit to its bottom line from one-off costs largely relating to its exit from operations in Russia. Net income from continuing operations should come in at some EUR500 million ($489.
