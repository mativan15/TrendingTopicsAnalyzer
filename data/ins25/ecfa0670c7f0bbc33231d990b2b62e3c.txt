UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has announced that she will be resigning after reading a statement outside of the front door of No 10 Downing Street. Her announcement means that she lasted a mere 44 days in office, putting her amongst the greats for the shortest stints in power in the world of football managements.Truss' resignation means she has had the shortest tenure as UK PM in history, breaking the record held by George Canning of 119 days – who died in the role. However, although an impressive feat to call for a substitution before the 50-day mark, Truss has been outshone by some football managers.
