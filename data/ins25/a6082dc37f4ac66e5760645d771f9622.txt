SAN DIEGO -- Aaron Nola had been nearly perfect for 21 days.
He had been pitching his best baseball in the most important games of his life. Nola pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings Oct. 3, when the Phillies clinched their first postseason appearance since 2011 in Houston. He pitched 6 2/3 scoreless innings Oct. 8, when they clinched the National League Wild Card Series in St. Louis. He allowed one unearned run in six innings Friday, when they beat the Braves in Game 3 of the NL Division Series at Citizens Bank Park.
