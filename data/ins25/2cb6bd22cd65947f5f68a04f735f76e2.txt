Brighton, Aston Villa and Tottenham are among the WSL clubs to invest this seasonManchester United and Tottenham both threatened to gatecrash the Women's Super League top three this season, but ultimately the campaign ended with the familiar trio of Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City at the top. Outside of those three, Liverpool were the last team to win the WSL in 2014 while the domestic cups have also been largely the property of the league's dominant forces.Both domestic cup finals were contested by Emma Hayes' Chelsea and Gareth Taylor's Manchester City last season and, since Birmingham City triumphed in 2012, Chelsea have won the FA Cup four times and Arsenal and Manchester City three times each.
