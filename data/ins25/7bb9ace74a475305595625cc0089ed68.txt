About 45% of Americans started their Christmas shopping in August as retailers offered early deals in an effort to unload excess inventory, according to a survey.

Meanwhile,16% of respondents said they bought some items in early 2022 to take advantage of last year's holiday deals.

That's according to Accenture's 16th Annual Holiday Shopping Survey, which highlights insights from more than 1,500 U.S. consumers.

A parallel Accenture (NYSE: ACN) survey of 150 retail executives found that 99% said that increased promotional activity is part of their plans for the holiday season, and 98% indicated that availability guarantees will be offered during the holiday season.
