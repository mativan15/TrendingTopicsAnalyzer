CLEVELAND (AP) — Aaron Judge was dropped from the leadoff spot to No. 2 in New York's lineup for Game 3 of the AL Division Series on Saturday as the Yankees try to break the home run king out of his postseason slump.

Judge, who set the AL record with 62 home runs this season and contended for the Triple Crown, is 0 for 8 in the series with seven strikeouts. He struck out four times in New York's 4-2 loss in 10 innings in Game 2, and got booed at Yankee Stadium.

Manager Aaron Boone juggled his lineup, dropping Judge as well Anthony Rizzo from No.
