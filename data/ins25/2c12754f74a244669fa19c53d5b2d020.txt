Oct. 14—ELKHART — Keeping moving and raise money — or don't, and read a book or write instead, and still raise money.

That's the endgame of Concord South Side Elementary School's "Read Write Move" annual fundraiser that took place Friday.

"We'll do a walkathon and other different activities that we choose," third grader Madison Byer explained.

All of the activities are in some way related to reading, writing or moving. For her part, Byer chose to read to a pony and to play the drums. Other exciting activities available to students included martial arts, making birdhouses, listening to guest readers from the community, calligraphy and sports drills.
