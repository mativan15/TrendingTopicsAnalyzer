The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) share price is up 11% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 0.8% in the last year.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
