kupicoo Summary I recommend a Buy rating on Sovos Brands (NASDAQ:SOVO). It has a decent moat stemming from its portfolio of key brands, and a clear growth strategy that has been repeatedly executed successfully in the past. I believe SOVO's current valuation can generate investors a long-term IRR of 10% over the long term, but it would be better if SOVO traded down to a lower valuation, which would give investors a better margin of safety. Company overview Sovos Brands is a large food company based in the United States that focuses on acquiring and building disruptive growth brands in order to provide modern consumers with delicious food that suits their lifestyles.
