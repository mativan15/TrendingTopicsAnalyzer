Witnessing a tremendous delay in the disbursement of elderly pension over the last one and half years, the Delhi Legislative Assembly's petition committee Friday directed department officials concerned to ensure that pension gets disbursed before Diwali.
The petition was filed by Saurabh Bhardwaj before the committee requesting action on the elderly pension that had stopped four months ago.
As per the committee, elderly pensioners have not received the allowance since July as the central government allegedly did not release its share of funds in the last one and a half years and the AAP government is covering the entire expenses including the Centre's share.
