House Republican leaders slammed the White House on Thursday after it celebrated projections that gasoline prices would fall slightly in the coming weeks. "If your narrative is that gas prices are rising, well, your narrative is out of date," Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, tweeted Thursday morning.Klain's post came in response to an earlier tweet from Patrick De Haan, an oil market analyst, who projected gasoline prices would decline over the next two weeks by up to 75 cents per gallon in California and 50 cents per gallon in other parts of the country.
