(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: What you're hearing is happening at the ruins of a Roman temple. It's an orchestra playing Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir" at a popular cultural event in Lebanon - the annual Baalbeck International Festival. On stage are two young women rocking out on their electric guitars. They're Shery Bechara and Lilas Mayassi, co-founders of Lebanon's first ever thrash metal band, Slave to Sirens. They're the subject of Rita Baghdadi's new documentary called "Sirens." I spoke with Rita and Lilas and started by asking Lilas how she formed the band.
