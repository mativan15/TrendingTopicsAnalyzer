Oct. 21—ST. PAUL — The Vancouver Canucks took a one-goal lead into the third period Thursday night in Xcel Energy Center.

But given what's happened so far this season, it didn't mean a lot.

In Vancouver's first four games of the season, it held a two-goal lead. It lost all of them.

Against the winless Minnesota Wild, the lead was only one, and the Canucks let that one slip away, too. Wild forward Mats Zuccarello scored the game-tying goal on the power play at 8:31 of the third period. Then, star Kirill Kaprizov won it in overtime.
