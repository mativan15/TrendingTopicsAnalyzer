The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a Texas law requiring social media sites to post all content that expresses a "viewpoint," in at least a temporary victory for sites like Meta's (FB) Facebook and Instagram.The high court handed down the decision that grants an emergency request from tech industry lobbyists to block the law HB 20, the first of its kind in the nation. Justice Elena Kagan said she would dissent from the decision, and Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch joined in a dissenting opinion.
