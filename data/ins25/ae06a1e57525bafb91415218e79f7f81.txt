A sturdy wooden fence and security cameras fortify the Brisbane refuge where Ksenia* and her six-year-old daughter, Nyura*, have lived for the past 10 months.Camouflaged between brick homes and a cluster of trees, the refuge sits on a quiet suburban street.Inside, children run around a purple slippery dip.

'I'm grateful for what I have, but I want to move out of the refuge and find an independent place.
