The PBS show "Frontline" aired an hour-long documentary Tuesday on Michael Flynn that highlights his political activities in Sarasota County.

Michael Flynn's involvement in the Sarasota County School Board races and the Sarasota GOP is highlighted in a new PBS "Frontline" documentary about the retired general's life and political activities.

Titled "Michael Flynn's Holy War," the hour-long program aired Tuesday evening nationwide, including on WEDU in Sarasota. It included an extensive portion on Flynn's political activities since moving to Sarasota, much of which was first reported by the Herald-Tribune.
