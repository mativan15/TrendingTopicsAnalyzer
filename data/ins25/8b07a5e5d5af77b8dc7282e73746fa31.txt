Meghan Markle hopes whoever plays her in the future looks at all her "dimensions," she told Variety.

"I hope that in preparing for that role, she finds the softness and the playfulness," she said.

"Also, she can call me!" the Duchess of Sussex added.

Meghan Markle, who was an actor before becoming the Duchess of Sussex, has some thoughts about the person, or people, who might play her in depictions of the royal family in the future.

"It's all weird," she told Variety in a new cover story.
