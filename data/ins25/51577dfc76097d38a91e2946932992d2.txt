The pace of development of information technologies, the increasing number of cases of grooming of minors for sexual purposes and the lack of mechanisms for reporting child sexual abuse material are the challenges faced by authorities investigating cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse. In this regard, the Council of Europe project "Preventing and protecting children from violence including in the digital environment in the Republic of Moldova" organised a workshop on 19 October 2022 where they addressed the challenges of preventing and combating online sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.
