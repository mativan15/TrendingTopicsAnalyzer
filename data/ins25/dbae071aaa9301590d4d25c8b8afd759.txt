Wall Street's view of 2023 corporate earnings growth is lofty, which will contribute to an ongoing search for the bottom in stocks, Barclays said. Earnings are the market's Achilles heel, with the consensus view too optimistic in the face of a worsening economic outlook, especially outside of the US, the bank said in a research note Monday. Risks to profit include consumers pulling back goods spending and margins contracting because of sticky costs and wage pressures. Equities will struggle through 2023 as valuations and consensus earnings estimates are "disconnected" from fundamentals, Barclays predicted.
