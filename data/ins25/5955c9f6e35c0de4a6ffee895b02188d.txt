June 3 (Reuters) - Investors ramped up their bets on Friday on ECB interest rate rises this year, and now see bank delivering a bigger 50 basis-point hike at one of its meetings by October.

May's record 8.1% euro zone inflation print and broadening price pressures have added to the cin e for big European Central Bank rate hikes, with several policymakers saying they are open to a 50 basis-point move instead of the 25 bps increments that are widely expected .

On Friday, money markets priced in 125 bps of hikes by year-end and 100 bps by October.
