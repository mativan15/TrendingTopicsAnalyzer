Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see CNO Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:CNO) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, CNO Financial Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of June.
