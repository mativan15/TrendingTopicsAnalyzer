Large banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup had to pause share repurchases earlier this year in light of higher regulatory capital requirements that will come into play in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC 1.62%) has plenty of capital but put off repurchases due to the uncertain economic outlook and market volatility. That makes Bank of America (BAC 3.75%) the only bank in its peer group that not only repurchased shares in the third quarter of the year, but also will continue to be able to do so for the remainder of the year.
