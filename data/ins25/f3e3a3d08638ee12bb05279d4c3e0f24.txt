Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson has now played through two and a half games with a partially torn lat. He got an injection in his right shoulder to help ease pain after Week 5, and the Broncos iced the quarterback's shoulder on the sideline in between drives in Week 6.

Wilson then suffered another injury — a hamstring — against the Los Angeles Chargers, coach Nathaniel Hackett announced after the game.

Wilson said after a 19-16 loss that the injury happened in the fourth quarter.

'Yeah, I got my hammy,' Wilson said after the game.
