A first-generation iPhone from 2007, still unopened in its original box, has fetched more than $39,000 at auction.

That's more than 65 times its original price of $599, or roughly $860 in today's dollars.

The phone has a 3.5-inch screen, a 2-megapixel camera, and the Safari web browser.

If you had bought the first-generation iPhone when it debuted in 2007, it would've cost you $599.
