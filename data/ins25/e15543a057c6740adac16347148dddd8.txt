One of the most powerful—and potentially damaging—space weather phenomena are G5 storms. But what exactly is a G5 storm and what kind of effects can it have on Earth?Space weather is a term used to describe the phenomena that occur in the space environment between the sun, Earth and beyond. It originates from solar activity and can manifest itself in various different ways, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections and geomagnetic storms, among many others.While the Earth's magnetic field largely protects us from charged particles emitted by the sun, space weather phenomena can sometimes have an impact on our planet, interfering with life and technological infrastructure, both in space and on the ground.
