To be honest, some of us might be a little sceptical about whether a Government that can't even cover up a party in a brewery, never mind organising one, is really capable of conquering the rest of the universe.
Still, never mind. At least the ambition is there. The UK is pumping money into what are perceived as the high-growth strategic industries of the future at an unprecedented rate.
There is, in fairness, a strong argument for that. A range of industries are changing very rapidly, and, freed from the restrictions imposed by the European Union, the UK could well be a world leader in at least a few of them.
