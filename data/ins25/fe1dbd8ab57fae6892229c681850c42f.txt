SAN DIEGO -- Behind a frenzied sold-out crowd at Petco Park on Friday night, the Padres took a 2-1 lead in the National League Division Series with a 2-1 win over the Dodgers in Game 3.
It was the first postseason game in front of fans at Petco Park since 2006, and now San Diego is just one win away from reaching the NL Championship Series for the first time since 1998.
Outfielder Trent Grisham was again the hero, hitting the go-ahead and decisive homer in the fourth inning. He's hit three homers this postseason and has the Padres on the precipice of a major upset over the rival Dodgers, who won 22 more games than San Diego during the regular season.
