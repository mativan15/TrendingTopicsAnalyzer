Interdisciplinary artist Paul Vanouse will present at IGNITE at 12:30 p.m. Oct. 21 in the University of Nebraska–Lincoln's Johnny Carson Center for Emerging Media Arts. The IGNITE colloquium involves guest lectures, workshops and seminars around creative and professional development. IGNITE is free and open to the public. Vanouse will be discussing his most recent project, 'Labor' (2019), a scent-based, bio-media installation that produces the scent of human sweat — not with humans, but with three glass bioreactors.
