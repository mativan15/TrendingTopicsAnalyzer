The Dutch government has been ordered to take 'immediate action' to help those most at risk at the country's chronically overcrowded main refugee reception centre at Ter Apel – rather than wait until judges hear its appeal next month against an injunction ordering it to act.That injunction, issued a fortnight ago by a court in The Hague in response to an application by the refugee NGO, Vluchtelingenwerk, instructed the government to comply urgently with EU guidelines on the provision of emergency aid and with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
