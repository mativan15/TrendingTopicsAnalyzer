With a median price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of close to 15x in Australia, you could be forgiven for feeling indifferent about Etherstack plc's (ASX:ESK) P/E ratio of 16.2x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.

Recent times have been advantageous for Etherstack as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising.
