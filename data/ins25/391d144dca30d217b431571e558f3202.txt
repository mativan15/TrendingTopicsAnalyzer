The West Division Cyber Crime Police are probing a case where the bank account of a business woman was allegedly misused to make several benami transactions worth several crores of rupees, without her knowledge or consent. Nisarga Gowda, a resident of Vijay Nagar who runs multiple businesses, alleged that she received a message two months ago one that her account had been credited with ₹4 crore. Next morning when she went to the bank to check, the bank officials reportedly said no such transactions had taken place and the message was probably a mistake.
