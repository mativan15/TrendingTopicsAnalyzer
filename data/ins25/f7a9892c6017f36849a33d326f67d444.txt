At the end, they lifted him up, the guy who could barely stand on his own.

The Chargers hoisted kicker Dustin Hopkins into the air after he ignored the pain and lifted his team to a 19-16 overtime victory over Denver at SoFi Stadium.

Playing with a hamstring he said he felt 'pop' on a second-quarter extra point, Hopkins booted four field goals, including a 39-yarder nearly eight minutes into the extra session.

'Before every kick, you knew it was going to feel like someone was stabbing you with a knife,' Hopkins said.
