Jun. 5—Terry Dorsey needed a gimmick, and he needed it fast. Something clever and genuinely funny that would make people laugh.

The 32-year-old morning deejay had just jumped from a radio station in Dayton, Ohio to the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Dorsey made it to the big time in 1981, alright. But whether he would remain there depended on his ability to turn around the struggling morning show he had inherited.

Like many of his on-air colleagues, Dorsey's life had been an interesting journey. Born and raised in Cincinnati, he graduated high school just in time to be drafted for the Vietnam War, where he helped defuse landmines as a combat engineer.
