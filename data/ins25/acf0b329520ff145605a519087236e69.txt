Average energy bills for most consumers could double next April, analysts warned yesterday, after Jeremy Hunt announced a 'new approach' to the existing two-year price freeze.The new chancellor said that, in order to save money, the Treasury would review the existing freeze that limits average annual gas and electricity bills to £2,500 a year.Hunt said the cap would remain in place until April but after that would be subject to a 'Treasury-led review' that would cost the taxpayer 'significantly less than planned whilst ensuring enough support for those in need'.
