May 28—It'll cost a bit more, but the Henderson County Sheriff's Office is entering a new contract with Southern Health Partners for service at the detention center.

HCSO has had a contract with Southern Health Partners since 2010. The company has more than 25 years experience in developing medical programs for detention centers.

Sheriff Botie Hillhouse said when the new contract goes into effect in October the cost will increase by 4%.

"It's written in the contract that they can go up a small percentage every year and this is only the third or fourth time they've chosen to do this," he said.
