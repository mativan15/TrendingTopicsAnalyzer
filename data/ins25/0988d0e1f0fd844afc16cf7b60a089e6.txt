Kiwi couples are selling up and hitting the road on working holidays Couple saving $1000 a week while working in Central Otago Labour welcomed by horticulture and viticulture sector Forget the big OE. Some Kiwi couples are choosing the stay-at-home version of the working holiday – the DE (domestic experience). Wendy and John Critchley (aged 47 and 48) have left their home, jobs and possessions behind in favour of the open road and the promise of different jobs every month. Based in Alexandra since December, the couple have been working on a dairy farm, but they have a wealth of skills they hope to utilise on the road – Wendy's experience as a chef and John's in painting and decorating.
