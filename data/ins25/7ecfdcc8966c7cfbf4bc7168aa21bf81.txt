It is fitting that the Nobel Committee has recognised Douglas Diamond , along with his co-author, Phil Dybvig, as well as Ben Bernanke for the 2022 Nobel Prize in Economics. In many ways, Doug is the father of modern banking theory.His 1983 work with Dybvig, 'Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,' (bit.ly/3Trq3iC), explains how the important value banks provide - of allowing investors to benefit from the high returns from long-term investing while allowing those who need liquidity to withdraw their money without experiencing large losses - also exposes banks to depositor runs.
