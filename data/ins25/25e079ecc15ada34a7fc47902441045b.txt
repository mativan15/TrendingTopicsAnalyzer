By Anita Komuves BUDAPEST, June 2 (Reuters) - The Hungarian forint traded near an all-time low versus the Polish zloty on Thursday, as the two currencies took different paths after the European Commission approved recovery funds for Poland while a deal for Hungary was still pending. "The forint has already been a pariah among CEE currencies recently, but since the announcement... the gap between the zloty and the forint further widened," an FX trader in Budapest said. On Wednesday the European Commission approved billions of euros in COVID-19 economic recovery funds for Poland, but the money will not flow until Warsaw makes reforms to the judiciary, the EU executive arm said.
