Shares of Tesla fell after the electric vehicle maker reported third-quarter revenue that missed analyst estimates. In a note to investors, tech analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein said Musk's performance on the "earnings call didn't sit well with us." The company said on its earnings call that, while it expects 50% annual growth in production this year, its deliveries may fall just under 50% growth "due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year." Shares of Tesla slid about 6% Thursday morning as investors digested the company's third-quarter earnings report from Wednesday evening.
