ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - The Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association says a government proposal to give the health minister a say in licensing would compromise a basic tenet of the profession.

In a letter dated Sunday, the association says the change would undermine the principle of medical self-regulation by bringing the minister inside the regulatory process.

It says the move would make Newfoundland and Labrador unique in the country, as no other province allows its health minister such power.
