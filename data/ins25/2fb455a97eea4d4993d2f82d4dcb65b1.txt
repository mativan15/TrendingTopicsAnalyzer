No. 4 Tennessee (6-0, 3-0 SEC) will host UT Martin (4-2, 3-0 OVC) Saturday at Neyland Stadium in Week 8.

Kickoff is slated for noon EDT and SEC Network will televise the in-state homecoming matchup.

Tennessee announced the Vols will wear white helmets, orange jerseys, orange pants and Summitt Blue accessories against UT Martin.

In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Title IX, University of Tennessee athletics updated its brand standards and renamed the blue accent color historically associated with the Lady Vols to Summitt Blue.
