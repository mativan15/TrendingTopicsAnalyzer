If memory serves, Murder, She Wrote was on near constant rotation on RTÉ in the 80s and 90s. It seemed like it was on after Mass on a Sunday, yet also on a Sunday evening after the six o'clock news and again magically squeezed somewhere between Where in the World and Glenroe, if it wasn't replacing them completely. It was also broadcast every weekday around 11am, and then again at 4pm. On weekday evenings it would jostle with McGyver and Matlock for the 8pm slot. Then it was back midmorning on a Saturday and then once before and once after Baywatch for good measure.
