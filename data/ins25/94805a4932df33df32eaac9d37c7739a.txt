Loan demand in the June quarter exceeded the pre-pandemic levels, a credit information company said on Thursday. In its Credit Market Indicator (CMI) report, Transunion Cibil said there was also a corresponding increase in new accounts opened. The CMI reached 99 in June 2022, a level last seen in December 2019 before the pandemic hit the world. The company said its CMI is a comprehensive measure of data elements that are summarised monthly to analyse changes in credit market health, and categorised under four pillars of demand, supply, consumer behaviour, and performance.
