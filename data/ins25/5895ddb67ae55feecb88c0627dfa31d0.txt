Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) is all for sticking up for her best pal Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in upcoming episodes of EastEnders as she discovers Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) recent attempt at blackmailing Mick's (Danny Dyer) ex.
Recently, fearing Mick would get back with Linda, Janine offered her £25k to leave Walford and never return.
 Initially, it looked as though Linda would take the cash (which soon turned into £50k) and depart life in Albert Square, but she left Janine stunned when she defiantly announced she isn't going anywhere and won't give the money back.
