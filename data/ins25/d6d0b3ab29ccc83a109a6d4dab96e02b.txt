Representatives from the biggest sports leagues and competitions in the world arrived at Tel Aviv's Bloomfield Stadium last week for an expo of new Israeli technological innovations in the field of sports.

Future Sport Israel 2022, led by the Israel Export & International Cooperation Institute and the Economy Ministry's Foreign Trade Administration, hosted delegates from the most popular sports leagues around the globe who came to see how Israeli tech can innovate both players' performance on the pitch and the organization's financial performance off it.
