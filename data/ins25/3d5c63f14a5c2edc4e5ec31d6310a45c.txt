The Hotel Council of San Francisco, the nonprofit representing 200 of the city's largest hotels and advocating for hospitality interests, has brought in some fresh blood to its board of directors.

The 24-member directing board will grow to 27 with the addition of Franco Finn, known as the 'hype man' for the Golden State Warriors, but here representing Alaska Airlines; Sheena Way, the Warriors' vice president overseeing Chase Center and Thrive City programming; and Gail Isono representing the Harbor Court Hotel.
