jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) shares gained on Thursday after the freight transportation provider filed a Form 10 to spin off its brokered transportation platform. The firm has forwarded its intentions to separate the business since March, creating two separate, publicly traded companies. Management indicated the spinoff is aimed at increasing focus on the asset-based less-than-truckload business and free cash flow for XPO while creating a robust public company in the standalone brokerage platform.
