OXFORD, Miss. — TJ Finley, who started Auburn football's first three games of the season at quarterback before being benched for Robby Ashford, replaced Ashford under center during the first quarter of the Tigers' game at Ole Miss.

Ashford, a redshirt freshman, had started Auburn's last three games.

The Tigers (3-3, 1-2 SEC) gained just 26 yards of offense on their first three drives and trailed 14-0 by the time Finley entered the game with two minutes to go in the first quarter.

Finley hadn't played since Auburn's 41-12 loss to Penn State on Sept.
