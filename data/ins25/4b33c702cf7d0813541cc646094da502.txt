The first two episodes of "The Peripheral" are now streaming on Prime Video. The show is a new addition to an already extensive list of dramas centered around the concept of apocalypse and time travel. The show revolves around the story of a young woman, Flynne Fisher. She lives an everyday life while working and caring for her ailing mother, Ella Fisher. Flynne's brother Burton Fisher spends most of his time playing games. Flynn's best friend, Billy Ann, tells her that she is wasting her time at the printing shop and should play games to earn extra money.
