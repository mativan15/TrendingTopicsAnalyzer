Russia is set to build a new university campus on the Chinese tropical island of Hainan, which will focus on science and technology research and studies.

The campus forms part of Russia's existing national research university called the Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI). The public university was founded in 1930 and offers training in the fields of power engineering, electric engineering, radio engineering, electronics, information technologies, and management.

As the South China Morning Post (Opens in a new window) reports, the Hainan province has been trying to bolster its education sector by providing a greater range of foreign institutions.
