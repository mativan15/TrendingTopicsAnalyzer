For credit unions across the state, the most common trend currently has been digital transformation.

'Because of the pandemic, the emphasis has been more on the digital world, and so digital adoption has been a priority in terms of servicing our members,' Gary Fukuroku, CEO of Maui County Federal Credit Union, told Pacific Business News. 'And it'll probably continue to [be] so in the future.'

Hawaii State Federal Credit Union has updated its digital banking technology and is launching a person-to-person payment feature within its mobile app that 'allows you to send money to anyone just by using their mobile number,' according to President and CEO Andrew Rosen.
