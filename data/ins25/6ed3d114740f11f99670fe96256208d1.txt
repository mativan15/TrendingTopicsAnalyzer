Rishi Sunak held an early advantage in the latest race for the Conservative Party leadership, with the former chancellor securing the backing of at least 100 Tory MPs and ensuring he'll proceed to the ballot of party members next week if he publicly declares his candidacy.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood tweeted late Friday that he was 'honoured' to take Sunak to the three-figure threshold.
