MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has shaken off criticism against the country's defense ministry for refusing to appear before legislators to explain a major cyber hack, resulting in a massive data breach.

Lopez Obrador asked the opposition to calm down and have some tea, during a regular news conference on Tuesday, describing the criticism as politically motivated.

"It's politics, don't give importance to that, it's not news," Lopez Obrador said when asked about whether General Luis Sandoval, who heads the defense ministry, enjoys privileges.
