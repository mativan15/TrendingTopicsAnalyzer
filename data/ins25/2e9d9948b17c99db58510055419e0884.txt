Chemical company DGL Group, led by controversial businessman Simon Henry, is delisting from the New Zealand stock exchange because its board believes there is no benefit from remaining listed in New Zealand. A note to the New Zealand stock exchange on Friday afternoon said DGL would move to a sole listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. Shares in DGL recently lost a third of their value after Henry, the company's chief executive, founder and majority shareholder, made disparaging remarks about My Food Bag brand ambassador Nadia Lim.
