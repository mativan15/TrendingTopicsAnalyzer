Oct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures slipped on Thursday, with those of the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, after Tesla failed to meet estimates for quarterly revenue and warned of missing its vehicle delivery target.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker dropped 6.1% in premarket trading as the company flagged persistent logistics challenges, with fourth-quarter deliveries growing by less than the aimed 50%.
