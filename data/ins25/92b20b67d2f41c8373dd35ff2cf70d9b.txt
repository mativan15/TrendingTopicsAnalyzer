Not only is Caleb McLaughlin one of today's top young actors, but he's also quite financially responsible for his age.

McLaughlin's career took off in 2016 after 'Stranger Things' premiered on Netflix. With the hit show's new season currently streaming, CNBC reports that he didn't make any big purchases until the season prior.

The Big Purchase

Reportedly earning $250,000 per episode, McLaughlin didn't touch much of his money until last year after season three, when he bought a Tesla Model X, which retails starting at $106,590, according to the outlet.
