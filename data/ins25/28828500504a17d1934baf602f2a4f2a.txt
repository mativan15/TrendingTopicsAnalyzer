Gareth Bale is ‘ready' to inflict more Champions League final misery on Liverpool tonight.
The Wales international has become a forgotten man at Real Madrid, starting just four games this season having returned from a loan spell back at Tottenham last summer.
The 32-year-old will leave the Spanish capital when his contract expires next month having played a key role in some of Real's biggest successes over the last decade.
Bale has won four Champions League titles with Los Blancos, scoring twice against Liverpool in their 2018 clash against Liverpool in Kyiv.
