It's been years of rumour and six-hour return trips for locals looking for affordable home goods from Australian retail giant Kmart. On Thursday, the company finally confirmed they would be returning to Dunedin. The city was possibly the retailer's biggest gap in the New Zealand market, according to Ben Smith​, Kmart's property group general manager. 'We've got a fantastic support base in Dunedin, it's amazing, I've heard of customers driving to Invercargill just to shop at Kmart,' he said.
