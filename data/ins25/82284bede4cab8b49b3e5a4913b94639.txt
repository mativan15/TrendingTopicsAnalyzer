Midland States Bank is seeking to evict Barat Academy, a private Chesterfield high school with a history of financial troubles.

The Effingham, Illinois-based bank said in a lawsuit filed Oct. 3 in St. Louis County Circuit Court that it owns Barat's property, at 17815 Wild Horse Creek Road, and that the school has retained possession of the property past its lease.

The bank also said it has sustained damages of $48,000, and that the value of monthly rent at the property is $16,000 a month.

It asked the court to award award it possession of the property, double the monthly rent from Oct.
