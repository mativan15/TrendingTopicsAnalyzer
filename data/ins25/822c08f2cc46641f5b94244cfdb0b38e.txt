Had the Premier League season started on 30 August, when Gary O'Neil was appointed Bournemouth boss on a caretaker basis following Scott Parker's dismissal, the club would be fifth in the table, just five points behind Arsenal. Bournemouth have picked up 10 points from six games under O'Neil. They have drawn four of those games but, since he took over, they are the only unbeaten team in the Premier League.For a side that had been expected to drop straight back into the Championship, which they may well have done had Parker remained at the helm, O'Neil deserves a lot of praise.
