Russia's President gave the go-ahead for his troops to invade Ukraine on February 24 after more than 100,000 of his country's troops had spent weeks massing on the border. But Vladimir Putin's war plan has suffered several hammer blows along the way, coming up against courageous Ukrainian resistance whose troops have forced Russian soldiers out of cities they had been confident of occupying. The Russian President has also lost several of his high-ranking officials in the brutal battle.Now, he has suffered a devastating blow after the Ukrainian 80th Paratrooper-Storm Brigade destroyed a unit of the Russian 104 Paratrooper-Storm Regiment (76th Division).
