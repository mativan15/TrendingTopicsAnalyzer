A former principal and CEO of Lincoln Charter School in York has pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining and misapplying money from his employer, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

Leonard Hart, 50, of Mount Wolf misrepresented that he was pursuing a Ph.D. and sought tuition reimbursement through the charter school, which receives funding from the U.S. Department of Education primarily because it serves a high number of children from low-income backgrounds, a news release states.
