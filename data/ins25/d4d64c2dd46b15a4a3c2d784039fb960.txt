If domestic violence was happening in front of you, would you know how to respond?

For many people, the answer is no. South Suburban College is addressing that issue by conducting live and virtual bystander intervention trainings as part of Domestic Violence Awareness Month activities.

'What we are trying to do is teach how to be aware that a domestic violence situation might be unfolding and if they were to encounter a situation — at school, in their own homes or out in the community, at athletic events or a party — the skill set to be able to do something about it,' said Alexandra Glumac, who is facilitating the training.
