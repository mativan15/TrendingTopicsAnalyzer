The Enforcement Directorate's allegation that AAP leader Satyendar Jain's wife Poonam Jain was a member of a trust which is under a money laundering investigation was based on mistaken identity with a Rohini-based woman with the same name, the defence counsel for two co-accused in the case told a Delhi court Thursday.
The ED had accused Satyendar Jain of being the president of Lala Sher Singh Trust, which is under investigation in the money laundering case against him. The agency had earlier told the court that Poonam was a member of the trust.
