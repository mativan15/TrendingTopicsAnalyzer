The Telangana unit of Bharatiya Janata Party is in an upbeat mood following a proposal of the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership to hold its national executive meeting in Hyderabad on July 2 and 3. 'The party leadership is yet to make an official announcement in this regard but reports that Hyderabad is being considered for the national executive committee meeting is definitely an exciting news for all of us,' Telangana BJP spokesman NV Subhash told HT. On Wednesday, BJP national organising secretary BL Santosh, along with party general secretary in-charge of Telangana Tarun Chugh and other senior leaders of the party visited various places, including some star hotels, to finalise the venue.
