Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy dipped slightly in May as more Americans continue to express pessimism about the state of the job market and business conditions. 
On Tuesday, the Conference Board published its monthly survey results for consumer confidence and it found that positive sentiments had eroded from 108.6 in April to 106.4. 
Broken down further, Conference Board's Present Situation Index — a measure of consumers' sentiments about current business and labor conditions — dipped from 152.
