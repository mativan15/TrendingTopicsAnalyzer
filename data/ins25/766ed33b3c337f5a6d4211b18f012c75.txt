The LSU Tigers entered Sunday night's game just one win away from advancing to the super regionals.
Just like on Saturday night, they trailed heading into the ninth inning against Southern Miss. But this time, there was no late-inning magic to win the game as the Golden Eagles won 8-4 and sent the regional to a winner-take-all Game 7 tomorrow at 3 p.m. CT.
The Tigers started the game off strong with a two-run Cade Doughty dinger in the top of the first inning before Samuel Dutton took the mound. In the bottom of the second, Southern Miss tied the game 2-2 with a couple of runs before chasing Dutton from the mound after only 2.
