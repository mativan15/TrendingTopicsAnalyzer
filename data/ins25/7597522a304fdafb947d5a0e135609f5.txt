Tottenham have been told that they could beat rivals Chelsea to the £77million signing of Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig. The Blues came close to completing a deal for the defender in the summer as co-owner and acting sporting director Todd Boehly took spending at Stamford Bridge to over £200m, but other defensive signings came into the club instead.Chelsea signed Kalidou Koulibaly, Wesley Fofana and Marc Cucurella but it was rumoured that the Blues were in talks over a £77m fee for Gvardiol, although he would have remained at the Bundesliga club until next summer.
