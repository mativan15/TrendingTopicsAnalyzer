There was supposed to be rain Wednesday during the normal morning commute from Van Buren to Fort Smith for Jody Cantrell.

So Cantrell decided not to drive his motorcycle. He picked the Hummer instead.

With high gas prices advertised on the digital billboard outside the Shell station near Interstate 540 and Rogers Avenue, Cantrell wished he was in the Hummer. There was no rain at all, just hot sunny skies.

"Gas prices are ridiculous," Cantrell said as he pumped the 32-gallon tank in the 2007 Hummer H2 until it was full.
