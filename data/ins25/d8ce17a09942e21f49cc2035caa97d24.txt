Varun Berry has been appointed chairman of Go First (formerly Go Air), weeks after he was named vice chairman and managing director of Wadia Group flagship Britannia, said people with knowledge of the matter. Berry, 61, who was a director at the carrier, will steer the company in a challenging environment for aviation ahead of plans to tap the capital market. He succeeds group promoter Nusli Wadia, 78, who becomes chairman emeritus. Ben Baldanza, former CEO of US carrier Spirit Airlines, will continue as vice chairman of GoAir, having come on board in March last year.
