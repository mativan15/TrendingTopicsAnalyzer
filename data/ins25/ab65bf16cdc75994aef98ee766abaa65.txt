After a couple of painful quarters of subscriber loss, Netflix has made good on its promises to rebound. The streaming service brought in 2.4 million new subscribers in the last quarter, after losing one million in the prior quarter and 200,000 before that.Its earnings report today reveals that just over half of those gains (1.4 million) came from the Asia-Pacific region, though all tracked segments (United States and Canada; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and Latin America) saw growth compared to last quarter.
