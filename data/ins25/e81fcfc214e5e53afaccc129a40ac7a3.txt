BELFAST, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The British government may be forced to trigger a Northern Ireland election next week but talks between London and Brussels on trade rules governing the region would not be frozen during campaigning, a government minister said.The pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) refused to join a compulsory coalition in Northern Ireland following the region's May Assembly election in which Irish nationalist rivals Sinn Fein became the largest party for the first time.The DUP says it will not join until its concerns about the post Brexit trading arrangements for the region as set out in the Northern Ireland Protocol are resolved.
