Few sports have proven themselves to be as reliably cinematic as boxing. It's a duel between two individuals, and as such, the matches are always intensely personal. It's no wonder, then, that boxing has been a subject of moving pictures since basically the second they were created, and has even been central to several major video games.
In that time, though, some movies, from Raging Bull to the upcoming Creed III, have really expanded what a boxing movie can do. Some of these movies focus on real people, and others on invented figures, but each of them is a thrilling sports spectacle, and that's what made all of them worthy of this list.
