The Independent's petition calling for a general election to resolve the political turmoil in Westminster has already collected over 300,000 signatures from members of the public exasperated with the ongoing state of chaos within the Conservative government.The ousting of prime minister Liz Truss on Thursday and the emerging possibility of the deposed and discredited Boris Johnson joining the race to succeed her has only given the project fresh momentum and renewed impetus.Opposition leaders Sir Keir Starmer, Sir Ed Davey and Nicola Sturgeon have all likewise insisted that a general election is now mandatory to restore order to British politics but the Tories have so far insisted they remain fit to govern and will rally around a new leader, who will be selected by the end of next week.
