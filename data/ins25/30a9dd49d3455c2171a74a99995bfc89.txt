Whether that will curb an widening economic slowdown and restore faith in the authoritarian system remains unclear. The party has 96 million members and has long run its own internal system of keeping cadres in line through a mix of offering privileges and threatening severe punishment for taking bribes, selling offices or otherwise abusing their authority.
