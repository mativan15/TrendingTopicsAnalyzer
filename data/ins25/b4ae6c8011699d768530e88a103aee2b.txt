Calgary is experiencing warmer than usual temperatures this fall, but winter is fast approaching and a local outreach group is already pressuring the city to make better preparations to care for unhoused individuals. The city's community development committee recently approved $2.3 million over the next four years to the Calgary Homeless Foundation (CHF) through its Community Safety Investment Framework (CSIF). The city also said it would be investing $1.2 million for The Alex mobile response team alongside the Calgary Police Service and putting in more than $2 million towards the Alpha House's Downtown Addiction Outreach Partnership (DOAP).
