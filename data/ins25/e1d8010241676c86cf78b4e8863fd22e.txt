If you think you're seeing a lot more Tesla cars on the roads, you're right.

Record numbers of electric cars have been sold in California this year. And the automaker, whose original manufacturing plant is in Fremont, accounts for more than half the number of electric cars sold in the state this year, according to the California Energy Commission.

Out of 1.4 million vehicles sold statewide in the first three quaters of this year, 250,486, or 17.7%, were zero emission vehicles, or ZEVs, the energy commission reported.
