Washington – A member of the far-right Oath Keepers told a jury on Tuesday that he traveled to Washington, D.C., and stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election win.

"I threw my rifle and pistol in the car…and ultimately ended up on the steps of the Capitol, moving into the Capitol building, to try and stop Congress from certifying [Biden's presidency]," Jason Dolan testified during the trial of five Oath Keepers – including founder Stewart Rhodes – who stand accused of conspiring to use force to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
