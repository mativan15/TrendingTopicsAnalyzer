As we enter June, specific macroeconomic trends are taking center stage. Supply shortages are persisting, inflation is rearing its ugly head, economic reopening is changing spending patterns, and uncertainty about the direction of the pandemic has not ended. 
eBay (EBAY 5.06%) is a company that I think can do well in that economic backdrop. The asset-light business model can protect against rising costs, and eBay is where consumers go when things are sold out everywhere else. 
More importantly, eBay has done an excellent job at growing earnings over the past decade, which can sustainably fund its dividend payment.
