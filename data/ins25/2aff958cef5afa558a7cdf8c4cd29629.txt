After a walk from our hotel, I said, 'Hey, let's duck into this building. I have always wanted to say that I was once in the Chicago Tribune building.'

So just three or four steps off Michigan Avenue, we entered into an area that completely stopped me cold. Outside, the sign on the building now says the Tribune Residences, so I thought it would be just an 'in and out' – but it certainly was not. The Tribune Tower was built in the early 1920s and its neo-Gothic design looked like King Arthur and his knights resided there.
