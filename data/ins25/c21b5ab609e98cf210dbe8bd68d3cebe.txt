Former President Barack Obama warned fellow Democrats not to focus their energies on his successor Donald Trump's antics heading into the 2022 midterm elections, saying the party should instead aim to prove its value to voters as Republicans have sought to broaden their appeal beyond the closest adherents to Trump's "Make America great again" movement.In his first major interview of the 2022 midterm election cycle over the weekend, Obama told Pod Save America hosts Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor that the modern Democratic Party has seemingly become absorbed with maligning the "outrageous behaviors" of Trump and GOP candidates in his mold.
