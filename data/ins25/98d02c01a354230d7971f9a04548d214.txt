Fresno businessman Chris Pacheco spoke emotionally in Fresno County Superior Court Thursday about feeling betrayed by his former business manager, who embezzled more than half a million dollars from his companies.

The former business manager, Shannon Andrade (formerly Standifer), was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for siphoning thousands of dollars in cash from the bank accounts of A-Plus Signs and Mega Prints.

Judge James Kelley also ordered Andrade to pay restitution of $513,667.
