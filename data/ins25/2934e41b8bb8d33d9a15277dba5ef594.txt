Barring an unforeseen setback, it sounds as though the Cowboys' starting quarterback will be back on the field Sunday at AT&T Stadium.

Dak is (all but) back.

After missing five games with a broken thumb on his throwing hand suffered late in the Week 1 loss on Sept. 11, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott is trending toward a return to the field Sunday at AT&T Stadium against the Detroit Lions.

Prescott said after last Sunday night's loss in Philadelphia that he plans to return in Week 7.

And on his weekly radio appearance on 105.
