LONDON (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs banker and self-proclaimed whistleblower is suing his former employer for more than 20 million pounds ($23 million) for unfair dismissal in a London claim the Wall Street bank has labelled "cynical" and "lamentable".

The bank said the claim by Thomas Doyle, its former EMEA head of synthetic swap sales who is suing Goldman Sachs International and four senior bankers, was "scarcely believable".
