WWE boss Triple H has reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss tonight's episode of Raw.
The former world champion – whose real name is Paul Levesque – took over the company's creative direction following his father-in-law Vince McMahon's retirement, and currently serves as chief content officer while leading the talent relations division.
Metro.co.uk understands that Triple H has tested positive for Covid and he'll miss tonight's episode.
As reported by PWInsider, he's said he is ‘feeling well and in good spirits' but under the company's current protocol, he will be away from his in-person duties.
