Sleepers: No. 5 Central Catholic, No. 11 Boston Latin, No. 14 Needham, No. 8 Longmeadow.Players to watch: Ava Connaughton (Westwood), Lucy Davis (Lincoln-Sudbury), Reagan O'Brien (Boston Latin), Grace Lydon (Central Catholic), Alanna Dumalac (Wellesley), Caroline Whelan (Walpole), Shea Berigan (Hingham).Analysis: Westwood is the clear favorite, but there are many other teams capable of hoisting the trophy. It's very possible Westwood and Franklin will meet again in the state final, but balanced teams such as Lincoln-Sudbury, Central Catholic, and Walpole hope to prevent a rematch.
