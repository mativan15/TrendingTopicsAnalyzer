NEW DELHI: Reflecting the strength of the Indian capital market, the sharp depreciation in the Indian rupee has failed to have a severe impact on Sensex and Nifty. The Indian rupee, which plunged below the 83 mark for the first time on Wednesday to hit a fresh record low against the US dollar, has so far depreciated over 11% against the American currency year-to-date. Nifty, on the other hand, is up around 1% so far in the calendar year 2022.

The domestic currency hit another record low of 83.075 in morning session on Thursday.
