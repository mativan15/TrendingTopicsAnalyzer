We're all familiar with farm-to-table. But what about sheep-to-sleep? In the era of hyper-localisation, that's the message being proffered by Floks, a Yorkshire-based woollen bedding brand offering duvets, pillows and mattress toppers filled with the fleeces of sheep that graze the British countryside. Founded in 2021, Floks sources from the hardy Cheviot breed, farmed since the 1400s in the Scottish borders. As it turns out, it has a lustrous white wool that's quite lovely to laze under. 'Customers have sent me their improved Fitbit sleep scores after buying our pillows,' says founder Sophie Platts, who began her love affair with woollen bedding when trying to solve her own nighttime woes: she kept waking up sweating, and organic cotton or linen sheets weren't making a difference.
