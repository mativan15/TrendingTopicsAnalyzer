By PA Media Published: 02:34 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 02:34 EDT, 21 October 2022 Government borrowing swelled to £20 billion in September amid a surge in debt interest due to inflation, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the reading for borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, marked the second-highest September on record, only surpassed during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Borrowing in September outpaced the predictions of economists, who had forecast £17 billion for the month, and was significantly above the £14.
