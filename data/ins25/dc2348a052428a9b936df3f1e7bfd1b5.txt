Mac Jones is back. According to ESPN's Mike Reiss, the young Patriots QB will be available on Monday to start against the Chicago Bears after missing the past three starts with a high ankle sprain.

Jones injured his ankle in Week 3 against the Baltimore Ravens. He bent his leg awkwardly while being taken down by Calais Campbell and was replaced with Brian Hoyer, who started in his place against the Green Bay Packers in Week 4. However, after less than one quarter of that game, Hoyer sustained a concussion and was replaced by Bailey Zappe, a QB the Patriots selected in the fourth round of the 2022 NFL draft.
