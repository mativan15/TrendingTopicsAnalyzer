By Kyle Morris CPPGroup PLC said Wednesday that it is launching a new strategy and change management program after completing a review. The provider of assistance and insurance products said that under its new strategy it plans to exit the legacy business and to migrate to an insurtech business, led by the Blink product and supported by CPP India and CPP Turkey. It said insurtech businesses generally have attractive economics that generate high levels of repeat business. The legacy U.K. and European card protection business has been in decline since 2012 and could become unprofitable and a significant drain on resources.
