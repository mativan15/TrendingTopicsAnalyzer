The State government is exploring the possibility of restructuring the scale of finance (SoF) for crops in a scientific manner. The SoF forms the basis for determining the credit for various crops. The State Agricultural Prices Board (SAPB) on Wednesday organised a consultative meet attended by banks, officials of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the State Agriculture department and farmers to discuss the current guidelines and how best the SoF can be redesigned to reflect the cost of cultivation borne by farmers.
