Tencent Holding Ltd (OTC:TCEHY) boosted share repurchases to spend over $3 billion in 2022 as the company's stock price plunged to four-year lows.  The Shenzhen-based company has focused on returning cash to shareholders with its outlook dented by China's sagging economy and President Xi Jinping's crackdown on gaming, the Financial Times reported. Tencent increased its buyback outlay to HK$600 million ($76 million) last week, which could hit HK$90 billion next year, on par with the buyback program at rival Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Bernstein analysts estimate.
