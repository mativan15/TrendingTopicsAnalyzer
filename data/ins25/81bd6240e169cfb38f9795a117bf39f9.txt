Kevin Simon was 18 years old in September 1995 when he helped his cousin Anthony 'Dudley' George move picnic tables into the sandy parking lot of the Ipperwash Provincial Park to serve as a blockade to the park's entrance.

Shortly after, Dudley George was shot by the Ontario Provincial Police.

Simon is in his mid-forties now and admits that 'a lot of stuff I thought I had dealt with and overcome' surfaced as he and other Aazhoodenaang Enjibaajig/Nishnaabeg of Stoney Point told their story in the new book, Our Long Struggle for Home: The Ipperwash Story.
