(Bloomberg) -- Digital wealth platform Endowus Pte acquired a majority stake in an independent wealth manager in Hong Kong as the Singaporean company builds out its business beyond the city-state. The deal to buy more than 60% of Carret Private Investments Asia Ltd. brings together Endowus's digital wealth technology with Carret Private's ultra-high-net-worth customers across Asia. Together, they will serve tens of thousands of clients with assets of more than $4 billion, said the firms' executives, who didn't disclose terms.
