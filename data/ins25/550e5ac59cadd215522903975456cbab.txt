The day I talk to Detective Senior Sergeant Rob Lemoto, the media is awash with tales of ramraids and a supposed surge in youth crime.

Since 2014, Lemoto has been co-host of Police Ten 7, a hit reality show that's sometimes accused of reinforcing negative stereotypes of Māori and Pasifika offenders. Lemoto has now become the lead host as part of a rebrand that also includes a name change to Ten 7 Aotearoa.
