Deirdre Horan and Fiona Talbot.Getting a horse-box from your family for a significant birthday might seem an unusual choice of present, but for Fiona Talbot of Ballyshannon it was for a particular purpose, writes Brian Byrne.In her case, no horse was involved — "though it once did carry horses!" — but rather an extension of Fiona's part-time catering work. And it opened for business today in the car park of Dowlings of Ballyshannon as 'The Cedar Box' coffee stop."I had been planning it for some time, but it took a bit longer to complete than I expected," Fiona told the Diary today, adding her thanks to family and friends who helped with the work of converting the box into the smart coffee stop which already had customers queuing when we arrived.
