Google hosted the I/O 2022 event earlier this month where the company announced the upcoming Pixel series smartphones. The tech giant confirmed that the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro smartphones would be released later this year. In the event, Google teased the upcoming devices with some images and confirmed that they would be powered by the next-generation Tensor SoC along with running Android 13 out-of-the-box. However, the company didn't divulge more detail about the upcoming handsets and now a new report has leaked the display specifications of the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones.
