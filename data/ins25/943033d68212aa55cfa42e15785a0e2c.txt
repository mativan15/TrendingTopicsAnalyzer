Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran, a pair who finished second on the ITV2 show Love Island one year ago, have split. Last week, Chloe, 27, took a quick flight to Morocco to get away from her breakup with co-star Millie Court. The 23-year-old hunk Toby and the beauty are reportedly still cohabitating in their house in Essex, but they are finalising plans to part ways.
Even though they gave the relationship her all, there was no reversing the situation. Last month, Chloe confessed that her footballer lover had already asked her to marry him, but she had declined.
