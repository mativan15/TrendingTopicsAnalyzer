The tides have turned. It's now a buyer's market for potential homeowners in Arizona and many other U.S. markets.

Homebuilders are beginning to lower their base prices and offer incentives, said Steven Hensley, advisory manager for Zonda housing market research firm.

While the lowering of base prices isn't widespread today, it is occurring in certain submarkets across the Valley, he said.

"Common incentives include interest rate buy-downs, long-term rate locks, money to be applied toward closing costs and some options/upgrades credits," Hensley said.
