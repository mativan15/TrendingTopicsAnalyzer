Gandhinagar: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the upcoming National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal will act as a centre for learning and understanding of India's diverse maritime history and that heritage developed in the country in the last eight years gives us a glimpse of India's legacy. 'There are many such tales of our history, which have been forgotten and ways have not been found to preserve them to pass them on to the next generation. How much can we learn from those events of history? India's maritime heritage is also a topic that has been not been talked about much,' PM Modi said in his address after reviewing the NMHC project site at Lothal, 80km from Ahmedabad, via video conferencing.
