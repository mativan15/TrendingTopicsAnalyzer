A pirate ship that went on the market earlier in 2022 and looked like something out of 'The Goonies' is now a short-term vacation rental in Callao, Virginia.

It's called The Jolly Lodger and it can be a fun family adventure for $292 per night, the listing on Airbnb notes.

'Arrrrrrrgh! Just in time for Halloween, stay in comfort on a fully decorated pirate ship! Docked in paradise in Callao, VA the ship features two bedrooms and 1.5 camping bathrooms, working kitchen and upscale linens,' the listing says.
