Ted S. Warren - staff, APFILE - Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, poses for a photo before taking part in a debate, Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022, in Olympia, Wash. Washington voters will soon decide whether to elect their first Democratic secretary of state in six decades or, instead, send a long-time county auditor to be the state's first nonpartisan chief elections officer. Republicans were shut out of the state's top two primary in August, which sent Hobbs and nonpartisan Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson to the general election.
