Ayo Dosunmu totaled 17 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists in the Bulls season-opening win over Miami.
We just had our first nearly-full slate of games Wednesday night, and it was marvelous. We had our share of upsets, big-time debuts, and jaw-dropping highlights, courtesy of Paolo Banchero and Ja Morant.
But while those two are rostered in all leagues, there are plenty of players who stood out or have the opportunity to stand out going forward that you should try to scoop up.
We're going to follow the same format that we used last year where each and every week, we'll look at players that you should consider picking up who are rostered in four different roster-ship tiers:

50-60%
30-49%
15-29%
0-14%

What's more, we'll give you a breakdown of how many games each team has for the upcoming week so that you can maximize the minutes of your streamers.
