A military commissar in charge of recruitment for Vladimir Putin's disorganised mobilisation effort was discovered dead close to his home, prompting Russian authorities to open a murder inquiry. Up to 200 combat deaths result in severe losses for Russia. Senior sources in Crimea, however, issued a warning tonight, saying that Russia remained unconvinced and was preparing to sanction the use of chemical weapons as part of a new offensive that will take place at the same time as the G20 summit in Bali in November.
