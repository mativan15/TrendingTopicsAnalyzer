Every investor in SILK Laser Australia Limited (ASX:SLA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

SILK Laser Australia is a smaller company with a market capitalization of AU$142m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
