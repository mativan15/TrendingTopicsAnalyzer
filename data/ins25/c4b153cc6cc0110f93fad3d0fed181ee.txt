Published: 17:14 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 17:19 EDT, 20 October 2022 Parler accidentally leaked the email addresses of 198 VIP users including Ivanka Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle. The blunder happened after the rapper - also known as Ye - agreed to buy the pro-free speech app on Tuesday.Users deemed VIPs were sent a group email gushing about the acquisition. But recipients addresses were added to the email using the carbon copy (cc) function, rather than the blind carbon copy (Bcc) function.
