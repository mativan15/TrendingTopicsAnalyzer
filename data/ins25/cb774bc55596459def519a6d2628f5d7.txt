Victorians aged six months and over will be able to get a free flu jab as part of a four-week vaccination program.

Health Minister Martin Foley announced the $33 million program would run from June 1 to June 30 and involve more than 3000 GPs and community pharmacies.

"This is our first real flu season for two years, and what this free program will do is protect Victorians and their families in the face of what is going to be a challenging winter," he told reporters on Tuesday.

Mr Foley said about six million Victorians would be eligible for the vaccine and authorities were confident enough stock was available.
