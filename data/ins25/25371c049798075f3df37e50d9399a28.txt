Netflix Inc. executives on Tuesday detailed their plans to crack down on users sharing their accounts on the streaming service, which is expected to arrive early next year.

In a letter to shareholders in conjunction with their third-quarter earnings report, Netflix NFLX, -1.73% executives said that they would offer those currently using other people's accounts an option to transfer that profile to their own subscription. They will also offer account holders the option of establishing 'subaccounts,' paying more to allow others to use their Netflix service.
