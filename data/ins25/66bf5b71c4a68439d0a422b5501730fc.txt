Global investment in cloud software startups reportedly dropped by 42% in the third quarter as valuations of their publicly traded counterparts slide.

Only three cloud software developers raised funds at valuations of $1 billion or more between July and September, according to a report on Tuesday from Silicon Valley venture firm Accel. That's down dramatically from the 51 that did so in the first quarter.

The report comes after cloud stocks in the U.S. had their worst week since January, dropping the Wisdom Cloud Computing Fund to its lowest level since March 2020.
