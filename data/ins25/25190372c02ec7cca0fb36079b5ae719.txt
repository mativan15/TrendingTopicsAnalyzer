Two days after Ghaziabad police lodged an FIR based on a woman's complaint that she was gangraped and assaulted by a group of men before being dumped on the side of the road, police said at a press conference on Thursday that she fabricated the allegations. Police also pointed to a property dispute as a potential cause.
The Delhi Commission for Women had on Wednesday issued a notice to the Ghaziabad police regarding the case, with its chief Swati Maliwal alleging that the woman had been violated with an iron rod.
