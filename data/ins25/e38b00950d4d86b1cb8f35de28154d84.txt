I upgraded the investment rating for WH from a Hold to a Buy with my prior update published on August 1, 2022. Wyndham Hotels' relative stock price performance following the publication of my article has been good. WH's shares declined slightly by -2.1% since the beginning of August, as compared to the S&P 500's -12.
