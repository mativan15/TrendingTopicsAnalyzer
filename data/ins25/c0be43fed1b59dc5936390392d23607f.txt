Come March, and in advance of Israel's 75th Independence Day, the People of the Book will have a shrine worthy of its literary legacy, promises Oren Weinberg, CEO of the National Library of Israel, making him the chief librarian of the Jewish people.

Almost half the NLI's collection of more than 5,000,000 rare volumes, manuscripts, incunabula, books and miscellaneous printed material has been transferred from the current building on the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Givat Ram campus.
