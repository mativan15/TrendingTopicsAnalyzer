One of the co-founders of Ethereum, Gavin Wood, has warned investors and asked them to be aware of what or who is backing their holdings.
Wood was at the Davos Annual Meeting 2022 of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Acknowledging the major market crash in May when Bitcoin plummeted below $30,000 and the market lost nearly $800 billion in the past few weeks, Wood warned the crypto community to invest their money carefully, reported Reuters, 
"I would hope that people pay more attention to what is belying the currency name when they get involved in a community, ecosystem, economy," Wood was reported as telling Reuters on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Meeting.
