Reported Arsenal transfer target Orkun Kokcu has explained that his religion made him feel uncomfortable with the idea of wearing a captain's armband supporting the LGBTQ+ community. The 21-year-old midfielder, whose impressive rise at Dutch club Feyenoord has been noticed by multiple elite clubs, handed over the captaincy for his side's 3-1 win away to AZ Alkmaar on Sunday following a decision made pre-match. Teams in the Eredivisie were encouraged to wear the 'OneLove' armband over the weekend, as it contains the same rainbow-infused design which England captain Harry Kane will don during the World Cup in Qatar next month in solidarity with LGBTQ+ people.
