Che Adams' first-half header was his third goal of the seasonSouthampton relieved the pressure on boss Ralph Hasenhuttl with their first win in six games against south-coast rivals Bournemouth, who lost for the first time under interim manager Gary O'Neil.It is hard to remember a time when pressure was not on Hasenhuttl, who has been in charge of the Saints since December 2018, but his side seem to grind out results when required and this was another example of that.Che Adams' first-half glancing header, after a left-wing cross from full-back Romain Perraud, was their first away goal in four games and ultimately proved enough as the Saints won for the first time since 30 August.
