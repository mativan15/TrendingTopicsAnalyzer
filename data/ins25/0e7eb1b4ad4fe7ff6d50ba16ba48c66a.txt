Nigeria joined Germany as the second team from Group B to make the quarter-finals of the under-17 women's World Cup after a 2-1 win against Chile on Monday; the scoreline not reflecting the domination, speed and skill shown by the Africans. But after a performance this convincing—and one that sealed a fourth quarter-final berth for Nigeria in seven editions—it fit that skipper Blessing Emmanuel would say, with a wide smile, 'we are not afraid of either Brazil or USA, bring them on.'Alex Castro sat on his haunches like Marcelo Bielsa, and like the former Chile national team coach, he also used the cooling box as a seat in the technical area.
