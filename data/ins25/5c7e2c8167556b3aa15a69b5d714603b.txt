The size of the UK's public debt has surged unexpectedly as rising prices put more strain on government finances than any time since the height of the pandemic.
A sharp rise in the cost of debt interest payments means the Treasury owes £20 billion as of September, new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows.
Officials have been blindsided as the figure is well above the £17 billion predicted by economists, and more than a third larger than government estimates calculated in March.
