The dollar held close to a 32-year peak versus the yen on Wednesday while edging up from a two-week trough against a basket of major peers, underpinned by the prospect of aggressive U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.

Sterling consolidated in the middle of its trading range this week following the Bank of England's decision not to sell any longer-duration gilts this year, while denying a Financial Times report that it would delay quantitative tightening. The euro slipped back from near a two-week top.
