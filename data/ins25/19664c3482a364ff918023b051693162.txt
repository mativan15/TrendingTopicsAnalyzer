Nasdaq 100 futures fell slightly on Wednesday night after surging Treasury yields ended a two-day rally for the major averages. Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 38 points, or 0.12%. S&P 500 futures slid 0.09%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.23%. Tesla shares dropped 3.7% in extended trading after the electric vehicle maker reported third-quarter revenue that missed analysts' expectations, though it beat on earnings. Revenue came in at $21.45 billion, less than the $21.
