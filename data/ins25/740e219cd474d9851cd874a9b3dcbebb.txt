Erik ten Hag claims he is not worried by Manchester United's lack of goals – despite them managing just 13 in the Premier League this season. Of the top 10 in the Premier League, only Bournemouth have scored fewer goals than United, but Ten Hag claimed he is happy with the return from his strikers. United forwards Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Martial and Antony have managed just 11 league goals between them this season. But Ten Hag defended his misfiring strikers and insisted he is not concerned at United – who host Tottenham on Wednesday night - scoring far fewer goals than their immediate domestic rivals.
