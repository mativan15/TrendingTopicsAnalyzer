On Sept. 28, the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Canadian Football League announced that the 109th Grey Cup game at Regina's Mosaic Stadium had sold out. But now, people appear to be ticket dumping.On the the Ticketmaster website, nearly every section has tickets for the Nov. 20 CFL championship game available for resale. Some of the tickets posted hover around the $1,000 price point. The Grey Cup match is finally coming to Regina, after it was originally intended to be held in the city in 2020 — but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the game, and later the entire season.
