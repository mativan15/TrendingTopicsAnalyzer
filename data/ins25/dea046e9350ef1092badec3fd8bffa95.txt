Former Formula One champion-turned-green-tech entrepreneur Nico Rosberg hailed the UK's push to transition away from fossil fuels, which he said that Britain is leading the way in, during an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. Mr Rosberg, although he once ran rings around rival Sir Lewis Hamilton on the racecourse back in his heyday, has moved on to greener pastures in his older (but still young) age as he tries to make a difference in the world. Stepping down from F1 back in 2016, just days after being crowned champion in Abu Dhabi  Mr Rosberg has since been involved in setting up the Greentech Festival.
