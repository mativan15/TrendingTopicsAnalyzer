ST PETERSBURG, Fla. — Aaron Judge did not want a barbecue or a picnic on Monday. With the Yankees finishing a stretch of nine games in eight days with back-to-back losses to the Rays, the Yankees slugger did not particularly even want a day off to think about it.
'We've got a bad taste in our mouth,' Judge said Sunday. 'Everybody in here is ready to go every single day. I know it's been quite a few games in a row, but we've got a lot to prove.'
But Monday, Memorial Day, was a scheduled Yankees off day and it is a traditional day in baseball to take stock of where a player or team stands.
