As the BBC marks its centenary today, veteran journalist David Dimbleby says the broadcaster has an ‘absolutely vital' role.
The former Question Time host, 83, said the BBC remained as close to an ‘objective truth teller' as was possible in the current media landscape.
While perhaps best known for fronting the topical debate program for 25 years between 1994 to 2018, Dimbleby first joined the BBC in the 1960s, where he went on to play a pivotal role in its political coverage, leading the reporting of 11 general elections over the subsequent decades.
