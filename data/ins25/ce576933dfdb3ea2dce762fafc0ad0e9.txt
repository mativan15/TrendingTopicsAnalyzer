Truss had started the day with murmurings that her former cabinet colleague, Sajid Javid, would confront her in parliament over some quite mean things her office had said about him in the weekend newspapers.Jason Stein, a special adviser to Truss, was suspended for planting quotes in The Sunday Times that Truss thought he was 's—' and should not replace Kwasi Kwarteng at the Treasury. Stein was also suspected of being the Downing Street aide who told a journalist that former levelling-up secretary Michael Gove was 'clearly' someone who got 'his kicks in a sadistic way'.
