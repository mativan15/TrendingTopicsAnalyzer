But then, on Sunday, Perry got an unexpected call.

Donations were pouring into a three-year-old fund set up for the band by the Capitol Hill Community Foundation, fueled by a Washington Post story about the accomplished group's struggle to pay for instruments, uniforms and trips to competitions.

Money came from Honolulu and Alaska, the Czech Republic, Australia and France. It came in from every state but Mississippi, South Dakota and Wyoming.

By Thursday, the donations totaled $115,000.

"Oh my goodness," said Perry, 41, who is also an attendance counselor at Eastern High.
