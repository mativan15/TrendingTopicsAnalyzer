Instagram is to start verifying the ages of users aged 18 or older in India and Brazil via the upload of an ID or video selfie in a programme the company said will come to the UK and EU by the end of the year.Users verifying via video will have their footage analysed by UK-based startup Yoti, which provides AI-powered age estimation technology for various tech companies.The move follows a similar programme in the US earlier this year. Verifying users' age will allow Instagram to prevent things like adults messaging teens or minors seeing restricted ad content.
