It's the soup of the week! I just love parsnip. It manages to be sweet and earthy at the same time, a flavour like no other. It's also truly seasonal – you'd be hard-pressed to buy parsnip during the summer months, so it's something to be savoured while it's around. Here it's blended (and feel free to use a stick blender for this part) into a simple, uncomplicated soup, extra ingredients there only to enhance the star ingredient. Consider the pine nuts optional.
