Emma Corrin has opened up on #MeToo and the importance of intimacy coordinators, explaining that they have previously removed clothes at a director's request despite feeling uncomfortable.
The actor, best known for their role as Princess Diana in The Crown, said that before the #MeToo movement, they sometimes felt like they had to go along with things for the sake of their career.
‘I've done it myself. I've been on sets where I've been asked to do something and in the moment I've done it and then people have come up to me and been like, 'Emma, why were you comfortable with that?'‘ they recalled.
