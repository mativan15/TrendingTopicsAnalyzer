Twitter Musk Lawsuit (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of engaged in 'unlawful conduct' aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company.

It is the second lawsuit against the multibillionaire after a complaint was filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this month, with the Orlando Police Pension Fund saying that, under Delaware law, Mr Musk cannot complete the takeover until at least 2025 unless holders of two-thirds of shares not 'owned' by him approved.
