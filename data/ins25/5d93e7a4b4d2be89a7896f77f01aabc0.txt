OPINION: Two months before his own assassination, on the night Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, Sen. Robert F.

He quoted the Greek playwright Aeschylus saying, 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.'
