The world's biggest maker of Christmas crackers pulled in more money over the summer than it had anticipated as retailers brought forward seasonal orders to avoid a repeat of last year's supply issues.IG Design, based in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, yesterday reported 'strong trading' between April and September, the first half of its financial year. Sales, profits, margins and cashflow had 'significantly improved' compared with a year earlier, it said, and were 'ahead of the board's expectation'.
