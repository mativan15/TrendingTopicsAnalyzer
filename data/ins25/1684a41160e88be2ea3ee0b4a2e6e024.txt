Oct. 19—A team of 10 civil engineering students at Terre Haute North High School have devised a system exploiting the currents of the Wabash River that — in theory — could ultimately eliminate the electric bills of every resident of Vigo County.

Senior Logan Wenzel came up with the idea he named Vortex on the Wabash.

The vortex contains a propeller that spins as water enters it and spits the water out a separate tube. The result is not unlike a toilet constantly flushing, which drives an attached generator and creates the electricity.
