CHAMPION TWP. – Calling all brides-to-be!

A Northeast Ohio woman wants to give her $3,000 wedding dress to a woman who cannot afford the dress of her dreams.

"I'm not a flashy person, but the day of my wedding I felt like a princess, a queen, anything. I just felt amazing. I just want someone else to feel (that way)," Gwendolyn Stulgis said.

Any woman with a wedding date set in the next six months can message Stulgis on Facebook and tell her in a few paragraphs why she deserves the dress.
