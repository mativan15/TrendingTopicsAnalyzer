Terry McLaurin is entering the fourth season of his NFL career in 2022. At the conclusion of his third season, McLaurin was eligible for a contract extension.
Outside of the Washington Commanders landing quarterback Carson Wentz, McLaurin's contract has been a hot topic surrounding the team. Washington began OTAs last week and McLaurin was not present as he seeks a new deal.
McLaurin isn't the only fourth-year wideout expected to cash in this offseason. A.J. Brown already received his money after the Titans traded him to the Eagles, while Deebo Samuel has been outspoken about wanting a deal and DK Metcalf is also expected to land a lucrative new contract.
