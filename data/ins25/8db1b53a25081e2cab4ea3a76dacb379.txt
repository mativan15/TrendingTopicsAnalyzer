There's some good news, and then there's some bad news for AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC 1.18%) and its smaller rivals. The good news is that the $76.3 million that domestic multiplex operators collected in ticket sales this past weekend is the industry's strongest showing in eight weeks. 
The bad news? Well, it's a bit of a list.

The box office receipts were 45% below the comparable weekend in 2019 when $137.7 million in tickets were sold. And the result was still 30% off from the $109.3 million that theaters collected for the same weekend last year.
