Offering prayers at the Hindu shrines of Kedernath and Badrinath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lashed out at previous Union governments and said that 'slave mentality' made them ashamed of India's spiritual legacy and leave the country's pilgrimage hubs under-developed. Speaking at Mana village near the India-China border in Uttarakhand, the PM also said that previous governments were apathetic to the needs of people from the hills and ensured that these people were the last to 'see the benefits of development'.
