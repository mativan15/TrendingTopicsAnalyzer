There were two big problems with the scheme. First, it was completely uncosted. Estimates varied by tens of billions: some said £60bn, others went as high as £150bn. You could fund the NHS for six months on the difference between the two numbers. No one really had any idea how much it might come to. 
The reason for the vast difference was wholesale gas costs. The final bill all depends on how much gas ends up costing over the next few months. 
Worst of all, though, was the fact the former Chancellor hadn't bothered to put any hard numbers on the scheme's cost, nor had he figured out how to pay for it if it ran for the full two years as originally planned for.
