Exclusive: Former Liverpool star Mark Lawrenson is hopeful Liverpool might be able to keep Sadio Mane, but has a replacement in mind if the Senegal international leaves AnfieldLiverpool should move for Darwin Nunez if they lose Sadio Mane, according to former Reds defender Mark Lawrenson, despite the Uruguayan being likely to cost "mega-money". Senegal forward Mane is out of contract in 2023, and has been linked with a summer move to Bayern Munich. Liverpool won't want to let their star leave on the cheap, and may prefer to lose him on a free a year from now rather than compromise on a free this summer, but they'll also have their eye on potential replacements.
