COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio school districts could once again arm employees under legislation being fast-tracked by Republican lawmakers to counter the impact of a court ruling that restricted the practice. The measure aims to undo the effect of an Ohio Supreme Court ruling last year, which held that under current law armed school workers would need hundreds of hours of training. Under the latest version of the bill, school employees who carry guns would need up to 24 hours of initial training, then up to eight hours of requalification training annually.
