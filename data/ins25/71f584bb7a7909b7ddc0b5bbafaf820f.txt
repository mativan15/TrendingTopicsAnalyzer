New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday showered praises on the city government's think tank, Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) and its vice chairperson Jasmine Shah, for its 'exemplary work' over the past seven years.Kejriwal's effusive praise for the DDC came just two days after the administration headed by Lt Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena issued a notice to Jasmine Shah, accusing him of misusing his position for political purposes. Shah, who was told on Monday to respond to the charges within seven days, had contended that the LG had no jurisdiction over the DDC vice chairperson's office, that he held the rank of a minister and that only the chief minister had the power to remove him.
