NEW DELHI: After India's largest private sector lender reported a 20% year-on-year (YoY) earnings growth on the back of a 10% YoY operating profit growth in Q2, analysts were left impressed by its steady performance. The stock has been under pressure over the last one-and-a-half years on account of weaker pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) growth and merger-related execution risk. "With Bank's multiple 30% lower than in the past, improving core PPOP growth and a good start to its deposit mobilisation journey, we believe it is at the end of its underperformance period," global brokerage firm CLSA said.
