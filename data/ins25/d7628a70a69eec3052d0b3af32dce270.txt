Each day the weather co-operates, 58-year-old Richard Dennis takes the PATH train into Manhattan from his home in Jersey City, New Jersey. He heads to a Citi Bike docking station, picks up a bike and begins a day of pedalling that will last about six hours, transferring bicycles from locations with too much supply to spots with too little.  Dennis started 'rebalancing' bikes nine months ago, and that's helped him accrue a stunning collection of statistics: more than 15,000 rides, 920 hours on the bike and 8,621km pedalled.
