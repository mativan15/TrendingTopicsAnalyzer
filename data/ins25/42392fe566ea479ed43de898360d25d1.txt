Energy companies that borrow cash using a new £40 billion government-backed liquidity scheme will be barred from paying bonuses or dividends.The Energy Markets Financing Scheme, which was launched today by the Treasury and the Bank of England, is designed to help energy firms cope with huge margin calls caused by unprecedented volatility in commodity markets.Companies can apply for government guarantees as a 'last resort' to enable them to borrow more cash under existing lending facilities from commercial banks.
