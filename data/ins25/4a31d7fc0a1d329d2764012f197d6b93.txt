Summary It's a terrible time for an IPO, but Intel INTC is still planning to offer one. Mobileye will hit the markets at around the same price Intel paid for it five years ago, despite a revenue CAGR of 36%.
 With the bear market going strong, it is a terrible time for companies to go public, which is why initial public offerings are down nearly 80% at this point in 2022 compared to the same time a year ago. Nevertheless, Intel Corp. (INTC, Financial) is planning to go ahead with the spinoff of its self-driving subsidiary Mobileye, sending its stock down more than 3%.
