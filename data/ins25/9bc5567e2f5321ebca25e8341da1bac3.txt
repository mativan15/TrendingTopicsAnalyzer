(Patch Graphics)I met Anastasia over the summer at an RTC meeting where she put her name in to be a candidate for Representative of the 20th district of the State House. Her pitch was simple, she's a highly successful self-made woman, she's a current board of education member in the town of Newington and she's a mother who wants to make sure her son grows up in a just and copacetic America. But, above all, it is her tremendous energy that caught my attention. For one, her leadership rallied the rest of the elected officials to audit the towns spending and as a result she already saved the people of Newington money and lowered the towns mill rate.
