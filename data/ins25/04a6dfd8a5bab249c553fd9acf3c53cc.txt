eyewaveThe Costamare E Series Preferreds (NYSE:CMRE.PE) are ones that we covered some years ago. Technically they did overperform since then, but we think that the preferreds trading below par now is a little unnecessary as it gives substantial margin over the rising reference rates. Given the state of the business, although seeing some mean reversion, CMRE.PE remains pretty attractive from a valuation and implied credit risk perspective. We won't play in commodity exposed markets for the time being, but still highlight the potential in this stock.
