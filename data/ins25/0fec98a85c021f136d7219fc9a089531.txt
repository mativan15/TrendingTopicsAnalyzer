Elon Musk has suggested that Mackenzie Scott is donating to organisations, including Democrats, to take aim at her ex-husband, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. On Memorial Day, 30 May, Mr Musk tweeted 'in remembrance of those who fell to preserve the light of freedom'. 'You don't care about freedom, Elon. If you did you wouldn't be supporting Donald Trump,' a Twitter user responded. Mr Musk said that he supports 'free speech, but not any one candidate. In fact, I gave money to and voted for Hillary and then voted for Biden.
