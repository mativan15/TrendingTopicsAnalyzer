Amazon, the largest e-commerce corporation in the world, which began as an online bookshop, allegedly violated competition law, which led to higher prices for customers, according to the proposed claim. Julie Hunter, an advocate for consumer rights, leads the claims that items sold on Amazon.co.uk and the Amazon app concealed better deals.
The "buy box" promoted offers account for over 80% of purchases completed on the website. However, Julie Hunter claims that independent merchants are not included in the buy box even when they provide the same goods at a lower price or with better terms, violating EU and UK competition legislation.
