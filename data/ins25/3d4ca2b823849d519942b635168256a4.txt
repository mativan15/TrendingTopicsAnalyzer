Italy's Silvio Berlusconi told MPs on Wednesday  that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin into an endless war, according to an audio obtained by an Italian newswire.The recording sheds further light on the pressures to soften Italy's stance towards Russia in the right-wing coalition that won elections on September 25. Its publication follows that of another audio, apparently from the same meeting with MPs, where Berlusconi recounted how he had revived ties with Putin.
