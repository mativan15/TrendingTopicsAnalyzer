Approval ratings of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government have risen to the highest since the start of the pandemic though there's lingering concerns over the surging prices of essential items and unemployment, the latest survey showed on Monday. Modi's government has met or exceed expectations in the second term, according to 67% of 64,000 people polled by LocalCircles. That's a jump from 51% last year when a brutal second wave of Covid-19 infections overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums and 62% in 2020 when the pandemic started.
