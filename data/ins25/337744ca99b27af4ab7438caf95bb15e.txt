Indian shares advanced more than 1% Friday, erasing nearly half their gains earlier in the day, as traders trimmed bearish bets on the back of positive Asian markets and a sharp reversal overnight on Wall Street, shrugging off hotter-than-expected US consumer inflation for the month of September. The BSE Sensex ended at 57,919.97, up 684.64 points or 1.20% from the previous close. The Nifty gained 171.35 points or 1.01% to end the day at 17,185.70. Benchmark indices had surged as much as 2% earlier in the day.
