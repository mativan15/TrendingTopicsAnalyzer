AgenciesMonday marks the start of jury selection in the case against Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis. The complainant sued the 'Crash' filmmaker in 2017, alleging he assaulted her in his Soho home on January 13, 2013. Haggis allegedly offered the victim a ride home after a movie screening. Despite her protests, he allegedly invited her to his Mercer Street flat for a drink. The complainant claimed she complied with Haggis' demands because he could affect her career. Haggis, however, claimed that there was a consent from the complainant.
