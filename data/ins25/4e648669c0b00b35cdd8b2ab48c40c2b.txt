In what has given a fresh ray of hope for resolution of the Naga dispute, the NSCN (I-M) and Naga National Political Groups or NNPGs have decided to form a common body to carry forward negotiations.
While there had been talks ongoing for cooperation and coordination between the two key Naga stakeholders for some time, the contours of the common body – to be known as the Council of Naga Relationships and Cooperation – were worked out at a two-day meeting held recently in Kolkata. The key mandate of the group, the two parties said, would be finding 'realistic' ways for the talks to move forward, and find an 'acceptable' resolution 'on the basis of Naga historical and political rights'.
