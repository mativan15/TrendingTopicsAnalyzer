Oct. 17—WILLIMANTIC — Ives Bros. prides itself on the relationships it builds with the customers.

"We believe people want to know who's coming to their home," co-owner Matt Butler wrote in an email.

The business has been owned by Butler and Ted Laythe since 2000, when Lew and George Ives retired.

Butler and Laythe began working there together in the 80s, when the two men attended Windham High School.

The business has been at 1244 Main St. since it opened 105 years ago.

"Our prices are competitive," Butler wrote.
