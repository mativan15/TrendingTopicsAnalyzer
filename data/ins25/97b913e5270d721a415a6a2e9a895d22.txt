By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:11 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 23:11 EDT, 17 October 2022 Billions will be spent in the next decade to break down barriers for working women in NSW, giving them access to cheaper, better-quality childcare. The NSW government has passed legislation creating a $5 billion fund to increase access to quality, affordable childcare in well-known 'childcare deserts' across the state. Places will be created in Sydney's west, southwest and regional NSW - where there is less than one childcare placement for every three children.
