Iran said on Sunday that four prisoners had been killed and 61 injured in a fire at Tehran's Evin prison a day earlier, with state television airing video apparently showing that calm had returned to the facility.The judiciary said four of those injured in Saturday's fire were in critical condition and that those killed had died of smoke inhalation, Iranian state media reported.The fire at the notorious prison in northern Tehran came amid ongoing unrest sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of Iran's morality police a month ago.
