The Seattle Art Museum's security workers voted to form an independent union in a 38-4 majority vote Tuesday.In a Zoom call, an agent for Region 19 of the National Labor Relations Board publicly counted each of the ballots submitted by the security workers, called visitor service officers (VSOs). There were approximately 57 eligible voters. One ballot was challenged, but its outcome will not affect the vote."It's a really big relief," union organizer Josh Davis said. "The biggest challenges of these campaigns is just sitting with the unknown of what is going to be happening next at work, and the kind of chaotic things that have happened since we started the campaign.
