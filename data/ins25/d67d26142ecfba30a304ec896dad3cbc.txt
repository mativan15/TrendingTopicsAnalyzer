A Bulgarian man who ran a fake news website for four years tells DW why disinformation about Russia is most popular in former Soviet states like his homeland. 


"If I can't convince them they are wrong, I might as well make some money out of them," argued Dimitar, a Bulgarian man who spent years earning income from spreading disinformation and fake news at home.
It was this thought that set Dimitar, who would not give DW his real name for fear of repercussions, on the road to becoming an administrator of what he calls a "fake news website" in Bulgaria.
