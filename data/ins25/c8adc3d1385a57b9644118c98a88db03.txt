Aehr Test Systems (AEHR -2.50%) is a little-known stock that's helping power the electric vehicle (EV) movement. The company knocked another one out of the park on its last quarterly earnings update, getting a huge lift from the sale of equipment it makes for a niche within the semiconductor industry.
