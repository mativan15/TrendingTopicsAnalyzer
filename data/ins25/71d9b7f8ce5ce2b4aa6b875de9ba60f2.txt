Shares of video platform Rumble (RUM 0.63%) were down 25% this week, as of Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET, and had been down as much as 26% at the worst. This underperformance is further accentuated by the fact that the S&P 500 was up 3.6% for the week, as of this writing, meaning Rumble can't blame poor market conditions for its drop.
So what
The news cycle at the beginning of the week was positive for Rumble. The company had two press releases -- both of which could be positive developments for its video creator community.
