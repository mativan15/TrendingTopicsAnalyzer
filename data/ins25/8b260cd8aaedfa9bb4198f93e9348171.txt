At a trade congress in early October Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, declared that he 'always' knew Russia would use its energy resources as a weapon. But in 2016, when he was vice-chancellor and his Social Democrats were the junior partner in a coalition led by Angela Merkel, Mr Scholz said it was simply 'not correct' to suggest that Nord Stream 2, a second gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, might make Germany too dependent on Russia. The chancellor's memory may be faulty, but since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February his government has radically decoupled Germany from Russian energy supplies, even as it has showered diplomatic, financial and military support on Ukraine.
