Sweden's parliament has narrowly elected conservative leader Ulf Kristersson as prime minister, leading the country's first government to be shored up by the far-right Sweden Democrats.
Kristersson, 58, was elected on Monday by a wafer-thin majority of three votes, after announcing a deal on Friday to form a governing coalition comprising his Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals.
The government will be supported in parliament by its far-right ally, the anti-immigration, nationalist Sweden Democrats.
