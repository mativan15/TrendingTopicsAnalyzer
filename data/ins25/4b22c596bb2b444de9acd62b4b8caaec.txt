"The Meijer LPGA Classic is such an important event in our community and to us as a company," Meijer Vice President of Diversity & Inclusion Tim Williams said. "While the tournament has always represented a major investment in a wide variety of local businesses, this year we wanted to be especially intentional about offering an experience that represents our community and inclusive culture."

Throughout tournament week – June 16-19 at Blythefield Country Club – Meijer will collaborate with local, diverse-owned food and beverage restaurants and vendors to supply new and unique experiences unlike any other LPGA Tour event.
