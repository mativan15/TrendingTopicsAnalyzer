A cabinet minister has told Sky News they believe Boris Johnson could secure the 100 nominations he needs from Conservative MPs to progress in the Tory leadership race if he were to stand.And Jacob Rees-Mogg has become the first cabinet minister to publicly declare his backing for the former PM this morning, posting on social media: "I'm backing Boris #BorisorBust."
The second leadership contest in three months got under way yesterday after the extraordinary resignation of Liz Truss, who was forced from office 44 days into her tenure after a seismic few weeks in Westminster in which her tax-slashing mini-budget crashed and burned.
