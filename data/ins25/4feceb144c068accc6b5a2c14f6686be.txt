The U.S. District Court of New Jersey handed down an indictment against two men for swindling investors across the state out of $650 million using a real estate Ponzi scheme that promised high returns with low commitments, but the company never saw a dime in profits, eventually toppling under its own burden to pay out victims.

Nicholas Salzano, 64, of Secaucus, and Rey Grabato, 43, who maintained residence in Hoboken and the Philippines, were charged in an 18-count indictment announced on Wednesday, with fraud and conspiracy violations.
