The Jewish trading year opened a couple of weeks ago with a mini-financial storm.

The dollar strengthened against the shekel by more than 1.3% and traded at its highest level since the beginning of 2022 (NIS 3.53).

The strengthening of the dollar is explained by the increase in interest rates in the US and expectations for further increases. The American stock exchange fears that inflation will spur Fed Chair Jerome Powell to speed up interest rate policy at a hawkish rate and raise the interest rate more sharply and on a longer schedule.
