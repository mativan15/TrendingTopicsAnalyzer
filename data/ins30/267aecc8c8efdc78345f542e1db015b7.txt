JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon urged investors Wednesday to prepare themselves for turbulence in the market in the weeks ahead – warning that extraordinary financial circumstances were creating a potential 'hurricane' for the economy.
Dimon, the head of the largest US bank, said factors such as the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and the Federal Reserve's move to tighten monetary policy due to decades-high inflation could stoke chaotic conditions in the market.
'It's a hurricane. Right now, it's kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,' Dimon said during a conference sponsored by AllianceBernstein, according to Bloomberg.
