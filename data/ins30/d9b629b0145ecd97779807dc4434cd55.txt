When Halifax gallery owner Ian Muncaster recently appraised a painting attributed to famed Nova Scotia folk artist Maud Lewis, it wasn't the painting itself that raised a red flag."You could tell that the soiling on it, that somebody had shaved a pencil on their finger and then rubbed [it] in," said Muncaster, owner of Zwicker's Art Gallery."Old dirt doesn't look like that," he told The Current. Lewis, who died in 1970, enjoyed some recognition in her later years. But her vividly colourful paintings have gained greater international recognition more recently, with London's prominent Whitechapel Gallery featuring her work alongside Picasso and Andy Warhol last spring.
