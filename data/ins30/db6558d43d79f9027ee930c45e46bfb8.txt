The Italian Program of the University of Pittsburgh and the Italian American Program of the Senator John Heinz History Center will co-host the 54th annual Italian American Studies Association Conference Oct. 27-29. 
 Entitled 'Mining the Diaspora: Italian-American Materialities, Archaeologies, and Intersections,' the conference's theme examines the intersections of local, global and transnational settings, with emphasis on the connections, collaborations and contestations that exist between and among Italians, Italian Americans and other multi-ethnic and -racial groups.
