OPINION:

You have to wonder sometimes if Congress has its collective head in the sand. Or it just doesn't care what happens to the money it authorizes after it's out the door. Reports that billions, perhaps tens or even hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars may have been stolen from the people through fraudulent claims for relief have been met with stony silence by congressional leaders.

None of them, at least no one in the majority party, has been willing to investigate what happened and why or seems the least bit interested in what happened to the money, $663.
