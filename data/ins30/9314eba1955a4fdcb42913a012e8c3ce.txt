The political activist group Led by Donkeys has gone viral with a new video in which three of its members scale a ladder to place a mock blue plaque on the exterior of 55 Tufton Street in Westminster, central London, a Georgian townhouse serving as home to a number of right-wing think-tanks popular with Liz Truss.'The UK economy was crashed here,' the commemorative sign reads, giving the date as 23 September 2022, the day on which Ms Truss's now-ex chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng delivered his disastrous, uncosted 'mini-Budget', which proposed reckless tax cuts and heavy borrowing at a time of high inflation.
