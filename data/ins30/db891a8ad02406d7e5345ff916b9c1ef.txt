Supporting a local charity with a shot of whisky, some 70 people attended Mezzo Ristorante and Lounge in Little Italy Thursday night and became the first group outside company employees to try what's being called 'the oldest whiskey in Canadian history.' It's been aged for 45 years — meaning this latest entry in Canadian Club's chronicle series was locked away the year the first Star Wars movie came out. It's been brought out now with tickets to taste it alongside a five-course meal at Mezzo selling for $200 a piece.
