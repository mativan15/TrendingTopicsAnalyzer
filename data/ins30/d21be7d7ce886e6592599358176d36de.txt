Just Stop Oil activists have been accused of having ‘blood on their hands' after two women died on the M20.
An ambulance had battled through diversions caused by the closure of the Dartford Crossing to reach the crash in Swanley, Kent.
The accident reportedly took place after a woman stopped to help a fellow driver who had become stranded by the side of the motorway.
A vehicle then collided with the women as they waited for assistance on the hard shoulder.
An ambulance, held up by traffic, took 40 minutes to reach the crash scene.
