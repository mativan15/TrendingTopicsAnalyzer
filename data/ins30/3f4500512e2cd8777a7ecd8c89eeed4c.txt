The move away from Steve Smith for the early part of Australia's T20 World Cup defence has put the spotlight on his replacement Tim David, who already has significant fans.

National selection chief George Bailey ended any speculation about the position of Smith, who was part of Australia's World Cup winning team in Dubai last year, ahead of the defending champions' opening clash with New Zealand this Saturday.

While Smith could yet play a role in the defence, he's not going to be playing the Kiwis.
