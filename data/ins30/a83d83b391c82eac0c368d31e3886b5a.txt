A MATCH in memory of former Southend United skipper Chris Barker has raised more than £10,000 for mental health charity Mind.

Chris' family and a number of his former team-mates were all at Roots Hall on Saturday for a match in honour of the ex defender who tragically took his own life at the start of 2020.

And Chris' brother Richie was moved to see so many people in attendance.

Echo: All together - the two teams and the Barker family at Roots Hall
