By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, EnQuest PLC (LON:ENQ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 56% over three years, well in excess of the market decline (8.5%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 15% in the last year.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
