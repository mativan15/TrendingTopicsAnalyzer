Toby + Chilli MorningsBy @TobyChilliShowOct 20, 2022Fall - aka pumpkin spice season - is in full swing and there's no shortage of the products available in the season's favorite flavor. Just be prepared to pay a lot more for it. It turns out, food manufacturers commonly bake an informal 'pumpkin spice tax' into the cost of the items and this year, thanks to demand and inflation, it's even higher than usual. Research from MagnifyMoney, a personal finance site, finds that this year pumpkin spice products are an average of 14% more than traditional varieties of the same products.
