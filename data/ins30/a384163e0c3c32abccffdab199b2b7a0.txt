If you've always considered 1990's crazy-pants sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch to be severely underrated, you are not alone. Director Joe Dante and star Zach Galligan are right there with you.Galligan, who famously played Mogwai whisperer Billy Peltzer in both the 1984 horror-comedy classic Gremlins and its far less celebrated sequel, revealed as much in a recent interview with Yahoo Entertainment at San Diego Comic-Con (watch above).At SDCC to promote his return to the franchise in next year's animated prequel series The Secret of the Mogwai, Galligan was explaining how he's never lost touch with Dante, who serves as a consultant on the show, when the conversation veered toward The New Batch.
