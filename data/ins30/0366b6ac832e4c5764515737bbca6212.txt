By Michael Susin Gama Aviation PLC said Friday that its pretax loss for 2021 widened due to higher costs. The business-aviation services group said pretax loss was $10.7 million compared with a loss of $8.1 million the previous year. Operating loss was at $7.25 million, compared with $12,000 in 2020. However, revenue rose 30% to $235.9 million, driven by the acquisition of Jet East in the U.S. and a general recovery of activity due to the lifting of travel restrictions. The company has started 2022 with continued positive momentum but revenue gains have been offset by increased costs, it said.
