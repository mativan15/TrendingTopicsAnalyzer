Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry and defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons are two of the most notable players not taking part in voluntary organized team activities.
However, that doesn't mean Simmons and Henry aren't putting in work, as evidenced by the pair sharing workout videos on social media recently.
Henry, who is coming off a major foot injury last season and has no shortage of doubters about his future viability, was running uphill and working on change of direction in his video.
