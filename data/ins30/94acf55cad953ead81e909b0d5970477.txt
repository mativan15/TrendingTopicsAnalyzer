U.S. Rep. John Rutherford, R-Jacksonville, said he paid fines to resolve a review of his compliance with the STOCK Act that requires filing of disclosure reports for any stock transaction exceeding $1,000.

U.S. Rep. John Rutherford said he paid fines for making late disclosures of stock transactions and he believes that concludes a review by the House Committee on Ethics.

The committee opened its examination after the Office of Congressional Ethics provided information to the committee on Feb. 28.
