NEW DELHI – Yields on government bonds rose on Monday ahead of the Monetary Policy Committee's statement on Wednesday as most traders were of the view that the rate-setting committee would raise interest rates by 40 to 50 basis points. Market sentiment worsened further because of a sharp rise in global crude oil prices, which add to upside inflation risks, strengthening the case for aggressive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India's MPC.

Bond yields and prices move inversely. A rise in yields, therefore, brings with it the risk of marked-to-market losses on bond portfolios and eats into banks' profitability.
