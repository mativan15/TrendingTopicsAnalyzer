AsiaVision Shift4 (NYSE:FOUR) is a payments company that is often overlooked when compared to more well-known payment providers such as Square (now Block). However, Shift4 has best-in-class technology and provides the backbone payments for many leading brands from Burger King to Elon Musk's Starlink. The company was formerly known as "United Bank Card" and was founded in 1999 by a 16-year-old genius named Jared Isaacman. Shift4 finally went public in 2020 as they saw an opportunity to benefit from the surge in popularity around fintech solutions.
