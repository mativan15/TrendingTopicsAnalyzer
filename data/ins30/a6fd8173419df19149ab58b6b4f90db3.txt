NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Louisiana Supreme Court has disbarred former state Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is awaiting to hear whether she will be sentenced to prison for defrauding campaign contributors and the Louisiana Democratic Party.

Peterson, who resigned her Senate seat in April citing depression and a gambling addiction, pleaded guilty in August to one count of wire fraud. U.S. District Judge Sarah Vance will sentence her on Dec. 7. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years but it is uncertain how harsh her sentence will be after she signed a plea agreement and cooperated with prosecutors.
