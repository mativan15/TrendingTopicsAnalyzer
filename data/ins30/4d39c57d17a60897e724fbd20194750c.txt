British academics have collaborated on thousands of research papers with Chinese military scientists according to a government-funded report that universities sought to suppress.
The paper, a summary of which was published yesterday by the Henry Jackson Society, detailed publications in which British academics had partnered with those at ‘very high risk' universities in China. It also detailed links to universities in Russia and Iran with military ties.
The research by the foreign policy and national security think tank claims to have uncovered 13,415 collaborative partnerships.
