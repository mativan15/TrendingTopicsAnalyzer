The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the decision of the Maharashtra government to provide 20 per cent reservation to in-service officers in postgraduate medical admissions in the state. A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and Hima Kohli said it was difficult to accept the submission of the petitioners that the government resolution should not apply in the current academic year because of change in rules midway. 
"We are of the considered view that the judgement of the Bombay High Court does not call for interference," the bench said.
