Most people starting out on their passive income journey focus on an investment's current yield. They want to earn as much income as possible from their investment. However, that can cause them to miss out on the even greater income upside from an investment that can grow its income stream over time.  
One excellent example of the upside potential of an income grower is Extra Space Storage (EXR -0.85%). The real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on self-storage has delivered tremendous dividend growth over the past decade, turning a $1,000 investment into a more than $200 annual income stream.
