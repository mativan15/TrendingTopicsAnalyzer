Storyville: The Fire Within

9pm, BBC Four

More explosive than most blockbusters, Werner Herzog's spectacular documentary follows volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft on their journey to Mount Unzen, Japan, where they died in 1991. 'I have seen so many eruptions in 23 years that even if I die tomorrow, I don't care,' declares Maurice at one haunting point in the 200 hours of footage they captured. Just watching the Kraffts calmly stand and observe erupting lava around them is quite something.
