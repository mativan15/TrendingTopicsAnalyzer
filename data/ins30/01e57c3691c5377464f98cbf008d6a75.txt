The land briefly used to host the notorious Fyre Festival is being sold exclusively as NFTs — reinventing the site as an ultra-luxe, crypto-first, resort-style community.
Situated on top of Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, AGIA International plans to sell 60 ultra-luxurious pavilions and villas exclusively via a series of upcoming non-fungible token (NFT) mints on the Ethereum blockchain.
Since the infamous Fyre Festival event in 2017, the land has remained predominantly vacant. 
Five years and tens of millions of dollars later, private spending is set to transform the site that 'now promises to house the most exclusive enclave in the Caribbean,' according to a press release.
