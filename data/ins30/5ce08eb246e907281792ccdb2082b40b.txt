MYSURU: Much though the residents, and the stakeholders of the tourism sector, including the government, might tout Mysuru as the Heritage City, it appears as though the very historical structures that have helped the city earn this sobriquet may be falling apart. Unrelenting rain in the city resulted in the wall of the building of Maharani's Science College caving in on Friday. The incident occurred around 10.30am, when a part of the building that the college authorities had decided against using after they noticed cracks on the wall.
