Taylor Swift's new album Midnights offers rare insight into her personal life and relationship with her boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn, while also embracing a dramatic new sound.

The pop megastar, 32, has described the record as the story of '13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life' and 'a journey through terrors and sweet dreams'.

It sees her turn away from the intimate indie songwriting of her two last albums, Folklore and Evermore, in favour of electronica, synth-pop and sometimes even hip hop-influenced beats.
