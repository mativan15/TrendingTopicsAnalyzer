According to unofficial data, a million Russians can be mobilized in Russia

She said the Russian Federation had managed to mobilize about 66% of the number of citizens it had planned to call up.

'According to intelligence data, the staffing of 107 and the formation of 24 regular and reserve regiments and battalions with a total number of about 146,000 people is ongoing', Malyar said.

'This is happening in all military districts, the Northern Fleet and the Airborne Forces,' she added.

The Russian Federation still has problems with a lack of a sufficient amount of barracks and housing stock, as well as shortages of equipment due to the accelerated pace of mobilization.
