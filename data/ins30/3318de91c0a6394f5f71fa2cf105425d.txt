ST. JOHN'S, N.L - Cenovus Energy announced Tuesday it will restart work on the West White Rose oil project in Newfoundland, ending nearly two years of uncertainty in the local energy sector. The company said in a news release that work to complete the project will resume in 2023. "The joint venture owners have worked together to significantly de-risk this project over the past 16 months," Cenovus president and chief executive officer Alex Pourbaix said in the release. "As a result, we're confident restarting West White Rose provides superior value for our shareholders compared with the option of abandonment and decommissioning.
