Scotland's First Minister has said the Prime Minister not having resigned is a sign of 'how badly broken UK politics is'.On Monday, new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced that most of Liz Truss' financial agenda would be scrapped, signalling a significant U-turn by the Prime Minister after three weeks of turmoil in the financial markets.The cut to the basic rate of tax followed the scrapping of the top rate cut, also being axed by the new occupant of No 11, while the plan to cap energy prices for two years was reduced to six months with a new targeted plan to be put in place after that.
