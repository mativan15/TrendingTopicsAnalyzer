PITTSBURGH — The score might not have indicated it, but Lightning goaltender Brian Elliott did his part in his first start of the season Saturday night against the Penguins at PPG Paints Arena.

Tampa Bay's backup faced an onslaught of shots but kept the Lightning in the game as their season-opening, three-game road trip concluded with a 6-2 loss to the Penguins.

With three back-to-backs over a 13-day stretch, Elliott will get plenty of playing time. And he got plenty of work Saturday.

The Lightning gave away the puck too much and failed to carry over their five-goal offensive output from the previous night's victory in Columbus.
