"It's an honor to be chosen to work with Israel's Government for a second time to bring the Cybersecurity Impact Bootcamp to learners across the country," said David Chesterman, Head of Education Partnerships, ThriveDX SaaS. "ThriveDX's mission is to help people find and retain jobs that accelerate their careers, and we're confident that the cohort of 2022 is poised for success in Israel's well-respected cybersecurity industry."

ThriveDX's Cybersecurity Impact Bootcamp was developed by veterans of the elite cyber-intelligence unit of the IDF (unit 8200) to create more accessible career opportunities in cybersecurity.
