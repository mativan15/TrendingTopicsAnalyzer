High school students in St. James were raising money for a good cause at their homecoming football game this weekend. It was the second annual homecoming game fundraiser for the Sturgeon Heights Huskies as they hosted the Miles MacDonell Buckeyes at Sturgeon Heights Collegiate. The game marked the end of a campaign to raise money for CancerCare Manitoba. Student Payton Zubec said the idea came to her after a Huskies game last year. "One day after watching one of our games, I noticed a player praying to his dad, and it kind of just hit me - I was like 'this isn't fair, his dad should be here,' so it sparked the idea," she said.
