The Ukrainian winners of this year's Eurovision song contest have auctioned off the crystal microphone trophy for £712,000 to buy drones to defend the country against Russia.The rap-folk band Kalush Orchestra, who won the song competition earlier this month with a wave of popular support, sold the trophy in a Facebook auction led by the Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula. He said that more than 31,000 people from 56 countries took part in the event.The money from the auction, raised in digital cryptocurrency, will be used to buy the PD-2 unmanned aerial system, which includes three aircraft and a ground control station, Prytula said.
