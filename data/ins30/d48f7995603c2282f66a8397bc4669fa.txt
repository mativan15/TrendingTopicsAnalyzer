The number of new homes being built in the capital has gone into a deep decline, according to figures from the Greater London Authority.Just as London bursts at the seams – with almost 300,000 households stuck on council housing waiting lists and rents reaching record highs – the supply of new homes is shrinking rapidly.In the past six months, some 2,000 new homes were completed in the capital, around five per cent of the target of 38,603. Last year 38,000 new homes were completed, and in 2016/17 the total was a record 43,825.
