ALBANY — New York lawmakers approved a restructuring of the city's embattled Housing Authority on Thursday, creating a public trust that could unlock federal funds and borrowing power for much-needed repairs.The measure adopted on the final day of the legislative session allows NYCHA to transfer 25,000 apartments into a publicly owned trust with the ability to issue bonds and borrow money to cover capital repairs.'This is a major win for New Yorkers who call NYCHA home,' Gov. Hochul said in a statement.
