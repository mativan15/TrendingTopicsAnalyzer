Angel Di Bilio As we already performed in Q2 (and also in Q1), today we comment on Rio Tinto's Q3 operational performance (RIO, OTCPK:RTPPF, OTCPK:RTNTF), which was just released by the company. Here at the Lab, we recently published an analysis called M&A optionality that also emphasized the company's ability to generate FCF, its compelling valuation, and Rio Tinto's tasty DPS. Following the company release, today we provide our first takeaway. Q3 Production Results The company's production in Q3 was softer than expected, cross-checking the consensus estimate, Rio Tinto's output was above expectations with aluminum and iron ore production, whereas as already happened during the Q2 results, the company missed production results on copper by 11%.
