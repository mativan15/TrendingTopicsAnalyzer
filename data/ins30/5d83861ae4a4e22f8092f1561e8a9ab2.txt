The game has been scheduled all season as Military Appreciation Night, with proceeds from the gun raffle going to local veterans organizations. One Sioux City business partner with the Bandits said on Facebook Wednesday he would end his company's contract with the team if they went through with the promotion only eleven days after a fatal school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.
