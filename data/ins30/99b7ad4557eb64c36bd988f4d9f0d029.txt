WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Tuesday stopped a Texas law that would regulate how social media companies police content on their sites, while a legal battle continues over whether such measures violate the First Amendment. The vote was 5 to 4. The five in the majority – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – did not provide reasoning for their action, which is common in emergency requests. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, said he had not made up his mind about the constitutionality of the law but would have allowed it to go into effect while review continues.
