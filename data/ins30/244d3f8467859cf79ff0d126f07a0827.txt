New texts shed light on former Sen. Kelly Loeffler's thinking during the Georgia runoffs and Jan 6.

She told aides to make sure Trump retweeted a statement announcing her objection to the 2020 results.

But after the violence, an aide warned her to back off from objecting due to "reputational risk."

Former Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia privately fretted about her decision to object to the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to a new batch of texts obtained and verified by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
