Concerned at the lack of job and social security among gig and platform workers, the Centre has decided to train officials of Central and State Governments on the technological change, new forms of employment, working conditions, and the mechanisms to protect labour and social security rights of these workers. The V.V. Giri Institute, the training arm of the Union Labour Ministry, is organising the programme aimed at sharing information and good experiences on policies and global practices relating to gig and platform workers and their social security.
