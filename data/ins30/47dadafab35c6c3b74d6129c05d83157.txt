VICTORIA, British Columbia, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Estimates are that around one in 10 adult Americans are diabetic, and the majority of them are among the 24 million plus that have Type 2 diabetes and are insulin resistant. Anyone who has full Type 2 diabetes will almost always need to use medication to keep their blood sugar from staying elevated for long periods of time. The A1C hemoglobin measure how well your medication and other contributing factors are working for you, and blood sugar control medications like Semaglutide (Ozempic) are among the ones Americans buy for less when ordering from Canada and pharmacies like Canada Drugs Direct.
