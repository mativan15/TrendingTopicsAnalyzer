City National Bank of Florida will become the official bank and mortgage partner of the Orlando Magic and Amway Center during the 2022-23 season, the two organizations announced Tuesday morning ahead of the season opener against the Pistons on Wednesday in Detroit.

As part of the partnership, City National Bank will be the first partner whose logo will appear on the Magic's warmup shirts — a branding opportunity created by the NBA last season.

'The Orlando Magic are thrilled to forge an exclusive partnership with City National Bank of Florida,' Magic CEO Alex Martins said in a statement.
