Charlie Frederick looks completely different after ditching fame for his own fitness business. The former Love Island star rose to fame on the show but it now seems he is living a more conventional life. After occasionally appearing on Made In Chelsea, Charlie is focusing on his fitness, as well as helping others to live a healthier life. First appearing on TV as a bright eyed clean-shaven blonde, he has now transformed his look since 2018. He now sports a cropped hairstyle with facial hair and an earring, often showing off his toned physique on his Instagram page.
