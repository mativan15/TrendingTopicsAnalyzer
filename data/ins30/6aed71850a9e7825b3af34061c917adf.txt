A Miami Beach doctor-in-training thought he was in the process of buying a 12-year-old girl from a human trafficker to keep locked in his home to have sex with and keep under his control, authorities say. He was actually speaking with an FBI agent.

Alan Li is facing charges of attempted sex trafficking of a minor younger than 14 and attempted coercion of a minor. The 26-year-old is being held Thursday night at the Federal Detention Center in Miami.

Li was listed as a resident, or a doctor-in-training, on Mount Sinai Medical Center's website, NBC4 Ohio reported.
