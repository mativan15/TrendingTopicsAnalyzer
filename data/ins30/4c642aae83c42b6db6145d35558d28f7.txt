Oct 21 (Reuters) - Portugal's government is exploring the sale of a green bond and has identified around half of the expenditures it could potentially finance, Portugal's debt management agency head told Reuters.In recent years, many European sovereigns, from Germany to Italy, have issued green bonds that fund a range of environmentally-beneficial projects, from clean transportation to renewable energy.A green bond issuance is "definitely on the agenda and we are working hard to put it together," Miguel Martin, recently appointed to head Portugal's debt agency, said.
