SingHaiyi Group—controlled by Chinese tycoon Gordon Tang and his wife Celine—and banking and real estate billionaire Wee Cho Yaw's UOL Group submitted top bids for two Singapore state-owned residential plots amid surging housing demand in the city-state. Developers have been actively replenishing their land banks as demand for residential properties in the Asian financial hub remains robust. While cooling measures imposed by the government in December tempered sales in the first quarter, new launches in recent weeks saw a revival in demand with billionaire Kwek Leng Beng's City Developments and partner MCL Land selling 77% of its 407-unit Piccadilly Grand condominium project just outside the central business district last month.
