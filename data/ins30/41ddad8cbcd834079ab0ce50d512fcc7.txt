Odds of Liz Truss leaving No10 this year have been slashed as home secretary Suella Braverman resigned. William Hill Spokesperson, Lee Phelps, said: 'There had been some gentle support at the start of the week for Liz Truss to remain as PM for the year, but since Suella Braverman departed as home secretary the tables have quickly turned and she's been heavily backed to leave in 2022. 'On Wednesday, Truss could be backed at generous odds of 4/6 to be gone before 2023, but the weight of money today has left her odds of leaving this year plummeting down to a highly likely 1/7.
