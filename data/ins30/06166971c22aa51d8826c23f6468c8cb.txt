Ahead of Diwali, the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) has decided to increase Amul milk prices by Rs 2 per litre for all markets, except Gujarat, an official source said Saturday. This is the third hike in fresh milk prices this calendar year. The hike in prices, however, is restricted to Amul Gold and Buffalo Milk, the source said.
When asked about the reason for leaving out poll-bound Gujarat from the hike, Jayen Mehta, chief operating officer of the GCMMF, said: 'It was a decision of the management and I can't comment about it.
