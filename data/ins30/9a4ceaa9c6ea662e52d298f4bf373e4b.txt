An announcement by the New Brunswick government that it will spend $102.2 million over the next four years to add 380 public housing units, and repair 110 others, is welcome news, but some say it's not nearly enough.Under the plan, Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton will each get 40 new units over a four year span, with an additional 68 units added in northern New Brunswick. Another 192 units will be established in areas of greatest need, while 110 N.B. Housing units that are currently unlivable will be repaired and renovated.
