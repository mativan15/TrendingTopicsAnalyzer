A divided US Supreme Court blocked a Texas law that critics say would fundamentally transform Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook by requiring them to allow hate speech and extremism.The justices put the measure on hold while a constitutional challenge goes forward in a lower court, granting a request from tech groups that represent the platforms. A federal appeals court let the law, known as HB20, go into effect earlier this month.'It will be impossible for these websites to comply with HB20's key provisions without irreversibly transforming their worldwide online platforms to disseminate harmful, offensive, extremist, and disturbing content,' argued the tech groups, NetChoice and Computer and Communication Industry Association.
