Jonsen right candidate
for the sheriff's office

Electing Bob Jonsen will give Santa Clara County a new sheriff with innovative ideas and solutions with a broad range of law enforcement experience as a commander and chief. Not another insider.

For 50-plus years people with diverse ideas, opinions, experience and backgrounds have been shoved aside.
