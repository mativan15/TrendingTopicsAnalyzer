With over 60,000 students accepting the courses and colleges allotted to them in the first list released by Delhi University, the varsity estimates that all 70,000 seats in its undergraduate programmes will be filled via the same list. "We are expecting all 70,000 seats to be filled in the first list itself. This would mean the entire process will be completed by October 24," Delhi University (DU) Registrar Vikas Gupta told PTI.

Announced on Wednesday, the first list marked the beginning of the final phase of the admission process, with 60,863 having accepted their allocations by Thursday.
