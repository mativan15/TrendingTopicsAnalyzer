Florida will soon have 11 more specialty license plates and one new military tag for those serving during the Cold War traveling about its highways, although nine of them came as a package deal.

The Divine 9 specialty tag approved by the 2020 Florida Legislature is for nine historically Black fraternities and sororities. Those nine along with the America the Beautiful and Explore Off-Road Florida tags were shipped out this month to the state's 67 county tax collector offices.

The state also shipped out a 12th plate, a new military tag, the Army Of Occupation plate, which requires recipients to have been permanently assigned to occupation forces in specific overseas locations during the Cold War between May 9, 1945 and Oct.
