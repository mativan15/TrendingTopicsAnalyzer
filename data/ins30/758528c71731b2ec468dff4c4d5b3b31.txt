Cryptocurrency predictions site Polymarket is accepting bets now on 'Will Russia use a nuclear weapon before 2023?' following an escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine and increased calls by Russian authorities to utilize such weapons.

Polymarket is not able to be used by U.S.-based traders. Earlier this year, the site was fined $1.4 million and ordered to shut down by the CFTC for not registering with it. Polymarket eventually restarted operations but limited access to only non-U.S. users.
