Garcia's Ryder Cup pedigree is evident when you consider he is the tournament's all-time leading points scorer, but the Spaniard elected to skip next week's Mallorca Open on the DP World Tour, which would have been his fourth event of the year, allowing him to retain his tour card and remain eligible for the biennial match play event. That means that even if the breakaway LIV golfers are successful in their legal bid to remain members of the DP World Tour in February of next year, Garcia will no longer be a member and will not be considered for Ryder Cup selection - though he will still be eligible to play in events due to his top-40 status on the career money-list charts.
