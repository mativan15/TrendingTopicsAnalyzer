US politics faces a serious trust deficit. MAGA Republicans don't trust RINOs, leftist Democrats don't trust their centrist colleagues, Republicans don't trust Democrats (and vice versa), and trust in major social institutions has been weakening for decades. And this skepticism has spread outside of partisan politics: according NORC's General Social Survey, the proportion of respondents who said 'you can't be too careful in dealing with people' rose from 50.3% in 1972 to 63.9% in 2018. How can society function with growing distrust? And yet, we should recognize that beneath the political contention, Twitter rages, hyperbolic rhetoric and angry posturing, a big part of American society routinely finds many individuals and organizations to be very trustworthy.
