King Charles III's niece Zara Tindall and her husband, Mike Tindall, reportedly take home more than £1 million each year from their partnerships with Rolex, Land Rover, and many others. It seems the couple's work does not end there as the former England rugby player will now be heading Down Under, as he will be appearing on the upcoming series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! for which he is reportedly taking home a hefty sum. A branding expert has explained how the couple makes their significant income.
