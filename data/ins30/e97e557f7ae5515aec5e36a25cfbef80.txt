Twitter (TWTR) announced early Friday that Tesla (TSLA) CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk's offer to purchase the popular social media platform passed an important anti-trust hurdle.
Thursday at 11:59 p.m. ET marked the expiration of the waiting period of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR) of 1976. HSR gives the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department 30 days to review any potential anti-trust violations regarding a potential transaction. 
Anti-trust regulators can no longer block Musk's $44 billion, or $54.
