Team Biden's energy nonsense never stops. The latest: a bizarre claim that Americans are saving money — $120 a month, or $420 million in total since summer — at the pump. 
Yes, gas prices are down from their scorching-hot $5.01-per-gallon June peak to a still-painful $3.85. But, by all accounts, the main reason for the drop was that Americans reduced their driving in response to the sticker shock. 
And that $3.85 is still 62% higher than when Biden took office. So there have been no savings at all.
