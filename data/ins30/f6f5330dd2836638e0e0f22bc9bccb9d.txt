At 22, where were you career-wise?I'd graduated from the National School Of Drama, Delhi, and freelanced as a theatre actor. I'd worked with theatre director Amal Allana. I had the option of becoming a full-time actor in NSD's Repertory Company, but I took a train to Mumbai. I wasn't confident but keen on fulfilling my dream of becoming a film actor.

Your bank balance then?I opened my first bank account only after I came to Mumbai. My sister Shakuntala's husband Ramesh Bhardwaj gave me ₹800.
