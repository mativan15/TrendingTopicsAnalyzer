A divergence between the S&P 500 and the VIX fear gauge is sending mixed signals to traders as they try to identify a bottom amid the market's ongoing correction.Typically the VIX has an inverse relationship with the broader stock market and surges higher as the stock market falls lower, and vice versa. But while the S&P 500 has fallen to new lows in May, almost hitting bear-market territory as it neared a 20% decline last week, the VIX index has remained subdued below the 30 level.That's the same level the VIX was at last month when the S&P 500 was about 10% higher from current levels, signaling to some traders that there has yet to be true capitulation that would give an all-clear to buy stocks again.
