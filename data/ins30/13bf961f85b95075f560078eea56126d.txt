La Liga president Javier Tebas said on Tuesday the Spanish league would send its formal complaint to UEFA in "one or two days" regarding Kylian Mbappe's new contract at Paris Saint-Germain.Tebas said it was "impossible there has not been cheating", referring to UEFA's financial fair play rules and that La Liga "is not going to allow a European club to destroy the ecosystem of European football."Mbappe rejected Real Madrid to sign a new three-year deal at PSG last week, prompting Tebas to say the agreement was an "insult to football" given the French club's financial losses.
