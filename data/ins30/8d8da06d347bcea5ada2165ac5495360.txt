Kolkata: Nearly 63% of Indian districts are yet to get a gold hallmarking facility though the government is all set to roll out the second phase of the initiative where it has included hallmarking of gold jewellery of 20, 23 and 24 carats. The second phase of hallmarking kicks off on June 1. In the first phase, which was rolled out on June 1, 2021, hallmarking of 14, 18 and 22 carat jewellery was made mandatory. At present, out of 773 districts in the country, only 288 districts have hallmarking facilities.
