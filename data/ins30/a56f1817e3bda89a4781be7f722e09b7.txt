Phillies in for a major test in Games 3 and 4 despite home-field advantage originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

While the Phillies wrestled home-field advantage away from the Padres by splitting the first two games of the NLCS in San Diego, these next two at Citizens Bank Park will be a big challenge.

The Phils hand the ball in Game 3 to Ranger Suarez, who lasted just 3⅓ innings and walked five in a wild start last week against the Braves in Game 1 of the NLDS.
