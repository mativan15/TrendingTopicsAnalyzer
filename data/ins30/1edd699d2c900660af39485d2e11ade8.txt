There isn't a quarterback walking in that door who is going to save the New Orleans Saints' season. They're 2-5 without any good options: Andy Dalton might be the worst passer in the league at running a two-minute offense, Jameis Winston has somehow still thrown more interceptions than his replacement after resting the last four weeks, and the ship sailed on Taysom Hill a long time ago. Maybe it's practice squad quarterback Jake Luton's time to shine. Unless you're about to trade even more draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles for Gardner Minshew (and history suggests the Saints should never call that area code again), this is what you've got.
