A small cavalcade of tractors trundled through town on Thursday before some parked up at Seymour Square as farmers protested the Government's emissions pricing scheme. The Blenheim demonstration, which caused little-to-no disruption on the roads, was part of the nationwide Groundswell protest, where the proposed levy was being dubbed a 'burp tax' by some and a 'food tax' by others. More than 100 protesters gathered beside Seymour Square at noon, with signs asking people to 'toot for farmers', while other signs warned 'no farmers, no food'.
