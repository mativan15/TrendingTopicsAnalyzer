Tens of thousands of people have protested in Paris against the high cost of living and for a more decisive fight against climate change. But is it the beginning of a wider movement against President Macron's policies?


On Sunday afternoon, thousands of protesters gathered at the Place de la Nation in northeastern Paris waving signs labeled "Stop Tax Evasion" and "I want a 52% Pay Rise Just Like the CEO of Total."
The demonstrators were hoping the march against rising living costs and government inaction on climate change would mark the beginning of a nationwide protest movement.
