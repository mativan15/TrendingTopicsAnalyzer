The Indian government will share anonymised data sets collected and harmonised under the upcoming National Data Governance Framework with Indian start-ups and researchers to innovate systems and create better policy solutions, minister of state for information technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, told Hindustan Times. 'It will be a far-reaching policy that will harmonize all independent silos of data, data management, data processing, so that standards and rules — how to store, manage access, control and security — will form an administrative part of the policy, and its first pillar, ' Chandrasekhar said.
