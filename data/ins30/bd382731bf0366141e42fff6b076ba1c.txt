San Antonio's Noise Ordinance Task Force heard plenty of pushback during two meetings held in the last week with restauranteurs, bar owners and other stakeholders as it considers changes to the city noise ordinance.

It's the latest chapter in a year-long process by the Development Services Department's task force. The focus of its most recent meetings was a series of recommendations from Austin-based consultancy Sound Music Cities LLC.

The consultant recommended four changes to the ordinance: creating a permit system for businesses to create sound, clarifying decibel levels and times for specific decibel levels, stricter enforcement guidelines and potentially rezoning districts with a high concentration of bars and other nightlife venues as entertainment zones.
