(Bloomberg) -- Abbott Laboratories shares dropped the most since June 2021 after third-quarter earnings showed a dwindling demand for Covid testing and substantial declines in its infant nutrition businesses after recalls spawned nationwide baby formula shortages.Total sales of $10.4 billion were down 4.7% from a year ago, with the most acute decline in Abbott's US nutrition business, where sales dropped 25%. Earlier this year the company had to stop production at one of its baby formula plants after a recall though that production has since resumed.
