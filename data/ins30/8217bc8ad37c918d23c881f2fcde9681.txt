"There was an enormous push to digitisation which helped enormously during Covid but yes there was a great deal of disruption, a great deal of the trouble particularly in the unorganised sector which could have been avoided and handled better. At least in the case of Covid, the government learnt from its mistakes while in demonetisation, it did not quite learn from its mistakes," says Mythili Bhusnurmath, Consulting Editor, ET Now on Modi@ 8:A reality check. 
Keeping in account that Covid-19 hit countries all over the world, how did India fare and where do we stand now in terms of growth with the issue of inflation being a big problem? Do these land up at the government's door or is this something that could have happened to any government and they tried the best they could?Covid and inflation are universal concerns and affected every country.
