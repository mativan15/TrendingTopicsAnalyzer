Experts fear the likely causes include increased predation and stresses from warming water.Scientists have been left perplexed after billions of crabs and crustaceans reportedly disappeared mysteriously in the Bering Sea off the US state of Alaska in the last several years.
Ben Daly, a researcher with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), told US media outlet CNN the snow crab population shrank from about 8 billion in 2018 to 1 billion in 2021.
'Snow crab is by far the most abundant of all the Bering Sea crab species that is caught commercially,' Daly said.
