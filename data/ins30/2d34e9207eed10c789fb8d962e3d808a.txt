Daniel Craig had his number one cheerleader on-hand for support at the Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery premiere with his wife Rachel Weisz making a low-key appearance.
It was a big night for the former James Bond actor who debuted the highly-anticipated sequel to Rian Johnson's critically acclaimed 2019 crime mystery as the closing event for this year's BFI London Film Festival. 
Daniel, 54, hit the red carpet solo, looking smart in a 007-worthy tuxedo, before being joined by the rest of his Glass Onion co-stars including actress and singer Janelle Monae and director Rian.
