Strap yourself in for a wild ride: 'The Boys' returns for a third season of head-popping gore, dark humor and psychotic superheroes — and it's a rollicking ride.
Nearly two years have passed since Season 2 of 'The Boys' dropped on Prime Video and ended with Nazi superhero Stormfront (Aya Cash) fried to a cinder and narcissistic, murderous Homelander (Antony Starr) — leader of The Seven — spiraling further into his unbridled madness.
There's a quick catch-up tutorial in the opening episode of Season 3 and, once that's dispensed with, it's right back into the fire with our 'Supes' and the mere mortals plotting their downfall — starting with a clip from 'Dawn of The Seven,' Vaught's big-budget movie rewriting Homelander's history with Stormfront (portrayed by Charlize Theron in a meta twist) in an effort to boost his sagging public ratings.
