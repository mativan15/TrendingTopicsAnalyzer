Wall Street's main indexes jumped on Tuesday as strong earnings from Goldman Sachs ignited hopes that upbeat corporate reports could help soothe market worries of a potential recession due to rising inflation and interest rates.
In midday trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 250 points, or 0.9%, at 30,460, the S&P 500 was up 0.8%, at 3,705, and the Nasdaq  was up 0.7%, at 10,745.
Goldman Sachs jumped 4.58% after reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit due to a slowdown in investment banking, which was cushioned by a boost in net interest income.
