After months of underperformance, Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM) stock bounced back 66% since it announced its better-than-expected Q3 financials on May 12. Despite this recovery, AFRM stock is still down about 86% from the 52-week high. This includes a decline of about 76% this year alone.

The rising interest rates, high inflation, and credit risk are why shares of financial technology companies, including Affirm, have lost substantial value. Along with macro challenges, higher competition and the weakening of revenue yield (revenue as a percentage of gross merchandise volume or GMV) further remained a drag for AFRM stock.
