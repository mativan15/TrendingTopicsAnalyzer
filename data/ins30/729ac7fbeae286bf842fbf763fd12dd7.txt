VANCOUVER—British Columbia's attorney general says a recent report in the Toronto Star highlights the broken system Canada has for tracking money-laundering, and that he's frustrated by the federal government's lack of action on the problem.A joint investigation from the Star and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has David Eby asking why Ottawa has done so little to fight money-laundering given the hardship it has brought to regular Canadians, particularly in the form of real-estate prices.
