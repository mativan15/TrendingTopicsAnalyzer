Investment Thesis

When rules-based ETFs reconstitute during volatile periods, they risk deleting poor-performing securities as they bottom, and not adding them back until after their prices recover. I call it the turnover trap, and even top-performing ETFs I've studied are victims. Unfortunately, the Virtus Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum ETF (NASDAQ:JOET) will be no different. Technology stocks have sharply fallen this year, yet JOET still maintains a 20% allocation to the sector.
