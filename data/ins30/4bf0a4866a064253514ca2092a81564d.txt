Although they operate very different business models, both the digital marketplace bank LendingClub (LC 4.51%) and the artificial intelligence lender Upstart (UPST 6.50%) are market leaders when it comes to online personal lending, each having originated at least $10 billion of unsecured personal debt in 2021. While Upstart originated more loans and will likely continue to do so, LendingClub has a big funding advantage, which will be key as interest rates rise and if economic conditions get more difficult.
