After ministers Satyendra Jain, Manish Sisodia and Rajendra Pal Gautam, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has trained its guns on another AAP cabinet-level member, Jasmine Shah for alleged 'misuse of public office'.
Following a complaint of BJP MP Parvesh Singh Verma, the Planning Department of Delhi Government has issued a showcause notice to the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission (DDDC) vice-chairperson, to reply to the notice within seven days. In his complaint, submitted in September, Verma said Shah, while working as the DDDC vice-chairperson 'acted as official spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party for political gains, which is in violation of established procedures'.
