The cryptocurrency market faced catastrophe in early May, when LUNA tumbled, leaving the once valuable coin near-worthless and thousands of investors struggling. Even those who hadn't bought tokens of their own felt the burn as a lack of confidence tugged on other coins. As attitudes start to recover, experts believe the new month has provided a reason for optimism.Between May 31 and June 2, the coin crossed the much-anticipated £30,000 mark, reaching a high of $32,147.39.While the coin has since dripped again, it remains around the vital mark at $29,801.
