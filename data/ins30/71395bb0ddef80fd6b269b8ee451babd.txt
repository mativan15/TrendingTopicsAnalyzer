Zach LaVine will not play in the Chicago Bulls season opener Wednesday against the Miami Heat, sparking concerns about his availability for the season as he continues to recover from left knee surgery.

LaVine told reporters after shootaround Wednesday that he isn't experiencing specific pain or soreness in the knee and described his absence as injury 'management.'

Although LaVine said he isn't experiencing a 'flare-up' of pain in the knee, he was vague in his description of what specific symptom led to the determination to sit out the opener.
