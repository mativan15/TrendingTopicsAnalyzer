The Timberwolves roster appears set after a series of moves on Saturday.

Placed on waivers were forward CJ Elleby and guards A.J. Lawson and PJ Dozier.

Elleby was signed as a free agent after playing the past two seasons with Portland. Dozier was with Denver the past three seasons, playing in 97 games with six starts. Lawson had been signed to a two-way deal after playing for Dallas' summer league team.

The Wolves confirmed former Iowa center Luka Garza, who was with Detroit last season, had his Exhibit 10 contract converted to a two-way deal after a strong preseason.
