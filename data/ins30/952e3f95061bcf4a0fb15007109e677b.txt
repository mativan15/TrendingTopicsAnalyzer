Gangs of London season 1 featured so much violence its body and torture count outdid Game of Thrones.
The first instalment followed Joe Wallace (Joe Cole) as he sought to avenge his father Finn's (Colm Meaney) murder.
But as other rival gangs also sought to fill up the power vacuum, while Elliot Finch (Sope Dirisu) was secretly trying to bring the Wallace family to justice as an undercover cop, the criminal organisation collapsed.
It turned out Finn had fleeced a powerful group known as The Investors, who had ordered the hit, to leave his family and move to an exotic island with his pregnant lover.
