Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano said Tuesday the "future of the nation" hinges on the outcomes in the Keystone State's statewide elections, including his own."We're going to take back this state. And it's very important: It's just not another gubernatorial race -- I believe the future of the nation is hinged upon the outcome in Pennsylvania at the governor level," he told "Tucker Carlson Tonight" Tuesday."[W]e're sitting on what I call ‘freedom' -- gas and oil and coal.
