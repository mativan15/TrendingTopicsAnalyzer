Apple gave the Apple TV 4K a much-needed refresh last year. While the updates weren't as expansive as I had hoped, they did fix some of the device's most glaring holes, particularly by adding a better remote and a faster, more modern processor. Given the company's less-than-frequent cadence for updating its streaming device, we probably now shouldn't expect any new hardware for a while. After all, the gap between the 2021 refresh and the previous Apple TV 4K was nearly four years. To think we'd be getting another update one year later is some real wishful thinking.
