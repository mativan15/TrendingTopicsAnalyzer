Oct. 17—Southern Oregon University rock band MUSIX has released its first full-length album and will premiere original songs during a free concert from 6:30-8 p.m. Wednesday in Ashland's Lithia Park.

The songs on the new album "Zombie in My Basement!" were created by students in SOU's music program plus its new Music Industry & Production Studies program. The new program debuted this fall and aims to give students a solid grounding in everything from the business of music to using music editing and production software.
