After gaining rights to 'Thursday Night Football,' Amazon Prime is getting a crack at a game on Friday. The live-streaming giant will launch a new 'Black Friday' broadcast in 2023, broadcasting a new game on the day after Thanksgiving. The move will add more NFL football to a period that opens the nation's critical holiday shopping season and expand the NFL beyond its usual annual Thanksgiving roosts on NBC, CBS and Fox. Executives from Amazon and the NFL indicated the new match was baked into the recent 11-year deal the two sides struck that gave the digital titan sole rights to 'Thursday Night Football,' starting with the current season.
