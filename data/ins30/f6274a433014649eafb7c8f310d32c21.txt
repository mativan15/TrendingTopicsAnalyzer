Pakistan's former premier Imran Khan faces a crucial popularity test as he contests in seven of the eight by-elections on Sunday, looking to build momentum for his campaign to pressure the six-month-old government into calling an early national vote.

The seats fell vacant after all 131 lawmakers from Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party resigned from parliament's lower house in April after he was ousted from power through a no-confidence vote. Elections to those seats are being held in phases.
