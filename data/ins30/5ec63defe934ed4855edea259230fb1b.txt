AsiaVision/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE) is slated to report its FQ1'22 earnings results on June 2. STNE stock has suffered a massive battering since its double top bull trap in February 2021. It has lost almost 90% of its value from its all-time highs as the market astutely digested those massive gains from 2020. The stock also staged new record lows in May 2022 before staging a rebound. Our price action analysis also indicates that a double bottom bear trap formed in the May sell-off.
