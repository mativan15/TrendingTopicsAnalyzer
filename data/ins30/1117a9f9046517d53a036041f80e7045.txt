The Wichita Business Journal's list of largest office buildings is a good mix of new, old, east, west and downtown.

You can see all 25 buildings in the attached gallery.

Eleven of the buildings on the list are in the central business district, showing that while Wichita continues to have plenty of office space available downtown, there's also plenty of space in other parts of the city.

East Wichita has 10 buildings, ranging from the six-decade-old Parklane Shopping Center and Office Park (300,000 square feet) to newer buildings such as the 46,000 square-foot Hartman Oil Building at 10500 E.
