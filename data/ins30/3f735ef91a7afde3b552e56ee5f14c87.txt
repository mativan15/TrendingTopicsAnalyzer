LONDON (AP) — Steven Gerrard is out as manager of Premier League club Aston Villa after less than a year in charge.

The Birmingham club said Thursday that Gerrard 'has left the club with immediate effect' after a 3-0 loss at Fulham.

Villa has just two wins after 11 league games and is one spot above the relegation zone.

'We would like to thank Steven for his hard work and commitment and wish him well for the future,' the club said in a brief statement.

The Liverpool great was hired last November in a Premier League return that many expected would eventually lead to the manager's role back at Liverpool, where he played 710 matches — many as captain — and is widely regarded as one of its best players.
