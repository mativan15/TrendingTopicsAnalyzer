A California man faces up to 30 years in prison for a romance scam in which he stole $1.5 million from nearly 20 victims, federal officials reported.

Ze'Shawn Stanley Campbell, 35, of Irvine, falsely told them he was a millionaire business owner and investor who had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan as a U.S. Navy SEAL, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Central California said in a news release.

He pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering Monday, Oct., 17, prosecutors said.

Campbell convinced 10 people, some of whom he developed romantic relationships with, and nine companies to send him hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2014 and 2020, the release said.
