Published: 18:45 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 18:45 EDT, 4 June 2022 As inflation continues to wreak havoc on America, the country hit a grim milestone in the continued skyrocketing of gas prices. The price for a gallon has doubled since President Joe Biden took office in January of 2021. At that time, a gallon ran you $2.39, but as of Saturday, that same gallon now costs $4.81, according to AAA. That price is even up five cents from Friday alone, as Republicans continue to hammer the current administration on the pinch at the pump.
