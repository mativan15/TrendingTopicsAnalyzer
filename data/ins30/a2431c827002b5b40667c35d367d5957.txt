The possessive claim in the title 'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' is a gutsy one. There's confidence — some would even say arrogance — in filming an oft-told story at least as old as the hills, and suddenly branding it as your own: Even two auteurs as ballsy as Francis Ford Coppola and Baz Luhrmann didn't slap their own names on 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' and 'William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,' respectively. Still, you can hardly blame del Toro's stop-motion spin on Carlo Collodi's 19th-century chestnut 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' for wanting to advertise its distinguishing vision up top: After umpteen tellings of the wooden-boy tale, and coming on the heels of Robert Zemeckis' wretched Disney remake, Netflix's rival adaptation has to announce itself as something different.
