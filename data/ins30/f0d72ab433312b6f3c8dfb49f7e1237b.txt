Every investor in Garmin Ltd. (NYSE:GRMN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I quite like to see at least a little bit of insider ownership. As Charlie Munger said 'Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.

With a market capitalization of US$20b, Garmin is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register.
