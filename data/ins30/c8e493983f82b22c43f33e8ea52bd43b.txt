Jun. 3—The Butler County Democratic Party has selected a new party chair and candidate to challenge embattled County Auditor Roger Reynolds in the November election.

Kathy Wyenandt of Fairfield Twp. was elected chair of the Butler County Democratic Party in a party reorganization meeting last night.

Wyenandt is a long-time Democratic Party and Lakota School District volunteer and activist.

"Our goal is to re-establish government for the average Ohioan and eliminate from office corrupt legislators who accept bribes in exchange for the passage of laws that line big corporations' pockets and ignore the rights of citizens," said Wyenandt.
