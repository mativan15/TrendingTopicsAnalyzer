Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles are one way to purchase a gently used car, truck, or SUV from a dealership with fewer miles than you might see on a traditional used-car lot.

Right now, with used-car prices up 10 percent in May compared to already climbing prices in 2021, it can be hard to get an affordable used car of any kind.

On the brighter side, trade-in values are up 72 percent over 2021, so you might be getting a deal on the other end of the transaction if you have a car to sell.
