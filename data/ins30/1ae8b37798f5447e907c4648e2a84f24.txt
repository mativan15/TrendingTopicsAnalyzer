Oct. 15—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — Ianni's Pizzeria is expanding outside of Westmoreland County for the first time in its 95-year history, into a location on a mountainous section of Menoher Boulevard in Upper Yoder Township.

The 3849 Menoher Blvd. location, the former location of the Pickin' Chicken takeout restaurant, is "rather remote," said Ianni's co-owner Wesley Harris — but the spot is a familiar landmark for people who travel along Route 271 between Ligonier and Johnstown.

The old sign for Pickin' Chicken still remains at the property.
