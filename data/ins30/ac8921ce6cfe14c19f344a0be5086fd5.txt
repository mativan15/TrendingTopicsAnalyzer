The Miami Dolphins are set to host the Pittsburgh Steelers for a Sunday night matchup at Hard Rock Stadium this weekend.

Head coach Mike McDaniel's team has lost their last three games due to stupid penalties, turnovers and injuries at key positions after starting the season 3-0. They're expecting to have Tua Tagovailoa back under center, so they should be a more productive offensive team in Week 7.

The Pittsburgh Steelers have had an interesting start to their season as well with Mitchell Trubisky and Kenny Pickett both getting playing time earlier on.
