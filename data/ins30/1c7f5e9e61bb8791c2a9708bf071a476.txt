Microsoft is still working on a small streaming puck that would allow people to play games over the internet, according to a new report.But it is making changes to the way that it works and it could not arrive for some time.The device would not require any of the powerful and expensive components that power consoles like the Xbox Series X. Instead, it would simply stream games over the internet, from a remote console, using Microsoft's Cloud Gaming platform.That would allow customers to play the latest Xbox games at a much lower cost – as well as avoiding the ongoing problems with actually being able to buy an Xbox, which remain mostly out of stock and difficult to find.
