Seattle-based tax software company Avalara Inc. is officially a private company.

The company on Wednesday announced the close of its $8.4 billion acquisition by Austin-based private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, and the company's shares have stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The acquisition closed after facing opposition from some individual shareholders and shareholder firms.

"We thank our employees, customers, partners and shareholders for their trust during this process, and we are excited to begin our work alongside Vista,' Scott McFarlane, co-founder and CEO of Avalara, said in a release.
