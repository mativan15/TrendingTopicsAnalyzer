The UK Government is taking immediate steps to deter and penalise Chinese recruitment of British military pilots."When former UK military pilots provide training to the People's Liberation Army of China it clearly erodes the UK's defence advantage. We are taking immediate steps to deter and penalise this activity," tweeted the Ministry of Defence Press Office on October 18 (local time). The move comes amid reports of China hiring nearly 30 retired British military pilots to train pilots in the People's Liberation Army which raised alarms that the practice could threaten the UK's national security.
