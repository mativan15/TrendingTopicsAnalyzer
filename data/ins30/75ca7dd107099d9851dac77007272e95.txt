Kevin Fiala loved his time in Minnesota. He made that very clear on Saturday morning at Xcel Energy Center before his former team, the Wild, played his current team, the Los Angeles Kings.

Not surprisingly, though, Fiala is already loving his new life on the West Coast.

Especially the weather.

'It's very different than here,' Fiala said with a laugh while chatting with a few familiar faces. 'I like it a little more than there.'

Nonetheless, Fiala was thrilled to be back on the Twin Cities over the weekend.
