The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to increase the 'linkage' fees paid by developers for new commercial real estate projects by 66%, putting them at more than double Boston's rate.

After the vote, the fees are now $33.34 per square foot of a building's gross floor area. They are one-time payments that apply to new labs, offices and other non-residential facilities of at least 30,000 square feet, with the funds going towards affordable housing initiatives in Cambridge.

In addition to new buildings, the fees apply to properties undergoing significant renovations in changing from one use to another, a provision that captures office-to-lab conversions.
