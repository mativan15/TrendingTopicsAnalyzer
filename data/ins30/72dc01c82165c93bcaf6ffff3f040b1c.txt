'This is a highly integrative project,' said Nesbitt. 'It's augmented reality people talking with education people, talking with scientists. Just locally, the collaboration has been amazing. What's flown out of that is a bunch of students interacting too. Showing undergraduate students how a process like this works and how much goes into reconstructing a skeleton was one of our ultimate goals.' 
'It's really exciting to see collaborations across fields with this project and to see so many people learning about new ways to work on their topics of research,' said Stocker.
