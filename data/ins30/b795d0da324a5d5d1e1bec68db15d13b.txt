AgenciesMarcus Rashford, a future Manchester United legend, is already a member of Erik ten Hag's team, said Ander Herrera. As Rashford's friend in the Old Trafford dressing room for more than three years, Herrera saw first-hand how quickly he moved from academy prodigy to senior star. Rashford is still a crucial member of the Red Devils' team, playing alongside players like Cristiano Ronaldo and under his third permanent boss, Ten Hag. And Herrera hopes that Rashford may continue to excel at his boyhood club and develop into "one of the biggest Manchester United players in history" under the tutelage of both of those individuals.
