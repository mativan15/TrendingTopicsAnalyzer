DUBAI, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to issue new U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and sukuk and has made a tender offer to holders of existing notes to purchase them for cash, a London Stock Exchange filing and bank document showed on Tuesday.

Initial price guidance for the new notes was around 135 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries (UST) for six-year sukuk and around 180 bps over UST for 10-year conventional bonds, the bank document showed.

BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs and HSBC are global coordinators and joint bookrunners on the debt sale, while Aljazira Capital, Citi, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered are passive joint lead managers and bookrunners.
