May 28—ROCHESTER — The weekends are made to spend time with family and friends, both human and fur, if you own pets.

For some, hanging out with their dogs means taking them to disc events.

That happened Saturday, May 28, 2022, at the Dumpster Fire Palooza at Riverview West Park in Rochester. Long Shot Dog Sports, a small business owned by Tiffany Long, hosts Toss and Fetch and UpDog events for people who want to get involved with their dog and disc.

Long first joined the disc dog world when her dog, Kaiba, was a puppy.
