Excise licences of hotels, clubs and restaurants in Delhi have been extended till July 31 in view of a delay in grant of approval to the city's excise policy for 2022-23 by the Delhi lieutenant governor, officials said on Friday. In an order issued on Monday, the excise department of the Delhi government extended the Excise Policy 2021-22 for two months till July 31. The Excise Policy 2022-23 was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on May 5. It is yet to be approved by the lieutenant governor (L-G). 
For the extension, the licence-holders will have to pay a pro-rate licence fee for two months by May 31.
