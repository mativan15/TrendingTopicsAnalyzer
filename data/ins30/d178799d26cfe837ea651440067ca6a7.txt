City investors are bracing for a week of renewed choppy trading in UK financial markets as Liz Truss's government attempts to regain control and the Bank of England steps back from its emergency intervention.Before markets reopen for the first time since the Bank halted its multibillion-pound support programme on Friday, analysts said renewed turbulence on Monday despite Kwasi Kwarteng's sacking as chancellor could not be ruled out.'It has been such a volatile time. We can't expect plain sailing from here regardless of all the changes made,' said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
