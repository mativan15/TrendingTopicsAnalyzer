A mum of five was able to slash her water bill in half after contacting her provider for a meter. Karen Hudson, 56, was paying £43 a month for her water, but her bills dropped to £24.50 after getting one fitted.She said to The Sun: 'I was shocked by how much I was saving.'We're not on a huge amount of money because I have multiple sclerosis, which means I can't work and we have to be quite frugal with money - any saving is an advantage.'Water bills are often labelled 'the forgotten utility' as people assume they can't save on this as they can't switch water providers.
