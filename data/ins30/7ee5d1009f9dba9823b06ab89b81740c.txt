Harry Styles took an apparent bottle to the groin at his recent Chicago concert but shook it off like a Taylor Swift song.While performing at the United Center, the "As It Was" singer was speaking to his fans, as he routinely does throughout his concert, and talking about the weather in the Windy City when he was hit by what appeared to be a bottle in a very sensitive area.Tweets of the incident went viral, as it has unfortunately become more commonplace for artists to be targeted on stage at their shows - whether it be out of adoration or terror.
