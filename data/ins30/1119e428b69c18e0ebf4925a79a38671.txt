BARCELONA are hoping Gerard Pique will announce his retirement next summer to save them money following his shock split with Shakira.
That's according to RAC1, who claim Barca would prefer it if Pique rolled credits on his celebrated career in 2023 to save themselves €80million (£70m) in wages over the next two seasons.
