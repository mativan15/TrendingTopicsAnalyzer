It's been a bumpy ride for Netflix recently, and the announcement that it will be charging for password sharing hasn't gone as smoothly as it might have hoped, a new report claims. Subscribers in Peru who were opted in to new password-sharing restrictions have reported confusion over Netflix's loose definition of 'household' and noted the lack of clarity around the differing charges imposed on consumers.
Global tech news site Rest of World informally surveyed more than a dozen Netflix users in Peru, after Netflix's March announcement that it would be asking customers in the country — as well as in Chile and Costa Rica — to pay extra when sharing their account passwords outside their homes.
