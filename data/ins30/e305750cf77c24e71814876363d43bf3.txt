AquariusThis week, it's best to adopt a live and let live policy. Try not to see a difference of opinion with a friend as a personal attack, or feel you need to defend your point of view. Instead, be open-minded and agree to disagree.PiscesFeeling repressed? If so, ask yourself whether it's circumstantial or self-inflicted; you'll probably conclude that it's the latter. However, you shouldn't have to monitor your words or make others guess. Say what you think.AriesFinancially flustered? Money matters will be a lot clearer now, allowing you to make firm decisions.
