Marijuana company Canopy Growth (CGC -5.23%) is trading at multi-year lows. The cannabis producer has been struggling to find ways to grow and seems to be in an endless holding pattern, waiting for the U.S. to legalize pot so that it can execute on multiple deals it has pending, including one from 2019 involving the acquisition of multi-state operator Acreage Holdings.
There's no timetable as to when (or if) that deal may finally get across the finish line. And in the meantime, Canopy Growth still needs to strengthen its existing operations, which frankly don't look great right now.
