The New England Patriots have an opportunity to get back to .500 win percentage in Sunday's road showdown with the Cleveland Browns.

For coach Bill Belichick, it's a trip back to his old stomping grounds and the team that gave him his first head coaching job. His Patriots will be facing a Browns offense led by the quarterback he drafted in the third round of the 2016 NFL draft, Jacoby Brissett.

The Browns haven't done well passing the ball, but they've been an unstoppable juggernaut on the ground.
