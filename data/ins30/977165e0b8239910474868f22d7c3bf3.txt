Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings (NYSE:KNX) shares slid sharply in Wednesday's extended trading after missing EPS estimates and paring full-year forecasts. The Arizona-based transportation company posted $1.27 in adjusted earnings per share alongside a 15.2% jump in revenue from the prior year to $1.89B. While the latter figure was in-line with expectations, the former came up $0.05 short of analyst consensus. A 400 basis point increase in the operating ratio for the Truckload segment was blamed for a drop in operating income.
