Narendra Modi's government is intensifying its efforts to relegate English to the margins of Indian life where it believes it belongs as a 'colonial relic' by offering medical degrees in Hindi for the first time.Ever since he came to power eight years ago, Modi, along with home minister Amit Shah and other Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, have taken intermittent pot shots at the English language and talked up Hindi, the language of north India.After Independence Day, how can India get rid of 200m flags?Modi has spoken frequently of freeing Indians of the 'colonial mindset' left by the British empire and of removing the relics of that rule.
