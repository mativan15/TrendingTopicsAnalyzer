Kanye West has been asked if he's been taking care of his mental health after embarking on an endless string of controversial rants in recent weeks. 
The Jesus Walks rapper has been locked out of mainstream social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, after posting comments deemed to be anti-semitic. It came after he branded Black Lives Matter a ‘scam', wore a White Lives Matter shirt and repeated claims that his ex-wife Kim Kardashian blocked him from attending their daughter Chicago's birthday party earlier this year.
