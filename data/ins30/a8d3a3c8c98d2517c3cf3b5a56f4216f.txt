If you only had $100 to spare in your budget, you'd want to spend it the best way possible. 
The same is true for governments looking to bring vital health or sanitation services to more people. As the CEO of the nonprofit Evidence Action, Kanika Bahl works to disrupt traditional international development to help find, fund, and scale the approaches that drive outsize impact for every dollar spent. The result: effective and efficient poverty interventions that reach millions around the world.
Bahl's experience in business, microfinance, and emerging markets finance — including at the nonprofits Clinton Health Access Initiative and Results for Development — influences the approach she takes at Evidence Action.
