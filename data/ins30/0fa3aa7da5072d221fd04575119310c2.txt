"It feels it's all about to erupt."

That's Jonny Lee Miller's British Prime Minister in the just-released trailer for season 5 of The Crown, which launches on Netflix Nov. 9. And his premonition will prove correct.

When EW recently spoke with Imelda Staunton for our recent cover story about The Crown the actress confirmed that the show's upcoming season will detail some of the royal family's darker days.

"This particular part of history, an awful lot happens," said Staunton, who is taking over the role of the late Queen Elizabeth II from Olivia Colman for seasons 5 and 6 of the show.
