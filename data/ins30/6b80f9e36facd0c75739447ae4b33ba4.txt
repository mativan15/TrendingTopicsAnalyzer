In the aftermath of a mass shooting on a New York City subway train, Mayor Eric Adams floated a high-tech idea: deploy scanners that can spot someone carrying a gun into the transit system before they have a chance to use it.The technology to scan large numbers of people quickly for weapons does exist, and is used now to screen people at places like sports stadiums and theme parks.But security experts say installing such a system in the city's sprawling, porous subway system in a way that would make a difference would be difficult, if not impossible.
