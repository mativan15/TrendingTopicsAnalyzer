BJP Spokesperson Harish Khurana on October 20 hit out at AAP government over rising pollution in Delhi. Harish Khurana said 'Aam Aadmi Party's duplicity and inefficiency have come out. I want to ask the Arvind Kejriwal about AAP leaders bursting firecrackers. By last year, they were saying that the Parali burnt in Punjab is the reason behind the pollution in Delhi. Now every day almost 1000 farmers are burning Parali in Punjab but Arvind Kejriwal is not speaking a word where his government is present.
