Watch: Jeremy Hunt reverses most tax cuts to tackle economic instability

Jeremy Hunt has delivered sweeping changes to the government's tax plans in his first act as chancellor in an attempt to get the public finances back on track and stabilise financial markets after weeks of turmoil.

The new chancellor of the exchequer on Monday made an emergency statement on the government's medium-term fiscal plan following talks over the weekend with prime minister Liz Truss.

Hunt, who took over from Kwasi Kwarteng after he was sacked by Truss, said he will reverse almost all the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget, ripping apart Truss's £43bn tax-cutting agenda.
