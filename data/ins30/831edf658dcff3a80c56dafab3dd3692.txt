The Reliance JioBook Laptop is now available for purchase for about Rs 15,000 in India. The JioBook is designed for basic purposes like education or browsing, and will suit people with a limited budget. The budget laptop comes with a starting price of Rs 15,799 in India and may cost less than Rs 15000 with additional offers. Earlier this month, at the India Mobile Congress (IMC), Reliance Jio revealed its first-ever new-launch laptop. Initially, the device was available for only government officials but is now on sale for everyone.
