Oct. 14—Physical health is a key component to improving overall well-being, and many local organizations offer services to help support and encourage a healthy lifestyle.

The United Way partners with many different companies that all work to bring physical health options to the community. This week, the United Way is shining light on these physical health partners as a part of their annual campaign.

The YMCA offers many different healthy living programs.

"For physical health, we offer a variety of group exercise classes," said Christy Mayfield, YMCA healthy living manager.
