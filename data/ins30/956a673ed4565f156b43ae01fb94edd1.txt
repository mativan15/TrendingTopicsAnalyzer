A federal appeals court rejected former Newport News airport director Ken Spirito's appeal of his convictions for misusing public money, money laundering and perjury.

The charges involved the Peninsula Airport Commission's use of federal state and local funds to guarantee a loan to the start up airline People Express in 2014.

Stories in the Daily Press revealing the guarantee sparked state and federal investigations, legislation to tighten state transportation finding rules, the resignation of Newport News City Manager Jim Bourey, who served on the commission, and Spirito's dismissal.
