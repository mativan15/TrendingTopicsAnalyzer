Maksym Kapliuk Overview Global equities moved higher in the wake of the strong gains in the US yesterday. US futures point to the possibility of a gap-higher opening today. Most of the large Asia-Pacific bourses rallied 1-2%, with China's CSI a notable exception, slipping fractionally. Europe's STOXX 600 is edging higher and is near two-week highs. If the gains are sustained, it will be the fourth consecutive advancing session, the longest in two months. Benchmark yields are higher - mostly 7-12 bp in Europe, while the US 10-year Treasury yield is up about three basis points to 4.
