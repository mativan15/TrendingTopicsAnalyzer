Antonio Bordunovi Investment thesis I think that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) could see a strong and fierce recovery in the Gaming segment as the segment has fallen below levels seen in previous down cycles, while the channel inventory has been reduced significantly, and the new product launches will drive an acceleration to growth. For Nvidia's data center segment, there are some concerns about China cloud and the charges relating to the business in the quarter. However, guidance for the business remains strong and there is no concrete evidence of any material slowdown in the Data Centre segment.
