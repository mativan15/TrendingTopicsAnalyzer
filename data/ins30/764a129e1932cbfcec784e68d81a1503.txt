As an investor, mistakes are inevitable. But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of Seafarms Group Limited (ASX:SFG), who have seen the share price tank a massive 81% over a three year period. That would be a disturbing experience. And over the last year the share price fell 80%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. Furthermore, it's down 39% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
