BREA, Calif., October 17, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Golden State showed continued strong gains in sales tax receipts in the second quarter of 2022, reporting an overall 10% spike in sales and use tax from April through June when compared to the same quarter last year. These returns mark the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth since the pandemic periods in 2020.

"Commuters returning to offices combined with the Russia-Ukraine conflict continuing to put upward pressure on oil prices have left Californians facing the highest average price per gallon on record resulting in fuel and service station receipts 42% higher than last year," stated HdL Companies President/CEO Andy Nickerson.
