jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) reported revenue increased 13.8% to $1.2B in FQ4. Organic growth was 4.3% over a two-year period during the quarter after backing out the impact from the Barletta business. The RV giant said pricing actions helped to offset a decline in towable units sold during the quarter. WGO's gross profit margin rate fell 30 basis points in the quarter to 17.8% as a result of higher material and component costs and deleverage that were only partially offset by pricing actions.
