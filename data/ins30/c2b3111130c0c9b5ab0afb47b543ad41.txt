JP Morgan's Marko Kolanovic, one of the most closely followed quantitative analysts on Wall Street, augured in a note to clients on Wednesday that U.S. stocks could see a torrid rebound during the latter half of 2022. While Kolanovic's boss (JPM CEO Jamie Dimon) helped spook markets on Wednesday with his talk of an economic 'hurricane', the JPM quant recounted the reasons why the latest rebound in stocks could continue, even as U.S. equities finished Wednesday's session slightly lower. According to him, May could serve as a 'template' for stocks during the balance of the year.
