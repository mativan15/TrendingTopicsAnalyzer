Julian Assange is facing 'a very dark' situation and the Australian government must show 'courage' in pushing the US to drop the charges against the WikiLeaks co-founder, a leading human rights lawyer says.Jennifer Robinson, who represents Assange, said she last saw her fellow Australian citizen during a visit to Belmarsh prison, in London, last month and indicated his health had been declining since he had a mini-stroke last year.'He's just had Covid in prison and has been in 24-hour isolation,' Robinson said in an interview with Guardian Australia on Wednesday.
