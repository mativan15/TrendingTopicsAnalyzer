Thunder Bay's Crystal beer drinkers won't have to find a new brand after all. Despite recent rumours to the contrary, Labatt assures the lager is not, in fact, being discontinued.Earlier this week, rumours were going around on online forums suggesting Labatt would be killing the brand, which is a staple in the northwestern Ontario city's bars, curling rinks and local garages.CBC News has confirmed with Labatt those rumours were, in fact, false. "Due to the high demand for Labatt Crystal we are currently out of stock, but we're working quickly to ensure product is restocked and available in Thunder Bay," a spokesperson for the brewery told CBC News.
