ESPN's College GameDay is officially returning to Eugene, and with it will come all of the fanfare and buzz that is fit of the weekly marquee show for the mothership.

Kirk Herbstreit, Lee Corso, Reece Davis, Pat McAfee, and Desmond Howard are going to find some place on campus and set up shop this week to preview what will be one of the best football games of the weekend, a showdown between the No. 12 Oregon Ducks and No. 11 UCLA Bruins. Of course, as is tradition, there will be one 'guest picker' up on stage with them at the end of the show that goes through the top games of the weekend and makes picks for who will win.
