(Bloomberg) -- The words used to describe the UK economy and its currency are growing increasingly dire as analysts revise down their forecasts. Earlier this month, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said a surge in food costs could have 'apocalyptic' consequences for the poorest people in society and the global economy. On Monday, Bank of America Corp. strategists warned of 'existential' risks to sterling. The vocabulary is translating into the numbers. The consensus year-end 2022 forecast for the pound against the euro weakened Tuesday to the worst in over a year, according to a Bloomberg survey.
