Malachi Toliver is a six-foot-six, 300-pound, 2024 offensive tackle from Cartersville, Georgia, where he plays for the Cartersville Hurricanes, a powerhouse in Georgia that recently from 4A to 5A after reclassification in 2020.
The Hurricanes are 7-1 this season and 2-1 in region play. They will play Woodland and Dalton before attempting to make another deep run in the playoffs. Toliver currently doesn't have any full-season films, but he does have a few individual game films from the season.

From what I can tell, Toliver is a mauler in the running game and a pancake machine when he is protecting the quarterback on passing downs.
