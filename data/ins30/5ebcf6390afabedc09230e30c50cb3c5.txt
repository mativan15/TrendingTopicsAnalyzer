Gold Star, one of the best-known names in Cincinnati chili, has long been a supporter of the Bengals, with the restaurant chain now spending about a quarter of its total marketing dollars in association with the NFL team.

Gold Star has been a sponsor of the Cincinnati Bengals for more than 20 years, and it nets the restaurant chain perks like having eight locations inside downtown's Paycor Stadium, as well as the ability to use the team and its brand in marketing. Over the years, the partnership has only grown.
