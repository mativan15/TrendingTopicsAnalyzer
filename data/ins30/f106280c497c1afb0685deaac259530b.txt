The last time Snap Inc. reported quarterly results, the roof caved in and its shares lost a quarter of their value.Slackening digital advertising and warnings of deep cost cuts will do that to a stock. But Snap's SNAP, +6.01% conundrum was merely a prelude for similar troubles at Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc.  META, +5.74%, Twitter Inc.  TWTR, +0.57%,  Pinterest Inc.  PINS, +5.53%  and, to a lesser extent, Alphabet Inc.'s  GOOGL, +3.53%   GOOG, +3.70% Google. Each is caught in a vice grip of inflation, a war in Ukraine and a looming recession, which combine to make for a dismal near-future for online advertising.
