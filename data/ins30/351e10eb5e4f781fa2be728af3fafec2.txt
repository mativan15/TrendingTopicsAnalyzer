When it comes to blankets, Barefoot Dreams is in a league of its own. The super-soft beauties have a feverish cult-like following that includes everyone from Chrissy Teigen (who professed her love for them in a 2019 tweet) to Kourtney Kardashian, who wrapped herself up in one of the plush blankets during a glam session. While the CozyChic Marled Stripe Blanket is typically pricey, we spotted an incredibly rare sale on the 45" x 60" size. Right now, the throws are marked down at QVC to only $75 (from $130) — they're never this cheap!Don't want to pay all in one go? Opt for five Easy Pay installments of just $15.
