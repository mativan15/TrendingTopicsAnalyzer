The Australian government has reversed a decision by its predecessor to recognize West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, prompting a rebuke from the Israeli government. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong reaffirmed Canberra's "previous and long-standing position" on Israel in a briefing on Tuesday, emphasizing the new Labor government's unwavering support both for Israel and the Palestinian people. "Australia is committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist, in peace and security, within internationally recognized borders," Wong said.
