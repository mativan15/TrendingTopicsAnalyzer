Comedian Zakir Khan is all set to return with some cringeworthy poetry, which he says will be so bad that the audience will fall in love with it. Titled Farzi Mushaira, the comedy web show on Amazon miniTV will have him officiate a fake poetry session with several names from the entertainment industry joining him for some harmless fun. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Zakir opens up about what he is up to and how confident he is about not offending anyone.
