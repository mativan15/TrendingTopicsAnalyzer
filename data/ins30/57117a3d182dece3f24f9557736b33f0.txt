A top former executive at the highly valued NFT startup OpenSea was arrested Wednesday and charged 'with wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading,' according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York (SDNY).
TechCrunch previously covered the firing of former OpenSea Head of Product Nate Chastain. Chastain was accused of front-running purchases of NFT collections that he knew were about to be featured prominently on the homepage of OpenSea.
