Elon Musk plans to cut Twitter's workforce by almost 75% after he finalizes the deal to buy the social media company, a move that's likely to cause chaos among employees, according to a new report from the Washington Post. And that's to say nothing of Musk's plan to reinstate the accounts of far-right figures like former president Donald Trump.The news comes as Bloomberg News reports Musk is on track to actually close the deal and buy Twitter after months of backpedaling and litigation. And to top it all off, President Joe Biden's administration is said to be looking at the billionaire's actions with both Starlink and Twitter, concerned that Musk's friendliness with autocrats could pose a threat to national security, according to yet another report from Bloomberg News.
