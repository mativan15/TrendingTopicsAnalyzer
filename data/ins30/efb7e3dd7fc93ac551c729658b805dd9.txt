Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has hit out at VAR for disallowing his team a goal against Liverpool. City's unbeaten start to the season ended at Anfield thanks to a late Mohamed Salah goal.City thought they had taken the lead earlier in the second half. Phil Foden squeezed the ball into the net from a tight angle.However, VAR recommended referee Anthony Taylor to review an incident involving Erling Haaland and Fabinho. Taylor deemed Haaland to have fouled Fabinho in the build-up and the goal was ruled out.
