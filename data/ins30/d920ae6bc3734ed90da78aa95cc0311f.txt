What made you get into comedy?Benny Hill was my inspiration as a child. I wanted to run about chasing women in swimsuits around trees. Sadly, the 80s politically correct culture swooped in and made this an unviable career choice so more traditional standup seemed to be a safer bet.What advice would you give to up-and-coming comedians?Love the audience. They have paid good money to watch you fill the void in your soul so love them without caring who they are or who they vote for. Don't start out your career imagining you are going to teach them something.
