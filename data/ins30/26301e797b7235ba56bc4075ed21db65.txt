Pound coins and notes

The pound rose against the dollar and government borrowing costs dipped as the markets reacted to Prime Minister Liz Truss's resignation.

Sterling hit $1.13 as Ms Truss made her announcement and rose higher in the afternoon before falling back to $1.12.

One analyst said investors were "relieved" by the news, despite a lot of uncertainty remaining.

Business groups said the new prime minister would have to act quickly to restore confidence.

A fall in the value of the pound increases the price of goods and services imported into the UK from overseas - because when the pound is weak against the dollar or euro, for example, it costs more for companies in the UK to buy things such as food, raw materials or parts from abroad.
