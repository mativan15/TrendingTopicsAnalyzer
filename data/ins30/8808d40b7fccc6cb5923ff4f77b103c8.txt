Smartphone maker Vivo on Tuesday said it will release software updates this month to make most of its 5G-enable handsets work with both standalone and non-standalone 5G networks.
Standalone 5G network transmits only 5G signal, while the signal with a mix of 4G and 5G networks is called non-standalone 5G network.
At present, Reliance Jio provides standalone 5G network while Bharti Airtel offers non-standalone 5G network.
Vivo has launched 30 smartphones for 5G services, which are compatible with non-standalone 5G network.
