A political advocacy group created to support President Biden's agenda on Wednesday released an ad touting the administration's student loan relief program.

The Building Back Together ad is targeted toward young people, especially Latinos and African Americans, with a six-figure buy.

The ad kicks off with CNBC host Shepard Smith delivering news of the White House's 'efforts to forgive student loan debt.'

Smith's voice and image are remixed, leaving the anchor onscreen repeating the word 'debt' in a robotic monotone.
