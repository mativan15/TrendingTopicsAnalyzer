Dwayne Johnson's "Black Adam" has been 15 years in the making, but the antihero has finally made his way to the big screen. The DC movie tells the story of Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson), a former slave who gets superpowers and defends the people of Kahndaq with vicious brutality. Although Black Adam is a hero of sorts, he isn't afraid to cross the boundaries that other characters in the DC Extended Universe won't. But the producers had to cut down some of that violence to get the film a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.
