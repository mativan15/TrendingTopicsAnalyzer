New Mexico State will take on No. 3 national seed Oregon Friday, June 3, at 8 p.m. on ESPNU.

Nine of the top 150 MLB Draft prospects will compete in the Corvallis Regional this weekend. None play for New Mexico State.

So the Aggies have adopted the only rallying cry they can: Why not us?

The Aggies know they'll need any edge they can get heading to the Corvallis Regional of the NCAA Tournament, hosted by No. 3 national seed Oregon State — whether it's luck, skill or anything in between. NMSU slipped into the Field of 64 by earning the WAC's automatic qualifying bid when the Aggies won the WAC Tournament last week and has the second-fewest wins and second-lowest RPI of any team to make the Tournament.
