The stock price of South Korea's internet giant Kakao tumbled on Monday after a fire at a data center that cut off power on Saturday, causing several service malfunctions.
The blaze at the SK C&C data center, which houses the servers of Korea's two largest internet companies — Kakao and Naver — disrupted Kakao's messaging, ride-hailing, payment and game apps, and Naver's internet search and news services, over the weekend.
Some disruption is ongoing — mainly affecting Kakao's services.
On Monday morning, Kakao's share price dropped more than 9%.
