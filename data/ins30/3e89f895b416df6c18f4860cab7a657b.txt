ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - Bids to buy the massive Romanesque cathedral that has loomed over downtown St. John's, N.L. for over 150 years close Thursday. It's a day Newfoundland English professor and historian Shane O'Dea never thought possible. The archdiocese of St. John's is selling the basilica because it needs the money to pay survivors of physical and sexual abuse endured by young boys at the former Mount Cashel Orphanage, which once stood just three kilometres away from the historic church. "It's absolutely inconceivable," O'Dea said in an interview Wednesday.
