Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged the United States to reconsider a nuclear deal with Iran as any funds could end up helping Russia sustain its invasion of Ukraine. "I believe that we should place heavy sanctions on Iran, and those who advocate lifting the sanctions, which is what this nuclear deal would do if it ever gets signed, would bring hundreds of billions of dollars not only to Iran, but to Russia's coffers as well," Netanyahu told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.
