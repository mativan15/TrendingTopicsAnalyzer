In 2020, when Angela Lang and her team at Black Leaders Organizing for Communities encountered Milwaukee residents who were nervous about voting in person during the pandemic, they pointed to a widely available alternative: ballot drop boxes.

Two years later, drop boxes are no longer an option for voters in the state – after the conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July barred their use. So, on Wednesday night, Lang's team blasted out a text message to voters urging them to return their absentee ballots by mail, no later than November 1.
