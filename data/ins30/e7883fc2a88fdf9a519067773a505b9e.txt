Sometime after midnight on a freezing morning in August 2002, 24-year-old Jim Chalmers swum the length of the fish pond at University House at the Australian National University. Chalmers was an ANU alumnus, completing a PhD on the leadership of Paul Keating. Back then, he worked as a researcher in Labor's national secretariat and had just wound up work on a party review spearheaded by Bob Hawke and Neville Wran. He went to the pub. A few beverages in, someone mentioned Hawke had swum the length of the University House fish pond half a century before.
