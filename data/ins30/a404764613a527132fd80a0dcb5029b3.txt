Meanwhile, south of the border, there was little sign the surge in gun violence was abating.
Three people were killed and 11 wounded in Philadelphia on Saturday night, and in Phoenix, Arizona a 14-year-old girl was killed and eight other people injured after a mass shooting in a strip mall.
According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have already been 239 mass shootings in the US this year - in which at least four people have been killed or injured.
The figure was set to rise after 14 people were shot in Chattanooga, Tennessee in the early hours of Sunday morning.
