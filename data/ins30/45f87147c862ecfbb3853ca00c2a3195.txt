Not only do student loan borrowers who fell behind on their payments get President Joe Biden's debt forgiveness, but they also get a chance to erase their delinquent status.

The Education Department's (ED) Fresh Start program announced in April is an initiative to get default borrowers back into good standing once the pandemic payment pause expires at the end of the year.

What that means is these borrowers will again qualify for other relief programs that could help them meet their debt obligations in the future.
