The Denver Broncos had high hopes for Greg Dulcich when they drafted the UCLA tight end in the third round of the 2022 NFL draft, but he started his first season on injured reserve, missing the first five games of the year.

Dulcich was activated just in time for Monday night's game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and he wasted little time living up to the hype, showing off his big-play ability on a 39-yard touchdown catch from Russell Wilson.
