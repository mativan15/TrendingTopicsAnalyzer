Sorry, this video isn't available yet.
Will Taylor (Dean Andrews) is on a mission, but he isn't half making it complicated for himself. 
The Emmerdale local is going behind the backs of Kim Tate (Claire King) and Gabby Thomas (Rosie Bentham) to use young Thomas' hair to ascertain whether Jamie is alive. 
For a DNA comparison they need a sample from a blood relative of Jamie and Will decides on the simplest option – Jamie's kid.
Gabby is pleased when Will offers to babysit Thomas, obviously not realising he has an ulterior motive.
