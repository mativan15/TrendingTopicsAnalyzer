(Bloomberg) -- A global anti-money laundering watchdog removed Pakistan from its 'gray' monitoring list after four years, providing relief for the South Asian nation that is facing a crisis. The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force said the country 'has strengthened the effectiveness' of its regime for anti-money laundering and combating terror financing, and addressed technical deficiencies to meet the commitments of its action plans. Pakistan has been on the FATF's monitoring list since 2018 for its inability to combat money laundering and terror financing.
