The NSW gambling regulator will fine Sydney's The Star a record $100 million for its failure to stem criminal activity and money laundering within its casinos.

The Sydney Morning Herald understands the Independent Casino Commission (ICC) will hand down the decision on Monday, which is also the first day on the job for The Star's new chief executive Robbie Cooke.

Last month the ICC published Adam Bell SC's report which found The Star was unfit to hold a casino licence, with chief commissioner Philip Crawford accusing the company of 'breathtaking institutional arrogance'.
