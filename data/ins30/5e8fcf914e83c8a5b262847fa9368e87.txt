By Will Feuer Shares of Krispy Kreme Inc. popped in morning trading Tuesday after McDonald's Corp. said it will sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts at nine of its locations in Louisville, Ky., as part of a limited-time test. McDonald's will sell three styles of Krispy Kreme's doughnuts as supplies last, it said. McDonald's said it often conducts tests to inform future menu decisions. "This small-scale test will help us understand how offering new bakery items like Krispy Kreme could impact operations in our restaurants," McDonald's said.
