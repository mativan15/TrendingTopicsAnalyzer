PayPal (PYPL -0.96%) is an experienced leader in the world of financial technology. Its digital-payment system has been the lifeblood of the e-commerce market for years. 
The RippleNet blockchain network was designed to carry cash payments quickly, with low fees and across international borders. These features are powered by the XRP (XRP 1.80%) digital token, often referred to as Ripple, due to its close association with the payment system.
Many investors are wondering whether Ripple poses a threat to PayPal in the long run, thanks to their overlapping-use cases.
