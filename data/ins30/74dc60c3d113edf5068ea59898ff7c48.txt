By Stephen Nakrosis Moody's Investors Service on Friday said it changed its outlook on the Government of the United Kingdom's ratings to negative from stable. Moody's also said it was affirming the domestic and foreign-currency long-term issuer and domestic-currency senior unsecured ratings at Aa3. The change in outlook was driven by "heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid weaker growth prospects and high inflation," Moody's said. Another driver was "risks to the U.K.'s debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and risk of a sustained weakening in policy credibility," according to Moody's.
