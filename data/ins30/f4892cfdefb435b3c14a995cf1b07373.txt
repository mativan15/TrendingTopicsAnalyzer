AgenciesThe Diwali festive week is here, and markets are getting swarmed with thousands of shoppers daily. This year Diwali falls on October 24; however, Indian shoppers buy one or the other thing on Dhanteras (October 22) and Naraka Chaturdashi (October 23). Some are looking for dinnerware and kitchen utensils, while others plan to buy gold and silver on Dhanteras. Apart from buying ethnic apparel and decorating homes during the festive week, this tradition is linked with historic Hindu legends and beliefs.
