The Georgia Southern baseball team is hosting an NCAA regional for the first time. Can the Eagles take advantage and move on to the Super Regionals?

Georgia Southern opens against UNC Greensboro on Friday night, after Notre Dame and Texas Tech kick off the Statesboro Regional in the afternoon. The regional is double-elimination.

(UPDATE: Because of multiple rain delays during Friday's first game between Notre Dame and Texas Tech, Georgia Southern's game against UNC Greensboro was moved to Saturday morning.
