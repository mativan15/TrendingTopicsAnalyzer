Investors looking to play the third-quarter earnings season for gains should take note of stocks with a track record of beating expectations and moving higher. So far, the earnings season has been better than anticipated due to lowered expectations and inflation helping boost sales numbers even with lower volume. Of the roughly 20% of companies that have reported quarterly results so far, 72% have beat expectations, according to FactSet data. Next week will be a big one for the season, with more than 100 S & P 500 components slated to report.
