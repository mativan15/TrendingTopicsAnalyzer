New Delhi: Delhi Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar on Tuesday directed officials to involve district magistrates in the work of setting up electric vehicle charging stations in the national capital to cater to the demand. He chaired a high-level meeting on the electric vehicle strategy for the city that had 50 participants including representatives from oil companies, Discoms, the New Delhi Municipal Council, and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Officials said the idea behind the meeting was to connect the dots for the government's action plan since it needs partnerships and alliances.
