South African petrochemicals company Sasol on Tuesday said it was partnering steelmaker ArcelorMittal South Africa to explore carbon capture technology and steel production using green hydrogen. Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, is considered a cleaner energy source for the future, but the technology is still in its infancy and relatively expensive.

 Sasol is the world's biggest producer of fuel products and chemicals from coal, but is transitioning away from the fossil fuel as part of its decarbonisation plan.
