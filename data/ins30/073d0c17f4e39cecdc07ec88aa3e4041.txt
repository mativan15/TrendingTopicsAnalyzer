Fox News contributor Scott Martin, who went viral online for pointing to his $28 Taco Bell order as evidence of high inflation, on Friday responded to the criticism he received, saying that he did not get as much food as some online were saying he did.

Martin appeared on Fox Business's 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast' on Wednesday, telling host Neil Cavuto that his lunch at Taco Bell the day before cost about $28, to Cavuto's apparent disbelief.

'People need to pay for those things, and they do that by getting jobs and getting in the economy and getting active and getting involved,' Martin said.
