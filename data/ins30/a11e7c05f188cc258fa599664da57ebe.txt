The campaign manager overseeing former Rep. Charlie Crist's bid to topple Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was arrested for domestic violence this week, according to a report.
Austin Durrer was busted at his home in Cambridge, Maryland on Tuesday and now faces second-degree assault charges.
Crist's longtime aide was also ordered to vacate the residence he owns with his wife and surrender his guns as part of a $10,000 bail package in Dorchester County, according to Fox News.
Crist's campaign abruptly announced that Durrer was resigning to address a family issue Thursday but did not allude to the arrest.
