CNN host Don Lemon continued to attack former President Donald Trump on Thursday, claiming that Trump didn't "have the courage" to butt heads with him on his evening show.Lemon gave his first interview to Semafor's Max Tani following the announcement that he would be demoted from his primetime evening show to a new three-hour morning show. With the switch in line-up, Tani noted Lemon "would occasionally butt heads with Trump" and asked whether he had gotten "tired" of covering politics so much in primetime.
