This is the daily notebook of Mike Santoli, CNBC's senior markets commentator, with ideas about trends, stocks and market statistics. The fifth S & P 500 rally of more than 5% since the Jan. 3 market peak is underway. The index is more than 8% higher than the intraday low for this downturn set a week ago. The prior four faltered and gave way to a further slide to new lows. Does the current rebound look more likely to stick? The latest bounce came from the 20% downturn level, though so far we've not closed under that threshold, giving this retreat a chance to become the fifth since 1990 that stopped just ticks short of a 20% closing decline (1990, 1998, 2011, 2018 are the others).
