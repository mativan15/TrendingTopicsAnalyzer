Fears of global recession and spate of layoffs in the start up space are expected to have a sobering effect on high attrition levels in Indian IT industry over the next 2-3 quarters, say market watchers as majority of large tech companies talked of easing of supply side pressures in September quarter. Infosys, whose high levels of attrition had alarmed analysts at one point, reported lower attrition of 27.1 per cent in just-concluded quarter, compared to 28.4 per cent in June quarter. 
 For Wipro, the attrition came down to 23 per cent in Q2FY23, from 23.
