Misleading posts viewed hundreds of thousands of times claim that a documentary on alleged corruption by Pakistan's prime minister is an "upcoming Netflix series", but a producer for the film told AFP it is independently produced. A Netflix spokesperson also said the company has not been involved in production.

The video was shared here on Twitter on October 17, 2022, and has been viewed more than 300,000 times. Comments on that and similar posts suggest that many users believed the documentary was produced by Netflix.
