The Biden administration is seeking to make it easier to deploy renewable energy on pubic lands, slashing the amount of money that companies have to pay to use these lands for wind and solar.
The Interior Department said in a statement on Tuesday that it would implement a 'rate reduction policy ' for solar and wind energy that 'substantially' reduces the rates and fees developers have to pay the government. 
On average, the Bureau of Land Management expects to cut rents and fees by more than 50 percent through both lower rents and a 'standard' fee for energy produced.
