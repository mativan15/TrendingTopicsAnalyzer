Ally Financial 's weak third-quarter results were enough for analysts at two major Wall Street shops to downgrade the auto lender. "We are downgrading ALLY shares to Underweight from Equal Weight, as we believe NIM pressure and declining used car pricing will continue to weigh on fundamentals and sentiment," wrote Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti in a note to clients Thursday. Shares of the financial services and loan provider slumped 3% in premarket trading, building on their near 8% loss from Wednesday, after the company reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations and sharing a rise in auto loan losses.
