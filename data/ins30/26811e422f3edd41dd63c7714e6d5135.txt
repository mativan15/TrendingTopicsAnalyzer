Since September our clients have begun to roll off their interest rates secured in the good old days and some of the monthly increases in mortgage payments that we are seeing are eye-watering.
It is now not uncommon for our clients in London and the South East to see their payments rise by £1,000 per month. For larger mortgages make that £2,000, or more.
We are now tracking these increases and it's clear that our clients are no longer putting hundreds of thousands of pounds into the local and national economy.
