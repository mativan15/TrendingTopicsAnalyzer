Bayer AG (OTCMKTS: BAYRY) will appeal a $275 million jury verdict in Washington state that sided with plaintiffs who alleged that polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, caused neurological injuries to students and teachers.

'We respectfully disagree with the divided jury verdict reached in this 13-plaintiff case and plan to pursue post-trial motions and appeals based on multiple errors and the lack of proof at trial,' a Bayer spokesperson said.

A King County Superior Court jury in Seattle returned the verdict last week in the fifth consecutive trial that centered on whether PCBs manufactured by Monsanto caused cognitive deficits in those who taught or attended school at Sky Valley Educational Center in Monroe County, Washington.
