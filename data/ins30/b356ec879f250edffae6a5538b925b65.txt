Korea is banning plastic bags in convenience stores and supermarkets in a bid to reduce disposable waste while coffee shops will be banned from using disposable paper cups, plastic straws and swizzle sticks.The ban applies to all shops and restaurants measuring more than 33 sq.m, which make up the vast majority, and takes effect from Nov. 24. Small business owners are up in arms, saying the measure could not come at a worse time amid runaway inflation and at the tail-end of years of crippling lockdown.
