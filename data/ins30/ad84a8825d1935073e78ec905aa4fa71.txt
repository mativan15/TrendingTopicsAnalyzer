Forerunner 955 Solar GARMIN 
Garmin has announced the Forerunner 955, which it calls the company's 'first dedicated running smartwatch with solar charging.' However, given the Fenix 7 and Epix 2 will make just as good runner's watches it may be more useful to think of the Garmin Forerunner 955 as a more affordable option than either. The standard Forerunner 955 costs $499, while the Forerunner 955 Solar costs $599. This is a significant drop from the cost of the respective Fenix 7 models, and as in the last generation the primary visible difference is the switch from a metal bezel to a 'fibre-reinforced polymer' one.
