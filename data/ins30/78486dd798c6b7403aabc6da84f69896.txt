The triple lock pledge on the state pension has been temporarily frozen by the Government in a bid to save money following the pandemic. This promise means the state pension will either go up by the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5 percent. Due to exponential increase to average earnings last year, the triple lock was put on hold with the state pension being increased by 3.1 percent in line with last September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation. However, the rise has been very different from recent rates of inflation, as the country's cost of living crisis worsens.
