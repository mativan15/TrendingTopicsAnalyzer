Squid Game star Hoyeon Jung, Olympics golden-boy fencer Edgar Cheung Ka-long and skiing sweetheart Eileen Gu were ranked among Forbes' 30 under 30 list of Asia-based entrepreneurs for "trying new ideas, building on success and in some cases starting their own businesses." A record 4,000 entrants applied, from which Forbes selected 300: 30 in each of 10 categories. India had the highest number of honorees with 61, followed by Singapore's 34 and Japan's 33. Singapore, however, could arguably be deemed the winner in terms of nurturing a vibrant start-up ecosystem, as 18 of its selected entrepreneurs do not originate from the Southeast Asian city-state.
