Federal political campaign spending has risen by 144 per cent over the past two decades in a trend that has outstripped the increase in the number of voters, according to new figures to be put to a parliamentary inquiry in a bid to put a cap on spending.Political parties increased spending from $124 million in 1999 to $302 million in 2019 due in part to the entry of new forces in national affairs such as mining billionaire Clive Palmer, the biggest source of new outlays in recent elections.Clive Palmer's United Australia Party spent $92.
