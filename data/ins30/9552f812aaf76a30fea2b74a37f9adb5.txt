Police officers appear set to make a return to Vancouver schools in the coming months, following the sweeping victory of Ken Sim's ABC in the recent civic elections.
ABC now holds the most votes on the Vancouver School Board, and with it the opportunity to reinstate the School Liaison Officer program, a key campaign pledge of Sim's.'We knocked on over 78,000 doors in Vancouver and we spoke to tens of thousands of residents, and a big concern from the majority of parents who had kids in the school system was they were concerned about safety,' Sim told Global News, Tuesday.
