Joyce Sims, who has died aged 63, was a soul singer who reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1980s with her dancefloor classic Come Into My Life; with its relaxed, infectious beat and its sense of yearning desire it was remixed and re-released several times over the years.
Joyce Sims was born in Rochester, New York, on August 6 1959, the eldest of five children; her mother was a chef in a restaurant while her father was a machinist with Kodak. 'Money was tight,' she recalled, but the family had 'everything we needed, and some of the things we wanted'.
