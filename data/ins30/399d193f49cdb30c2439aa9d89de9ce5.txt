Geena Davis took an intentional approach to starting her family.
 
Speaking on ITV's Loose Women daytime talk show, the actress and mom of three shared that she's "really grateful" that she waited until her 40s to have her kids.
 
The comment came amid a conversation about empowering kids, during which Davis said she believed empowerment was "about modeling," citing her own experience growing up with traits her parents emulated.
 
"I wanted to wait, [and] was hoping that I could still have kids. But I thought, 'I'll be more evolved the longer I wait.
