Michael Portillo has compared the state of the Tory party to the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk. Speaking on GB News, Mr Portillo said: "The last five weeks in British politics have been unlike anything I have ever seen. The Conservative party has chosen its leader Liz Truss and she's lost all her authority, irredeemably in my opinion, in just over a month."She is the project of an absurd electoral system devised by the party having to win the votes of Conservative party members, a tiny unrepresentative minority of British society.
