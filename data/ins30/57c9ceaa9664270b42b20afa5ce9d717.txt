Granting time to petitioners to file a rejoinder to the counter affidavits filed by the Gujarat government and the convicts, the Supreme Court Tuesday listed hearing the petitions challenging the remission granted to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano gangrape case on November 29, Live Law reported.
When the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday, the Supreme Court observed that the response filed by the Gujarat government to the pleas was 'very bulky', Bar and Bench reported.
A bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and CT Ravikumar made the observation while directing the government to serve the State's counter-affidavit on all parties.
