There are few things more enjoyable than a good heist movie. A gang get together: the charismatic ringleader, the muscle, the brainy tech person, the master of disguise and the love interest, whose presence will add many plot complications.They are going to steal £10 billion from the Bank of England. The brainy tech person says: 'But no one has ever taken down the Bank of England before. It can't be done!' With a roguish smile, the charismatic leader replies: 'That's why we're doing it.' After days of fiendishly clever deception and derring-do they succeed, and ride off into the sunset with bags of cash.
