Chesterton senior Danny Goveia wants everyone to know when he's on the field.

That's been the philosophy guiding the 6-foot, 190-pound linebacker throughout his career.

'When I'm out on the field, I want to make an impact,' he said. 'I'm there to play football, and even if I'm not getting as many reps as I'd like, I still want to make an impact while I'm out there.'

Goveia is seeing plenty of reps this season and has turned that playing time into a starring role. He leads Chesterton (4-5) with 107 tackles.
