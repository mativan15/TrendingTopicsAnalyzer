Fintech firms are exploring market opportunities as the government focuses on financial inclusion through digitisation. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 75 Digital Banking Units, or DBUs, noting that if Jan Dhan accounts had laid the foundation of financial inclusion in the country, then fintech would form the basis of a financial revolution. DBUs are brick-and-mortar outlets that provide facilities such as account opening, balance checks, fund transfers, fixed deposit investments, loan applications, credit and debit card applications, tax and bill payments, etc.
