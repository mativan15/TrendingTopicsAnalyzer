IN THE run-up to the election of the veteran Mallikarjun Kharge as the president of the Congress this week, some BJP leaders suggested that his victory will result in the emergence of a third faction in the Congress in Karnataka.
Apart from the Siddaramaiah (former Congress CM and Leader of Opposition) faction and the D K Shivakumar (Karnataka PCC chief) faction, there would now also be a Kharge faction, the BJP's state in-charge for Karnataka, Arun Singh, said at a Jana Sankalpa rally of the party on October 16 in the Dharwad region of the state.
