Married At First Sight UK star Whitney Hughes has opened up about Matt Murray following their split and revealed her ‘regrets' about the E4 show.
Whitney, a personal assistant, was originally married to Duka on the social experiment programme but fell for Matt, who had tied the knot with Gemma.
Duka and Gemma then made the difficult decision to quit the process, with the experts controversially allowing the barber and Whitney to stay on as a dating couple.
