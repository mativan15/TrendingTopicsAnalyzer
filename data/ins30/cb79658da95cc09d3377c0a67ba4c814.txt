Michelle Williams will receive a performer tribute at the 32nd Gotham Awards ceremony, taking place in person on Nov. 28 in New York City. The Gotham Awards are the first ceremony of the fall season recognizing the achievements of independent productions and performers in film and television. With Williams in the Oscar conversation for her turn in Steven Spielberg's 'The Fabelmans,' this marks her first major piece of recognition this awards season as she seeks best actress attention. 'We are exceptionally proud to honor Michelle Williams, whose iconic performances in collaboration with our most renowned directors have defined her as a leading talent of her generation,' says Jeffrey Sharp, executive director of The Gotham Film & Media Institute.
