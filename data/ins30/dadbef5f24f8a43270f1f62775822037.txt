SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. – Mina Harigae's biggest takeaways from finishing runner-up at the 77th U.S. Women's Open?

That she can handle this kind of moment. That she belongs.

Those are the intangibles, at least. Practically speaking, Harigae cashed in on the biggest prize in LPGA history for a woman who didn't win. Her historic $1,080,000 payday at Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club is quite literally life-changing. Going into this week, she'd made $84,721 on the season and $2.9 million over the course of her 12-year career.
