Two days after a 68-year-old woman's corpse, partially eaten by stray dogs, was found in north Karnataka's Ganagapur village, which houses the famous Sri Dattatreya temple, the authorities on Tuesday said they would ensure such a 'shameful incident' does not occur again.
The Sri Dattatreya temple in Kalaburagi district's Afzalpur taluk is frequented by devotees from Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka, and often, many devotees abandon their aged parents here, police sources said. The police suspect that this woman was similarly abandoned.
