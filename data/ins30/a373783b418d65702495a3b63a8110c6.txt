Craig Petersen, the head of the Secondary Principals Council, said NAPLAN was a simplistic measure, and measured basic skills rather than the more complex things students were taught at high school, such as critical thinking and problem-solving.LoadingHe also said the past two years were highly disrupted due to COVID-19.'I think the targets were always highly ambitious, and [then came the] the challenges of COVID and, even more significantly, staffing [shortages],' he said. 'If I haven't got qualified maths or science teachers in front of every class, I'm not going to meet those targets.
