Oct. 15—ALBANY — The discovery of a canine on doggy death row in 2013 may have saved not just one life. For military vet Larry Barfield, the chocolate Labrador retriever mix has been a constant companion and source of reassurance for nearly a decade.

Camo can detect when his human is having a nightmare and nudge him, Barfield's wife, Pam, said.

Barfield was the first local recipient of a service dog through the annual Barney's Run for Warriors. The 10th Barney's Run will be held on Oct. 22, with proceeds going to the national organization that provides the service dogs.
