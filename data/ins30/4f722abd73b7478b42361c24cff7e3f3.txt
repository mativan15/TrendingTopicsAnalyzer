Constellation Energy Corp. has tapped Nneka Rimmer, a former president at McCormick & Co. Inc., to join its board of directors — the second former high-level executive at the spice maker to join the energy company.

Constellation (NYSE:CEG) on Tuesday elected Rimmer to fill a seat on the board once held by Allstate Insurance legal chief Rhonda Ferguson. Ferguson, 52, died in April. Rimmer's appointment will be effective Nov. 1.

Rimmer most recently was the president of global flavors and extracts for Hunt Valley-based McCormick (NYSE:MCK).
