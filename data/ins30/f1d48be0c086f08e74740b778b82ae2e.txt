Macron finds himself in a perilous situation. He is facing discontent over shortages at gas stations, along with labor strikes and a fierce opposition in the National Assembly, the lower and more powerful house of parliament, which may try to bring down his government this week over a disputed budget bill.'We are entering a particular and quite extraordinary cycle,' said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of France Unbowed, as he led the protest Sunday. He noted 'the great convergence' among the strikes, the crisis in parliament, and the march.
