Jun. 2—The annexation lawsuit between tiny St. Clair Twp. and the city of Hamilton has been "settled in principle" after years of wrangling over how much the township is owed because of faulty annexation procedures.

The township sued Hamilton in December 2019 and after protracted litigation and complex calculations now claims the city owes at least $10 million including interest for lost property taxes due to annexations. The city has maintained it owes nothing.

Court records indicate a settlement has been reached in the case.
