Towards the end of the summer Shun-Bun Lee, owner of the New Loon Fung restaurant in London's Chinatown, found himself lacking a dim sum chef for his six-strong team. But he knew what to do. He went up to the kitchen and started filling the prawn har gau dumplings himself. His son, Sunny, shows me a photograph of the compact Mr Lee, in smart collar and tie, putting to good use the dim sum skills he first learned in Hong Kong well over half a century ago. 'My father is a bit of a legend among dim sum chefs in Chinatown,' Sunny says proudly.
