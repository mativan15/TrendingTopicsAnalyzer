What is ‘fair chance' hiring, and what is its potential impact on Arizona's labor shortage?

Specifically, this means giving fair consideration to people with criminal records.

For the Arizona business community, adopting fair chance hiring is an important solution to overcoming an existential threat – the labor shortage.
