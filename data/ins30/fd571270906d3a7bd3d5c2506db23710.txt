The wealthiest families in the U.S. will get a bit of inflation-adjusted relief from the IRS in 2023, with the lifetime estate-tax exemption increasing to $12.9 million for individuals, up from $12.06 million (and to $25.84 million for couples, up from $24.12 million). The annual gift-tax exclusion will go to $17,000, up from $16,000. Estate-tax limits jumped significantly in 2018 with the adoption of the Trump-era Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and are indexed for inflation along with myriad other annual items, like tax-bracket thresholds, the standard deduction and the limit on FSA contributions.
