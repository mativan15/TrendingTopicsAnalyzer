Specialist fraud courts are needed to combat the 'epidemic' of scamming in Britain, say MPs on the Commons Justice Committee.

They found that just one in 700 of the estimated 4.6 million frauds and scams a year were being prosecuted with victims facing 'considerable delays' of 'several' years to get justice.

The MPs said there was a 'compelling' case for creating dedicated economic crime courts to ensure there were judges with the right skills to tackle the backlog of fraud cases which were 'not always seen as a priority for listing'.
