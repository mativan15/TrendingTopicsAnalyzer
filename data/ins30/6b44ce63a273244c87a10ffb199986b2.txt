MIAMI GARDENS, FLA. — In their first four games of the season, the Vikings turned just seven of their 15 red-zone attempts into touchdowns, costing themselves chances to keep their loss to the Eagles close and to turn victories over the Packers and Saints into blowouts.

Kirk Cousins attempted 28 passes in the red zone in those games — the third-most in the league behind only Derek Carr and Patrick Mahomes, according to Sports Info Solutions. He threw 18 inside an opponent's 10-yard line (second only to Carr).
