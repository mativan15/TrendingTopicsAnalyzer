You'd think when a city considers its library to be one of the best attractions for children, then the rest of the landscape must be particularly dire. That couldn't be further than the truth in revitalised Christchurch, where brilliant family-friendly attractions sit around every corner. The city's bibliotheca also happens to be much more than a repository for dog-eared books. Tūranga is an impressive and inspiring complex complete with an audio video studio, virtual reality simulators, Lego pits, 3D printing and a children's play area with dress-up costumes and its own slide.
