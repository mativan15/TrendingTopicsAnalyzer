Amid a spike in US bond yields and depreciating rupee, key equity indices opened in the red on Thursday. Selling was seen across all sectors except FMCG stocks. At 9.17 am, BSE Sensex was trading 229 points or 0.39% lower at 58,877. Nifty50 was trading at 17,439, down 73 points or 0.42%.

'The recent 3% rally has taken the Nifty to just 6% below its 52-week high. This rally in a difficult global equity environment has surprised many, including the FIIs, who have slowed down their selling,' V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.
