Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan won the majority of seats in by-elections on Sunday, building momentum in his campaign to pressure the six-month-old government into calling an early national vote.Khan contested seven of eight seats and has won six, according to data from the Election Commission of Pakistan. The Pakistan Peoples Party, a member of the ruling coalition, took the other two seats.While the former leader will have to resign from all but one of the seats he won — and elections will happen again — the sweeping victory shows popular support for his political narrative in the nation of more than 220-million.
