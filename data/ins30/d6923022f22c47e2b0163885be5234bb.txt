Brent Walker says the independent review into Pharmac is 'too little, too late' as he makes plans to move to Australia in July to access drugs that will improve the quality of his life. The 28-year-old from Waikato was born with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and has been a wheelchair-user since he was 3 years old. He feels he has been continually let down by the Government to access the drug nusinersen, marketed as Spinraza, which will help him regain movement in his hands and arms. Spinraza is on Pharmac's options for investment list, along with more than 100 other drugs.
