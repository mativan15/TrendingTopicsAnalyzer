Gwyneth Paltrow's husband is confident in their love.
 
In an interview with Entertainment Tonight published Wednesday, the Politician actress, 50, revealed how her husband, Brad Falchuk, 51, feels about her friendship with her ex-fiancé Brad Pitt, 58.
 
Paltrow and Pitt were together from 1994 to 1997, when they called off their engagement. She later married Falchuk in 2018.
 
"When we first broke up, we weren't friends for a while and then we sort of found our way back, probably about 18 or 19 years ago, something like that, and then just kind of stayed in touch over the years," she told ET.
