Good news for adrenaline junkies.
An adrenaline burst could help scientists learn when we experience surprises due to the hormone noradrenaline, or norepinephrine.
A study conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published in 'Nature,' discovered that the hormone, which also serves as a neurotransmitter, is released when we need to focus on or pay attention to something of importance.
While it's produced deep in the brain within a structure called the locus coeruleus, it can help stimulate rewarding behavior.
