Sometimes life can throw a googly that derails retirement plans even after years of diligent saving and planning. When 58-year-old Catherine Walter was mis-sold a self-invested personal pension, or Sipp, a decade ago, she almost lost her nest egg for good.
'I came across a financial adviser while networking and he convinced me to put my pension in a scheme that then went pop,' said Ms Walter.
The former police officer managed to salvage £49,000 of her savings from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the lifeboat fund.
