Today technology has become the nucleus around which the next phase of growth is happening. In what is being hailed as ‘techade of India', new age technologies such as AI, ML and data analytics are playing a crucial role in strengthening India's capabilities in every sector. As defence is one of the most crucial aspects which can't be overlooked at any cost, innovative ways are constantly being chalked out to strengthen the country's internal or external security covers.  India today proudly stands tall as the 3rd largest startup ecosystem in the world, and with government support, policy developments, investments, innovation and large-scale technology adoption, defence tech startups are leaving no stones unturned to make India resilient against any possible threat.
