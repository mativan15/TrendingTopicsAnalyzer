An order from the department of public instruction to collect a donation of Rs 100 every month from the parents of each student studying in government schools has drawn the ire of critics, who are calling this a 'burden on the poor families'.
The order dated October 19 allows the school development and monitoring committee (SDMC) to collect a minimum donation of Rs 100 every month from parents to develop the infrastructure of schools and also to address the shortcomings of payments to guest teachers.
