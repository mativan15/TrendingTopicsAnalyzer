The Pro Bowl cornerback left the Patriots during the offseason to sign an $82.5 million deal.

The Patriots let J.C. Jackson leave as a free agent to take big money during the offseason.

Jackson signed a five-year, $82.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Chargers, following an appearance in last year's Pro Bowl.

But Monday night, Jackson wound up on the bench during the second half of the Chargers' overtime win against Denver.

Jackson was targeted three times and gave up two catches for 86 yards and a touchdown, along with a pass interference penalty, according to Pro Football Focus via MassLive.
