Apple is reportedly cutting back production on the iPhone 14 Plus due to low sales, according to a report from The Information on Tuesday. The tech giant debuted the new phone during its "Far Out" event in September, along with the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Officially released on Oct. 7, the iPhone 14 Plus is essentially the same as the iPhone 14, but with a larger screen size and a higher starting price of $899. Per The Information, Apple instructed one manufacturer in China to stop production on the phone, while two suppliers in the country have been told to scale back production by 70% and 90% respectively.
