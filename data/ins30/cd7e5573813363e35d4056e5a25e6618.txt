Oct 19 (Reuters) - Irenic Capital Management, a hedge fund that owns a 1.5% stake in Capricorn Energy Plc (CNE.L), asked the natural gas producer on Wednesday to abandon its sale to Israel's NewMed Energy LP (NWMDp.TA) in favor of selling its assets piecemeal.Irenic's intervention challenges a deal that would create a London and Tel Aviv-listed gas giant, at a time when European countries are looking for such companies to help with a supply crunch caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Irenic told Capricorn's board in a letter seen by Reuters that a liquidation, in which the company would auction off its assets, can deliver a 43% premium relative to the its current share price and a nearly 40% premium relative to the NewMed deal.
