A couple in England cashed in on a golden treasure found where they least expected – below their kitchen floors!
 
While doing some home renovations in 2019, the couple, who have chosen to remain anonymous, uncovered a stash of more than 260 gold coins hidden underneath their kitchen floorboards, the BBC reported. That coin collection was recently sold at an auction house for over $800,000, according to Today.
 
When they first made the discovery, the couple thought they had merely stumbled across a piece of electrical cable.
