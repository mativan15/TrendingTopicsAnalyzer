The Secret Service was charged in excess of the government-allowed rate when Eric Trump, the former president's son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, stayed in Washington, D.C. at the Trump-owned hotel with his wife Lara Trump, the House panel said. Citing new documents from the Secret Service, the Oversight Committee disclosed five stays at about three times the allowed rate.

When Donald Trump Jr. stayed at the Trump-owned hotel in Washington in 2017, the Secret Service was billed $1,185 a night, nearly six times the allowed per diem rate of $201 per night, according to the records released Monday.
