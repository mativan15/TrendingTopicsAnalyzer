A sustained recovery in tech is becoming increasingly unlikely, according to Bank of America. Tech is the third-worst performing sector in the S & P 500 , down roughly 20% for the year — on pace for its worst annual decline since 2008, when it dropped 43.7%. To be sure, the sector has also posted yearly gains in each of the last three years, and it's risen in 12 of the last 14 years. Much of that outperformance was driven by several factors, including low interest rates, "disinflation from demographics and disruption," globalization and a shift from active to passive investing, Bank of America's Savita Subramanian said on Friday.
