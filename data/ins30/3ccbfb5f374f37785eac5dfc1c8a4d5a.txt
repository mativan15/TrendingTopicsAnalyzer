(Reuters) - Trend-following hedge funds are capitalising on market disruption and geopolitical unrest, with funds such as Graham Capital Management, Aspect Capital, AlphaSimplex and AQR Capital Management all near or over 40% higher for the year.

Such funds profit by buying or selling when the markets make big moves and by riding that move until it fizzles out or the market changes direction.

They have thrived in markets whipped around by soaring inflation, high interest rates and the energy shock.
