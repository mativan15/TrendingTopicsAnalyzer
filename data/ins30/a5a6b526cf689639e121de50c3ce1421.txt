By PA Media Published: 11:04 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi insisted he is pleased with his striking options as his side prepare to host Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Tuesday. Brighton had a promising start to the season, but have lost their last two matches – against Brentford and Tottenham – and failed to find the net in either game. However, the manager insisted that a new striker is not required at the south coast club.
