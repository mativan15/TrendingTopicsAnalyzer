Based on the updated version of Renault-Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-C crossover platform, the X-Trail is gets two engine options - a 1.5-litre turbo petrol and a 1.5-litre turbo petrol with Nissan's e-Power series hybrid tech which is a strong hybrid system (in which the combustion engine charges the electric motor on the go). While the hybrid variant gets a four-wheel-drive system, the petrol engine-only version comes with FWD (front wheel drive) only. The hybrid powertrain has a 150 kW front electric motor and a combined output of 201 hp or the e-4ORCE dual motor system producing 209 hp.
