Mackenzie Webb and her cousins, Katie Reidy and Sarah Webb, told me they walked quite a distance last Saturday, May 21: from the area of the Colony Hotel and St. Ann's Episcopal Church on Ocean Avenue in Kennebunkport to Nubble Lighthouse on Sohier Park Road in York.

I tried to do a quick calculation of that distance in my head as Mackenzie, Katie and Sarah sipped their coffee and tea during my interview with them at Mornings in Paris in Kennebunk on Monday.

'How many miles is that?' I finally asked.
