The top financial officials for Nevada and Massachusetts are seeking policy changes that would allow them to divest millions in gun manufacturers and related businesses.The Democratic state treasurers in Nevada and Massachusetts on Thursday announced plans to unload taxpayer money invested in the gun industry that will require approval from other governmental bodies in both states. With gun control proposals uncertain after last week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 21 dead, the treasurers are using divestment as a strategy to address gun violence.
