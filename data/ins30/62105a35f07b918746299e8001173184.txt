Last week payments firm PayPal announced a second round of job losses at its operations in Dundalk and Blanchardstown. From a high of about 2,800 a year ago, this will bring its employment down to about 2,000. However, PayPal is not the only technology company to announce a reduction of its cost base: worldwide, hiring freezes and redundancies are rippling across the sector. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia, Twitter and Uber have all announced a worldwide slowdown or pause in hiring. In China, video gaming and social media giant Tencent has announced job cuts, and the ecommerce Alibaba Group is undergoing several rounds of job losses across a number of its divisions.
