Oct. 16—MYSTIC — People crowded Mystic River Park on Saturday with all eyes and cameras on one thing― the Mystic River Bascule Bridge.

Opened on July 19, 1922, the unique bridge has connected the residents of Groton and Stonington for 100 years and attracted visitors from all over.

After more than a year of planning, the Greater Mystic Chamber of Commerce and the Mystic River Historical Society celebrated the bridge in a day's worth of events, starting with a dedication ceremony.

Even though the anniversary day was in July, Bruce Flax, president of the chamber, said it wanted to set aside a day outside of the summer to solely recognize what "means for us and to deliver a plaque that will hopefully live forever on the bridge.
