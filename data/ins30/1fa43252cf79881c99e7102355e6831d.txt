DJ Chark thought a little rest would do his body good. Now that it hasn't two weeks later, concern is growing over the Detroit Lions receiver's injured left ankle.

Lions coach Dan Campbell said Chark would not practice Wednesday because of continued problems with the ankle he fractured last September with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Chark missed the final 13 games of last season and signed a one-year, $10 million deal with the Lions this spring.

"Certainly we don't want anything to rear its head again," Campbell said.
