Published: 08:44 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 08:44 EDT, 21 October 2022 The latest trailer for The Crown features a disclaimer saying the series is a 'fictional dramatisation' and 'inspired by real events'. Previous trailers for Netflix's lavish royal drama have not included this logline and instead offered only a description of the series. The passage appears only on the YouTube description and not in the actual trailer. However, Netflix already describes the show as 'fictionalised drama' in its press materials, on social media and on The Crown's landing page on its platform.
