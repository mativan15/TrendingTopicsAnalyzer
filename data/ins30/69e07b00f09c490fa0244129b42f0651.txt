A federal appeals court has kept intact the federal robbery-homicide conviction of Richard Leon Wilbern, writing that there was "overwhelming evidence" of his guilt in the 2003 murder at the Xerox Federal Credit Union in Webster.

A panel for the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals rejected multiple defense arguments that maintained Wilbern's trial was unfair, including claims that genetic testing linking him to the crime was unreliable and that witness identification was unconstitutional.

"Taken together, the multiple identifications and circumstantial evidence of Wilbern's motive and connections to evidence at the scene of the robbery amounted to overwhelming evidence of Wilbern's guilt," the appellate judges wrote in a ruling released Tuesday.
