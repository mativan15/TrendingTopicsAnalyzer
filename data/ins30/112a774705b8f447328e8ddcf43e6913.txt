By Reuters Published: 13:00 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 13:00 EDT, 16 October 2022 The NFL is unlikely to punish Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams for shoving a photographer until after his legal situation is resolved, NFL Network reported Sunday. Adams was charged with misdemeanor assault this week for pushing a credentialed photographer to the ground at the end of Monday night's 30-29 loss in Kansas City. Adams, 29, is expected to keep playing for Las Vegas while his case is ongoing.
