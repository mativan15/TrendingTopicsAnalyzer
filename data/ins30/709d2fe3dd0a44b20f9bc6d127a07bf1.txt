The craze for the famous word-guessing puzzle game, Wordle, has increased. Thousands of puzzle enthusiasts across the world solve Wordle puzzles daily. The popularity of Wordle is such that the New York Times purchased it earlier this year. Wordle is a word-guessing puzzle where players are required to guess the correct five-letter word in a maximum of six attempts. If the players get it right, they maintain their winning streaks. On the other hand, failure to guess the correct word in six attempts can lead to the end of the winning streak.
