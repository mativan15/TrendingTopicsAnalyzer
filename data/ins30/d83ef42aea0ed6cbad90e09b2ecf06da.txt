Two months have passed since that historic evening at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium when Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty became the first Indian men's doubles pair to medal at the World Championships.Much water has flowed under the bridge ever since. Rankireddy went home to Amalapuram to spend some much-needed time with his family. Shetty took a long-awaited break and travelled to Goa to 'chill' with his friends.But much hasn't changed when it comes to their on-court performance. The world No 8 combine have continued their menacing form – for their opponents – with which they started the year to scalp yet another big shot pair on Thursday.
