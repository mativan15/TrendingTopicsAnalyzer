The stock market may be signaling Republicans are about to sweep Congress. Investments that would do well under Republicans are edging higher and outperforming those in a hypothetical Democratic portfolio, particularly in the past week, according to Strategas. That could be signaling that the market is sniffing out more potential for Republicans in mid-term elections to regain the Senate, once thought as a long shot, according to Dan Clifton, head of policy research at the firm. Strategas creates Democratic and Republican portfolios to identify investments that have the most to gain or lose, based on the election outcome.
