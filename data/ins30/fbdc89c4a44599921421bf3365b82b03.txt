MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FR8Focus is a new mobile application on the market that proves to be the next step in the visual, real-time digitization of freight and asset tracking for North American carriers. In collaboration with a leading private carrier over the last three years, the application is highly refined and addresses real-world pain points of transportation. Allowing carriers to connect, mobilize, track and manage their fleets in real-time, FR8Focus was developed to integrate seamlessly into all facets of less-than-a-truckload (LTL) and truckload (TL) operations.
