Information provider Relx (REL.L) expects annual profits to grow faster than ever before as face-to-face events return.

The London-based company reported underlying revenue growth for the year to date across the business of 9%.

It said momentum remains strong across the group, and it expects growth in revenue, adjusted operating profit and constant currency growth in adjusted earnings per share to "remain above historical levels".
