West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Tuesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy arresting opposition leaders and said the BJP would not come to power in 2024. Banerjee's claims came even as the Modi government is celebrating its eighth anniversary. Addressing a meeting in Bengal's Purulia district, Banerjee said: "Modi babu is busy arresting the opposition leaders. You have arrested Delhi's minister, Maharashtra's minister. You are sending central agencies to Hemant Soren's residence.
