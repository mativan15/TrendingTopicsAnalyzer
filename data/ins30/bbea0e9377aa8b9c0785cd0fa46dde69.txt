These 4 stocks with low price-earnings ratios hit new 52-week highs this week. This is notable as most of the formerly hot tech stocks with much higher p/e's were nowhere to be found on the 'new highs' list. Even with slight bounces among the old leaders, the stock market in general remains in a funk. Equities able to continue upward are few and far between right now, but they do exist. Here are 2 energy companies, one shipping company and an electronics component company making their way to higher highs.
