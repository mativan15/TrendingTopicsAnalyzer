ROSWELL, N.M. (AP) — Roswell officials say the city's UFO Festival had an economic impact of more than $2 million.

The Roswell Daily Record reports the Roswell City Council's finance committee looked earlier this month at an economic report for the event.

It indicated more than 40,000 visitors came to the four-day festival, which ran June 30-July 3.

The cost for the city to mount it was more than $200,000. Officials applauded the results as a '10 to 1 return on your money.'

Staff who put together the report reviewed gross receipts taxes, occupancy or lodgers' tax, ticket sales and other factors.
