Texas basketball appears to be one of the teams on the rise in the sport, and it helps to have a head coach like Chris Beard at the helm.

After successful stints at Arkansas Little Rock and Texas Tech, Beard took the job at Texas and led the program to their first NCAA tournament win since 2015.

Beard has key players such as Marcus Carr coming back, a couple of five-stars in Arterio Morris and Dillon Mitchell arriving to campus, and landed one of the best transfers in Tyrese Hunter. The Longhorns are believed to be poised for a deep run.
