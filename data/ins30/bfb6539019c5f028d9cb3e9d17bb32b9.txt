By Australian Associated Press Published: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 Rural and regional mental health will get a boost in the federal budget, which will restore funding for bulk-billed video telehealth psychiatric consultations. Health Minister Mark Butler will make the $47.7 million announcement in Nowra on Monday, restoring cuts made by the previous coalition government late last year. The scheme will support more than 500,000 consultations over five years, addressing high mental health hospitalisation and suicide rates in the regions.
