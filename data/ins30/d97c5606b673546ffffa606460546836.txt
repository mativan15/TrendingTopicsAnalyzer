 The 2022 State of the Energy Union report has been published by the Commission today, highlighting the challenges that the energy sector has faced in the past 12 months and the progress made in addressing both these exceptional circumstances in the short-term and Europe's long-term climate goals. In particular, this seventh edition of the report takes stock of the EU's energy policy response to the current energy crisis, exacerbated by Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine.
