Free mobile phone charging terminals will be installed across more than a dozen Sydney train stations under a NSW Opposition plan.

Charging stations would be rolled out across 15 of Sydney's busiest train stations if Labor were to win the state election next year, in a similar scheme to one promised by the Andrews government ahead of the 2018 Victorian election.

Phone chargers are already available on some Sydney ferries and the long-delayed intercity train fleet, though Opposition Leader Chris Minns said the move would help encourage more people onto public transport.
