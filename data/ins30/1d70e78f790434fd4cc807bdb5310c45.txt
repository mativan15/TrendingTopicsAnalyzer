In a lengthy response to a question about how his defense might be able to generate turnovers, Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay laid bare his frustrations with the way his defense has performed through five games. The team's Week 6 matchup against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday will be a true test of Los Angeles' mettle, and without a few takeaways, they may drop another game below .500.

Asked specifically about conversations he has had with defensive players regarding their lack of production, McVay told reporters that he feels his team has been 'playing from behind' since Week 1.
