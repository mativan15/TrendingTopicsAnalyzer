By Dean Seal Gannett Co., the owner of USA Today and news outlets in 45 states, is restructuring into two new business units. The first unit, Gannett Media, will focus on content, business-to-business matters and digital subscriber growth under the leadership of Maribel Perez Wadsworth, the publisher of USA Today. Ms. Wadsworth's team will work on stabilizing the media organization's print segment while keeping a "digital-first lens on all efforts," Gannett said. The second unit, Digital Marketing Solutions, will focus on building out the company's marketing platform and bolstering relationships with its existing customers.
