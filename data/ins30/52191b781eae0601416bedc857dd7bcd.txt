Designer radiator specialists, BestHeating, polled homeowners on renovation habits unveiling that nine in 10 have taken on a renovation since 2020. John Lawless, content marketing manager at BestHeating, commented: 'When renovating a home, it can be confusing to know what to focus on and what will add value.'More than a third (37 percent) spend less than £10,000 when making updates, so hopefully our advice on five priority updates will provide some guidance on getting it right the first time and not waste money.
