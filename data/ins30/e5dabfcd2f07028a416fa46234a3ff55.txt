Chinese junk dollar bonds have dropped to a record low, as a property crisis sparked by a crackdown on excessive borrowing and a slide in home sales show few signs of turning around without more policy steps.

The notes, dominated by real estate firms, fell 0.3 cent on the dollar to 55.7 cents Monday, according to a Bloomberg index. Prices reached 56 cents in August before some government support fueled the biggest monthly gain in a decade. But that rally faded like others this year. The market slid for a fourth-straight week through Friday in the longest streak since July.
