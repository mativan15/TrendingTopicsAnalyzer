Islamabad — 
Pakistan's election authorities Friday disqualified populist former Prime Minister Imran Khan from holding public office for allegedly concealing his assets, prompting his supporters to stage nationwide protests and fueling political turmoil in the country.
The ruling alleges that the former cricket star turned politician had made a 'false statement and incorrect declaration' about his assets before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Khan 'consequently ceases to be a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan [the lower house of parliament] and his seat has become vacant accordingly,' the ECP said.
