Don't play 'Gotham Knights' alone. That's the lesson I learned the hard way playing WB Games Montreal's latest project. Although one could run through the campaign solo as one of Batman's proteges, it's not advisable. The whole concept of the experience is that players team up with friends to take on Gotham's enemies.
Each player controls a member of the Bat Family — Dick Grayson, aka Nightwing; Jason Todd, aka Red Hood; Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl; and Tim Drake, aka Robin — as they fight crime across the city.
