A prominent local developer and one of the best-known restaurateurs in Central Ohio are partnering on a new hotel project in Dublin.

Crawford Hoying and Cameron Mitchell Restaurants plan to expand the successful Bridge Park development with a boutique hotel featuring a new restaurant from the Columbus-based culinary group. It will be located southeast of the Route 161 roundabout at Riverside Drive and West Granville Road, a site that previously housed a Wendy's.

In addition to lodging and fine dining, the hotel will include additional food and beverage options, multiple outdoor spaces and an event and conference center.
