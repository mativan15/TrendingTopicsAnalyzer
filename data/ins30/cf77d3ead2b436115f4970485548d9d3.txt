The BJP on Monday hit out at Congress over its Rajya Sabha nominations and said the Gandhis can't see beyond their coterie. The BJP also claimed that the Congress has disappointed its Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh (both election bound) and Maharashtra units by denying nomination to locals for the Rajya Sabha.

In-charge of BJP's National Information and Technology Department Amit Malviya tweeted, "The Chintan Shivir clearly didn't serve any purpose. Soon after, Congress saw high profile exits. Now it has disappointed it's Rajasthan, Chattisgarh (both election bound) and Maharashtra units by denying nomination to locals for RS.
