The deadline to link PAN with Aadhaar was extended from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023. Though the deadline to keep your PAN operative without linking it to your Aadhaar, linking of PAN-Aadhaar from April 1, 2022, will cost you money. This was announced by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) via a notification dated March 29, 2022, and press release dated March 30, 2022. If you link your PAN to your Aadhaar on or before June 30, 2022, you will be charged Rs 500. A fee of Rs 1,000 would be required if the PAN-Aadhaar link is completed on or after July 1, 2022.
