Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, likens predicting a flu season's severity to forecasting a hurricane's strength and its exact path 5 days before it makes landfall.

With influenza, as with hurricanes, '[w]e have to expect the unexpected,' Osterholm, founder and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, explained in an interview with JAMA. 'We have to plan as if this could be a severe flu season.'

Some experts, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD, have pointed to Australia's 2022 flu season—in the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, flu season typically runs from April to September—as a warning about what could be in store for the US.
