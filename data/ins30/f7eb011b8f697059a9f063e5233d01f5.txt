Acute staff shortage and lack of modern equipment have created a huge backlog of samples for testing at the Regional Chemical Examiner's Laboratory at Kakkanad. The toxicology wing alone has a pending list of about 11,000 samples collected by the police in cases related to suicide, murder and unnatural death, according to senior officials. Of the average 400 to 450 samples received at the section monthly, only 100-150 samples are being tested presently owing to the serious shortage of trained personnel, they said.
