By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:16 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 01:16 EDT, 19 October 2022 Bitter boxing rivals Paul "Showtime" Fleming and Billel "Babyface" Dib will be fighting for much more than their growing families in a spicily dubbed "Bad Blood" bout in Sydney. Desperate to improve his ranking and move closer to a world title shot, the undefeated Fleming (28-0-1,18 KOs) and Dib (26-3, 13 KOs) will be jousting for the IBF Pan-Pacific super-featherweight title in Penrith on November 30.
