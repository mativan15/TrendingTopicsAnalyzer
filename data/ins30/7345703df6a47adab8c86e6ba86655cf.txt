rancho_runner/iStock via Getty Images Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) soared Tuesday to its biggest daily gain in more than two years, closing +8.7% after beating Q3 earnings estimates and increasing its stock buyback authorization by $14B. Q3 adjusted earnings came in at a stronger than expected $6.87/share, and cash flow from operations jumped 62% to $3.13B, but net sales of $15.68B narrowly missed analyst consensus estimates. The stock held up even after executives said on the earnings conference call that the company does not expect sales growth to return until 2024, as a recovery from supply chain problems and lingering effects from COVID-19 will be "more gradual than previously expected," driving flat sales in 2023.
