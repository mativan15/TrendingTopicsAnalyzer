This November two candidates representing disparate factions of the Democratic party are fighting for control over California Assembly District 20, which stretches from Hayward in the west to the more-Conservative Dublin in the east.
Elizabeth Ortega-Toro, who serves as the executive secretary-treasurer of the Alameda Labor Council, is backed by many of the state's largest labor rights organizations, like United Auto Workers, and has the endorsement of the state's Democratic party.
Dublin City Councilmember and Navy veteran Shawn Kumagai is backed by large corporations like DaVita healthcare and pro-trade organizations like the California Chamber of Commerce.
