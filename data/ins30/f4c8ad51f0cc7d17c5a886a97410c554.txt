A food bank charity has launched its first-ever emergency appeal to meet a "devastating rise in need" as it warns of its "hardest winter yet" amid the cost of living crisis.The Trussell Trust said food banks are "struggling" to meet "a tsunami" of demand which was now outstripping donations - and called on the government to do more to help.
Through its support of 1,300 food bank centres, the charity said it has already used up its reserve stock which would normally help maintain supplies across the winter months.
