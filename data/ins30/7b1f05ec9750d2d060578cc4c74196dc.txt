Newcastle host Everton later tonight, looking to make further progress in their attempts to break into the Premier League's top six.

While Eddie Howe's side have not won as many games as they would have liked, few can doubt their progress this season, having tasted defeat only once.

Backed by new money, they are perhaps the most interesting subplot outside of the usual scraps for the title, top four and for survival, with everybody waiting to see just how far their controversial project will go.
