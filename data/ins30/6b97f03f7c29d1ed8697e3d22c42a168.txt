The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed as 'frivolous' a plea of a self-acclaimed environmentalist for making 'scurrilous allegations' against the President of India.
The petitioner sought to be made 'undisputed candidate' for the post of President of India and be given salaries and perks since 2004, as he was disallowed to file nomination.
A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and Hima Kohli dismissed the PIL by Kishore Jagannath Sawant, who argued in-person, and said he should not file such kind of petition and instead pursue the aim in life, in which he specialises.
