Looking into the water while working on his family's crayfishing boat, Andrew Basile noticed how quickly damaged coral regrew at the Abrolhos Islands off the West Australian coast. "You'd see where a pot had been on the reef and there was a couple of scratches and marks … and then you go back for the following lobster season and everything would be nice and neat and clean, and you'd think, 'Hmmm'," he said.  Andrew and Tracey Basile have spent the past decade perfecting the art of growing coral.(Supplied: Andrew Basile)An idea began to form and 10 years ago it became reality when Andrew and his wife, Tracey, were granted a licence to take pieces of coral from the wild at the Abrolhos and plant them as broodstock in an area that is now their coral farm.
