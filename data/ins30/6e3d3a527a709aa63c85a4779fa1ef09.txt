It's no secret that the Arizona economy is running on all cylinders, resulting in big growth for publicly and privately held businesses.

To recognize that growth, the Phoenix Business Journal will recognize the top private and fastest-growing businesses in the Valley during its annual Arizona Corporate Excellence (ACE) awards set for Thursday, Nov. 17.

The ACE awards recognize the largest private companies ranked by revenue in 2021 and the fastest-growing businesses showing revenue percentage increases over a two-year period from 2020-2021.
