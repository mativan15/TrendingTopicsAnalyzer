The decision of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao to expand his Telangana Rashtra Samithi into a national-level political party and renaming it Bharat Rashtra Samithi and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) president, is not an overnight one, at least for those who have followed his moves for more than a year now. The TRS was formed in 2001 with the single-point agenda of achieving statehood for Telangana, one of the three main regions of undivided Andhra Pradesh. The intention to form the BRS has been all the more visible, particularly after his relations with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre soured and the saffron party is looking to grow on its own in the State.
