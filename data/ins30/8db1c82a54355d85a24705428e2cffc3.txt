House minority leader Kevin McCarthy was booed by supporters of Donald Trump when he appeared in pre-recorded video form at the ex-president's rally in Wyoming.

The rally on Saturday, which saw the president rail against Wyoming's lone congresswoman and Trump critic Liz Cheney, saw the former president host a collection of right-wing speakers, both on stage and virtually. From hardcore Colorado representative Lauren Boebert to Ms Cheney's challenger Harriet Hageman, most were received warmly.

However, the crowd was less receptive when an announcer introduced video appearances by Mr McCarthy, along with third-ranking House Republican Elise Stefanik – and Congressman Jim Jordan, who received a hearty cheer.
