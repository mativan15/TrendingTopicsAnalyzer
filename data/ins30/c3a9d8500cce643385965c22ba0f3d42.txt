Chloe Ferry burst into tears as she and her boyfriend were thrown off a flight to LA for a work trip. The former Geordie Shore star, 26, took to her Instagram on Wednesday to share her excitement at jetting off to the US for a very special occasion - but just moments later the reality star was seen getting upset over her "bad luck". She explained the pair got to the airport and were "buzzing" as they were ready to board their flight to LA, but they were soon thrown off by staff as neither of them had their visas.
