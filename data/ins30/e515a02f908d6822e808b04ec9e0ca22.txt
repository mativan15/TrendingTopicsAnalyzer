Nairobi: A Nairobi-based green mobility company on Wednesday unveiled an electric bus its inventors hope will encourage environmentally friendly commuting in a city where smog-belching minivans are a far more familiar sight.The brightly painted bus pulled out into the notorious morning traffic in the city of nearly five million, which lacks a state-run transport network -- even though it is the capital of East Africa's economic powerhouse.The city only has one charging station and electric vehicles remain a rarity on its roads, despite the government slashing taxes to try and spur their uptake.
