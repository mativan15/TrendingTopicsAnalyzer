Bruce Sutter, the relief pitcher who relied on a single delivery, the split-fingered fastball, to become a six-time All-Star, a recipient of the 1979 Cy Young Award as the National League's leading pitcher and, ultimately, the first pitcher inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame without starting a major league game, died on Thursday at a hospice in Cartersville, Ga. He was 69.

His death was announced on the St. Louis Cardinals' website. His son Chad told The Associated Press that he was recently found to have cancer.
