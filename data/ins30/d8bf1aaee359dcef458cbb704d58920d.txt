In this series, we bust the jargon and explain a popular investing term or theme. Here it's discount rate.  No – and, confusingly, the term has two distinct different meanings. 
The first of these is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank – known as the Fed – charges banks for loans when they need a back-up source of funding.

The second meaning is an element in an analysis designed to show the viability of an investment.
