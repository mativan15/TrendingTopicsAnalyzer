A big festival is an excellent reason to plan a trip - but if you're looking for an off-the-beaten path experience, you're going to need a guide. Here, writer Jamie Fullerton explains why Bostwana's heavy metal festival is worth traveling for and how to make it happen.

Botswana's heavy metal scene is one of Africa's most exciting and welcoming music subcultures and it's finding a new home in October 2022 for the return of Vulture Thrust Metal Fest.

Offering high-octane rock with a vibrantly inclusive attitude, the event will take place in the village of Rakops in central Botswana.
