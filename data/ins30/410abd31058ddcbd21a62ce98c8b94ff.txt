Former Liverpool defender Jose Enrique believes that the club should sign Bukayo Saka, Jarrod Bowen and Max Aarons in the summer.
The Spaniard also thinks that Jurgen Klopp needs a new midfielder and named Monaco star Aurelien Tchouameni as a possible acquisition.
While the Reds endured one of their greatest seasons ever, winning the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, it ended in disappointment as they were pipped to the Premier League title by Manchester City and lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid.
