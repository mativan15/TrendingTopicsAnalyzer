A new Costco Business Center could be coming to an old Tempe computer superstore.

Earlier this year, Costco Wholesale Corp. (Nasdaq: COST) submitted plans to the city asking to modify the exterior of the former Fry's Electronics at 2300 W. Baseline Road, said Josh Rutherford, economic development program manager for the city of Tempe. But no further discussions have taken place on those changes, he said, and no formal request has been made for permitting.

Still, Costco potentially moving into the space was on the list of projects Tempe economic development staff included in a presentation to area executives on Oct.
