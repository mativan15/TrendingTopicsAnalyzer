Early Eagles 53-man roster projection as OTAs begin originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

We're a long way from the start of the 2022 season but we already know most of the names who will be on the 53-man roster.

The Eagles begin OTAs tomorrow and then kick off training camp later in the summer. So plenty is still subject to change.

But here's my best (early) guess at the Eagles' 53-man roster in 2022:

Quarterback (3): Jalen Hurts, Gardner Minshew, Carson Strong

There's a chance the Eagles could get blown away by an offer for Minshew, in which case he could end up on another roster.
