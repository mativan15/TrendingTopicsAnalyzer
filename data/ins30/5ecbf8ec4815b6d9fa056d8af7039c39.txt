Pierce Brosnan brought a little piece of his marriage into the DC Extended Universe.

The Golden Globe nominee, 69, revealed that he wore his actual wedding ring while filming the upcoming Black Adam as a tribute to his wife of 21 years, Keely Shaye Brosnan, in a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight.

"This is our wedding ring and this is a watch that Keely bought me many years ago with an inscription that [reads], 'Time flies on love's wings,'" he said.
