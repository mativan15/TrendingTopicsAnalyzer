The Big Apple Leadership Academy for the Arts (BALAA) — which runs a marching band and other youth activities — said Tuesday that it is in urgent need of $12,000 to keep its space on Gates Avenue. The money, which BALAA hopes to raise through an existing GoFundMe, would mean ensuring the space is available for young people who otherwise wouldn't have such programs to attend, leaders said.
