Hasbro's profit and sales slipped in the third quarter as families watched their spending on toys more closely with inflation cutting into budgets. "The third quarter is our most difficult comparison and was further impacted by increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer," said CEO Chris Cocks.Revenue for the Pawtucket, Rhode Island, company fell to $1.68 billion, down 15% from last year's third quarter, and Hasbro said the strong dollar knocked 3% off of quarterly revenue, or almost $54 million.
