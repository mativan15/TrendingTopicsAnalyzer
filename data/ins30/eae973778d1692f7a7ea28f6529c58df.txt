Insiders who bought UK£332k worth of Future plc (LON:FUTR) stock in the last year recovered part of their losses as the stock rose by 8.1% last week. The purchase, however, has proven to be a pricey bet, with losses currently totalling UK£83k.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
