Snap Inc., which is cutting costs and relying more on remote work, is closing its office in San Francisco, dealing a fresh blow to a city trying to revive its business district.

The San Francisco office is one of several in the Bay Area, including one that opened recently in Palo Alto, the company said. Snap will continue to let San Francisco employees use a coworking space in the city.
