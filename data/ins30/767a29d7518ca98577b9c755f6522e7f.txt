Before it even started its first flights to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Breeze Airways announced Wednesday more cities it will be flying to from the Valley.

The one-year-old airline said it will add direct, nonstop service between Phoenix and Hartford, Connecticut; Richmond, Virginia; and Bentonville-Fayetteville, Arkansas. All three flights will start in February. Currently, no carriers fly directly between Sky Harbor and any of those three cities.

'With these routes we'll have 99 routes and 93% have no nonstop competition,' CEO and founder David Neeleman told the Business Journal.
