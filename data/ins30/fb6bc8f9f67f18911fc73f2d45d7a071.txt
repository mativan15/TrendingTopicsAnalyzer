Oct. 21—Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies is pouring more money into defeating Portland's minimum wage referendum ahead of the November election.

The San Francisco-based company registered a new ballot question committee with the city last week. The committee, United for Portland Workers, has spent nearly $31,000 so far, mostly on research and polling with a New York firm.

The money adds to the $75,000 Uber already has contributed to other committees opposed to Question D. The company has donated $50,000 to Enough is Enough, which is opposed to all 13 referendums in Portland, and $25,000 to Restaurant Industry United.
