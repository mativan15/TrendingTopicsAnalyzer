If you receive a letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), do not panic. Beginning last week, the service began sending letters to more than 9 million people who appear to qualify for checks but have not filed the required 2021 federal income tax return that will qualify them for those funds. According to the IRS, members of this group of 9 million may be eligible to claim some or all of the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and other credits depending on their specific situation.
