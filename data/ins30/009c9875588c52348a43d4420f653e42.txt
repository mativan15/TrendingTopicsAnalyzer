NASA Hubble Space Telescope thought it spotted something that should not exist, which was travelling at a mind-altering rate 7 times faster than light!
 On Earth, we have created some really fast objects. For instance, the speed of a bullet out of a gun can be as high as 4,200 kilometers per hour, which is three times the speed of sound. But it is not even the fastest thing. The fastest man-made object would be the NASA Parker Solar Probe spacecraft which reached a speed of 535,000 kilometers per hour using the Sun's gravity! Now, that is fast.
