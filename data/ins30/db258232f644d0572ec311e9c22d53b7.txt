The Reserve Bank is expected to go for another rate hike of 0.40% at the scheduled review of the monetary policy next week, a foreign brokerage said on Friday. The central bank's rate setting panel will follow it up with a 0.35% hike in rates at the next review in August, or make it into a 0.50% hike next week and a 0.25% increase in August, to make the total quantum of rate hikes at 0.75%, the report by Bofa Securities said. On May 4, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) hiked rates by 0.40%, and Governor Shaktikanta Das has already called a rate hike at the forthcoming review as a "no brainer" given the pressure to maintain its core mandate of inflation in the targeted band of under 6%.
