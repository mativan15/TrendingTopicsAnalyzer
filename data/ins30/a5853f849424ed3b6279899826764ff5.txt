A retired Indian Administrative (IAS) officer JM Pathania on Sunday wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Himachal Pradesh, Maneesh Garg to complaint against the state government departments, boards and corporations violating Model Code of Conduct (MCC). Pathania alleged that sixteen government departments, boards, corporations and cooperative banks have violated the MCC as their websites still flash pictures of ministers, politicians and political parties. This was also the first complaint of a violation of MCC in the run-up to the November 12 elections.
