The technical definition of recession is perhaps not doing us much service. The Bank of England's latest forecast for the UK economy, for example, doesn't predict an outright recession: instead it shows multiple quarterly economic contractions over the next few years, but not (yet) two in a row.
But meeting the technical definition does not determine whether people feel fine financially or significantly poorer. If Britain's economic outlook is anything like the Bank's projections, we are facing years of extremely lacklustre growth.
