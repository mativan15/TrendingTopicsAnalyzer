Federal Reserve officials have grown increasingly more aggressive in their battle against inflation by raising interest rates in large 75-basis-point increments. That's because inflation is putting up a good fight, too. The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile energy and food costs, rose to a year-over-year rate of 6.6% in September – its highest since 1982. And although the Fed is just doing its job, there are serious risks involved for the stock market and the economy."The Fed has committed to taking an aggressive approach to taming inflation by slowing economic growth, but the path to achieving the necessary slowdown without sending the US into a recession is rife with pitfalls," David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in a recent note to clients.
