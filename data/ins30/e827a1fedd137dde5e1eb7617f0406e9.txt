The 23-year-old has scored four goals in 11 games but has also been sent off

Darwin Nunez has had his critics since arriving in England and the Liverpool striker has found himself the target once more - but this time from an unlikely source.

Nunez became the Reds' record transfer signing this summer when they paid Benfica £85million for his services.

The 23-year-old has scored four goals in 11 appearances for the Anfield outfit so far, but he has also endured a three-match suspension too following a straight red card for headbutting Crystal Palace centre back Joachim Andersen in August.
