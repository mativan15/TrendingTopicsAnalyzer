Shanghai residents flocked to luxury stores as soon as the city opened after two months in lockdown.

Fashion houses such as Prada, Dior, and Louis Vuitton all saw queues on Wednesday, SCMP reported.

"Revenge spending in Shanghai means long queues outside Hermès," a social media user said.

Shanghai residents flocked to luxury stores on the first day of the city's reopening after spending two months under a strict Covid lockdown that stopped them from even heading out to buy food.
