The Washington Business Journal hosted its third On the Road event of the year Sept. 29 at the R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center on the St. Elizabeths East campus, diving into the successes and challenges of developing east of the Anacostia River in D.C. and the actions of the District government to strengthen the economies of wards 7 and 8 — and the economic standing of their residents.

From the imminent construction of the 11th Street Bridge Park to the ongoing redevelopment of St. E's, from the promise of new mixed-use at the Congress Heights Metro to the promise of new mixed-use at Poplar Point, there is much to look forward to on the city's eastern end.
