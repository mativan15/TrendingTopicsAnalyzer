A federal judge in Missouri dismissed a case brought by six conservative states that broadly charged that President Joe Biden had acted beyond its authority in its plan to cancel student loan debt for millions of borrowers, the Associated Press reports.

The six states – Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – failed to establish they had standing, with the judge saying Thursday that 'the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case.'

The states also had argued they would lose money from future tax revenues and via quasi-state agencies that service student loans.
