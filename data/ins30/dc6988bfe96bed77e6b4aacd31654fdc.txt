Opposition Leader V.D. Satheesan on Friday accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of rendering the force ineffective. Talking to mediapersons here, Mr. Satheeshan said even a case regarding the theft of mangoes involving a policeman was being settled without trial. Chief Minister, who also holds the Home department, had given his party men a free reign over police, he said. Mr. Satheesan accused that instead of DIG or IG, an officer of the rank of Superintendent was being controlled by a CPI(M) district secretary while the Station House Officer (SHO) was in the control of area secretary.
