AgenciesBothra added that the price of fabric has also come down due to lesser demand. Diwali orders at Surat's textile mills have fallen by 50% to Rs 8,000 crore in comparison to last year. Textile manufacturers of Surat say that the demand is not coming from the retail end which is why wholesalers are not picking up dyed fabric and other textile items like sarees, garments from them. However, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said that the retailers have huge inventory from last two years which they are clearing now and that is the possible reason for lower offtake from Surat's mills.
