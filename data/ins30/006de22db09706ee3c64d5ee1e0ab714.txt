General Mills is exiting its business in Israel by selling its stake to joint-venture partner Bodan Holdings, leaving behind a controversial Pillsbury plant in the occupied West Bank that prompted a boycott campaign. "This divestiture represents another step in General Mills' Accelerate strategy, which is centered on strategic choices about where to prioritize our resources to drive superior returns," the company said in a statement released this week. General Mills operates a Pillsbury factory in the Atarot Industrial Park, the largest industrial park in the Jerusalem area.
