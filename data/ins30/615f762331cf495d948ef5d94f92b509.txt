Good morning. With the platinum jubilee behind us, there could be few more fitting tributes than to anoint a new set of summer kings and queens: the stars of the new season of Love Island. This year's edition starts tonight, and it comes with a host of innovative features: a new villa, an even bigger gym, and Michael Owen's daughter Gemma. ('He took it quite well,' says Gemma. 'It's probably a father's worst nightmare,' says Michael.)If viewers can wrest their attention away from the 'the biggest bedroom we've had' tonight, though, they may notice something else: Love Island has a new sponsor.
