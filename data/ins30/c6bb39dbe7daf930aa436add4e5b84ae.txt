Wells Fargo's bottom line took a $2 billion hit in the latest quarter, and CEO Charlie Scharf told investors that the bank isn't out of the woods yet.

The San Francisco bank, one of the largest in the Triangle in terms of local deposits, is still seeking to recover from a series of scandals that first came to light in 2016. How much longer Wells (NYSE: WFC) will face huge expenses tied to regulatory fines, lawsuits and remediation efforts was a concern analysts raised on Friday's third-quarter earnings call.
