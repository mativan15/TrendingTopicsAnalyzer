The Playlist James Gray is an incredibly talented filmmaker. That much is really not up for debate. However, if you want to talk about one of his films specifically, 'Ad Astra,' that's when film fans begin to really diverge. With each film, Gray has no problem going for big swings and you could argue that 'Ad Astra' has been his biggest swing to date. The sci-fi epic earned pretty great reviews when it was released but audiences didn't open up to the emotional, space family drama, with the film not really able to recoup its money at the box office.
