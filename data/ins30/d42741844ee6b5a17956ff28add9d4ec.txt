Tom Brady says he has no plans to walk away from football (for a second time) before the end of the season, despite the speculation otherwise.
 
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, 45, pushed back on that claim — which came from a former Bucs QB, Chris Simms, on Wednesday — during his mid-week press conference Thursday.
 
When asked about Simms' comments, Brady first went for a joke, telling reporters, "Well that's really why I'm here, I'm here to announce, finally, you guys have pushed me to the brink.
