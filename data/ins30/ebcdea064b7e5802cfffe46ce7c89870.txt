Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick is showing no signs of slowing down.
The Paramount and Skydance tentpole, starring Tom Cruise, is doing massive business in its second weekend. If estimates hold, the sequel will earn $85 million or more in its sophomore outing to boast the smallest decline ever — 33% — for a movie opening domestically to $100 million more.
In North America, the summer tentpole earned $25 million on Friday (June 3) to finish the day with a jet-fueled cume of $230 million.
That number should rise to $290 million by the end of Sunday and as much as $540 globally.
