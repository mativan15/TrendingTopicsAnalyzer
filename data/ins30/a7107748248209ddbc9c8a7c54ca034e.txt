Jun. 5—Sixteen local residents have agreed to serve on a residents committee to promote a property tax proposal placed on the Aug. 2 ballot by Joplin city officials.

The council will be asked at a meeting Monday to approve a resolution in support of the appointments.

The city proposes to impose property taxes of $1 per $100 assessed valuation on real estate and $1 per $100 assessed valuation on personal property. Discussions of city staff and council regarding the proposal have committed proceeds of the tax to pay for increased wages for police officers and firefighters.
