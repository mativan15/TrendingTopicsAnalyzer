What I am looking at June 1, 2022 Salesforce (CRM) guidance was not light. If you factor in the severe increase in the dollar in such a short time, which the analysts didn't do, you would see it was a monster quarter . There are buyers for Slack and buyers for Tableau for accountability. Typical new client is Formula One, whose CEO Stefano Domenicali used to run Lamborghini. Just a very good big growth quarter in all areas. Barclays raises price target to $218 from $208. A bunch of joyous price target decreases though because numbers were too high and didn't reflect current valuations.
