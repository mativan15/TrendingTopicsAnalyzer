Hamilton West MP Gaurav Sharma, who was kicked out of the Labour Party caucus, says he has resigned. His resignation will trigger a by-election for Hamilton West. Labour leader Jacinda Ardern has said that by-election would be a waste of time and money, 'costing the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of dollars'. Ardern urged Sharma to stay in Parliament as an independent, and said she had no plan to pull the 'Waka Jumping' trigger to push him out of Parliament herself. Sharma had continued as an independent MP, after being expelled from the Labour caucus.
