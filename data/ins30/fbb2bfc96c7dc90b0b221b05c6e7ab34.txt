Will Raven Baxter's mom, Tanya Baxter, return to 'Raven's Home?' Only ET's Deidre Behar spoke with the cast during the 100th episode celebration about the possibility of fan-favorite actors returning to reprise their roles. Raven-Symoné, Rondell Sheridan and Anneliese van der Pol dish on Tanya's wherabouts, and how the series plans to address her in the future. Raven says she's in touch with the actress who played Tanya, T'Keyah Crystal Keymáh, and there is a phone call out to her to come back!As some long-time fans of the series might remember, T'Keyah didn't return for season 4 of That's So Raven and it was explained that Tanya Baxter had went to England to attend law school.
