The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will approach the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to present its case against the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) move to substantially dilute its powers in the draft telecom Bill. The Authority is also in the process of writing to the DoT highlighting its opposition to several clauses in the new Bill, which virtually make it a rubber stamp of the government.
According to sources, the telecom regulator plans to make a detailed presentation to the PMO showing how investor confidence and ease of doing business would get hurt if Trai's powers are whittled down.
