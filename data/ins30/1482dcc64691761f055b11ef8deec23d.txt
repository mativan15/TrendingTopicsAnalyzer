I'll tell you a secret: I was thinking of buying the aging iPhone XR recently when I was deciding whether I should go for a new iPhone 14 or just spend very little on one of the best iPhones I ever tested.I decided against it - mostly because I'm finishing a longer-term test of the iPhone 13 Pro Max and I'm intrigued as to what's coming with the iPhone 14 MaxThen I read, to my dismay, about possible delays to the 2022 Apple handset line-up, especially the new Max (opens in new tab). But then I found myself wondering: would such a slowdown really be a bad thing? After all, the iPhone XR was heavily delayed, and that sold well over the years, so it's not necessarily a problem for Apple if there are issues this year, too.
