Informal communication with the government and the Collegium before recommending names for appointment of judges is a threat to independence of judiciary, senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan has said.
'There are whispers — and I hope they are not true — of the Collegium thinking that they will send recommendations only if they are going to get accepted by the government. This is a very dangerous proposition,' Vaidyanathan said, speaking at the second M K Nambyar Memorial Lecture, organised by SASTRA University in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.
