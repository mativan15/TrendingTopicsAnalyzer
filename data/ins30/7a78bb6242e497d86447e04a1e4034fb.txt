Even amid an economic downturn, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.99%) delivered third-quarter results that show the company is in peak physical condition. Beyond the top and bottom line numbers -- which gave the company a clean bill of health -- management shared other developments that show that even in the most trying times, the company is a smooth operator.
Furthermore, one of the revelations in its quarterly checkup is that Intuitive Surgical is making a huge investment in itself that will help shareholders become financially healthier in the balance.
