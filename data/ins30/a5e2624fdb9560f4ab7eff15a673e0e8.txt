SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese chip maker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC) Ltd denied a media report that it had participated in emergency meetings convened by China's industry ministry to discuss the impact of U.S. sanctions.

The company in a statement late on Thursay described the report as "false and sinister," adding that the report had damaged its corporate image and would have serious adverse effects on the semiconductor industry environment at home and abroad.

Bloomberg News reported that YMTC, along with a number of other Chinese chip companies, met with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to discuss the impact of recent sanctions from Washington on China's chip industry.
