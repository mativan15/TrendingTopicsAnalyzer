Marvel's ruled the movies in May; now it's Maverick's turn. Tom Cruise and Top Gun: Maverick (NASDAQ:PARA) (NASDAQ:PARAA) zoom into theaters for the holiday weekend, bringing a sequel to Cruise's 1986 hit 36 years after the fact (and after a couple of years of COVID-19 pandemic delays). And the movie is sure to displace the three-week-old Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (DIS) atop the box-office gross charts; the question is whether it does in a historic manner. Paramount isn't fooling around with its plans: The film is opening on 4,732 screens in North America, the widest opening count in history.
