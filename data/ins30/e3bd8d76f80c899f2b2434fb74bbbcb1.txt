Surf conditions can be unpredictable.

The Corona del Mar and Huntington Beach high school girls' tennis teams have been the class of the Surf League in recent years, with neither team really able to dominate.

Each match has been close and tense. On Tuesday afternoon, players from both teams sat on the far end of the third singles court at Huntington Beach High, as the sun played peek-a-boo between the trees further to the north.

CdM freshman Polina Briggs rallied to defeat Huntington Beach senior Kayla Friedland in the last set on court.
