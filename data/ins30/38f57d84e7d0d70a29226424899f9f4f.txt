Mumbai After the pandemic-induced lull of the past two years, this festive season has seen an increase in sales from gold to dry fruit and even homes, industry bodies said. Dhanteras, considered by many Hindus to be an auspicious time to buy new items, has helped markets see an upswing in footfall and sales. Gold sales are especially high this year, said Kumar Jain, the spokesperson for India Bullion and Jewellers Association, adding that sales may double the usual numbers and reach up to ₹500 to 550 crore on October 22, which is the first day of the two-day Dhanteras festival this year.
