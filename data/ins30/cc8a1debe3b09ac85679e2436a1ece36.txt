Dell's UltraSharp 30 USB-C Hub Monitor (U3023E) is a $814.99 display for workers who crave something a little different. Its 16:10 aspect ratio gives it a slightly taller stature than the usual 16:9 panel, for a bit more vertical screen space than other widescreen monitors. It has all the ports you'd expect in a USB-C hub or docking-station monitor, as well as numerous ergonomic features and full coverage of the sRGB color space. It's a very capable if rather pricey monitor for general business use.
