The Ontario Liberals, New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives are promising to help the city of Ottawa expand light rail transit into Kanata, Stittsville and Barrhaven. However, only the Liberals and the NDP committed to funding 50 per cent of the costs for Stage 3 of the light rail transit project. Mayor Jim Watson sent a letter to the part leaders and candidates in Nepean, Carleton and Kanata-Carleton, asking if they will commit to funding 50 per cent of Ottawa's Stage 3 LRT project in the west end.
