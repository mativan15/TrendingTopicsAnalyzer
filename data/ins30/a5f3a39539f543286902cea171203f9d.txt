CRANBURY – Transportation services provider Penske Truck Leasing recently opened a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility in the township.

It is the first ground-up build in the firm's South Plainfield district. The last new builds in the New York metro area for Penske happened in tandem in 2006 with the openings of its Parsippany and Bridgeport locations.

Located at 2682 Route 130 North, the facility offers consumer and commercial truck rental, full-service truck leasing and contract truck fleet maintenance.
