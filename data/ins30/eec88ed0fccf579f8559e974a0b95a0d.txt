I'm not one of those people who is a die hard Donald Trump supporter. I grew up a Democrat because when I was registering to vote, a girl told me that all Jews were Democrats and, as I wasn't politically active, I said OK. Over time, being a Democrat didn't work for me, and 9/11 was my real awakening. I realized that America needed to focus on national security and being safe.I'm an Orthodox Jew. I grew up Orthodox, I went to religious schools and I go to synagogue all the time. I've dealt with anti-Semitism my whole life.
