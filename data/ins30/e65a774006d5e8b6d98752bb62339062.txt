The inflation-flavored 2022 has been a brutal year for most cryptocurrencies. The Shiba Inu (SHIB -0.21%) meme coin has fallen 88% from last October's all-time highs. The XRP (XRP -1.00%) token, which powers the Ripple network's international payments, is down 65% over the same period. Both digital assets took a deeper cut than the stock market; the S&P 500 index is only down 22% over the same span.
For the market in general, and for some specific cryptocurrencies, this sharp plunge will be remembered as a great time to pick up long-term winners on the cheap.
