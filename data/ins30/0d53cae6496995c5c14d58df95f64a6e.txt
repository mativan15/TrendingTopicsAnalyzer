The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Puducherry, has concluded a six-week talent, employability and entrepreneurship building programme for rural and underprivileged students.
The fourth edition of the ‘Garnishing Talent Programme', a CII partnership with Eaton Power Quality Ltd, which was returning after a pandemic-induced gap of three years, focused on students from vernacular medium (English/Tamil medium) and rural background whose families were not economically well off, a press note said.
