Calgary Flames fans are still coming to terms with a playoff series loss to the Edmonton Oilers Thursday night in a game that saw both controversy and heartbreak following a Connor McDavid overtime goal.  Kaylee Nowosiad attended almost every single Calgary home game during the postseason. She says that the better team won, but she still can't bring herself to cheer on the Oilers moving forward.  "I support McDavid, but it's just against everything I stand for as a Flames fan to cheer for the Oilers, I just can't," she laughed.
