State Assemblymember Alex Lee is the latest victim of negative campaign monkey business.

The PAC is largely funded by the California Association of Realtors and the California Apartment Association. Negative mailers and texts are certainly not new in Silicon Valley, but those sent out by the PAC have made waves on social media.
