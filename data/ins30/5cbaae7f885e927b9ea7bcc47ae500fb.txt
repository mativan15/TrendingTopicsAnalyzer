 Olivia Wilde has shared a salad dressing recipe after she and Jason Sudeikis rubbished claims from a former nanny that she had prepared a salad for Harry Styles while the former couple were still together. The pair, who split in November 2020 and share two children,  put on a united front this week to rubbish claims from a nanny that Olivia and Harry had begun spending time together before her split from Jason, and that he had found out about it from an old Apple Watch of hers which was lying around.
