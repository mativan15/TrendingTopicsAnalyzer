The Bingham County coroner has been charged with misdemeanor sexual battery.

James K. Roberts, 55, was charged with sexual battery in Ada County, according to court records.

Because the charge is a misdemeanor, information regarding the alleged crime is limited. However, court documents indicate that Roberts was accused of grabbing a woman's breasts on April 13.

The incident occurred in the 1400 block of Entertainment Avenue in Boise and was reported to Boise police, Boise Police Department spokesperson Haley Kramer told the Idaho Statesman on Tuesday.
