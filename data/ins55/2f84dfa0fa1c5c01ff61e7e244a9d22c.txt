Bond market volatility eased overnight as Britain backed away from its controversial tax and borrowing plans, giving Wall Street a firm leg up heading into a busy earnings week.

U.S. equity futures moved firmly higher Monday, while the dollar retreated against its global peers, as investors looked for an easing in bond market turmoil ahead ahead of another busy week for earnings releases on Wall Street.

Financial markets in Britain, which have caused global uproar of late amid plans by new Prime Minister Liz Truss to boost borrowing to pay for tax cuts, steadied Monday following the appointment of a new finance minister -- Jeremy Hunt -- who promised to tear up many of her key fiscal objectives.
