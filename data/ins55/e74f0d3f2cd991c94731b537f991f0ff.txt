Even though jewellers bet big on this Diwali, the World Gold Council (WGC) feels that
 inflation on household finances may lead to an immediate impact on gold jewellery demand. "Unlike the Diwali season of 2021, this season may not have the advantage of pent-up demand or savings from muted wedding celebrations fuelling higher gold purchase. Having said that, this is a busy buying season, and with gold being a valuable hedge against inflation, any further price declines in the coming weeks could result in a surge in demand," said Somasundaram PR, regional CEO, India, WGC.
