Enova International (NYSE:ENVA) One of our portfolio holdings that we believe will be relatively resilient is Enova International (down 26% YTD). We last wrote about Enova in our Q3 2018 letter. Since that letter, the trailing twelve-month earnings of the company have quadrupled and tangible book value per share has grown more than 12x. Despite that huge growth, their stock is trading at almost the same price it was back then! Enova is a subprime lender that uses machine learning methods to provide an automated underwriting of loans for a variety of different loan products.
