A former Marin resident said the Uvalde, Texas shooting was a harrowing reminder of the mass shooting she survived 10 years earlier.
Linnea Schurig, 26, a former San Rafael resident who now lives in Brooklyn, was with her older sister, Melia, now 29, during the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado. Both survived, but saw a friend sustain a gunshot wound in the theater where they were watching a movie with a group of youth associated with a national stuttering advocacy organization.
'I think I'm hoping maybe this time something will actually happen,' Schurig said in a phone interview this week.
