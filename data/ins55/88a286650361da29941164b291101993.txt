We've been asking for your views on Wolves' season and manager Bruno Lage after their campaign ended with defeat at Liverpool on Sunday.Here are some of your comments:Robert: Good to finish in the top half, but an opportunity missed. With 10 games to go we should have been aiming for Europe League or more. Disappointing and worrying last third of the season. Need some big signings who can start next season.Nathan: Overall a positive season but with a poor end. Remember, Wolves started the season creating more attempts on goal than most teams in Europe! As the season went on, that creative mindset disappeared and a more negative, defensive one came in.
