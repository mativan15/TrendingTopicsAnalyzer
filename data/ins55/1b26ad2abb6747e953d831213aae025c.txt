The Maharashtra Congress began a two-day conclave, 'nav sankalp', in Shirdi to strengthen the state unit. Congress ministers, MLAs, district presidents and other office bearers are at the meet. However, those attending are worried about the current state of the party and mulling about their future. Officially, the party has formed groups headed by senior leaders on political, organisation, economy, agriculture, farmers and cooperatives, social justice and youth and women empowerment to strengthen the organisation and create a bigger connect with voters.
