MPC member Jayanth R VarmaThe impact of rate hikes on inflation will be felt after five to six quarters, Jayanth R Varma, a member of RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said on Monday. "No doubt it (inflation) will come down. Because we have done monetary policy tightening," Varma, who is currently a professor of Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad), told news agency PTI. "That tightening will have its impact. The monetary policy takes, you know, five to six quarters to have its impact and cool prices," he added.
