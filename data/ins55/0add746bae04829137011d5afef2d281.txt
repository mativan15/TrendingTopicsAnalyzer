ET Canada Amy Schumer is one proud mom. Et's Rachel Smith spoke to the 41-year-old comedian at the premiere of 'Inside Amy Schumer' in New York City on Tuesday, and she gave a sweet update on her 3-year-old son, Gene, whom she shares with her husband, Chris Fischer.'I can't. I can't handle it. He's too cute. He's too cute and he's talking so much,' Schumer said. 'And he's a supreme athlete, just [for] any recruiters. People go, ‘Who works out? Where does he get it from?' I'm like ‘What do you mean?''Schumer, who attended Tuesday's event with Fischer, was excited to finally debut new episodes of her show after a six-year hiatus.
