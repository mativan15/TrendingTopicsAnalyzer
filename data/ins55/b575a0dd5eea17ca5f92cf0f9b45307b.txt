In 2011, corrupt Mexican police and cartel members murdered Javier Sicilia's son and six others. In the aftermath, Sicilia — a journalist for Proceso magazine — published an open letter headlined "Estamos Hasta la Madre" (We've had it up to here), launched a peace initiative and demanded government reform. A year later, Regina Martinez, another Proceso journalist, was beaten and strangled in her apartment. 
Since 2000, 150 Mexican journalists have been killed, according to Reporters Without Borders.
