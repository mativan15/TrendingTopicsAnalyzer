Leeds United are a threat to Real Valladolid for the permanent transfer of Sporting CP winger Gonzalo Plata, reports claim.

Plata has been a Sporting player since January 2019, when they brought him to Europe from Independiente del Valle in his native Ecuador. For the 2021-22 season, the Portuguese outfit loaned him to Valladolid in the Spanish second division.

Valladolid finished second to earn promotion and are now building a squad for their La Liga return.
