Grocery food prices were 6.4% higher in April this year than last year, with fruit and vegetables up a whopping 9.4%. And yes, inflation is biting around the world, but food is uniquely expensive in New Zealand: a Stuff report earlier this month noted that a Countdown-branded block of tasty cheese that retails for $18.50 in New Zealand costs just $10.88 in Australia. So why is food so expensive? And what can we do about it? MasterChef NZ judges Michael Dearth, Nadia Lim and Vaughan Mabee. The trio have their say on the reasons behind the high cost of food, and offer some advice on what we can do about it.
