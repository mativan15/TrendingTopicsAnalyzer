Regina is hosting a national conference on technology and aging, which is breaking a stereotype that technology is only for young people. Age-Well, a conference that brings together researchers, non-profits, care providers, and members of the public, among others, focuses on solutions and innovations to support an aging population. Jennifer Campos, Age-Well associate scientific director, said advancements in technology are often geared towards younger generations but new technology could also benefit older adults.
