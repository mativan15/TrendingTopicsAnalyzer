Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard Nigel Roddis AFP London (AFP) – Steven Gerrard was pushed closer to the sack as struggling Aston Villa crashed to a 3-0 defeat at Fulham, while Leicester climbed off the bottom of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Leeds on Thursday. Gerrard and his players were booed off at full-time by Villa's furious fans after a wretched display extended their winless run to four matches.Having won just two matches this season, Villa are above the relegation zone only due to their slight goals scored advantage over third-bottom Wolves.
