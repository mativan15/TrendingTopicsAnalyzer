Tom Brady explained why he chooses not to pay attention to social media amid rumours of his divorce from wife Gisele Bündchen.

The 45-year-old football star discussed his approach to social media during Monday's episode of his SiriusXM podcast, Let's Go! with Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray. Although Brady noted that everyone's strategy to what they post and read about is different, he confessed that he likes to 'ignore' as much online content as he can, since people don't fully know what's 'going on' in his life.
