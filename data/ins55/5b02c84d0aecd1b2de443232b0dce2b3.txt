Even as the September quarter for the multiplex industry remained weak, Kotak Institutional Equities maintained a buy rating on PVR for a target price of Rs 2,200, signifying decent gains to the tune of over 30% from the current market price. The brokerage is of the view that as the Bollywood content may improve, there will be a recovery in the company's business. Also, the Inox-PVR merger process which is currently underway will boost EBITDA by 15%. The PVR-Inox merger deal received shareholders' nod in October and the final NCLT approval will take three more months.
