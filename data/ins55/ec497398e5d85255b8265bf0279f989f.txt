Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano on Wednesday vowed that if he wins election to Pennsylvania's top office, he'll begin busing illegal immigrants to President Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

'On Day 1, we're no longer a sanctuary state. When those ghost flights show up, our beautiful Pennsylvania State Police will escort those busloads of illegals down to Delaware,' Mastriano said during a Fox News town hall hosted by Sean Hannity in York. 'Joe Biden can have them.'

His description of transporting migrants echoed Florida Gov.
