Europe's Stoxx 600 index climbed on Monday, buoyed by banks and real estate companies, as investors cheered the reversal of Britain's fiscal plan that had sent jitters across the markets. In the US, Wall Street's main indexes also jumped as Bank of America led a rally among lenders.The Iseq rose almost 2.5 per cent by the end of the session, dragged into the black by the large, indigenous multinationals such as Ryanair, Smurfit Kappa and Kingspan, who tracked their multinational peers.Companies with significant UK interests fared well.
