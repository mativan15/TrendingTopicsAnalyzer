NEW YORK — It's a green new day for weed dealers in the Big Apple.

Mayor Eric Adams promised Friday to not take a 'heavy-handed' approach toward those who sell marijuana illicitly in the city and gave New Yorkers his blessing to smoke more pot.

While New York legalized recreational weed use last year, the licensing system that's supposed to regulate cannabis sales isn't expected to kick off until late 2022 — and Adams said Friday afternoon that he doesn't see a need for cracking down on anyone caught dealing ganja out of stores or on the street in the interim.
