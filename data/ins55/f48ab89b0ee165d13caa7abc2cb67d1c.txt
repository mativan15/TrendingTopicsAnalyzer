By PA Media Published: 08:20 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:20 EDT, 20 October 2022 Steve Cooper says Saturday's game with Liverpool is a reminder of why Nottingham Forest were so desperate to get back in the big time. Forest host Liverpool at the City Ground in a repeat of their first home fixture in the Premier League in 1992, when Teddy Sheringham's goal gave them a 1-0 win. It has been 23 long years since the Anfield club have visited in the league as Forest meandered in the second and third tier.
