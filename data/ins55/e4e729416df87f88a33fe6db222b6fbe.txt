Congress leader Alok Sharma Saturday said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has not announced the dates for the Gujarat polls as 'some visits of ‘Saheb' may be pending' in the state ahead of the elections. Stating that the Congress would 'like to remain in the opposition' than form an alliance with any other party, Sharma also clarified that poll-bound Gujarat was not included in the ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra as it would have disturbed the election campaign.
When asked about the EC decision to defer the announcement of the Gujarat polls, Sharma said, 'Some inaugurations and visits of ‘Saheb' must be pending in Gujarat… We all know what the Election Commission is doing at the behest of the BJP like all other national organisations that run at the directions of the party.
