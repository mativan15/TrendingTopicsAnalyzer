The government has decided to set up language centres to prepare study material and courses for each of the 22 languages in the eighth schedule of the Constitution, officials aware of the development have said.The centres, called bhasha kendras, will be established under the Union ministry of education's Indian Knowledge System (IKS) initiative, they added. The move comes at a time when the Opposition is accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government of 'Hindi imperialism'. According to one senior official familiar with the matter, these language centres will be in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, that emphasises on promoting regional languages.
