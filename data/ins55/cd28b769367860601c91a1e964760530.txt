What does Doc Rivers think about Isaiah Joe's new landing spot?

The Philadelphia 76ers ' first two big cuts of the offseason weren't all that surprising. Two weeks ago, the Sixers waived the former G League MVP Trevelin Queen to knock the main roster down to 15 before the final two preseason games of the year.

Following the Sixers' preseason finale against the Charlotte Hornets last Wednesday, the 76ers made another expected move by waiving the second-year center Charles Bassey. Considering the roster was down to 15 players, it seemed everybody else was safe for the time being.
