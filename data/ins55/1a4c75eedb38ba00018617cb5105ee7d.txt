As the Aam Aadmi Party looks to expand its base in Gujarat amid hectic campaigns and frequent visits by top leaders, the state unit chief has drawn criticism ahead of the assembly elections due in the state. Gopal Italia - who was briefly detained in Delhi last week when the AAP's members protested outside the office of the NCW (National Commission for Women) where he was summoned - has been accused of making casteist comments, and targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his mother Hira Ba. Not just the leaders of the BJP, but even those of the Congress has said that his comments were 'unacceptable'.
