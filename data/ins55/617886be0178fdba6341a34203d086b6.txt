British Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on Monday, October 17, reversed most of an economic package announced by the government just weeks ago, including a planned cut to income tax. In a bid to soothe turbulent financial markets, Mr. Hunt said he was scrapping "almost all" the tax cuts announced last month and signaled public spending cuts are on the way. Mr. Hunt said a planned 1 percentage point cut to the basic rate of income tax that had been due to take effect next year won't happen. He also scaled back a cap on energy prices designed to help households pay their bills.
