Erik ten Hag kept his counsel about the officiating after Manchester United failed to 'kill' off Newcastle in a frustrating goalless draw.

A packed Old Trafford witnessed a tense Premier League clash between these top-six sides on Sunday afternoon, which started with Callum Wilson seeing a penalty appeal ignored.

Joelinton twice hit the woodwork during an impressive first half from Newcastle, but the hosts bounced back after the break and Cristiano Ronaldo quickly saw two goals ruled out.
