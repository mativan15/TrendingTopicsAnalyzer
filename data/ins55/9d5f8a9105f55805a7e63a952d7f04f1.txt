The Queen spent almost twice as long meeting Prime Minister's, as Liz Truss spent being one, it has been revealed.
Her Majesty would hold a weekly 30-minute audience with every PM throughout her 70 year reign.
This would mean she spent roughly 1,760 hours with PMs over the years.
Given the Queen would have been unable to meet up every week in person during the pandemic, it meant she did hold an audience almost every other week.
