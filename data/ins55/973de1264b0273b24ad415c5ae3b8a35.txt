Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images News Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) is down massively in pre-market trading as there's been a Bloomberg report saying: "Biden administration officials are discussing whether the US should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews, including the deal for Twitter Inc. and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network." In my opinion, this opens up an opportunity to add to a Twitter position at very low prices. These discussions seem to have borne out of Elon Musk's recent meddling in Russia's war on Ukraine.
