Russian reservists forced to buy their own gear are finding sky-high prices in stores, reports say.

Some items like body armor vests cost up to 10 times than normal, one Russian news site wrote.

Putin last month announced a mobilization of 300,000 Russian reservists to fight in Ukraine.

Prices are through the roof at Russia's military and outdoor gear stores, Russian news outlets report.
