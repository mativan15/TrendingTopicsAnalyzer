An airline hired to carry migrants from the UK to Rwanda has pulled out of operating any further such flights after pressure from campaigners.The Government used a plane run by Privilege Style when it tried to remove people to the east African country in June for the first time under the new immigration policy, but the flight was grounded at the last minute after legal challenges.Since then the Spanish charter airline has faced calls and demonstrations from campaigners urging it to abandon the arrangement.
