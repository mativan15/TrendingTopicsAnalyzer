Chelsea would prefer to sell Romelu Lukaku to Bayern Munich instead of the striker's former club Inter Milan to aid their own summer transfer plans, according to reports. The Blues are exploring a transfer for Bayern's legendary striker Robert Lewandowski and the chance to sign the prolific Lukaku as a replacement could make a deal more likely with the Bundesliga champions. Lukaku has had an underwhelming return to the Premier League in his second spell at Stamford Bridge, with a £97.5m transfer hardly living up to expectations.
