Lawless linked to a letter the National Minority Quality Forum, an advocacy group focused on health disparities among minority groups, sent to lawmakers raising concerns about whether the bill would protect against health data breaches. The letter was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the bill's Democratic co-sponsor Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who are working to pass the bill by the end of the summer.
The push from Amazon this week is the latest effort by the tech giants to fight unfavorable legislation by claiming it will hurt minority groups, including by funding some of these advocates, as POLITICO previously reported.
