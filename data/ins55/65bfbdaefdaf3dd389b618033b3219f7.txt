President Joe Biden vowed to meet with lawmakers about gun control legislation following the deadly massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas."I will meet with the Congress on guns, I promise you," Biden said Tuesday as he welcomed New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to the White House. He told Ardern he'd work with her to limit extremist content online. Biden told reporters Monday he hadn't yet opened negotiations with GOP lawmakers on the issue, but he believed there was a chance to strike a compromise with "rational Republicans," including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Texas senator John Cornyn.
