The Ohio State football team was enjoying a much-needed off week this past weekend and it couldn't have come at a better time, right smack dab in the middle of the regular-season schedule when several players were nursing injuries.

But things are getting cranked up to game-week level again as the Buckeyes prepare to host the Iowa Hawkeyes Saturday. And while you can never overlook an opponent, the one everyone is looking towards is the game in Happy Valley against Penn State in two weeks. Even if Michigan gave James Franklin and crew a football swirlie on national television Saturday.
