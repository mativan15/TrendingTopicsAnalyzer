Dave RyanBy dave ryanOct 17, 2022I met Joe Jacobs at the KDWB booth at the State Fair a few years ago. He was in our talent show and he has kept me up to date with his latest music. It's super-hard, almost impossible for a local artist to get on KDWB because you're competing with the biggest artists in the business: Taylor Swift, Beyonce', Sam Smith, Rihanna, Doja Cat, Bieber, etc. A few weeks ago, Joe sent me his latest song, "Emotions" and I loved it. I played it on KDWB on Friday and we had a huge response.
