(Bloomberg) -- The recent tumult in the UK government bond market is likely to be repeated where leveraged strategies are in place, said BlackRock Financial Management Inc.'s Bob Miller.

'When you tighten financial conditions this aggressively, this abruptly, things are going to break,' the firm's head of Americas fundamental fixed income said on Bloomberg Television's Surveillance on Monday. 'Where do they break first? Almost always, it's in the levered strategy.'

UK pension funds had been using an approach known as liability-driven investment, or LDI, to hedge against declines in government bond yields.
