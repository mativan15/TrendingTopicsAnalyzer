City Republicans praise proposals on the Nov. 8 ballot in New Britain as a way to better balance government, while Democrats decry them as a power play to reduce voters' control.

One charter change that will be before voters on Election Day would create a city manager's job, putting day-to-day operations of the city under the appointed executive instead of the mayor.

Another would do away with the five citywide seats on the common council, returning New Britain to the previous system where all 15 council members are elected by wards.
