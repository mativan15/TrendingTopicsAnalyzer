OTTAWA, ON, Oct. 17, 2022 /CNW Telbec/ - The Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA) announced today the composition of a panel of actuaries to review the 31st Actuarial Report on the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).

Produced every three years, the Actuarial Report on the CPP is considered by the federal and provincial Ministers of Finance as part of their statutory triennial financial review of the CPP. This is the ninth external peer review of the CPP Actuarial Report since 1999. These reviews generate valuable recommendations that have been a source of continued improvements in the quality and transparency of actuarial reports.
