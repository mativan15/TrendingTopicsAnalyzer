Everyone hates mosquitoes. The first frost may be just around the corner to give Northwest Indiana residents a reprieve from the endless biting battle, but now is actually the perfect time to celebrate our local mosquito-eaters with the kickoff of Bat Week.

As you close up your yard and hang up your gardening gloves for the season, it's a great opportunity to sprinkle some native wildflower seeds in your yard. While you start to winterize your home, it's also the ideal time to put up a bat house — you've already got the ladder out, and you'll be ahead of the game for their return in the spring!

Luckily, we can have free pest control services right in our own yards courtesy of our neighborhood bats.
