Part of the problem, lawyers said this week, is the complexity of its joint-venture-style master franchise agreement, which allows Burger King to profit from sales of Whopper burgers without the risk of using its own capital.Unlike rival McDonald's, which owned the vast majority of its Russia locations, Burger King's Toronto-based parent doesn't own any of its own restaurants in Russia. 'There's just a really complex contractual and legal atmosphere right now that's giving franchisees and franchisors in Russia no good option,' said Liz Dillon, partner at Lathrop GPM in Minneapolis.
