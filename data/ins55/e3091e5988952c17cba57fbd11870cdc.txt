The move comes as the Prime Minister faces growing Tory pressure over his leadership, with a growing number of MPs submitting letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson, and three ministers publicly criticising Downing Street over the partygate scandal.
Penny Mordaunt, the trade minister, told constituents that the rule-breaking exposed by Sue Gray's report was 'shameful'. 
Ms Mordaunt said she was 'angry' at those in Downing Street who were ignoring Covid rules while blocking 'reasonable requests to relax restrictions' during the pandemic.
