The oil industry appears divided this morning on the North Sea windfall tax. In an interview with The Times, Meg O'Neill, chief executive of Woodside Energy, has warned that the tax will imperil government attempts to revive Britain's oil and gas industry.O'Neil told Emily Gosden, our energy editor, that the Treasury's energy profits levy was a 'red flag' showing that Britain was 'not a particularly conducive place to invest'.But Serica Energy, the North Sea producer, has played down the impact in a stock exchange update this morning.
