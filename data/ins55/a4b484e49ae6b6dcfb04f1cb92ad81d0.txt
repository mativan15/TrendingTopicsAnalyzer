In another one of Joe Lycett's hilarious right-wing antics, he's urged Liz Truss to try again as Prime Minister in the leadership contest next week.
Earlier today, the PM delivered a speech outside Downing Street to announce that she was stepping down from the role after a disastrous short term, which has included crashing the economy and the departure of both her Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary within the last few days.
She became the shortest serving PM after only being in office for 44 days.
