A controversy has gripped the internet after a new video emerged showing US President Joe Biden offering 'dating' advice to a young girl. The video shows a few people were taking a picture with President Biden, who held the shoulder of the young girl and told her not to date any serious men until she turns 30. President Biden was heard saying that he had shared the same advice with his daughters and granddaughters. President Joe Biden grabs a young girl by the shoulder and tells her 'no serious guys till your 30' as she looks back appearing uncomfortable, secret service appears to try to stop me from filming it after Biden spoke @ Irvine Valley Community College | @TPUSA @FrontlinesShow pic.
