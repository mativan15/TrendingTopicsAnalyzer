The board of directors of Russian oil giant Rosneft is recommending the payment of a record high annual dividend for 2021, which will benefit the Russian government the most, considering the fact that it holds the highest stake in the oil firm.

Rosneft's board recommended on Monday that the company pay $0.38 (23.63 Russian rubles) per share for the second half of last year, which would mean the full-year 2021 dividend would be at a record $0.68 (41.66 rubles) per share.

Rosneft booked a sixfold jump in its 2021 net income, which surged to a new record, but was below the expectations of some analysts.
