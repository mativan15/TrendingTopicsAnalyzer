The Orlando Magic waived Devin Cannady Saturday to become roster compliant for the 2022-23 regular season, which starts Tuesday.

Cannady's release brings the Magic's roster down to 15 players signed to standard contracts, in addition to their pair of two-way players (Kevon Harris and Admiral Schofield). Orlando also waived Jay Scrubb and Simi Shittu, who were signed to training camp deals.

After signing a 10-day deal with the Magic on March 31, Cannady signed a 3-year, $3.75 million partially guaranteed contract ($100,000 guaranteed for 2021-22) with Orlando on the final day of last season.
