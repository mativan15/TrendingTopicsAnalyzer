An industry source says an operator could buy a failed broadband builder out of administration and run the network without the need to make immediate changes.
One executive says such is the market's confidence in the sector that it was more likely greater sums of money would flow into so-called alt-nets in the coming months, shielding them from the impact of commercial pressures.
An Ofcom spokesman said the regulator was keeping a close eye on the broadband market: "In the unlikely event that a network suddenly failed and ceased to provide services, we would work with alternative suppliers to help customers get reconnected as quickly as possible.
