Football is back. Well, football has been back for months, but the brand of football that made this America's new pastime is back — and it's especially back in the Dirty South.

Not only are the Falcons moving the ball, but in a league that's seeing robust improvements to run games with several franchises as more teams play in two-high shells, even the Falcons are distinguishing themselves.
