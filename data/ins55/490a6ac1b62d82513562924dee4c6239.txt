The new Milwaukee professional soccer team will begin play at the downtown Milwaukee Iron District in 2025 in the USL Championship division — the second-highest tier of professional soccer in the country behind Major League Soccer — and the owners are inviting fans to submit a name and colors for the team.

The new team's owner is Jim Kacmarcik, who owns multiple businesses under the Kacmarcik Enterprises umbrella in Grafton. Kacmarcik told the Milwaukee Business Journal he is holding discussions with potential minority owners and anticipates multiple owners for the new team.
