The comments appear to be at odds with the council's decision, backed by Keogh, for the memorial to give a more prominent place to recording the history of the frontier wars in Australia.UNSW Canberra Professor Peter Stanley, who worked at the memorial for 27 years and was its principal historian, said that he had argued for 40 years the frontier wars should be recognised.He pointed out the memorial had displayed galleries that documented the New Zealand wars, the Boer wars in South Africa before federation, and that the colonial galleries had an engraving that documented the Slaughterhouse Creek massacre of 1838.
