Dear Newsweek, We've been going on vacation with my sister, her husband, and her 2 girls since they were born. We rent a house in West Virginia every year with them and our mom. I have brought up in the past that we should split the rental [costs] based on headcount or room usage, including their children. My sister's response was that the girls don't have money and we should just split it with the adults. I was afraid of her getting mad and then not seeing my nieces while they were little (they live out of state), so I dropped it at the time, as she holds grudges.
