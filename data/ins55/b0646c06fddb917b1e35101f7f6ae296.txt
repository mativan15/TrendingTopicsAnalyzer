Published: 17:30 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 19:06 EDT, 16 October 2022 The hostility between Liverpool and Manchester City exploded again on Sunday as the champions surrendered their unbeaten start to the season at Anfield.Mohamed Salah's 75th-minute strike settled the contest but that provided only a fraction of the story, as Pep Guardiola had coins thrown at him during the second half and Jurgen Klopp was sent off for, in his own words, 'losing it' with an assistant referee.City confirmed they would complain about the coin-throwing, which happened shortly after Phil Foden had a goal disallowed in the 56th minute.
