Missguided is on the brink of collapsing into administration after it was issued a winding-up petition by suppliers.

Police were called to the company's Manchester headquarters as the online fashion giant reportedly owes creditors millions of pounds.

Suppliers are now demanding overdue payments be made, according to reports by The i, while office workers are said to have stopped answering phone calls from factory owners.
