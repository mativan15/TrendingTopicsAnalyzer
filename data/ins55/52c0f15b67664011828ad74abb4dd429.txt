The City stockbroker controlled by Bob Diamond, the former Barclays chief, is plotting a merger with one of its listed rivals as a slowdown in corporate activity drives a search for bigger cost savings.Sky News has learnt that Panmure Gordon, in which Mr Diamond's Atlas Merchant Capital took a majority stake in 2017, has approached FinnCap Group about a potential tie-up.
Discussions between the two companies are said to be at an early stage, and there was no certainty on Monday evening that they would result in a deal.
