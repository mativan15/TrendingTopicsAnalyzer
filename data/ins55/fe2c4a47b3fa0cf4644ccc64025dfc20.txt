Until 2008, everyone had their own fiefdom within Colorado liquor sales.

State law limited every individual or corporation to one full-service liquor sales license, meaning that grocery chains could have one location, just like liquor stores, to sell beer, wine and spirits. Liquor stores operated six days a week with no competition other than certain breweries and wineries selling full-strength beverages to go. And grocers got to sell low-alcohol beer, with most of their sales coming on Sundays.
