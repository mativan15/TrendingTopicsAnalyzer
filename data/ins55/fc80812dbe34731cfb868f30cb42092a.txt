A group of veterans supporting Pennsylvania Senate hopeful John Fetterman (D) formally launched on Monday, calling out Republican candidate Mehmet Oz as 'devoid of any principles' in a letter.

Veterans for Fetterman includes more than 100 veterans in Pennsylvania who have said they will be supporting the Democrat in the general election and attended campaign events for him. In their letter, they targeted Oz for pushing dubious claims and products as a doctor on T.V. and for not doing more to support a veterans health care bill before it was passed by Congress.
