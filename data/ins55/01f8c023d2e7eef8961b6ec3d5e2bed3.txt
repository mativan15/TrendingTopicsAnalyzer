India has taken another step towards financial inclusion and strengthening digital banking in the country. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi yesterday (Oct. 16) launched 75 digital banking units (DBUs) across 75 districts of the country. DBUs are brick-and-mortar outlets with minimal staff. They will provide a variety of facilities like opening savings accounts, printing passbooks, transferring funds, and investing in fixed deposits, apart from applying for loans and credit and debit cards. Eleven public sector banks, 12 in the private sector, and one small-finance lender are participating in the initiative.
