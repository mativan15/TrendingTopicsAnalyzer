Published: 08:00 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 11:12 EDT, 20 October 2022 Britain has become the laughing stock of the world's media as Liz Truss resigned today after her leadership went 'from absurd to ridiculous' amid daily scenes of 'abject chaos' in Parliament. Column inches from Australia to America, Ireland to India, and across mainland  Europe have been filled with mockery for both 'hopeless and hapless' Miss Truss and a Tory party they said has been doomed 'by its own idiocy'.But the tone was far from cheerful.
