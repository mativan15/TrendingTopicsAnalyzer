Joe Raedle Thesis adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY, OTCQX:ADDDF) shares plunged by as much as 10% following a profit warning for Q3 results, as well as a lowered guidance for the FY 2022. As a consequence of a challenging outlook in China, paired with a slowing demand environment in western economies, adidas estimates that profits in 2022 will be about 60% lower than what has previously been expected. The adidas profit warning is certainly difficult to stomach. But investors should consider that the company's stock has aggressively derated YTD - being down 60.
