Good afternoon and welcome to the Championship play-off final, historically one of the most exciting fixtures in the English calendar, and one on which so much rides. For Nottingham Forest, a chance to return to the big time for the first time since the 1998-1999 season, when they were relegated. Since then, they've been at times in the third tier of English football, there has been terrible mismanagement, boardroom foolishness and on-pitch heartbreak. I am sure many neutrals would like to see the former European Cup winners back at the top table.
