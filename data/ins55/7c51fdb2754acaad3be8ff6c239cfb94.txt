In 1960, songwriter Paul Vance took his family to a beach near their home on New York's Long Island. His 2-year-old daughter, Paula, was wearing a two-piece swimsuit for the first time and was shy about being seen when she emerged from a dressing room. She covered up in a towel before going in the water.Vance, who had already co-written "Catch a Falling Star," a Grammy-winning hit single for Perry Como, was always alert for new song ideas. On the way home from the beach, he jotted down the first draft of what became his best-known tune: - - - It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini That she wore for the first time today An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini So in the locker, she wanted to stay - - - The lyrics reflected Vance's (and his daughter's) experiences.
