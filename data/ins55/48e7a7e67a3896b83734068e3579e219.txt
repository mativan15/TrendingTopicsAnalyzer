Have you ever used Google Maps while you are travelling or to know the correct route to a place you wish to visit? Or maybe to look for a place that you have not been to yet? If you never used Google Maps yet, you should know that this app can be used to explore multiple places, create lists, share experiences, add information about a certain place, add reviews, fix incorrect or incomplete information about places and much more.

An internet connection is generally required to use Google Maps. However, you can use offline maps in a car if you have a poor internet connection for navigation and safety features.
