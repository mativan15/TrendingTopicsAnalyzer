(Bloomberg) -- Ireland will make it easier for would-be borrowers to qualify for mortgages next year as it relaxes its income-to-loan requirements in an effort to widen accessibility in the face of a shortage of supply and record prices.Prospective first-time homeowners will be able to borrow as much as four times their gross income, up from a limit of 3.5 times previously, from Jan. 1, 2023, the central bank said on Wednesday.
