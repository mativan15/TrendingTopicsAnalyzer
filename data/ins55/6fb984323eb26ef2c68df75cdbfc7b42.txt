Alan demonstrated how he divides his perennial plants to create more in a video for Waitrose & Partners. Popular, diverse and versatile, perennials fill our gardens with colour and interest in every season, and there's a huge range of easy-to-grow, free-flowering options to choose from. They're available in many shapes and sizes, with flowers in every colour imaginable, and when planted in borders or containers they can perform for many years.  As well as growing upwards and producing flowers and fruits, perennials also grow outwards, but it's something we can use to our advantage, according to Alan.
