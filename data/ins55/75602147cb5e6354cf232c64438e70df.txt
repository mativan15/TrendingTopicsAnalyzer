Erling Haaland already knows the next step he will take in his glittering career, according to his agent Rafaela Pimenta. The Norway international, 22, is one of the most feared strikers in Europe. He joined Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund in the summer after his £51million release clause was activated, leaving many critics stunned by his comparatively low transfer fee. It's emerged this month that Haaland also has a release clause in his City contract, which can be activated in the summer of 2024.
