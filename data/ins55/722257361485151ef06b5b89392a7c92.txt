Hans Niemann, a 19-year-old chess grandmaster, is suing Magnus Carlsen, the world chess champion, for defamation in a lawsuit that seeks US$100 million in damages. This development is the latest in a weeks-long cheating scandal that began when the upstart Niemann defeated Carlsen at the Sinquefield Cup in September.
The lawsuit also names Chess.com and popular streamer Hikaru Nakamura, who is also a chess grandmaster, as defendants, accusing them of slander and libel.
Chess.com, the world's largest online chess site, recently released a 72-page report that accused Niemann of cheating in over 100 games, which they say prompted them to ban him from the million-dollar Chess.
