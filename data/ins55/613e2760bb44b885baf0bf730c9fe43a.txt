The NBA returns on Tuesday with a pair of opening night games, including the defending champion Golden State Warriors at home against the Los Angeles Lakers.
Only four months ago, the NBA Finals ended, so you might be forgiven for not having your basketball betting strategy prepared as the regular season begins.
With sports betting sites, you can place various wagers on the NBA, including the moneyline, spread, game or player prop bets and futures. For example, the Warriors are +600 to repeat as NBA champions, which means a winning futures bet of $100 would net you $600 in profits if Golden State wins it all again.
