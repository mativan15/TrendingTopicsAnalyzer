ASML Holding NV said Wednesday that it expects 'limited' impact from U.S. sanctions on China, as shares of the Dutch tech group surged on better-than-expected results. 'We are continuing to assess and follow the new U.S. export control regulations. Based on our initial assessment, the new restrictions do not amend the rules governing lithography equipment shipped by ASML out of the Netherlands and we expect the direct impact on ASML's overall 2023 shipment plan to be limited,' said President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink, in a statement.
