The Guardians were looking to bleed the clock, the way those old Carolina basketball teams used to. Get a few zeroes against the Yankees. Empty the bullpen.

And then, you never know.
It was a sensible plan.
But then, as Mike Tyson once said: 'Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.'
Giancarlo Stanton punched the Guardians in the mouth.
