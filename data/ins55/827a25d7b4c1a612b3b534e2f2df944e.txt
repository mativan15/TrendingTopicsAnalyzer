Angel Martinez has been an organization favorite since signing with the Guardians for $500,000 out of the Dominican Republic in 2018. In addition to his all-around tools, club officials appreciate the infielder's instincts, work ethic and personality. Despite losing the '20 season to the pandemic, he reached Double-A at age 20 this year.
Now Martinez is in the Arizona Fall League, polishing his game with the Peoria Javelinas. The No. 11 Guardians prospect has gone 9-for-36 (.250) with nine RBIs in his first 10 games while bouncing between third base, shortstop and second base.
