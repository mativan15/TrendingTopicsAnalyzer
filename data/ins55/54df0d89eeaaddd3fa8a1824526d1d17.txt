WASHINGTON – Cindy Wilker, a retired Marine who jokingly describes herself as an "angry old lesbian," isn't easily offended – or pushed around.

But the 62-year-old Floridian was dumbstruck when a florist declined to sell her roses she hoped to buy for the woman she has loved for decades. She left the shop in tears.

"When she realized who they were for I could see that it was not going to happen. She said, 'What are you?'" Wilker recalled. "Every time now when I walk into a store I wonder, are they going to say something? Are they going to embarrass me?"

Seven years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in a watershed civil rights case, business owners and LGBTQ rights groups remain locked in a battle over whether businesses that sell goods and services to the public may reject LGBTQ couples as customers based on religious objections – particularly when matrimonial services for same-sex weddings are involved.
