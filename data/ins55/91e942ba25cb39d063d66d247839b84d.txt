TikTok has partnered with talent show host and music executive Simon Cowell and producer Max Martin to launch StemDrop, a new way of releasing music that could revolutionise the industry.

StemDrop is a different platform that lets artists publish the stems of their songs alongside full single releases.

Stems are the individual instrument tracks for each song. The significance of putting out the stems separately from the single will allow other people to immediately create remixes and samples from the new track.
