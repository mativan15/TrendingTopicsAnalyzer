The news that Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Cody Fajardo had been benched ahead of the two most important games of the season spread like wildfire across the province.
With only two games left in the season and the Riders fighting for a playoff birth, it comes as a shock for many fans that Mason Fine would be getting his first career start.'I don't think it's the end of the Cody Fajardo football book, but it might just be the end of a chapter,' Fajardo said at practice after the news broke.
