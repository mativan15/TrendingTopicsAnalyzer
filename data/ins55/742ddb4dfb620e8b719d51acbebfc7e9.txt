Thousands of lonely pensioners risk receiving a criminal record and £1,000 fines because of the Scottish government's chaotic handling of the census, a charity has warned.
Age Scotland said many older citizens are struggling to fill in the online forms because they don't have access to a computer or have anyone around to help them.
The latest government figures show that 350,000 people (12 per cent of Scottish households) have yet to complete the forms.  
Current legislation makes it a criminal offence to not return a census form, and it carries a fine of £1,000.
