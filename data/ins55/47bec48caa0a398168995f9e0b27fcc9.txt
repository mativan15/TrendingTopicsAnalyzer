DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (CBS) -- A Downers Grove couple talked to CBS 2 Monday after a pickup plowed right through their house last week. As CBS 2's Marissa Perlman reported, the couple said they are lucky to be alive after the incident. On Monday, three days after the accident, the house on Briargate Drive was boarded up. Caution tape remained strung up, tire marks ripped through the grass from after the pickup truck was hauled away, and there were still huge piles of debris in front of the house. And residents Scott Pillsbury and Niki Jones were shaken up as they came to terms with what happened.
