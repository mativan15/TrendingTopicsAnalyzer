Yeah, no, there's nothing to this. But we're going to share a quick laugh together anyway. If the New Orleans Saints take care of business against the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night (and our staff picks like them to do just that), it won't be because Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray is in a rush to get home and log onto his Xbox Live account. It'll be because they put in the work to prepare for this game and executed a well-thought-out plan to outplay Arizona.

Still, it's a lot funnier to joke about the alternative.
