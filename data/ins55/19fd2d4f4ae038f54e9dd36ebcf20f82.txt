By Prakash VLBENGALURU: The housing sector had taken a big hit during the pandemic and Mysuru was no exception. Now, with covid cases being low and people returning to their work places, the demand for rental houses is also steadily rising.As a result of this, many house-owners are able to take off the 'To-Let' boards that were hanging outside the homes for long. Real estate developers said that many software engineers, construction labourers, garment workers, auto, cab drivers and others who had either relocated back to their hometowns or had lost their jobs and moved to their villages had done so by giving up their rented houses.
