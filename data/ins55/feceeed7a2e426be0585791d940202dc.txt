Roofstock, a Bay Area real estate tech startup valued at nearly $2 billion, said Thursday that it would lay off 20% of its staff — days after the company announced that it conducted its first NFT sale of a single-family home.

A spokesperson for the unicorn company told SFGATE Thursday that it conducted layoffs, but did not specify if employees will receive severance pay or health care benefits — an industry standard — or how many employees were affected.

Roofstock's business model is 'remote real estate investing,' essentially letting people buy single-family properties in smaller, less expensive areas to rent out.
