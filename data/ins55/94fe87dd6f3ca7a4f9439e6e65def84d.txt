urfinguss/iStock via Getty Images After perking up on Tuesday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) is threatening to drop below $30K, another sign that the world's largest cryptocurrency doesn't appear to be a hedge against more traditional assets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down 5.4% midday Wednesday at the same time that the three major U.S. stock averages are each down at least 1% — the Dow -1.0%, Nasdaq -1.2%, and S&P 500 -1.2%. Market volatility continued after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that an economic "hurricane" is approaching, citing risks from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle.
