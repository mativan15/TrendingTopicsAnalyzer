June 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs to raise rates by a half-of-a-percentage point at each of its next two meetings, and then assess if inflation has moderated enough to slow the pace of rate hikes or if it needs to jack them up further, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said on Thursday.And while that process could be "painful" for households and businesses, she said, it would be worse to allow inflation - now running at a 40-year high and more than three times the Fed's 2% goal - to continue to sap buying power and undermine economic momentum.
