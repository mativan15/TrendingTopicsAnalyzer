Having a little water park fun doesn't have to depend on good weather. Safe from the crisp bite of fall air or winter snow, or even just a rainy summer day, there are all-weather water parks all around the nation that make for the perfect escape.

From hotels with indoor water parks that are totally over-the-top to ski resorts that double as water parks — so you can spend the morning on the slopes and warm up in the afternoon with some extra thrills — these parks offer fun for every age.
