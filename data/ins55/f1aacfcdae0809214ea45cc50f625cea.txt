Arizona Cardinals star receiver DeAndre Hopkins gave a cryptic response this week when asked to explain how he tested positive last year for a strange, steroid-like drug called ostarine.'It'll come out after the year,' Hopkins said Tuesday.He previously said he didn't know how he could have ingested the substance, which triggered a six-game suspension for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.After serving his punishment, he finally will return to action Thursday night against New Orleans.
