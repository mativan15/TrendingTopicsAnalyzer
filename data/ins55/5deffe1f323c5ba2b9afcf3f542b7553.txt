Jun. 4—One of Oklahoma's premiere outdoor events gets underway Monday at Crystal Beach Stadium.

The Woodward Elks Rodeo turns 92 this year and remains Oklahoma's longest running PRCA rodeo and in recent years has turned into one of the richest.

Technically, the rodeo dates are Wednesday through Saturday (June 8-11), but there are events all week long at either the main stadium or the roundup club arena just to the north.

Many of the current world champions or event leaders are expected to compete here this week along with numerous former world champions and national qualifiers among the hundreds of entrants.
