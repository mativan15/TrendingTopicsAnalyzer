A GoFundMe campaign is aiming to raise funds to recover the remains of actress Megan Hilty's family members who died in a plane crash in Washington last month.
 
On Sept. 4, a float plane carrying 10 people crashed in Puget Sound, killing everyone on board. Days later, Megan confirmed that her sister Lauren Hilty, brother-in-law Ross Mickel, and their son Remy, were among those dead. Lauren was eight months pregnant with her son, Luca, at the time of the crash.
 
Megan and her sister, Kristen Hilty Eaton, created a GoFundMe page on Wednesday to raise money to help locate the remains of Lauren, Remy, and Luca after they said Ross and other victims were recovered in the days following the crash.
