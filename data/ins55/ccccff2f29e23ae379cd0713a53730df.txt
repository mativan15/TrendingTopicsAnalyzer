Amir, a 28-year-old protester in northwestern Iran, has no doubt about what the country has experienced in the last few weeks.'What we witnessed in this one month is the explosion of Iranian people's anger caused by oppression, discrimination, corruption and the bad economic situation that has been imposed on us for 43 years.' The young man from the city of Tabriz said the Islamic Republic has tried in the 'worst and most brutal way possible' to suppress this 'revolutionary movement,' but it has not succeeded yet.
