European stocks surged at the open on Monday, extending a rally from last week as healthy US data and the easing of COVID measures in Shanghai and Beijing boosted sentiment.

In London, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) pushed 0.4% higher after the opening bell, while France's CAC (^FCHI) and Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.7%.

"Last week saw the FTSE 100 post its biggest weekly gain since March, while markets in the US saw the S&P 500 and Dow post their best weeks since November 2020, breaking a run of seven successive weekly losses, as well as wiping out the losses of the previous three weeks," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
