By Sarah TateOctober 18, 2022A popular bakery in East Nashville is preparing to close its doors for good at the end of the month after serving Music City for nearly 20 years. Sweet 16th Bakery has been serving up tasty treats for the past 18 years thanks to husband and wife co-owners Dan and Ellen Einstein. However, after Dan passed away earlier this year, Ellen has made the decision to close up shop and start "a new chapter" after months of running the business by herself, per WKRN. In an emotional announcement shared to the bakery's social media, Ellen described her reasoning for closing Sweet 16th and what it has meant to her serving her community for nearly two decades.
