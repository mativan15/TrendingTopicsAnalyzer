Published June 4, 2022 11:46am EDT The Washington Post attempted to clean up a mess made by Taylor Lorenz this week, publishing a lengthy correction on a report she had written. But it now appears the correction needs a correction. Lorenz, The Post's star "internet culture" columnist, landed herself in hot water for claiming in her story on Thursday about content creators who thrived during the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial that she had reached out for comment to two YouTubers, "LegalBytes" host Alyte Mazeika and an anonymous user named ThatUmbrellaGuy.
