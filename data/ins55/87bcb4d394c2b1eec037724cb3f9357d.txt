Read the latest on where the Detroit Lions will be picking in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft.

Through their first five games of the 2022 NFL season, the Lions haven't experienced many positives.

They sit at 1-4 and in last place in the NFC North division coming out of the bye week, and will look to get back on the right track in Week 7 against the Dallas Cowboys.

It'll be easier than done for Detroit, with its well-documented defensive struggles and Cowboys Pro Bowl signal-caller Dak Prescott expected to start under center for the first time since Week 1.
