French mogul Bernard Arnault, the second richest person in the world by virtue of his stake in luxury goods maker LVMH, said he sold his private plane after Twitter users started tracking his flights online.
Arnault, the 73-year-old co-founder of the Paris-based conglomerate that sells popular luxury brands such as handbag maker Louis Vuitton and the wine and spirits giant Moët Hennessy, told French-language Radio Classique that he has been renting private jets after selling the company-owned aircraft.
