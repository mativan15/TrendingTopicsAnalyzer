The British energy giant has pledged to inject the money into the UK's energy network by 2030 to boost "long-term security". It comes as industry regulator Ofgem warned last week the energy price cap (maximum annual tariff) is expected to soar to £2,800, which could push 12 million people into fuel poverty. Louise Kingham, Senior Vice President for Europe at BP, told The Telegraph that the £18billion investment amounts to £640 invested for 'every home in the land'.She added that while this will not instantly bring down bills, it can help to alleviate the soaring energy costs further down the line.
