Hasbro shares tumbled to their lowest level since 2015 after the toymaker and entertainment company reported a sharp drop in quarterly revenue and earnings results below Wall Street expectations.

	Midway through the trading day, Hasbro shares were down 3% at $65.76 on above-average volume.

Inflation and consumer sensitivity to price played a key role in the company's 15% earnings slide in the quarter ending September 30, compared with the year-earlier period, and the company is also battling foreign currency fluctuations and supply-chain issues.
