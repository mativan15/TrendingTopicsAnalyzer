Olympic Games bronze medallist David Nyika has knocked out Titi Motusaga in an all-Kiwi professional cruiserweight boxing fight in Melbourne. Hamilton-based Nyika, 27, felled Auckland-domiciled Motusaga in the second round. Nyika suffered a cut under the eye in a head clash, but Nyika was unfazed, winning with a short right hand right to Motusaga's chin. It was the fourth knockout win of Nyika's promising pro career, which began in 2021 after he left the amateur ranks following his Tokyo Olympic bronze and Commonwealth Games gold medals in 2014 and 2018.
