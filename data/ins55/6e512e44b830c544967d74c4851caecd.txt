The cost of living in Chinese metropolises is under scrutiny again after a viral video documented the extreme measures three young men in Shanghai took to save money. The unnamed men decided to share a tiny flat for 900 yuan (S$179) a month that only featured a toilet, a tiny bedroom and a balcony. It also has basic furnishing like a single bed, a wardrobe, a desk set and air conditioning. According to the video, posted by Star Video, the three men worked at different times of the day, which they said would allow them to use the bed while the others were gone.
