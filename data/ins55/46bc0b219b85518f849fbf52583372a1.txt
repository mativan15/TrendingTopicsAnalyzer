The creative participation of a group of migrant labourers has made the Labour department's ongoing ‘Kavach' awareness campaign against substance abuse a crowd-puller in Kozhikode district. A team of 11 migrant workers trained in presenting a skit against drug abuse is the main attraction of the intensive four-day campaign.The 10-minute skit in Hindi will be staged in about 20 locations. Singers, dancers, and mimicry artistes from various States will be part of the campaign. Local residents who have gained popularity as stage performers will also join the show.
