Waze will no longer be an accused in the case and will be considered a prosecution witness, whose testimony can be used against his co-accused including former state home minister Anil Deshmukh.
The CBI had last week given its nod to Waze's plea stating that he fulfils the requirements and conditions in law to become an approver. Waze, who is lodged in the Taloja Central Jail, was produced before court via videoconferencing Wednesday. Special Judge DP Shingade told him that his plea for grant of pardon has been accepted subject to conditions.
