The 'Hart of Dixie' actress was ordered by a court in April to pay Kyle Newman $1,000 a month in spousal support and $429 a month in child support for their sons James, eight, and seven-year-old Leo but the 'Barely Lethal' director has filed legal documents claiming she hasn't handed anything over. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Kyle claimed he put his career as a writer and filmmaker on hold to be a stay-at-home dad and has now found himself deep in debt and having to take money from his retirement fund in order to stay afloat.
