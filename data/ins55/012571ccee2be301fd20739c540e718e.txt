'I'm grateful for the opportunity to respond to and refute the anonymous allegations made against me, which I categorically deny,' Cole said in a statement released by the team in announcing his reinstatement. 'I'm looking forward to returning to the ice with my teammates and will have no further comments on this matter going forward.'

The Lightning suspended Cole on Oct. 9 pending the investigation into the allegations that he sexually abused a woman when she was a minor.

Among the allegations posted anonymously to Twitter by an account created last month, the person said Cole pressured her into having sex multiple times when she was a minor after he had reached the NHL.
