Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian band which won this year's Eurovision Song Contest, have sold their trophy for $900,000 (£720,000; €839,000) to raise money for the war in Ukraine.

The crystal microphone was auctioned on Facebook, with the aim of buying drones for Ukraine's military effort.

Band leader Oleh Psiuk told the BBC's Sophie Raworth why he decided to part with the prize.
