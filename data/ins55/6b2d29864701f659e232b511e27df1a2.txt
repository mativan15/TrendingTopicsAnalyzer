 Google is delivering an emotional gut punch to the forgetful as it will soon remove location-based reminders.The company didn't make a public announcement, but some eagle-eyed users noticed the change in the Google Assistant Help page (opens in new tab). For those who don't know or remember, you were able to create reminders to yourself according to a location. As an example, you could set a reminder to buy a gallon of milk at the supermarket, and if Google Assistant on your phone (opens in new tab) detects you driving past one, it'll let you know.
