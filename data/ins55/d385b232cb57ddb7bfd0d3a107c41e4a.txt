South Korea is eager to see a rebound in tourism from Japan to the pre-coronavirus level. These expectations come as border control measures have been lifted. Visitors from Japan are now allowed into South Korea without visas until October 31. From October 30, flights between Tokyo's Haneda and Seoul's Gimpo airports are expected to double to 56 round trips a week. The number of foreign tourists to South Korea has been gradually increasing. Quarantine measures for entrants have ended, as the PCR testing upon arrival rule was dropped October 1.
