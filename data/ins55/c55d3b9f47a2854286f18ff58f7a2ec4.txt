Also, if the SEC is truly the best conference, it won't hurt their chances of making the College Football Playoff and they'll likely get 1 if not 2 teams in because they'll play against less cupcakes and have better Strength of Schedule. Plus, think about the rivalries; Texas vs. OKLA and A&M every year? That would be incredible for College Football and the only downside is for the lower tier SEC teams trying to reach Bowl eligibility, which no longer holds the prestige it once did.
