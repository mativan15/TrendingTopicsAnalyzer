Washington — Properties owned by the Trump Organization charged the U.S. Secret Service rates that far exceeded the government rates during former President Donald Trump's presidency, Secret Service documents obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee show.  
 

 
 
 In a letter to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chair of the Oversight panel, revealed the rates charged to the agency tasked with protecting the president and his family members were as high as $1,185 per room per night in at least one instance, which Maloney said is more than five times the government rate.
