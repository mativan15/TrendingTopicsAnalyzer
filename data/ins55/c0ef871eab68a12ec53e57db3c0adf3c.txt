Federal prosecutors recommended Steve Bannon get six months in jail for defying a subpoena from the congressional probe of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. They also sought a $200,000 fine for Bannon, who was a senior advisor in former President Donald Trump's White House. The DOJ recommended the maximum fine and top sentence under the federal guidelines range because of Bannon's consistent "bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt." Bannon's lawyers asked the federal court for a sentence of probation.
