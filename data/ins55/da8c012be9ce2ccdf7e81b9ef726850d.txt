Donald Trump has said the US should prioritise funding for school security over sending money to Ukraine.Speaking at the National Rifle Association (NRA) annual convention in Texas, the former US President said the country 'should be building safe schools' before sending military aid sent to Ukraine.The pro-gun meeting comes just days after the Uvalde mass school shooting in which 21 people, including 19 children, were killed by a teenage gunman.'Before we nation-build the rest of the world, we should be building safe schools for our own children in our own nation,' he said in Friday's speech.
