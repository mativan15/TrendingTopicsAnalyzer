By Colin Kellaher Levi Strauss & Co. on Wednesday said its board approved the repurchase of up to $750 million in stock. Levi said the buyback program has no expiration date. The San Francisco jeans maker, which has nearly 97 million shares outstanding, sports a market capitalization of roughly $7.2 billion. The company said it believes its strong profitable growth and return on invested capital will generate ample free cash flow to fund investments in its business and drive higher shareholder returns with an annual target of 10% to 12%.
