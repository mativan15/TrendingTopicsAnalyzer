Former President Trump says he enjoyed rapper Ye's recent sit-down interview with Tucker Carlson, the top rated primetime host on Fox News.

Trump was pressed this week by radio host Larry O'Connor about recent anti-Semitic comments the rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, has made online and in other media appearances.

'He's been saying some really offensive things lately about your own son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and about Jewish people, Jewish Americans writ large. Could you react to that? Because is this the guy that you knew?' the radio host asked Trump.
