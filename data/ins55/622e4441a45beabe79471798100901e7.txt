Shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +0.84% rallied 1.1% in morning trading Friday to buck the selloff in the broader stock market, and enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -1.12% gainers. Analyst Michael Feniger at BofA Securities reiterated the neutral rating on the construction and mining equipment company (CAT) but raised the stock price target to $224 from $215. Feniger said a call with Caterpillar Group President of Resource Industries Denise Johnson was "encouraging," as there were "no signs of a slowdown from customers," partnerships were unlocking new opportunities and technology investments were bearing fruit.
