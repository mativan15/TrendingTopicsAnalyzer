No. 14 Syracuse (6-0, 3-0 ACC) at No. 5 Clemson (7-0, 4-0), Saturday, noon (ABC)

Line: Clemson by 13 1/2, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

Series record: Clemson leads 8-2.

WHAT'S AT STAKE?

A spot in the ACC championship game and, possibly, a College Football Playoff berth. Clemson wants to keep on track for both with a fifth straight win over the Orange. But while a Syracuse win would be its best start since its last undefeated season in 1987 — and mark it the favorite to play for an ACC title in December — it would likely end the chances for a conference team to reach the CFP four-team field.
