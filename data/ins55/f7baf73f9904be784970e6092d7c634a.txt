The labor group seeking to represent Apple store workers in Atlanta has withdrawn its request for a union vote, citing intimidation, reports say.

The vote, slated to take place June 2, could have ushered in the first unionized Apple store in the US.

The decision comes days after audio leaked showing a top Apple exec expressing her concern about unionizing to the company's retail staff.
