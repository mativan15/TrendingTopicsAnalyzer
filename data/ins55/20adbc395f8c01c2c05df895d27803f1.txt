‘Definition Please' (2022)

Stream it on Netflix.

Boasting the endorsements of Mindy Kaling (an executive producer) and Ava DuVernay (whose company, Array, distributed), this tender but tough comedy-drama marks the arrival of a major new talent. Sujata Day writes, directs and stars as Monica, who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee at 8 years old; now she's in her mid-20s and increasingly feeling that she'll never top that achievement. What begins as a fairly formulaic coming-of-age tale takes a surprisingly moving turn to the serious as Day focuses on Monica's tempestuous relationship with her estranged brother (Ritesh Rajan), and while the results are a little uneven, she carefully (thankfully) avoids easy answers and pat solutions.
