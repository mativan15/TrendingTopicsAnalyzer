Iman Vellani of Disney Plus' 'Ms. Marvel' donned the costume of the titular hero long before portraying her on screen in her upcoming acting debut.

The photo of a then-15-year-old Vellani on Halloween was spotted in Disney Plus' newly released 'A Fan's Guide to Ms. Marvel,' a short behind-the-scenes special for the upcoming series. It was then shared across Reddit, where Marvel fans geeked out that she was also a fan of the character prior to landing the role.

In the video, the now-19-year-old actor reveals that she made the outfit after purchasing the blue dress from a thrift store.
