(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were firmly in positive territory on Tuesday on rising hopes that upbeat corporate earnings would help eclipse the current economic gloom, with a fiscal policy reversal in Britain also boosting risk appetite.

Big U.S. banks have kicked off the quarterly earnings season on a largely positive note, with Bank of America's results underpinning a rally in stocks on Monday.

The reversal of parts of a controversial UK fiscal plan that had roiled bond markets also aided sentiment.
