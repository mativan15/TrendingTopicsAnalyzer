Much of the landscape was ringbarked for timber more than a century ago and sold off to warm 100,000-plus workers on the Snowy Hydro scheme. But now beef farmer Tim Annand is trying to turn back the clock. "I'm out to revitalise a country that's been fairly exhausted," he tells AAP of the grand designs for his Old Bredbo property, south of Canberra.
