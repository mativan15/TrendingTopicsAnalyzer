Not only did last week's by for the Oregon Ducks provide the team and players an opportunity to sit back for a week and recover after the opening half of the season, but it also allowed us at Ducks Wire to do the same, focusing on the first six weeks as a whole rather than getting into the nitty gritty of game previews.
That's all behind us, though, and we are as excited as ever to be back together and getting ready for what looks like an incredible matchup between the No. 9 Oregon Ducks and No. 10 UCLA Bruins.
