The Bahujan Samaj Party will not contest the bypoll for the Rampur parliamentary seat and also not support any party on this seat. By-elections for the Rampur and Azamgarh seats will be held on June 23. The polls have been necessitated after resignations of Azam Khan and SP President Akhilesh Yadav, who won the assembly polls. In a statement issued after a two-day party review meeting here, the BSP said, "The party will not contest the Lok Sabha by-elections scheduled on June 23 from the Rampur seat as we have to work on this seat to make it strong.
