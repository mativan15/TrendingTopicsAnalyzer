Manchester United know they need a new striker to ease the goalscoring burden on Cristiano Ronaldo. And that's why they're targeting Darwin Nunez, who tore up the Primeira Liga with Benfica last season. The Red Devils seem to think he'll be the perfect striker to kickstart the Erik ten Hag revolution as they strive for better days at Old Trafford.Nunez was relatively unknown before the beginning of the season.But the Benfica star is already on track to become a household name after scoring a remarkable 34 goals across all competitions last season.
