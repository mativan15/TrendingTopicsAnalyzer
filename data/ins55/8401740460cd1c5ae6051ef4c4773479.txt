Home Secretary Suella Braverman launched an attack on the "Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati" as she defended the government's controversial Public Order Bill.The legislation attempts to crack down on disruptive protests, including a new offence of obstructing major transport networks.
Lock-on tactics have been repeatedly employed by groups such as Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil, with protesters gluing or otherwise attaching themselves to roads or other areas to cause disruption.Referring to the disruption recently seen - which has included two demonstrators attaching themselves to the masts of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge - Ms Braverman gave a long list of who was to blame.
