Jun. 5—Susan E. Miller has lived in Germantown almost her entire life, and she has watched as it has grown and changed. But it still has "a lot of small-town touches," she said.

"I like the fact that it's small, and you know everyone and everyone knows you," she said.

Miller not only knows her neighbors, she cares about them and about bringing them together. That's what she does each year as president of the Germantown Pretzel Festival committee.

"My community is really important to me," she said.
