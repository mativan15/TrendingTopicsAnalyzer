The state Senate has passed the so-called Clean Slate Act, which would seal the records of convicted criminals. New Yorkers would get their records automatically sealed three years from sentencing for misdemeanors and seven years for felonies as long as they don't commit more crimes. Records would not be sealed for time in prison. Supporters say the bill would allow people with records to get jobs, homes, and support their families. The Business Council of New York State and local chambers of commerce have endorsed the bill.
