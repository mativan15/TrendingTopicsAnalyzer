OSLO/ESBJERG, Denmark (Reuters) - Northern European countries are discussing plans to create a common power grid under the North Sea to connect future offshore wind farms as they seek to strengthen energy security, but the ambitious proposal faces financing and regulatory challenges.

European nations have announced pledges to build dizzying amounts of offshore wind farms, spurred partly by the need to cut heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.
