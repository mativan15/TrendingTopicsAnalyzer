People in jobs on lower incomes are taking the biggest hit from high levels of inflation and central bank efforts to contain it, one economist says. Stats NZ said on Tuesday that CPI increased by an annual rate of 7.2% in the September quarter, barely less than the 7.3% the previous quarter. Economists had predicted a bigger drop, and clear signs that inflation was falling. Now, some are predicting there could be another peak yet to come. Economist Brad Olsen said, while people receiving a benefit would have their income adjusted in line with general wage inflation, and those on higher incomes could probably cope, there would be a squeezed 'lower middle' feeling the pain.
