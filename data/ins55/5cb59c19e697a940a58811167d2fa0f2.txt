Silicon Valley's unemployment rate dropped to 2.1% in September, slightly less than it was in August and hits the same place it was in July, according to an analysis released Friday by Joint Venture Silicon Valley.

The unemployment rate declined 0.2% from August to September, according to a report from the local think tank's Institute for Regional Studies. Putting that into people terms, the number of unemployed individuals dropped by nearly 3,100, which in turn means that the total number of unemployed workers in Silicon Valley is at its lowest level since May.
