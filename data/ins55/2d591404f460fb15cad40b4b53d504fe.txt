Hello there. I'm a tech writer, and like all tech writers I spend most of my time lying flat on my back making snow angels in piles of high-end consumer electronics, like the woman on the American Beauty poster, except with old MP3 players and HDMI cables instead of rose petals.As a tech writer, I've also developed a keen sense for a good deals and when they might appear. Given how expensive most new technology is, it's especially important you feel confident that you're paying a reasonable price for your new toys, and that what you're buying is going to last longer than the time it takes to update the firmware.
