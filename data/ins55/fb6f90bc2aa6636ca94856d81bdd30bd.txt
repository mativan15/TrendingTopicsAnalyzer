It's like something pulled straight from a sci-fi plot – the ability to unlock doors using a microchip implanted in your hand.
But for one US couple, it's part of their day-to-day life.
TikToker and self-professed 'innovator,' Burgundy Waller (or @Chipgirlhere) took to the platform on Tuesday to detail how their microchips work.
The footage shows the woman walking through her huge modern house, unlocking doors by waving her hand over a sensor.
'I have a chip in my hand that's used as a key to unlock everything in our house,' she explains.
