Ed Sheeran has revealed he 'started writing' the James Bond theme song for the most recent film, No Time To Die, before he was overlooked for Billie Eilish.

The 31-year-old British singer suggested a last-minute change in directors for Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as 007 saw his involvement on the soundtrack canned.

'They changed directors and then they just changed scripts and that was it. We had done all the meetings, I started writing it,' Sheeran told That Peter Crouch podcast.



English director Danny Boyle, 66, was originally in the director's seat for No Time To Die, before he dropped out in August 2018 due to 'creative differences', with American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga, 45, replacing him.
