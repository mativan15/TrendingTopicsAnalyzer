Insiders who bought US$105k worth of Cue Biopharma, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:CUE) stock at an average buy price of US$3.75 over the last year may be disappointed by the recent 16% decrease in the stock. This is not good as insiders invest based on expectations that their money will appreciate over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their original investment is now worth only US$72k.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
