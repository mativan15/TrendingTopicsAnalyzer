At a recent meeting for conservative Michigan women, the executive director of a far-right group claimed that they are now directly involved with a GOP governor candidate's campaign.The speaker, Tammy Clark, is the executive director of Stand Up Michigan (SUM), a group that rose to prominence amid anti-government protests, particularly those tied to Michigan's anti-COVID measures. Clark has personally fundraised for Jan. 6 rioters and boasted about doing karaoke last December with Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers leader currently on trial for seditious conspiracy.
