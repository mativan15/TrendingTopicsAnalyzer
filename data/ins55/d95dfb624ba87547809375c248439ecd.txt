NASCAR driver Brad Keselowski roared up to Elk Grove High School on Monday in his No. 6 Ford Mustang, spinning the car in a tight circle to announce his arrival.

Keselowski, a former NASCAR Cup Series champion, will race on the streets of Chicago next year, under the sponsorship of Elk Grove Village. The Chicago Street Course NASCAR race, set for July 2, will bring stock car racing to a 2.2-mile course on Michigan Avenue, DuSable Lake Shore Drive and around Grant Park, with the start and finish line at Buckingham Fountain.
