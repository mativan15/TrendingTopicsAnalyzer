After taking our breaths away in her gold gilded Sabyasachi structured saree at this year's Met Gala, Natasha Poonawalla is back at it again, looking as stunning as ever, in not one, but with two luxurious looks this time. For her first look, Poonawalla chose this statement metal mesh mini dress from Fendace, which is a part of the Fendi by Versace capsule collection. The dazzling pink-hued dress also features crystal embellished FF and V logo motifs, along with crystal embellished Fendace hardware at the shoulder straps.
