Justin Sullivan Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares rose on Thursday as Piper Sandler upgraded the IT services giant, noting there is the potential for improving margins now that operating margins have slid to an eight-year low. Analyst Brent Bracelin raised his rating to neutral from underweight, noting that operating margins are below 40% and gross margins are at 74.5%, a move exacerbated by the Cerner acquisition and the company's continued transition to the cloud. There is light at the end of the tunnel, however, the analyst said.
