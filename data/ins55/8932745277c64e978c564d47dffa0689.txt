Sony PlayStation 5: Sony PS5 units are coming soon to Flipkart. More stock for the popular Sony console is set to arrive on the ecommerce platform in both its disc and digital variants later today. Flipkart has already listed both variants of the console as ‘coming soon'.
Weirdly enough, the PS5 listings are only visible on the Flipkart app as of writing this story, and don't show up on browsers. Regardless, the stock refresh is sure to get gamers across the country excited.
Even two years after its official launch, the Sony PS5 remains an elusive console for most interested buyers.
