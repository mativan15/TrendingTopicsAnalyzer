AgenciesTamil action-spy movie, Sardar is getting rave reviews from all quarters. It features Karthi, Suriya's brother, in the lead role.

Sardar was released theatrically on October 21, 2022, coinciding with the Diwali festivities. Moviegoers have hailed this spy thriller as a blockbuster. However, despite getting rave reviews, Sardar's box office collection on day 1 did not live up to expectations.
