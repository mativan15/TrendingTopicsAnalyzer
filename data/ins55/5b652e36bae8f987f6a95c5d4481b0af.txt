Sending mail will soon cost more as the U.S. Postal Service plans yet another round of price hikes on postage.

The cost of Forever stamps and other postage is set to increase on Jan. 22, 2023, USPS announced in an Oct. 7 news release. Affected postage will see a 4.2% jump in price, a move officials said is necessary to keep up with inflation.

For instance, the price of a first-class Mail Forever stamp will increase by 3 cents to 63 cents by early next year, the postal service said. Consumers can also expect to pay 60 cents for 1-ounce metered mail and 48 cents to send a domestic postcard.
