Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received medical clearance to fully participate in practice this week, coach Mike McCarthy said Wednesday.

McCarthy said Prescott threw Tuesday after a 'regeneration day' Monday. Prescott will participate in the team's 70-play mock game late this afternoon with a workout following that.

'We'll probably throw somewhere between 40 and 50 balls,' McCarthy said, via Todd Archer of ESPN.
