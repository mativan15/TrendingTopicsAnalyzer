A WOMAN, 32, explained that she was so fed up of her husband, 30, sitting on his phone all day rather than look for a job, that she refused to give him the wifi password.
The wife explained that she thought internet access was a privilege and he hadn't earned that as he wasn't chipping in for the bills.

She said she was frustrated as three months had gone by since he was fired from his last position and she felt he'd done nothing to find more work.
