Liz Truss held a crunch meeting at No10 with members of her Cabinet as she tried to cling to power on Monday evening. Five Tory MPs have publically called for her to resign after her former Chancellor's disastrous mini-Budget caused widespread market turmoil. Ms Truss swerved a House of Commons grilling on her decision to sack Kwasi Kwarteng and sent Penny Mordaunt instead.The Commons Leader refused several times to say exactly where Ms Truss was that kept her from answering Labour's Urgent Question - but it was later revealed she had been in a ‘pre-planned' meeting with Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs.
