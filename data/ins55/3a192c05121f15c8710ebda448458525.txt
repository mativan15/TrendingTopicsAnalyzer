Australia says it will no longer recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing a decision taken by the government of former Prime Minister Scott Morrison in 2018.
'Today the Government has reaffirmed Australia's previous and longstanding position that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved as part of any peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people,' Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement.
'This reverses the Morrison Government's recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
