The Delhi government's planning department has issued a notice to Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDCD) vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah, citing 'misuse of public office' and asking him to explain his position in the matter.
The notice comes after BJP West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma filed a complaint against Shah, accusing him of acting as AAP's official spokesperson while holding the post of DDCD vice-chairperson. A similar complaint was also given to L-G V K Saxena. 
In his complaint submitted in September, Verma said Shah while working as DDCD vice-chairperson 'acted as official spokesperson of AAP for political gains, which is in violation of established procedures'.
