Oct. 22—Brad Nadeau doesn't consider himself a big hockey fan, but he's certainly a fan of hockey fans.

Nadeau's restaurant, Stars & Stripes Brewing Co., opened in Portland last spring. The brewpub sits at the corner of Cross and Spring streets, within sight of and just a few hundred feet from the Cross Insurance Arena, where the Maine Mariners host their first game of the 2022-23 season on Saturday.

Nadeau, who also operates a brewpub in Freeport, said he initially received a boost of customers when the Mariners still had a few games in the 2021-22 season.
