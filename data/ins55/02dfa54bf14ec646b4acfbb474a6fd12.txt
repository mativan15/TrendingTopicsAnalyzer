Blink Charging could bring an electric vehicle charging station factory to South Florida.

The Miami Beach company (Nasdaq: BLNK) is scouting locations for a 200,000-square-foot manufacturing facility that will be staffed by an estimated 300 workers. Blink Charging, an EV charging station provider, retained real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield for the search and has narrowed the site selection to Florida, Texas, Tennessee and South Carolina. The planned facility will produce at least 50,000 EV chargers a year.
