An Armed Forces of Canada Boeing C-17A Globemaster III aircraft arrived in Haiti Saturday, delivering the first four of more than a dozen new armored vehicles for the Haiti National Police. The vehicles are among 18 Haiti's government purchased commercially from a Canadian-based firm over the summer but for inexplicable reasons were delayed getting to the Caribbean nation. The government of Canada, which had guided Haiti through its purchase, later stepped in to ensure delivery of the vehicles. Saturday's flight is part of a stepped-up effort by both Canada and the United States, which also flew in three additional armored vehicles later Saturday, to provide the ill-equipped Haiti National Police with badly needed security assistance to confront powerful gangs.
