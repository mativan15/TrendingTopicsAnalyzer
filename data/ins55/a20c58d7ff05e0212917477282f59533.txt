The Cessna Citation XLS Gen2 has a large cabin, transducer sound system and customizable interiors.

The model is completely sold out and costs over $15 million.

I toured the jet while it was on display in Geneva and was surprised by how much can fit inside.

The Cessna Citation XLS Gen2 is Textron Aviation's latest model. I toured the private jet while it was on display at the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition in Geneva last week.
