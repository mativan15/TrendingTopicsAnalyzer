The public debut of Rivian Automotive (RIVN 0.89%) was one of the most anticipated of any electric vehicle company last year. Its initial public offering (IPO) didn't disappoint, as investors bid shares high enough to give the start-up company a valuation of over $150 billion. 
Much has happened in the seven months since that time. Rivian built a large reservation base for its vehicles, and it began production and made its first sales. The stock has also retreated to the level where its market cap is now below $30 billion.
