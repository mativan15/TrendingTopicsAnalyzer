Rob Baxter led Exeter to promotion from the Championship in 2010, winning the European Champions Cup a decade later

Worcester and Wasps should lose their Perpetual Shares in Premiership Rugby after going into administration, says Exeter boss Rob Baxter.

All 13 clubs that started the Premiership season have 'P Shares', entitling them to a slice of Premiership Rugby's central revenues.

Both Wasps and Worcester were 'P Share'-holders in the league.

The pair have been suspended from the Premiership and relegated as a result of their financial problems.
