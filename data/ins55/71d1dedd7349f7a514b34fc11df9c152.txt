Japan's badminton governing body has apologized for a series of scandals and improper conduct involving staff members and published reprimands of its senior officials. But there was no announcement of resignations. The Nippon Badminton Association held a news conference on Friday, attended by President Sekine Yoshio and others. The body published a summary of a third-party inquiry into the scandals, including embezzlement by a former employee. The report said the association's council members abandoned their responsibility by agreeing to compensate for the embezzled money, which totaled about 6.
