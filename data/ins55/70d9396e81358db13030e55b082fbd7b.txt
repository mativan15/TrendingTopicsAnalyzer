A jury is hearing evidence that will determine whether a Hauraki Plains man had murderous intent when he gunned down a rival on a bush-clad Coromandel road. Adrian Reginald George Phillips, 23, is standing trial in the High Court in Hamilton. He is facing one charge of murder in relation to the death of Bayden Williams, 20, who was found dead on the Kopu-Hikuai Rd in Coromandel on the evening of Wednesday, August 5, 2020. It is alleged that Phillips rammed Williams' vehicle off a twisting stretch of road about 5km from Kopu.
