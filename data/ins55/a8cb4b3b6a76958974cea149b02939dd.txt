'Once final details are resolved, and within 60 days of this notice, the parties will file a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement,' the attorneys said in a federal court filing Thursday.

Multiple investors sued Robinhood in several states, mostly alleging restrictions by the trading platform that amounted to a breach of contract, court records show.
