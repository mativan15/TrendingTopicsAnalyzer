May 30—MADISON TWP. -Take a rehabbed small town setting, creative women with an eye for what shoppers want and mix them together for Iron Rose Mercantile — and more.

Lisa Dethlefs and Susan Cox joined forces to create a combined business space coupled with their own shops at 446 Middletown-Eaton Road.

The front of the store features Dethlefs' "boho chic" merchandise including unique recycled projects and in the back behind a huge sliding barn door is Cox's Shade of Chic painting work space for furniture and whole kitchen makeovers.
