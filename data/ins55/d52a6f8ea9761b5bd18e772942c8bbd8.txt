The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering, on Friday announced its decision to free Pakistan from its 'grey list'.
In a statement, FATF welcomed Pakistan's significant progress in improving its anti-money laundering and combating financial terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.
'Pakistan is no longer subject to FATF's increased monitoring process; to continue to work with APG (Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering) to further improve its AML/CFT (anti-money laundering & counter-terrorist financing) system,' it said.
