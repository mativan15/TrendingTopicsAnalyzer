BERLIN (AP) — The head of the United Nations' World Food Program is renewing pressure on oil-rich Persian Gulf countries to give his agency more help to deal with mounting humanitarian crises.

WFP Executive Director David Beasley's comments on Thursday followed a meeting with Development Minister Svenja Schulze of Germany, the agency's second-biggest donor. Schulze also stressed that 'we simply need more countries to give money' as the global food crisis exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine and rising prices grows.
