Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag stated that he would "deal with" Cristiano Ronaldo after that star footballer left Old Trafford before the final whistle in the United's 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Ronaldo, who remained an unused substitute in the match on October 19, was seen walking down the touchline and heading to the tunnel in the final minutes. The 37-year-old Portuguese star watched the goals from Fred and Bruno Fernandes while sitting on the bench. However, Ronaldo decided to walk off the stage when the Manchester United boss did not bring him off the bench.
