Justin Sullivan While the investment community has felt Mr. Market's wrath throughout 2022, shareholders of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have received an extra dose as shares have declined -62.56% YTD. Mr. Market is treating META as a profitless tech company, not as a major component of FAAMG or one of the most profitable companies in the world. Everywhere you look, bear markets can be found from the major indices as the S&P 500 has declined -25.14% and the Nasdaq is down -35.09% to Apple (AAPL) as not even the gold standard could escape the bear market.
