By Reuters Published: 11:15 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:15 EDT, 17 October 2022 Milwaukee Bucks guard/forward Khris Middleton is expected to miss the first few weeks of the regular season as he continues to rehab from offseason wrist surgery, The Athletic reported Monday. Middleton underwent surgery in early July to repair a torn ligament in his left wrist. It was thought at the time he'd be ready for the beginning of the season. A three-time All-Star, Middleton, 30, just completed his 10th NBA season and ninth with the Bucks.
