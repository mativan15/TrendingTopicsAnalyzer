Few shows have inspired the cultural force that Euphoria has in recent years. The hit HBO series follows a group of high school students in a middle class Californian suburb as they navigate relationships, addiction, friendship, identity and trauma.It feels reductive to call it a teen show, as it deftly explores difficult topics, but in the middle of all the darkness, the series celebrates the joy of self-expression through truly euphoric make-up.The make-up looks are intrinsic to the show's moody-yet-whimsical aesthetic as well as the characters' identities, which is what makes them so brilliant: think geometric eyeliner in neon hues, flirty holographic glitter, mini rhinestones, iridescent inner corner accents and natural, glowy skin.
