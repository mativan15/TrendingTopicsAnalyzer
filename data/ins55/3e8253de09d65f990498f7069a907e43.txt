The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has sparked further controversy by declaring that its verdict on the Kamila Valieva doping case will be kept secret. The Russian figure skater, then aged 15, was at the centre of a major storm at the Beijing Winter Olympics this year after it emerged that she failed a pre-Games test.But Rusada is claiming that the age of Valieva, now 16, makes her a 'protected person' under the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code and therefore all elements of the doping investigation — including the outcome — will remain confidential.
