Twitter shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of engaged in 'unlawful conduct' aimed at sowing doubt about his bid to buy the social media company.It is the second lawsuit against the multibillionaire after a complaint was filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this month, with the Orlando Police Pension Fund saying that, under Delaware law, Mr Musk cannot complete the takeover until at least 2025 unless holders of two-thirds of shares not 'owned' by him approved.The lawsuit filed late Wednesday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California claims the billionaire Tesla CEO has sought to drive down Twitter's stock price because he wants to walk away from the deal or negotiate a substantially lower purchase price.
