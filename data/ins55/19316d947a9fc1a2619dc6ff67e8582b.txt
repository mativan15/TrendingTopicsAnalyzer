"When is it time to buy tech? When you stop asking," writes Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy and quantitative strategy, in a recent note to clients.In the June 3 note, Subramanian points out that after the dot-com bubble burst in early 2000 it took several years for tech stocks to finally reach their low point. By then, she says, investors had lost interest in the sector.While tech stocks are in the gutter right now, it doesn't seem like investors are abandoning the sector just yet.
