Internet data use across the Waikato has jumped to record levels, but it's not the big city dwellers leading the charge, it's the country folk who are tapping into technology at faster rates. According to network provider Chorus, data use has more than doubled in some parts of the region compared to pre-Covid levels with the South Waikato seeing a 175% increase in data use and a 124% increase in Waipa since February 2020 (see table below). The average monthly data use for Hamilton residents was 234GB in February 2020, increasing to 369GB in July 2022, an increase of 58%.
