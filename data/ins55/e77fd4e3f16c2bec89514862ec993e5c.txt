Crypto accounted for about one out of every four dollars reported lost, the most out of any other payment method, the FTC said in a report released Friday. The median individual loss was $2,600, and the top cryptocurrencies used to pay scammers included Bitcoin, Tether, and Ether, the FTC said. About half of the people who reported being scammed said it started with an ad, post, or message on a social media platform. Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram all topped the list of social media sites reported as the source of the scams.
