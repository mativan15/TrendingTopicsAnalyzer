Students at Cyril Varney Public School in Sudbury recently held a fundraiser that will allow an organization that serves the homeless to purchase a new stove. Sisters Isabelle and Makenzie Moore presented Bizzzy Bea's with cheque a few days ago. 'Our class together we wanted to do a book fair and we all voted and Bizzzy Bea's won and so we asked our whole school for books and a bunch of donations and we set up and it was really fun selling them and we raised 530 dollars,' says student Isabelle Moore.
