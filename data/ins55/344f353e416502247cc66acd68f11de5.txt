By Reuters Published: 06:59 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 06:59 EDT, 21 October 2022 Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. equity funds saw money inflows for the first time in four weeks in the week to Oct. 19, as strong third-quarter earnings calmed investor fears that rising interest rates would hit corporate profits substantially. U.S. equity funds drew a net $4.57 billion, marking their first weekly inflow since Sept. 21, data from Refinitiv Lipper showed. Better-than-expected quarterly earnings results from companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Netflix Inc and Johnson & Johnson, boosted sentiment in a market that was otherwise worried about rising treasury yields and further rate increases.
