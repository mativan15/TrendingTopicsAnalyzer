Taylor Swift is endorsing late nights with her first original album in two years.

The 11-time Grammy Award winner unveiled her 10th studio album, ' Midnights,' on Friday, following a surprise announcement at this year' s MTV Video Music Awards.

Swift, who is currently in the midst of revisiting her early albums in a bid to regain ownership of the work she released under her former label Big Machine Records, has pivoted from the folk-rock sound of 2020's 'Folklore' and 'Evermore' to something more mainstream.
