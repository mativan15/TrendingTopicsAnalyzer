When the Chicago Bears released linebacker Danny Trevathan and running back Tarik Cohen earlier this offseason, they designated them as post-June 1 cuts to lessen the dead cap hit and free up additional salary cap space.
Those releases have now officially gone into effect, which freed up an additional $7.29 million in cap space.
The Bears currently have $22.21 million in available cap space, which is currently the fifth-most in the NFL. It gives Chicago plenty of breathing room to make moves later this offseason and heading into the 2022 season.
