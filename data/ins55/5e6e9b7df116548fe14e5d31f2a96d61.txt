The Angad Arts Hotel in Grand Center was steeped in pride and emotion Thursday evening as 10 St. Louis-area family businesses were honored for their success.

The 2022 St. Louis Business Journal Family Business Awards drew a crowd of 160 to hear family members from several of the honoree firms make statements reflecting the hard work of prior generations, the inspirations of parents who preceded them, and, in the case of Dr. Jeffrey Dailin of Dalin Dental, a plea that his son and nephew will someday produce a fourth generation dentist to carry on the business.
