By Joe Hoppe Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC on Tuesday reported a 33% rise in third-quarter revenue and said it is guiding for Ebitda to be toward the upper end of market expectations for the year. The price-comparison website said the increase was driven by strong growth in its money and travel channels, and it exceeded its own expectations. Group revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was 101.9 million pounds ($115.7 million), taking the total for the nine months to GBP295.0 million. This compares with GBP76.
