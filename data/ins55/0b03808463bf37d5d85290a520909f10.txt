One of the toughest parts of retirement planning is the fact that there are so many deadlines and limits involved. Miss a deadline, and you're somewhat out of luck. After all, the limits involved make it that much more difficult to catch up later, since it typically has to come at the expense of another time and dollar limited opportunity.
