At least 11 soldiers were killed after two men -- said to be from an unnamed ex-Soviet state -- opened fire at a Russian military training camp in the Belgorod region, near the border with Ukraine, according to state-run media. The incident comes as Russia has intensified its mobilization efforts and already deployed thousands of new recruits into combat.
