Labour is demanding an investigation into claims that government infighting is delaying a programme to refurbish, extend or build 40 NHS hospitals.Boris Johnson announced plans in 2019 to build '40 new hospitals' by 2030, though it later emerged that many of the plans were in fact only renovations of existing facilities.But NHS bosses have complained that trusts are unable to proceed with the work because they are waiting for sign-off from government ministers, with the Treasury reported to be concerned about spiralling costs.
