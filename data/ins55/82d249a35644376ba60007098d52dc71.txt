The FTSE Russell calls this event the annual reconstitution process. It begins with evaluations and "rankings" in May and moves to the June-transition month. For 2022, beginning on June 3rd, the preliminary selection lists are communicated to the markets. Updates are provided following on June 10, 17, and 24th with the reconstituted indexes taking effect after the close on June 24 this year.
