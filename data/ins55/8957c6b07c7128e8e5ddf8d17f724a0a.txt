Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and development of northeast region G. Kishan Reddy, on Friday, once again offered to have a 'public debate' with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the Centre's financial assistance to Telangana State in the last eight years.'Every sphere of development or welfare activities being taken up here is because of funding by the Centre. Can the TRS government tell people about how much money has been allotted to the gram panchayats as against the Centre's release of funds?,' he questioned, at a press conference held at the party office on Friday.
