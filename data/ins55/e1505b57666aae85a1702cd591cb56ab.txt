Tax experts have urged the UK's new chancellor Jeremy Hunt to review the off-payroll working rules, known as IR35, after he cancelled plans to repeal controversial reforms.In a week of government turmoil, Hunt on Monday scrapped his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's proposal to liberalise IR35 in a move which would have made it easier to hire contractors but risked losing tax revenues.However, tax advisers urged Hunt to address problems with IR35, such as the danger of overzealous application of the rules.
