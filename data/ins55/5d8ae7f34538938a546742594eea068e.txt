U.S. stocks rose Friday after the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation for April proved in line with market expectations, with the smallest increase in a year and a half. Stocks rallied sharply on Thursday and all three indexes are looking at strong gains for the week after the S&P 500 came within a whisker of falling into a bear market. The Dow was on track to break a streak of eight weekly losses, its longest since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were set to end a stretch of seven straight weekly falls.
