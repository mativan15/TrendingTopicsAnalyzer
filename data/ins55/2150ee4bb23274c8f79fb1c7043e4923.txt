Last Week Tonight took last weekend off, meaning tonight's episode was John Oliver's first since the May 24 Uvalde, Texas school shooting in which 19 children and two teachers were massacred. So it was no surprise that Oliver devoted the show to the never-ending gun control debate.
This time, he focused on putting cops in schools, which has been pretty much the only action taken in response to school shootings since Columbine in 1999. Thing is, about the only thing those cops — euphemistically called School Resource Officers, or SROs — have managed to do over the past couple of decades is arrest hundreds of thousands of children for mostly minor infractions.
