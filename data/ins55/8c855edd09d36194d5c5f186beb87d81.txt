Albanese and Treasurer Jim Chalmers have been forced to straddle the line between helping Australians with the rising cost-of-living while also trying to keep a lid on inflation and the cash rate.With the prime minister's permission, Chalmers spent last week floating the idea of scrapping the $243 billion stage three tax cuts but this was later walked back by Albanese.Albanese also confirmed a significant expansion of the Commonwealth's paid parental leave scheme to 26 weeks at the NSW Labor state Conference on Saturday, where he vowed equality for women will be 'at the centre' of the budget.
