PTIHindustani Awam Morcha President Jitan Ram Manjhi.Former Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has said that being in the NDA as a junior partner of the BJP and the JD(U) was causing him "ghutan" (suffocation), as he regretted having stepped down in 2015, less than a year after being sworn in to the highest seat of power in the state. Manjhi, whose Hindustani Awam Morcha has four MLAs in the 243-strong assembly, was also of the view that with proper "samanjasya" (coordination), "we can make our presence felt in the upcoming legislative council polls when our support will be solicited by our bigger partners".
