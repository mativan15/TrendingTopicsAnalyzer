The two way race for the mayor's chair in the Town of Essex is in the home stretch as incumbent Richard Meloche and candidate Sherry Bondy continue to campaign. As the Oct. 24 election draws near, both mayoral candidates indicate enthusiasm is high amongst voters. 'The response on the doorstep is amazing,' Bondy tells CTV News Windsor. 'Me and my team, we are super pumped, like we are we are ready. And this has been an excellent campaign, a very strong campaign right from the start.' Among the top priorities according to Bondy remain broadband internet infrastructure, a roads plan, paved trails, debt management and improving council and community relations.
