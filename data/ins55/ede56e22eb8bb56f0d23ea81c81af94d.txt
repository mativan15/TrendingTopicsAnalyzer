A former private secretary to Margaret Thatcher has issued a scathing assessment of the incumbent Prime Minister, accusing Liz Truss of 'exploding the Conservative Party' as the polling gap to Labour grows beyond thirty points. After a day of chaos in Westminster, in which the PM lost her second major cabinet minister in less than a week and roughly 40 Tory backbenchers failed to vote against a Labour proposition banning fracking despite being obliged to do so by the Government, Caroline Slocock suggested the 'power is ebbing away' from Ms Truss.
