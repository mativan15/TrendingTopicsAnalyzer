Investors only seem to care about one thing this year: inflation. They have reason to be worried. The consumer price index (CPI), a measure of inflation, hit 8.3% on an annualized basis in April (not seasonally adjusted). High inflation can make for a tricky environment for investors.
When inflation gets elevated like this, investors often turn to dividend stocks as a good source of returns. According to Fidelity, dividend stocks account for about 40% of the S&P 500's total returns each year, on average, since 1930.
