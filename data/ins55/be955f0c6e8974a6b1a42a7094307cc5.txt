The resignation of New Brunswick's minister of education and early childhood education last week set the stage for French immersion reform to once again become a political pawn. Leo-James Levesque, a professor at Fredericton's St. Thomas Universit,y who helped write the French immersion curriculum for the province, says he isn't surprised that cabinet is setting the stage for French immersion reform again. The fate of the program remains up in the air following Dominic Cardy's resignation less than a week ago.
