Liz Truss quit as UK prime minister after a brief and chaotic tenure that saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market rout.

Truss, 47, said she was resigning after just 44 days in office, and is set to become the shortest-ruling prime minister in British history. The ruling Conservative Party aims to choose her successor by Oct. 28, and she will stay on as premier until then.

Candidates to replace her are likely to include former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak -- runner-up to Truss in this summer's leadership contest.
