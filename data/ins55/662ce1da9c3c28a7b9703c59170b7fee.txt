Philip Morris International doubled down on plans to enter the US, sweetening its offer for Swedish Match while also buying rights to sell IQOS heated tobacco products in the world's biggest market for smoking alternatives.The Switzerland-based tobacco company raised its offer for the Swedish nicotine pouch maker to 116 kronor per share from 106 kronor ($9.46) in a move it hopes will finalise the takeover that has, so far, been opposed by a group of hedge funds that want a higher bid. Swedish Match would give PMI a vast distribution network in the US for smoking alternatives such as vaping, nicotine pouches and heated tobacco.
