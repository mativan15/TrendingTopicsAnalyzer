Rupert Grint will always remember the smell of Harry Potter costar Robbie Coltrane's "cigars and beard glue."

The actor who portrayed Ron Weasley in the film franchise paid tribute to the "giant-hearted" Coltrane following his death on Oct. 14 at the age of 72. Grint shared a photo of his late costar in character as beloved Hogwarts half-giant and groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid in front of his hut.

"Heartbroken to hear that Robbie is gone," Grint captioned the Instagram post shared over the weekend.
