New Delhi: Union law minister Kiren Rijiju has sparked a controversy by saying that judges spend half their times spent in deciding who to appoint as judges instead of delivering justice, as he termed the collegium system 'opaque' and described the Indian selection system as the only one where judges appoint judges -- comments that some former judges described as 'unjustified'.The minister, in his remarks at an event held in Ahmedabad called Sabarmati Samvad, organised by weekly magazine Panchajanya (the magazine published by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), also said that there are a bunch of 40-50 lawyers who have created a 'monopoly' in the Supreme Court just because they speak good English.
