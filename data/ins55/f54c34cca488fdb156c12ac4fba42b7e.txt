By PA Media Published: 10:10 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 10:10 EDT, 18 October 2022 Middlesbrough are closing in on a deal to make Michael Carrick their new manager. The PA news agency understands there is work still to be done to secure an agreement with the 41-year-old former Manchester United assistant, but Boro are hopeful of doing just that within days. The Teessiders have spoken to a series of candidates since dispensing with the services of Chris Wilder on October 3, and have held more formal discussions with Carrick and ex-Watford manager Rob Edwards with the former West Ham, Tottenham and United midfielder emerging as the preferred candidate.
