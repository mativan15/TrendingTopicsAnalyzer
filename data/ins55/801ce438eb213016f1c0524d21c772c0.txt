Let's be honest, Ian Hislop isn't exactly known for biting his tongue when it comes to politics, and now the Have I Got News For You panelist has weighed in on Boris Johnson returning as Conservative Party leader.
The party is set to elect a new head once again following an eventful week, including the resignation of Liz Truss, who took over from Johnson just 44 days ago.
Although former PM Johnson, who also resigned earlier this year after a string of scandals, has not officially announced his bid for office once more, there are rumours he's planning a comeback.
