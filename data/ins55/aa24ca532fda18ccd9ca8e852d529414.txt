OTTAWA—The Emergencies Act inquiry is set to hear from more police witnesses on Thursday, after questions were raised earlier in the process about the response of Ottawa law enforcement to the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' that occupied the streets around Parliament Hill last winter. The inquiry is slated to hear from Patricia Ferguson, a high-ranking Ottawa police officer. Craig Abrams, of the Ontario Provincial Police, is also scheduled to appear on Thursday. Earlier this week, the inquiry heard from Ottawa city officials about the scramble to deal with the crisis posed by the convoy occupation.
