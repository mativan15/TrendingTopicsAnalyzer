LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields rose on Wednesday after the Bank of England (BoE) said it would start reducing its gilt holdings from Nov. 1, as government debt markets continued to trade in lockstep.

The BoE said on Tuesday it would start selling some of its holdings of British government bonds from Nov. 1, but said it would not sell any longer-dated gilts this year.

Britain's central bank was forced to start buying bonds again last month after the government's plans for unfunded tax cuts - which have now been almost completely reversed - sparked chaos in the market for long-duration gilts.
