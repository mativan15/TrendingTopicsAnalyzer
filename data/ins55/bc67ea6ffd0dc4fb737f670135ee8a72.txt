I will love quarterback Russell Wilson less if he wants a $50 million salary from the Broncos. He said he wanted to come to Denver and win Super Bowls. Who has the most rings? Tom Brady. Why? He has always taken less money to make the team better. Take notes, Wilson. 
C.J., thinks like a winner
Kiz: What's love to do with it? Money is another way athletes keep score. Wilson has not stopped grinning since the Broncos went all-in to trade for him. And why shouldn't Wilson be happy in the knowledge Denver has little choice but to pay him top dollar when it's time to extend his current deal? Whether we're talking about this franchise's playbook or the next owner's checkbook, Wilson can dictate his terms.
