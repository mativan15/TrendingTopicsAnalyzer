As many as 101 primary and secondary schools of Prayagraj district have been served notices by the project director (PD), district rural development agency (DRDA), for their failure to submit utilisation certificates for the first instalment of money sanctioned to them from MP/MLA local area development fund. These schools had sought monetary help for repair/construction in their schools from MP/MLA fund and were given the first instalment. However, these institutions failed in not only submitting the mandatory utilisation certificates for the money given to them but also never applied for the second instalment, said officials.
