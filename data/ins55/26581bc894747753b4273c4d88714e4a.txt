From a doorbell to a wi-fi router and a mobile phone, smart products are easy targets for hackers, new research from consumer group Which? has found.

In most cases, Which? tested devices that no longer receive software security updates, leaving cybercriminals free to steal data.

A Samsung (005930.KS) Galaxy S8 Android smartphone, which stopped being supported with security updates in April 2021, was infected with malware which could lead to data theft, tracking and spam adverts.
