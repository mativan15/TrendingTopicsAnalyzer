The Chennai-based chess legend was all praise for Gukesh and said he is someone who always plays fearlessly and never holds back.The legendary Viswanathan Anand feels young Indian chess players are on the right track given their penchant to hog the limelight on and off, here and there. Teenage Grandmasters R Praggnanandhaa, D Gukesh and Arjun Erigaisi among others have been enjoying a superb run in 2022 with wins over world champion Magnus Carlsen being the feather on their caps. Commenting on Gukesh's stunning 29-move win over the Norwegian superstar Carlsen in the preliminary section of the ongoing Aimchess Rapid online tournament, the five-time world champion said it showed that players like him and Erigaisi are very strong and could compete against anybody on the other side of the board.
