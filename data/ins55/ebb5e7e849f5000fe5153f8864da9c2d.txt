After what feels like the longest wait, One Of Us Is Lying is finally back this week for season two and it's like the Bayview Four never left.
The first series of the Peacock program ended in typically dramatic form as the aptly named Murder Club – made up of Nate, Bronwyn, Cooper and Addy – battled to clear their names after the death of fellow classmate Simon (Mark McKenna), before uncovering Jake's (Barrett Carnahan) role in his demise.
Throughout the drama, Nate (Cooper van Grootel) and Bronwyn (Marianly Tejada) endured a will-they-won't-they relationship and the suspicions against the gang only brought them closer – until he claimed that they couldn't be together.
