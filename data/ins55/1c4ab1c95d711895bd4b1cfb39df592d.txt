Don't assume the worst is over, says investor Larry McDonald.There's talk of a policy pivot by the Federal Reserve as interest rates rise quickly and stocks keep falling. Both may continue. McDonald, founder of The Bear Traps Report and author of 'A Colossal Failure of Common Sense,' which described the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, expects more turmoil in the bond market, in part, because 'there is $50 trillion more in world debt today than there was in 2018.' And that will hurt equities. The bond market dwarfs the stock market — both have fallen this year, although the rise in interest rates has been worse for bond investors because of the inverse relationship between rates (yields) and bond prices.
