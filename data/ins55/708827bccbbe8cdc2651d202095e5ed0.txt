A family business in Texas is donating 19 custom caskets to the families of victims of the Uvalde shooting – each one personalized for a child victim.

Trey Ganem, who runs SoulShine Industries, a custom casket business, met with the families of the victims so he could learn about their interests and incorporate them into special designs such as superheroes, TikTok or dinosaurs. All of the designs are hand-painted.

"Being able to go to the homes is something that is very emotional for me," Ganem said, "CBS Mornings" reports.
