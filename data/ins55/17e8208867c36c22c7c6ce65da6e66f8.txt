Long before Fidel Castro proclaimed the 'socialist character' of his revolution on April 1961, the new regime was already on the path to communism and was 'discreetly' placing sympathizers in key positions in government, Castro's younger brother Raúl told Soviet leaders, according to a rare document obtained by the Washington-based National Security Archive.

The recently declassified document from the State Archive of the Russian Federation, an official record of a conversation in Moscow between Cuba's defense minister, Raúl Castro, and the Soviet premier at the time, Nikita Khrushchev, on July 18, 1960, provides previously unknown details of the crucial moment the two countries sealed an alliance that would push the world to the brink of nuclear war just two years later during the Cuban Missile crisis.
