Parents of children needing Panadol have been warned against panic-buying the medication amid fears of serious supply issues.Pharmacy Guild of Australia Victorian branch president Anthony Tassone's plea came as flu cases surge across the state.'We do encourage the public to please not panic buy,' he said.'And we've certainly seen an increase in demand for those products in pharmacies recently.'Everyone has experience, whether it's at the workplace, school or junior sport, with widespread illness at the moment – whether it's the flu, colds or Covid.
