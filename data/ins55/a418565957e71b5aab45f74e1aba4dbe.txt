If you're planning to retire early, some traditional retirement advice might not work."Mad Fientist" blogger and podcaster Brandon, who retired six years ago at age 34, tells Insider that while the traditional retiree has a high income that keeps increasing until they reach retirement age in their 60s, the early retiree's income peaks before they quit their job in their 30s or 40s — and then it suddenly drops. "All the advice that I was reading on these financial sites and blogs at that time was geared to those normal retirees, and we're not like that at all," Brandon, who uses only his first name online, says.
