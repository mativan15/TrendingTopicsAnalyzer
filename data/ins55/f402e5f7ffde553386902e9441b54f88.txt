Under the SEC's proposals fund managers would have to disclose the ESG factors they consider and the specific strategies, criteria and data they use to invest in line with them. They would also have to disclose metrics like the greenhouse emissions of their portfolios and their annual progress towards their ESG objectives.In Australia, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have both shown increasing interest in ESG-related disclosures by fund managers and companies, with ASIC starting an investigation of greenwashing by superannuation and managed funds last year and the ACCC warning that companies falsely promoting their green credentials would face an enforcement crackdown.
