 Amazon has issued a critical response to new US legislation designed to limit the ability for large companies to promote first-party over third-party products and services.The 22-page ‘‘American Innovation and Choice Online Act'' features a range of recommendations that look to stop ecommerce platforms giving preference to their own products on their websites.However, Brian Huseman, Amazon Vice President of Public Policy maintained in a recent statement that the bill 'jeopardizes two of the things American consumers love most about Amazon: the vast selection and low prices made possible by opening our store to third-party selling partners, and the promise of fast, free shipping through Amazon Prime'.
