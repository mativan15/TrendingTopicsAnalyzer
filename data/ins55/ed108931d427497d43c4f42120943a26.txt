Scott Olson/Getty Images News Coming off a Street-beating quarterly earnings report, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said that the rise of hybrid working has created a "new normal" for leisure travel demand, allowing people to book more quick excursions and work from their vacation destinations. "I think travel demand for airlines is permanently higher -- it's at a higher level," the head of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) told CNBC. Kirby acknowledged that the airline industry faces a headwind in the form of slowing economic growth, with a threat of a recession on the horizon.
