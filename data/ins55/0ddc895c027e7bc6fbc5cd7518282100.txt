Wichita State sophomore point guard Tyson Etienne felt at home during his pre-draft workout with the Knicks.
Etienne's 'godfather'' is Marcus Camby, who had two stints with the Knicks and whom he calls 'uncle.'' Etienne is also related to former Knicks center DeAndre Jordan.
Born in New York and raised in Fort Lee, N.J., Etienne played for the prestigious youth program, the PSA Cardinals in The Bronx and attended his share of Knicks' games during the stirring 2012-13 campaign, courtesy of Camby's tickets.
