New York CNN Business —

Stocks rallied sharply Monday, thanks to more strong earnings from big banks and a sigh of relief about new plans by the United Kingdom to scrap a controversial tax cut plan.

The Dow was up more than 550 points, or 1.9%, and moved back above 30,000. Solid results from Bank of America (BAC), BNY Mellon (BK) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), helped lift market sentiment.

The S&P 500 surged 2.6%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq rose 3.3%. All three indexes are now up for the month of October as well.
