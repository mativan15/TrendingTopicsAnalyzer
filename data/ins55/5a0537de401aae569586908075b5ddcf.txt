Douglas Rissing I have been writing this post since February 8, 2008. The Great Recession began in December 2007. So, I have been writing this post for a long time, and I have written during the worst economic recession since the Great Depression and during the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and accompanying recession. I must admit that I am very pessimistic at this time. How my present state of mind compares with earlier situations is really undefinable at this stage of the economic picture that is evolving.
