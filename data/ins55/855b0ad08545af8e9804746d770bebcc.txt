Venus powers up in your sector of pure personality, and this means you are ready to stand out in love - if that's what you want. 
Making a grand gesture comes naturally, and if you're single, you say and do exactly what you need to, to be noticed. 
Saturn stirs up your success zone, and focus is number one on your work wish list.  Do try not to get distracted.

DESTINY DAYS: Monday, review all money accounts.
