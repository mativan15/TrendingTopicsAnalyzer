U.S. card companies are expected to benefit as pandemic-weary consumers continue to fuel demand for travel, one of the biggest contributors to revenue, despite rising inflation.With more companies resuming business travel and people planning vacations, Visa Inc, Mastercard and American Express are likely to see a jump in cross border volume, according to analysts."So far, despite the macro, you continue to see a somewhat stable consumer," Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said, adding that monthly data from Visa and Mastercard showed no hit to payments or cross-border volumes.
