PhonlamaiPhoto/iStock via Getty Images Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) -3.1% in Tuesday's trading after Goldman Sachs downgraded shares to Neutral from Buy with a $92 price target, cut from $114, citing the stock's relative performance vs. peers and reflecting modest caution around the non-residential construction demand outlook. "While we remain constructive on the fundamentals of the business, we see this better reflected in current valuation with the stock having outperformed since initiation," Goldman analyst Emily Chieng writes, adding that Steel Dynamics' (STLD) outperformance can be attributed to balance sheet strength, near-term production following the start-up of the Sinton mill, and additional capital returns announced earlier this year.
