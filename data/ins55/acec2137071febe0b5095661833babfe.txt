NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Thursday the central bank is not done with raising its short-term rate target amid very high levels of inflation, while adding it was likely the central bank will find space next year to pause the tightening process and take stock of how its rate increases are impacting the economy.Given the current inflation situation, 'the Fed is actively trying to slow the economy,' and 'we are going to keep raising rates for a while,' Harker said in a speech text.
