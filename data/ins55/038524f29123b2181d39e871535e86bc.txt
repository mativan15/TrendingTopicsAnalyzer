Bonnie Sweeten is surrounded by reporters as she leaves Bucks County District Court in Richboro on June 22, 2009, following her preliminary hearing on charges of identity theft and making a false report to police in connection to her abduction hoax.

Bucks County's infamous 'Hoax Mom' is expected to plead guilty next week instead of standing trial on charges she stole $700,000 from a Lower Southampton law firm and other people, according to a filing in federal court Wednesday.

Bonnie Sweeten, 40, rose to infamy in 2009 when she pretended she and her 9-year-old daughter were kidnapped in Upper Southampton.
