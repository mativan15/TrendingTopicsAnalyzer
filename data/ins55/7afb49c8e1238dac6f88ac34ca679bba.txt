October 20, 2022 09:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Trust Advisors L.P. ('First Trust' or 'FTA'), a leading exchange-traded fund ('ETF') provider and asset manager, announced today that it has launched the FT Cboe Vest Rising Dividend Achievers Target Income ETF (the 'fund').

Rising interest rates, low real bond yields, and increasingly positive stock/bond correlations have heightened portfolio risk and created a performance drag.
