ipopba/iStock via Getty Images C3.ai (AI) shares surged more than 11% on Friday on heavy volume, one day after the enterprise software company posted mixed fourth-quarter results and said sales for fiscal 2023 would slow. Shortly after 3 p.m. EST, more than 10M shares had changed hands, more than twice the average daily volume of just over 3.1M shares. On Thursday, shares fell more than 20% following the results, which prompted several Wall Street analysts to question the company's business model.
