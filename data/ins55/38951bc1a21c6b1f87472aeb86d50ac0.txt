Alexia Putellas and Karim Benzema won the Ballon d'Or award for the best players in the world on Monday.

Putellas kept her title as the best women's player in 2022 after scoring 18 goals to lead her team, Barcelona, to another domestic trophy.

The Catalan team won all 30 league games as well as both domestic cups, but an ACL injury prevented her from playing in the European Championship.

Spain, her national team, lost to the eventual champions, England, in the quarter-finals.

'I'm very happy to be back here,' Putellas said at the ceremony in Paris.
