Battersea Power Station is finally open! This weekend the renovated power station welcomed visitors for the first time in almost 40 years. While it was once a coal-powered titan of energy, it's now a wonderful emporium full of shops, restaurants, bars and entertainment. We rounded up our favourite pictures of the station on its opening weekend.  Recommended: Our ultimate guide to Battersea Power Station.
