ANIBJP President JP NaddaThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has become synonymous with scams and broken the records of corruption set by the Congress, BJP president J P Nadda alleged on Sunday. He also asserted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will "trounce" the AAP in the MCD election and thereafter, in the Delhi Assembly polls. "The AAP has become a party of scams. It has broken all records of corruption set by the Congress. It needs to go," Nadda said at the "Panch Parmeshwar Sammelan" held at the Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi ahead of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls, which are likely to be held in December.
