It's been a trying year for the investing community. Since hitting all-time highs during the first week of January, the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 have dipped by as much as 15% and 20%, respectively.
Meanwhile, it's been an even tougher slog for the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite and the Nasdaq 100, the latter comprising 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Both the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 have fallen close to 30% from their record-closing highs, placing both indexes firmly in a bear market.
