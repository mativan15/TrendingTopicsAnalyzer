Failure of authorities to implement complete prohibition in Bihar has led to an overburdened judiciary and a sharp increase in drug addiction and consumption of deadlier adulterated liquor, which poses a risk to the lives of people, the Patna High Court has observed. 'After liquor ban was imposed, many started looking for substitute. Drugs, being on supply route, made an easy entry into the state amid the lack of vigilance.
