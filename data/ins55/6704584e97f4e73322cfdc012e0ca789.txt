If you're looking for broad selection of shows and movies, Hulu really does get the best of both worlds. Hulu is owned by two entertainment giants: Disney, with 67% of it, and Universal's parent company, Comcast, with the remaining 33%. That means the service is able to cherry pick shows from ABC, NBC, and FX, as well as movies from Universal Pictures, Disney and 20th Century Fox. But, as well as this, Hulu executives also buy in movies from other studios.As a result, aside from Hulu's own original movies such as Fresh and Prey, no movie will stay on the platform indefinitely - and that can be irritating if a movie on your to-be-watched list suddenly disappears.
