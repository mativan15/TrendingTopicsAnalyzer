Waste Connections (TSE: WCN) (NYSE: WCN), a "waste collection, waste disposal, transfer, and recycling services" company, has been outperforming the market this year so far. It's not hard to figure out why -considering it's a leader in a recession-resistant industry. Notably, the stock has a 'Perfect 10' Smart Score while having a Strong Buy rating from analysts. However, do these factors mean you should buy WCN stock now? While WCN may continue outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX) during a bear market, which could make it a decent short-term purchase, it may not be an outperformer when looking a few years out, as its valuation is stretched.
