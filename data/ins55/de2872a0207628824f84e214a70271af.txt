Revolut's compliance chief has quit following a restructuring of the digital lender's risk division.
Harry Gill, Revolut's global head of regulatory compliance and a member of its executive leadership team, resigned after the company's chief executive Nikolay Storonsky overhauled the department, according to sources.
The resignation follows a string of senior departures at Revolut in recent months, including its head of operational risk and head of UK compliance. 
The overhaul of Revolut's risk and compliance department, known as its 'second line of defence', has meant that employees have been moved to other parts of the business as opposed to the bank reducing overall headcount, The Sunday Telegraph understands.
