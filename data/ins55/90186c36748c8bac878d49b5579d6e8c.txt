Jamie Dimon's prediction that stocks could plunge by 20% is too aggressive, but investors should still expect more downside until interest rates peak, according to Goldman Sachs' chief global stock strategist.On Monday, the JPMorgan CEO predicted a recession is likely to hit the US in the next six to nine months, which could send stocks falling an "easy 20%." That grim outlook has been echoed by other voices on Wall Street – but a decline that steep is unlikely to happen, according to Goldman's Peter Oppenheimer, as financial conditions remain strong.
