A Ukrainian Kiwi man has returned home to Aotearoa to recover after being injured multiple times in Ukraine – but expects to soon head back to the war-torn country. Vladimir Fomin, a 63-year-old Hanmer Springs man, travelled to his homeland in March, weeks after Russia invaded the country, to assist in the war effort by driving protection for humanitarian convoys. The Kyiv-born Kiwi has lived in New Zealand for 25 years and runs an adventure tourism company in Hamner Springs called Rock Wolf & Co.
