Nearly half of likely voters in key battleground states own cryptocurrency or are considering investing in it, according to a new poll.

The poll, commissioned by a crypto-focused PAC, surveyed voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

A third of voters who own crypto are people of color, compared to one in four of the overall electorate.

People who either own cryptocurrency or are interested in purchasing it could impact close races in key battleground states, a new poll asserts.
