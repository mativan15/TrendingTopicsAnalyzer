Close to six months have passed since the Delhi government announced the redevelopment of Gandhi Nagar market, the biggest textile hub in Delhi, but the area is yet to see any concrete change.Shop owners at the market remain a divided bunch — while some complain that the announcement is yet to reflect any change on the ground, others remain optimistic that the change will be a 'slow but steady process'. According to Balkishan, a shop owner based in the market for close to a decade, the recent spell of rain has resulted in the worsening of existing issues — frequent congestion, improper collection of waste, clogged drains, among others — that the 15,000 traders at the market continue to face on a daily basis.
