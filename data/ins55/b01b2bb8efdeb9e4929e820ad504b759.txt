With just a day left for withdrawal of nominations for the June 10 Rajya Sabha polls, a determined JD(S) is pushing ahead to persuade the Congress to withdraw its second candidate Mansoor Khan and instead support its own candidate Kupendra Reddy as both parties share the common goal of defeating the BJP. JD(S) veteran HD Deve Gowda is learnt to have convinced Congress leader Mallikarjuna Kharge to take it up with Sonia Gandhi as Karnataka's Congress leaders DK Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah have not responded to the idea.
