Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 21.1x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Medtronic has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue.
