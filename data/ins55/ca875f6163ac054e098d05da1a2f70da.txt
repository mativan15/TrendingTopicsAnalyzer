Oct. 15—The Missouri Southern football team will look to continue its hot start to the season on Saturday when it hits the road to take on Central Missouri at 1:30 p.m. in Warrensburg, Mo.

Just beyond the season's midway point, the Lions (4-2) have already clinched their winningest campaign since 2014 when they finished 4-7. Southern is currently two wins away from clinching its first winning season since the 2013 campaign that resulted in a 7-3 finish.

"We've just got to go out and just don't act like we've arrived," second-year MSSU head coach Atiba Bradley said.
