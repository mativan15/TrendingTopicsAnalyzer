Specifically, a VAT of 7% on crypto or digital asset transfers won't become effective until Dec. 31, 2023, the report said, citing the new royal decree. The move followed Thailand's agreement in March to waive taxes for digital asset-based transactions, the Bangkok Post said. Indonesia, another country located in Asia, recently made plans to impose a VAT on digital asset transactions and capital gains at a rate of 0.
