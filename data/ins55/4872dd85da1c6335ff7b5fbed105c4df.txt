Some in the media have suggested this could be a 'Last Dance' season for the Golden State Warriors due to the uncertain future of Draymond Green both in response to his fight with Jordan Poole but also his contract status. The Warriors already have an exorbitant salary plus luxury tax bill that will climb even further next season if Green remains. Stephen Curry was asked in an exclusive interview with Shayna Rubin to comment on the possibility of this season being the last season with a core of himself, Green and Klay Thompson.
