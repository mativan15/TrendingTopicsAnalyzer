A fraud analyst working at Wells Fargo is now accused of fraud after allegedly taking nearly $1 million in a scheme to bilk a COVID-19 relief program, federal authorities tell Channel 9.

The case involves money from the Paycheck Protection Program, which was supposed to go to businesses to pay their employees during the pandemic so the business could survive and avoid layoffs.

Prosecutors in Charlotte say Tamakia Harris is now facing 17 fraud charges in connection with the scheme. Harris was in court on Thursday.
