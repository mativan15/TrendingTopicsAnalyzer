As part of efforts to attract Rs 10,000 crore investment for the sector and turn Uttar Pradesh into a global textiles hub, the government announced Monday that it would give a 25 per cent subsidy on purchase of land and up to 100 per cent exemption on stamp duty for setting up textile units in the state as part of its new policy. 
'Making the state as the global textile hub, attracting Rs 10,000 crore investment and generating 5 lakh jobs are the main focus of this new policy,' said Uttar Pradesh Handloom and Textile Industry Minister Rakesh Sachan said.
