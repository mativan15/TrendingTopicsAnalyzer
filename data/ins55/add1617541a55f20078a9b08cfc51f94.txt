The Manitoba government is investing up to $40 million to help with the expansion and future development of CentrePort South. Premier Heather Stefanson announced the funding at a news conference on Friday, saying that CentrePort – North America's largest tri-modal inland port and foreign trade zone -- is an economic driver that helps to create high-paying jobs. 'Our government is pleased to provide much-needed certainty to the City of Winnipeg on this strategic infrastructure priority,' she said.
