Ricky Gervais waded into the drama surrounding fellow Brit James Corden and his brief ban from a New York restaurant.The host of The Late Late Show With James Corden, 44, was given a lifetime ban from Balthazar's in Soho, with owner Keith McNally calling him a "tiny cretin of a man and the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago," in a scathing Instagram post.He banned Corden from Balthazar after the comedian allegedly treated the staff poorly, but ended up reversing his decision within a day.
