Entering the NFL season, the New York Jets won just 22 football games in the prior five seasons. That mark was tied for the lowest in the league over that span. Who were they tied with? The New York Giants. It's been a while since football was relevant in the New York City area.

For the Giants, you have to go back to 2016 and the infamous boat trip prior to their playoff game against the Green Bay Packers. For the Jets, you have to go back even further to the playoff runs in 2009 and 2010 under Rex Ryan.
