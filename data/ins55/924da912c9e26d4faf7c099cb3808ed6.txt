Sylvia Park shopping mall owner Kiwi Property wants to be your landlord. It will be among the first to bring an internationally contentious large-scale corporate landlord renting model to New Zealand. The publicly listed $3.6 billion company intends to build and rent out around 2500 houses in Auckland in the next 10 years, including nearly 300 apartments at Sylvia Park which are set to be tenanted by 2024. Chief executive Clive Mackenzie said Kiwi Property would bring a 'new level of professionalism' not seen before by Kiwi renters.
