When PJ Flanagan joined H&MV Engineering as an electrical apprentice at 17, he never imagined swapping his toolbox for the boardroom to become chief executive and then leading the company to more than €150 million in sales. As its second employee he was part of 'a man in a van business' with Gerry Phelan, his boss, driving 'the length and breadth of the country' to look for jobs. 'We worked morning, noon and night,' says Flanagan.While he now clocks off at 5pm most evenings, the Tipperary native worked overtime again this year as he pushed a deal over the line that saw Exponent, a London private equity firm, invest in the high-voltage business that connects data centres and renewable energy projects to the grid.
