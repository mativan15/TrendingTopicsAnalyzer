The Queen is currently 96 years of age, and is the longest-serving monarch in British history.
She's been on the throne for 70 years now, a fact being celebrated with aplomb during the ongoing Platinum Jubilee bank holiday.
A host of festivities are currently underway – and it does make one wonder what celebrations would take place if Her Majesty should reach her 100th birthday in four years' time. 
The milestone age was indeed reached by The Queen Mother, who lived to be 101. And the Queen's aunt Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester lived to be 102.
