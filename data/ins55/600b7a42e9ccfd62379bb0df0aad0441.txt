A Virtuoso Performance 
Mr Modi is a devout Hindu. Most Indians are devout Hindus. Most others who are not Hindus are equally devout to another faith. When he went to the Mahakaleshwar temple, Mr Modi offered prayers and performed the rituals, and every minute of that was dutifully telecast live by all the channels that I surfed. At the sanctorum, he was draped in a golden angavastram and a saffron scarf. He had sandalwood paste on his forehead and a big tilak. When he addressed the gathering (I suppose nearly all Hindus), it was obvious that he had prepared well.
