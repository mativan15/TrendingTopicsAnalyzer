EXCLUSIVE: IFC Films has picked up worldwide rights to writer-director Nicole Riegel's sophomore feature Dandelion. Cameras roll this week on the romantic drama, which will star KiKi Layne. A theatrical release is planned for next year.

	Layne, who will also executive produce, plays Dandelion, a struggling but determined Cincinnati singer-songwriter in a downward spiral. She reluctantly takes a last-ditch-effort gig at a motorcycle rally in South Dakota where she meets Casey, a guitarist who walked away from his dream long ago.
