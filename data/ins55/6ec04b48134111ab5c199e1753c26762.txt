Amid all the speculations around the iPhone 14 launch date, leaks strongly suggest that this particular date could be when Apple officially unveils the next generation Apple smartphones. The speculation around the iPhone 14 launch date have grown significantly last week especially after the delay by Apple suppliers in providing the components became public. The Chinese suppliers of the Cupertino-based tech giant have been struggling to reopen amid COVID-19 related restrictions in China. It was earlier believed that it could delay the manufacturing timelines for the iPhone 14, however Apple Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that at that moment, delays were not being anticipated.
