The Great British Bake Off star Dawn has revealed the heroic lengths she underwent to get in the iconic tent on the Channel 4 show.
The IT manager became the sixth baker to be eliminated from the programme hosted by Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding on Tuesday.
Judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood chose to send Dawn home after Halloween Week, which saw the wannabe pastry chefs tasked with making various spooky treats.
For the technical, the contestants, getting into the spirit of the terrifying theme in fancy dress, had to make eight s'mores for the technical, while the showstopper was to make a baked delight from a hanging lantern.
