The Bobby Bones ShowBy Morgan HuelsmanMay 31, 2022Jordan Davis released his new song "What My World Spins Around" and he stopped by The Bobby Bones Show to share the story behind it. Before Davis was successful in country music, he had a job in residential erosion control. He told his boss that he wanted to go to Nashville to write songs, and his boss still let him keep his job until he was ready to move. But instead of doing residential erosion control, he took over weed eating until he left. Davis has scored a few number 1 songs during his career including "Slow Dance in a Parking Lot," "Take It From Me," "Singles You Up," and most recently "Buy Dirt" with Luke Bryan.
