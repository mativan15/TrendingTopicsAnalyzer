US stocks fell on Friday, led by a dismal earnings report from Snap. The social media company reported its slowest revenue growth in history, sending shares plummeting nearly 30%.All three major stock indexes opened lower, with investors knocking down shares of other tech giants in response to Snap's results. Meta shares were down 3%, and Twitter shares were down 5%, with both companies expected to report financials next week. Reports say Elon Musk told investors he would slash 75% of Twitter's workforce once his acquisition of the social media platform goes through, while a separate report said that the US government could take a look at Musk's recent business activity, including his Twitter purchase.
