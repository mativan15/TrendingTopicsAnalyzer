New Delhi: The director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, has withdrawn his letter that listed the special arrangements for MPs and those recommended by them at the country's foremost government hospital. Doctors' associations and activists had criticised the 'VIP culture', while the institute had said these were just the SOPs or Standing Operating Procedures for MPs.In an apparent bid to counter the 'VIP' charge, the AIIMS had also tweeted that it has 'always had a 24×7 control room for co-ordination of medical care of patients from all walks of life', adding that staff is deployed to 'expedite treatment for poorest of the poor'.
