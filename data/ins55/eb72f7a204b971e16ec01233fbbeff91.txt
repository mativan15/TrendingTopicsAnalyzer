Published: 04:06 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 04:06 EDT, 2 June 2022 New legislation would see Australians caught in possession of drugs handed a $400 fine rather than a court date in a massive overhaul to the current legal system.New South Wales Attorney-General Mark Speakman proposed the scheme which comes off the back of recommendations from the Special Commission of Inquiry Into Ice, released in 2020.The AG said he was 'disappointed' the state government hadn't taken any advice from the $10million inquiry and put his voice behind alternative methods to addressing the country's illicit drug problem.
