One of Australia's first cryptocurrency exchanges moved hundreds of millions of dollars of company funds, including customer deposits, out of customer accounts and invested the money into exotic cryptocurrencies sold on other exchanges and personal spending without the knowledge of customers.

Public examinations into the affairs of the exchange operator Blockchain Global at the Supreme Court of Victoria heard on Thursday that the exchange's entities had taken customer money to invest in a cannabis coins issuer, buy shares in a group listed on a secondary stock exchange in Canada, make mortgage payments for a senior staffer and pay personal bank accounts.
