For this episode of "ETF 360" (recorded before the ETF Trends rebrand to VettaFi), VettaFi's vice chairman Tom Lydon spoke with Jeff Weniger, CFA and head of equity strategy at WisdomTree, about the rotation back to value happening in markets.

Looking back, it's been around 14–15 years of largely growth for markets, with occasional 6–12 month breaks from the growth trend. This pattern has been going on since before the financial crisis, Weniger explained, and for many advisors that means that much of their whole career has been in this strong growth environment.
