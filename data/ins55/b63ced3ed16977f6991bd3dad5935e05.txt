Flagging that the AAP government submitted Lokayukta reports after an 'inordinate delay', Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena in a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has pointed out that 'being the custodian of public trust, it is incumbent upon higher public functionaries to display appropriate alertness in such matters of public importance'. 
Saxena has also advised the CM to ensure such statutory reports are timely tabled in Assembly so the system of Lokayukta is strengthened. 
The L-G in his letter to Kejriwal said, 'I would like to advise that the minister concerned may please be guided appropriately to dispose of such important matters of the public interest within a reasonable period so that the statutory purpose of laying it before the Legislative Assembly is not defeated and Delhi is not deprived of its wisdom.
