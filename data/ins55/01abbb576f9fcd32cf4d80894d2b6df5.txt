The cost of living in Cairo has soared so much that security guard Mustafa Gamal had to send his wife and year-old daughter to live with his parents in a village 70 miles south of the Egyptian capital to save money.

Gamal, 28, stayed behind, working two jobs, sharing an apartment with other young people and eliminating meat from his diet. 'The prices of everything have been doubled," he said. "There was no alternative.''

Around the world, people are sharing Gamal's pain and frustration.
