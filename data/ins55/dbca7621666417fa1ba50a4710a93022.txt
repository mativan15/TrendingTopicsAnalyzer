Season Two of the HBO Max series will premiere in November Fall break is over, and it's time for the young adult shenanigans to resume in the new trailer for Season Two of The Sex Lives of College Girls. The clip finds students returning to the hallowed grounds of the fictional Essex College and enjoying all the perks that come with higher education, from a 'Winter Under-land' party (cause everyone's in their underwear, get it?) to a 'female-forward strip-tacular' to raise money for climate change.
