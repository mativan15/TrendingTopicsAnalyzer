6. MARRIED FOR LOVE: "I was engaged to someone whose family had a lot of money, and he was graduating law school. At the time, I was in my first semester of law school when he proposed, and right after, he told me it was 'law school or me' because he didn't want to take on my law school debt (I never expected him to) and a stay-at-home wife (I didn't want that). So, I called the engagement off and married for love — my husband came from a poor family and didn't have a high-paying job. After we got married, I realized he had hid a lot of debt from me: credit card, student loans, and the wedding, which I was told was taken care of.
