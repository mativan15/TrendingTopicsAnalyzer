Justin Sullivan Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) maintained its full-year earnings forecasts despite coming up short of expectations in its Q3 report. The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toy manufacturer posted a 28% drop in adjusted EPS to $1.42 alongside a 14.7% decline in revenue from the prior year to $1.68B. Analysts had expected $1.60 and $1.69B, respectively. Foreign exchange impacts and greater supply chain challenges were noted as particular adverse impacts on the quarterly performance. "As expected, the third quarter is our most difficult comparison and was further impacted by increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer," CEO Chris Cocks explained.
