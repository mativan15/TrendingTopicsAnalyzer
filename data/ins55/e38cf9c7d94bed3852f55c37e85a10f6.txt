Johnny Depp's Latina lawyer, Camille Vasquez, became a media sensation after her powerful cross-examination of Amber Heard on May 17.

Now, the 37 year old has proved victorious alongside her colleagues and the Pirates of the Caribbean star after a jury ruled in favor of both parties for defamation.

The jury ruled largely in favor of Depp on June 1, awarding the actor $15 million in damages, but also sided with Heard under one matter pertaining to her claims that she was defamed by Depp's attorney Adam Waldman in an interview where he said that she and her friends "set" the actor up with "an ambush, a hoax" on the night of an argument between the couple in May 2016.
