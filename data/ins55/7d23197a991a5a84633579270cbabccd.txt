In addition to his singular musical legacy, Freddie Mercury left behind a slew of prized cars. Now the first Rolls-Royce he ever owned is hitting the auction block, and all the proceeds are going toward a good cause.



RM Sotheby's is offering up the singer's 1974 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow during a sale on November 5. The former Queen frontman was said to have owned the car from 1979 until his death in 1991 at age 45. After his passing, the Rolls-Royce was scooped up by his sister, Kashmira Cooke, and remained in her possession until 2013 when it was bought at auction.
