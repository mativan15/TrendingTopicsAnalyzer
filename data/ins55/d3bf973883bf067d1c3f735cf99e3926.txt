There may be an opportunity for investors to boost performance by snapping up shares of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks trading at a relative discount to their pandemic highs, according to Evercore ISI. "Despite the obvious challenges, we view risk/reward as attractive," analysts led by Julian Emanuel wrote in a Sunday note. "China US ADRs that have fallen significantly from their Pandemic Peak but have had favorable 2023e EPS revisions — could outperform." Evercore ISI screened for US-listed Chinese American depository receipts, or ADRs, with a market capitalization about $1 billion and that are down more from their pandemic peaks than Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which has fallen 47% this year.
