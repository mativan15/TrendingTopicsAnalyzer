Texas A&M entered the bye week sitting at 3-3, and 1-2 in The SEC, and after Saturday's exciting slate of SEC matchups, the Aggies are currently 5th in the SEC West, with six games remaining to further prove that the ship has not sunk, and progress is still being made no matter how many in the media seem to disagree.
From a realistic perspective, The Aggies are looking to finish off the season strong, but are no longer in contention for a College Football Playoff appearance, instead aiming for a respectable bowl game birth with a chance to create some momentum heading into the 2023 season.
