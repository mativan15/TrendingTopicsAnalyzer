CHICAGO — In 'Top Gun: Maverick' starring Tom Cruise back in the cockpit as a fighter pilot, Bashir Salahuddin plays a chief warrant officer named Hondo. 'In layman's terms, he's a super expert in multiple fields,' Salahuddin said. 'And he's kind of Mav's right-hand man — he's the guy who, whenever Mav looks around the room, he's the guy who is always in his corner.'He's also a character who brings moments of levity. And Salahuddin has plenty of experience with that. The Chicago native is the co-creator and star of two TV comedies: The Chicago-set 'South Side' on HBO Max (the third season begins filming this summer) and the 'Soul Train' homage 'Sherman's Showcase' on IFC.
