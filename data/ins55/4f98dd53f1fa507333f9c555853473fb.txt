CNN —

When President Joe Biden visits Pennsylvania on Thursday, he'll tout infrastructure investments that helped rebuild a collapsed bridge and raise campaign cash away from cameras with the state's Democratic Senate candidate.

Where he won't appear is a campaign rally stage.

Three weeks before November's elections, Biden's visit to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia neatly demonstrates a political strategy focused on promoting his agenda and talking with donors rather than headlining stump speeches alongside vulnerable Democrats.
