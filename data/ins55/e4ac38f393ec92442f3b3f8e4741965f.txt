The Chicago Bears (2-4) will face the New England Patriots (3-3) on Monday Night Football in Week 7, although there's a big question mark about who will be starting at quarterback for the Patriots.

Starter Mac Jones has been sidelined with a high ankle sprain suffered in Week 3. Backup Brian Hoyer started in place of Jones against the Green Bay Packers, but another injury forced fourth-round rookie Bailey Zappe into the lineup. Zappe nearly led the Patriots to victory over the Packers, and he's since followed that up with back-to-back wins as a starter against the Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns.
