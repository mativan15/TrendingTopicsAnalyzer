Former Vice President Mike Pence indicated Wednesday that he might not be inclined to vote for former President Donald Trump in 2024 should he launch another White House bid. Asked by a student at Georgetown University if he would vote for Trump if he is the nominee in 2024, Pence replied, 'There might be somebody else I prefer,' an apparent nod to his own presidential ambitions. Speaking at the Georgetown Institute of Politics, Pence reiterated that he and former second lady Karen Pence will pray over the decision of whether to seek the Republican presidential nomination 'in the coming months' before announcing a formal decision.
