Congress seems to have adopted a ‘wait-and-watch' policy as it withheld its list of candidates for the Himachal assembly elections yet again as the parliamentary board of the ruling BJP met in Delhi to discuss nominees for November 12 polls on Monday. Marred with factionalism, Congress has held back-to-back meetings in New Delhi to shortlist candidates. However, even after repeated surveys and internal assessments, the party has not been able to release the first list of candidates. It seems the top leadership is wary of an open rebellion.
