AFPAirtel's ARPU, key performance metric for telcos, grew to ?178 in the March quarter from Rs 163 in the one ended December.Bharti 's average revenue per user (ARPU) is estimated to jump nearly 41% in the next four to five years to ₹250, propelled by strong revenue and subscriber market share gains, say analysts. These, they added, are likely to come on the back of multiple tariff hikes and steady subscriber gains despite the likely continuation of Airtel's price premium over Jio. Strong ARPU growth, they added, is likely to translate in high incremental operating margins and free cash flows to support Airtel's future investments, starting with an estimated $3 billion towards 5G-related spends, including spectrum costs in the upcoming auction likely next month.
