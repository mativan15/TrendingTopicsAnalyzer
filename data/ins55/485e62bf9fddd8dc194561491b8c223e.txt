A chillingly beautiful dare of a movie, David Cronenberg's 'Crimes of the Future' imagines a near-future much like the present, only colder and more feral.Shot in Athens, largely at night, writer-director Cronenberg's first feature since 'Maps to the Stars' eight years ago gathers up a lifetime of personal obsessions in a story Cronenberg conceived late last century, and only now has gotten around to filming, the way no else could.
