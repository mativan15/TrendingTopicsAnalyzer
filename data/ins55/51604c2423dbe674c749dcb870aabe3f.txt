It looks like there will be plenty of holiday cheer in downtown Durham.

The Durham City Council on Monday night moved to establish an open container social district where alcohol consumption is allowed on public streets.

About a week after hearing a presentation on creating a social district for the first time, the council unanimously voted Monday to adopt an ordinance establishing a district that covers much of the downtown area. The city will be using Downtown Durham Inc. (DDI) as the official partner to execute the project.
