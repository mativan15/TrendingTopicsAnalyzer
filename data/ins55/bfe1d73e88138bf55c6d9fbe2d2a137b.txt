The Oklahoma City Thunder have added to their roster.
The Thunder signed guard Isaiah Joe to a multi-year deal, per The Athletic's Shams Charania.
This comes two days after the Philadelphia 76ers waived the 23-year-old guard.
Joe is entering the third season of his career after going 49th overall in the second round of the 2020 NBA draft. In 96 career games, Joe averaged 3.7 points and one rebound on 35.5 percent shooting.
With the addition, the Thunder will need to make roster space in order to have Joe on the 17-man roster.
