Influential Oakland retailer Sherri McMullen, who has made it part of her ethos to support designers of color at her inclusive luxury specialty store, is in expansion mode, with plans to boost her growing e-commerce channel and launch a young designer incubator at a new 10,000-square-foot warehouse space.

The fashion leader is also marking her 15th anniversary by taking her store on the road, starting in L.A.'s Leimert Park neighborhood, where she will have several events this weekend, then popping up in Detroit for six months beginning in September, and hosting a three-day celebration and runway show in November in the Bay Area with 15 exclusives from 15 designers.
