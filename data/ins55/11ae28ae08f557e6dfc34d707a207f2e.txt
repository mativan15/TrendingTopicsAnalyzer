Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on October 17, 2022, extended the validity of the search committee formed to identify the next Vice Chancellor of Kerala University by three months. The Raj Bhavan issued the notification as the term of the committee that came into being on August 5 was set to expire on November 4. The extension will come into effect from November 5 and all other terms of the previous notification will remain unchanged, the order stated. The Chancellor had created a flutter when he departed from conventions to constitute the search committee without including the nominee of the university's Senate.
