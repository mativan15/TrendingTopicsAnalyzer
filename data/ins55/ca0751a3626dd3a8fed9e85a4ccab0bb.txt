Von Miller walked behind the lectern inside the tight quarters of a room reserved for a Bills news conference, less than half an hour after his team beat the Chiefs here at Arrowhead Stadium. He began with an opening statement, of sorts.

'Howdy,' he said, and then he offered a grin. 'I came in this stadium a whole bunch of times, and I've been at this same podium, and I ain't have no smile. So it's good to come in here and smile.'

For years, the Denver Broncos could not beat the Patrick Mahomes-led Chiefs with Von Miller at this stadium, but on Sunday, the Bills would not have won without him.
