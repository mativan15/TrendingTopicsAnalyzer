Taiwan and Brazil have been touted as better investment destinations than Britain after Morgan Stanley warned of the 'daunting' task faced by new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.
Andrew Sheets, a strategist at the lender, told investors that 'better opportunity is in emerging market equities' and pointed to Korea, Taiwan and Brazil as possible alternatives.
Hours after his note was published, Chinese president Xi Jinping delivered a bellicose speech in which he refused to rule out the use of force in Beijing's quest to wrest control of Taiwan.
