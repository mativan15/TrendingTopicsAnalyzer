Image source, PA MediaA scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April as the government looks to save money, the new chancellor has said. Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limited a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost "significantly less than planned". But he said he would ensure there was enough support for those most in need.The government stepped in last month to protect consumers from soaring energy bills after Russia invaded Ukraine.
