OHSU's first chief people officer started on the job this week.

Qiana Williams brings 20-plus years in human resources, most recently at OhioHealth, where she served as chief diversity, inclusion and culture officer, then vice president for total rewards and HR operations.

OHSU launched a search last spring to fill the newly created role of executive vice president and chief people officer after an outside investigation into workplace culture concluded OHSU had 'devalued and marginalized' its HR functions and failed to provide sufficient resources, experienced leadership or adequate authority.
