A couple won a life-changing £105 million lottery. But they didn't really get their heads in the clouds and kept being grounded. How? By buying second-hand cars and doing a lot of DIYs to make things life better. Builder Steve Thomson and his wife Lenka brought a second-hand van and car after winning the huge lottery price. Just because the couple has earned a lot of money, they didn't want to spend the entire amount.  AlamyAfter revealing that he has won the lottery, Steve purchased a second-hand van for himself followed by a Volvo XC90 for Lenka.
