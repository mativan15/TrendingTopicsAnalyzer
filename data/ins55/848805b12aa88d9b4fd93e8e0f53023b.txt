Australia has reversed a previous government's recognition of west Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the foreign minister has said, prompting consternation from Israel. The centre-left Labor Party government on Tuesday agreed to again recognise Tel Aviv as the capital. The Cabinet also reaffirmed that Jerusalem's status must be resolved in peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said. Australia remained committed to a two-party solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, and 'we will not support an approach that undermines this prospect', Wong said.
