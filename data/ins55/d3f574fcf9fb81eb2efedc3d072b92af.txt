Foxtel will offer an ad-supported version of entertainment service Binge, in a move that emulates global streaming giant Netflix and other platforms that are looking at new ways to make money as subscriber growth slows.The new tier, which will roll out some time in 2023, will offer brands the chance to integrate ads before and during programs such as House of Dragon, Euphoria and Succession. Foxtel said there would be no more than four minutes of ads per hour.Advertisements will now run before and during episodes of shows such as Euphoria, which runs ad-free on Binge.
