Hardik Pandya corrected a dip in his stock price with a memorable IPL 2022 campaign. He delivered the title to Gujarat Titans as a first-time captain, performed with bat and ball, and overcame all injury doubts.The exclamation point came in the final here against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday when an all-round show (3/17 and 34) earned him the ‘Player-of-the-Match' award. His shrewd captaincy through the tournament was particularly impressive, given that this is Hardik's first attempt at a major leadership role.
