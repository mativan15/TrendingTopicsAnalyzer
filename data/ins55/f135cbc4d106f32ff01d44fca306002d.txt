Nick Cannon's ninth baby has been the subject of death threats, the baby girl's mother has revealed. 
The TV presenter, 42, welcomed his ninth baby Onyx with model LaNisha Cole, 40, in September, and has since had a 10th child with Brittany Bell. 
When baby Onyx was born, Nick had appealed to his followers not to send hate messages to Lanisha or the child, saying at the time: ‘As we all know I am not easily triggered and have quite tough skin and have always been an open book but not everyone in my family has that same level of strength.
