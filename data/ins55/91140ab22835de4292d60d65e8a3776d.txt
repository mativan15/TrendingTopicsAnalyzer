The crew of the ill-fated western "Rust" is scouting new locations to resume filming the movie with plans to have a safety officer on set.

"The production of ‘Rust' will not return to New Mexico," Melina Spadone, Attorney for Rust Movie Productions LLC, told Fox News Digital late Wednesday. "The production is considering other locations, including in California, but no decisions have been made."

The news comes nearly a year after director of photography Halyna Hutchins died when a gun held by actor Alec Baldwin accidentally discharged during a rehearsal, striking her.
