Anna May Wong, considered to be the first Chinese American film star in Hollywood, is getting her own quarter.

The late star's quarter, which is set to begin shipping on Oct. 24, is the fifth coin in the United States Mint American Women Quarters™ Program, which honors trailblazing women.

Wong, who died in 1961, got the first leading role of her career in the 1922 silent film The Toll of the Sea.
