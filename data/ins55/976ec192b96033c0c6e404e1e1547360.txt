Retail sales in Great Britain fell more steeply than expected in September as soaring prices prompted consumers to rein in spending and many stores lost trading on the day of the Queen's funeral.The Office for National Statistics said retail sales dropped by 1.4% in September, against a forecast of a 0.5% fall by City economists, and marks the first month that volumes have fallen below pre-pandemic levels.According to the latest figures, food store sales fell 1.8% as increasingly budget conscious consumers cut spending amid concerns over price rises and the cost of living.
