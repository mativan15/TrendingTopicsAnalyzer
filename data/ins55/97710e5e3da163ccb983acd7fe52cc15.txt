The Miami Hurricanes found their mojo Saturday on homecoming day — Virginia Tech homecoming, that is.

They also found a go-to receiver — junior-college transfer Colbie Young — among a corps that has been aching for one, and added strong special teams and until the fourth quarter a smothering defense that held the Hokies to 257 yards (78 rushing).

Call it the road to recovery, as Miami defeated Virginia Tech 20-14, despite the Hokies scoring two touchdowns in the final quarter and rejuvenating the capacity crowd.
