 NEW YORK - Puerto Rico is among 38 states, territories, and Indian Nations that will receive U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funding for its beach water monitoring and notification programs. The funding is being awarded under the BEACH Act. This year, EPA is expected to award about $10 million across the country, and Puerto Rico will receive $330,000 in BEACH Act funding. Since 2002 EPA's partners have used nearly $206 million in BEACH Act grants to protect beachgoers by monitoring beaches for bacteria, maintaining and operating public notification systems, identifying local pollution sources, and reporting results to EPA.
