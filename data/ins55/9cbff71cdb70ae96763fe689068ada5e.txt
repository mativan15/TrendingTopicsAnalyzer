Since the phrase ‘MeToo' hit the zeitgeist in 2017, Tarana Burke has earned a global platform. But as she tells theGrio, her focus on Black communities and survival has never wavered.

Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part interview with Tarana Burke in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the #MeToo movement. The second installment will be published on Sunday, Oct. 16.

It only took a hashtag to forever change Tarana Burke's life as she knew it.
