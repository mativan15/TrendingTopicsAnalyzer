Doc Midnight Society 
I continue to be somewhat perplexed by the new upcoming game from Dr. Disrespect and his studio Midnight Society. He's working on an upcoming shooter with some truly talented folks, but so far, the main focus of promotion for the game has been its integration with NFTs and the blockchain. Even as the rest of the core gaming industry has shied away from web3 tech after player backlash, Midnight Society is going full steam ahead, for better or worse. Today, Midnight Society has announced it is working with Polygon Studios 'to construct a game publishing platform on the Polygon blockchain where players can trade their in-game items freely without incurring high transaction fees or negatively impacting the environment.
