APThe Biden administration is pressing states to prioritize large-volume sites like children's hospitals, and to make appointments available outside regular work hours to make it easier for parents to get their kids vaccinated.The Biden administration said Thursday that children under 5 may be able to get their first COVID-19 vaccination doses as soon as June 21, if federal regulators authorise shots for the age group, as expected. White House COVID-19 coordinator Aashish Jha outlined the administration's planning for the last remaining ineligible age group to get shots.
