Insomniac has insisted that Spider-Man 2 has not suffered a delayed, and implied that they just don't have time for previews right now.
The pandemic may have been good for the games industry in terms of providing people with something to do when stuck at home, but its effect on publisher's output is going to be felt for several years to come. Not just in the lack of new games, which has been especially evident this year, but in the lack of previews too.
Although announced years previously, many games, such as the upcoming Need For Speed Unbound, are not being shown properly until just months before their release, but in a comment about Spider-Man 2 developer Insomniac Games made it clear this isn't necessarily intentional.
