Indiewire Paul Dano has played a 'Batman' villain and a Beach Boy, but the Emmy nominee had no desire to play a presumed child kidnapper in 'Prisoners.'The Denis Villeneuve-directed film stars Hugh Jackman, Viola Davis, and Terence Howard as parents whose children are taken. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective on the case, as the local community fingers Dano's character and his suspicious mother (Melissa Leo) as being involved. The 2013 film was nominated for Best Cinematography for Roger Deakins' work.
