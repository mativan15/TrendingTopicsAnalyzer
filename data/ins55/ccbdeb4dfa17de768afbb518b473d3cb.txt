Fashion Week ended some time ago, but Intuit MailChimp and Black in Fashion Council's (BFIC) commitment to creating access to digital tools, mentorship, and capital is ongoing. Black designers and fashion entrepreneurs have made immeasurable contributions to the fashion industry for decades. And arguably have been under-resourced. For those reasons, MailChimp and BCIF have partnered. MailChimp empowers customers to start and grow their businesses with world-class marketing technology, award-winning customer support, and content as an email marketing and automation company.
