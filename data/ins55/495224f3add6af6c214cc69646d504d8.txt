If you're a regular reader of the tech and business press, it's been painting a pretty gloomy economic picture recently, with a tendency to accentuate the negative. There's inflation and layoffs and supply chain problems, oh my!

Earlier this week, the company reported revenue was up for the quarter a healthy 24%, to $7.4 billion. Analysts had expected $7.38 billion.
