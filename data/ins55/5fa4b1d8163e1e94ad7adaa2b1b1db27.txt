NEW DELHI: India is the worst affected among G20 nations by carbon emission-induced rise in temperatures, losing $159 billion (5.4% of its GDP) in 2021 due to labour capacity reduction caused by extreme heat, says a report released on Thursday by Climate Transparency. According to the report, carbon emissions from energy use rebounded by 5.9% across G20 nations last year and surpassed pre-pandemic levels, causing huge income losses in services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors.
