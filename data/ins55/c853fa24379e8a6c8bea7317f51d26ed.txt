The Joe Biden administration on Wednesday lifted a series of restrictions imposed by the former president, including prohibitions on flights, to Cuba.The restrictions had prevented US airlines and chartered flights from going to Cuban cities except for Havana. The US transportation department issued the order after secretary of state Antony Blinken sent a letter asking it to revoke the restrictions.Mr Blinken said the action was "in support of the Cuban people, and in the foreign policy interests of the United States".
