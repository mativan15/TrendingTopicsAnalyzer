What is the obedience and sacrifice of the
world, Why the Church Focuses on Sacrifice
What is God's obedience, God's sacrifice 2. Preface
• Although the church exists in today's society, God requires
the church not to be friends with the world, but the church
can easily obey the world's thoughts and run the church
with secular concepts. Of course, the results can be seen in
a short period of time, for example, the number of people
who join the church increases, and the income of the
church also skyrockets, but these are worthless to God,
because when the church is linked to money, the word of
God no longer has an effect.
