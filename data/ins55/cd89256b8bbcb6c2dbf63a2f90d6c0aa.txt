Tim Allen has been slated on Twitter after sharing a bizarre ‘joke' about ‘woke' people.
The Toy Story actor left his social media fans baffled on Monday when he questioned where the ‘wokees clubhouse was'.
‘Who is the face of woke,' the 69-year-old penned to his 882k followers.
‘Do wokees have a club house in someone's backyard or maybe a cute yet safe playpen somewhere?'
Unsurprisingly, he was met with instant backlash over the comment, with one branding his words ‘disappointing'.
A Twitter user replied: ‘Really hit *send tweet* on this thinking it was a banger, huh, Tim Allen?'


Who is the face of woke.
