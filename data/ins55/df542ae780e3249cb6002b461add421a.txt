LG VK Saxena has granted permission to Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for probing the role of 82 prison officials under the Prevention of Corruption Act, in the organized crime syndicate being run by conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar from Rohini Jail here, sources said on Wednesday. The LG has also noted that the Prison Department was under the now jailed AAP leader and minister Satyendar Jain. Under him, it was marred with "several serious controversies including confiscation of mobile phones from prisoners", following which jamming devices were installed in and around various jail premises recently, the LG Office sources said.
