Growing up, my teachers pretty much skipped over the Korean War, as if it were a conflict which really didn't matter in the grand scheme of things. That is, of course, preposterous for several reasons I won't get into here. Instead, the purpose of this article, which is appropriately publishing on the federally observed Independence Day, is to highlight the use of motorcycles on Korean battlefields. Just like the war in my classes, this is a topic often skipped over when discussing the history of military motorcycles, so I want to shed some light on the subject as a way to honor the brave men who fought and the many who died to secure freedom for the people of the South Korea.
