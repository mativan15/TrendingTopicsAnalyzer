Vandalism caught on camera in Chinatown over the weekend left a new mural damaged and had the local business community sharing their frustration with ongoing graffiti and other property damage. The video was captured by a security camera at eevee's, a store selling e-scooters and other personal electronic vehicles, early Sunday morning on East Pender Street. It shows someone spray-painting the side of a neighbouring business, the Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Company. The person occasionally ducks into an alley but re-emerges repeatedly over the course of about 15 minutes, sometimes with people passing by.
