Published: 12:04 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 12:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 Tory MP Johnny Mercer has said Liz Truss laughed at him when she sacked him as veterans minister, saying the move was a 'gut punch' that cast him into depression. He also said the Prime Minister had lost authority by turning the Conservatives into a 'libertarian' party and handing Labour a massive poll lead. The Plymouth Moor View MP said that in dismissing him, Ms Truss reneged on the promise she made during her Tory leadership campaign that veterans' affairs would not be downgraded under her Government.
