When I was young, there was a common adage 'youth are the leaders of tomorrow,' and I was always looking forward, with optimism that this tomorrow will indeed come one day. When I graduated from the youth bracket, I realized that it's time to rethink the adage and perhaps express it as 'youth as leaders now.' The youth are the largest generation of the current humankind. Half of the world's population is less than 30 years and nearly 90% of the world's youth live in less developed countries. It is therefore not surprising to see that Malawi's population is largely youthful, with 80%of its population aged below 35.
