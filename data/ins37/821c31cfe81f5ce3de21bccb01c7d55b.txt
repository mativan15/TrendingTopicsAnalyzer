Delhi police Friday told a court that real estate tycoons Sushil and Gopal Ansal tampering with evidence in the 1997 case of Uphaar cinema fire, which had claimed 59 lives, "seriously eroded the judicial integrity of entire Delhi judiciary." The prosecution submitted to District Judge Dharmesh Sharma while opposing a plea filed by the Ansal brothers challenging their conviction and the 7-year jail terms by a magisterial court in November last year. The court had also imposed a fine of Rs 2.25 crore each on the Ansals.
