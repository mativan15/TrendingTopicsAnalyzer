Laura Anglin, an economist who during nearly two decades in New York government served as the state's budget director and, as the city's chief operating officer, helped manage the response to the coronavirus pandemic, died on Thursday in a Manhattan hospital. She was 57.

The cause was lung cancer, her brother John Svitek said.

Ms. Anglin's sweeping portfolio as a public official included administering, as deputy comptroller for retirement services, $6 billion in yearly pension benefits for a million current and former state employees.
