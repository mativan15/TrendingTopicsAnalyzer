Jamie Oliver is branching out from cookbooks as he announces he has written a novel for children.
The celebrity chef, 47, is no stranger to being published, with multiple books on how to cook and prepare healthy meals, but his newest venture is something ‘very special.'
Jamie revealed in a special announcement on Thursday that his first-ever children's book, Billy and the Giant Adventure, would be released next year.
