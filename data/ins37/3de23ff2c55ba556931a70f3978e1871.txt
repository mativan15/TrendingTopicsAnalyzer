I first recommended TTI in an article that was published on 2/22/22 (Tetra Technologies Stock: A Potential Double In One Year (NYSE:TTI)). I wrote that article before Q4 2021 earnings came out on 2/28/22, and importantly, before Russia invaded Ukraine. When I wrote my first article three months ago, WTI crude was trading at around $91, natural gas was around $4, and TTI was trading at $2.
