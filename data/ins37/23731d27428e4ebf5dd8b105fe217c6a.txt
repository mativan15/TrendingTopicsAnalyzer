Thanks to federal subsidies, sucking methane out of landfills is twice as profitable per unit of energy versus pumping oil — with zero carbon emissions. BP yesterday agreed to buy landfill gas producer Archaea Energy for $3.3 billion cash plus the assumption of $800 million in debt. The biggest winner is Daniel Rice IV, the 41-year-old chairman of Archaea, who with his brothers will receive more than $700 million in the deal.
