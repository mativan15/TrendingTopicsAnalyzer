The alleged kingpin of a Chinese rhino-horn smuggling gang has broken out of prison in Namibia after nipping to the lavatory, the authorities in the southern African country said.Wang Hui, 47, a Chinese citizen, is on the run after escaping from the Windhoek Correctional Facility near the country's capital, where he was serving a 15-year sentence for smuggling controlled wildlife products.Wang's associates were arrested at Hosea Kutako airport in March 2014 after customs officers found a leopard skin and 14 rhino horns worth an estimated £2 million stuffed in their suitcases.
