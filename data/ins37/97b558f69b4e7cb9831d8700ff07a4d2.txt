Starlink is a satellite-broadband service designed to boost broadband speeds for people who aren't within reach of high-speed fibre internet.The company is now planning to bring the service to the aviation industry, potentially providing a huge hike in speed compared to the patchy Wi-Fi access on today's planes. Indeed, it could be even faster than the Wi-Fi on the ground at Heathrow, and in some areas of the UK.The new service, dubbed Starlink Aviation, will 'deliver up to 350Mbits/sec to each plane, enabling all passengers to access streaming-capable internet at the same time,' the company claims.
