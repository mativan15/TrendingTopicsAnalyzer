The death of a toddler created a heightened awareness of non-accidental injuries at the hospital he was discharged from ahead of the tragedy, a coroner has heard. The case caused considerable distress among staff and is still talked about at the hospital years later, a doctor said on day four of the toddler's coronial inquest. The toddler died of fatal injuries at his home, which were inflicted by the partner of the toddler's mother, a coroner found in 2021. The second part of a coroner's hearing, in Wellington this week, examines the role of multiple agencies leading to a toddler being in the care of the man who caused his death.
