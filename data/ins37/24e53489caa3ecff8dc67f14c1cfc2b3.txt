Restaurants that struggled to survive the pandemic are now worried they could close their doors for good after the Senate effectively killed legislation that would have provided more funding.

The Senate in May failed to advance the Small Business COVID Relief Act, which included $40 billion to refill the Restaurant Revitalization Fund set up by a separate relief bill in March 2021.

Restaurants argued the new money was necessary because nearly 177,000 restaurants that applied for funding were left out of $28 billion in grants sent to just 105,000 restaurants.
