Tracy Slocum, CEO and founder of the Latham clothing business Pretty Rugged, scored a deal Friday night on the national TV show "Shark Tank."

Two of the Sharks — Robert Herjavec and Lori Greiner — offered $200,000 for a 25% stake in the company, which makes blankets, scarves and other products with faux fur on one side and waterproof, washable fabric on the other.

Slocum countered, asking if they would accept 20%.

"Tracy, we feel pretty good about that offer," Herjavec said, making it clear he and Grenier were sticking to their original offer.
