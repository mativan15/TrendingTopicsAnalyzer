The Treasury Department sanctioned a Russian national and two of his companies on Wednesday for allegedly transferring sensitive U.S.-based military technology to Russia.

Yury Yuryevich Orekhov, and his companies Nord-Deutsche Industrieanlagenbau GmbH (NDA GmbH) and Opus Energy Trading LLC, were sanctioned on Wednesday over a scheme that allegedly obtained advanced semiconductor and microprocessor technology from the U.S. and transferred it to Russian entities, including sanctioned companies.

The technology — which can be used in fighter aircraft, ballistic and hypersonic missile systems, smart munitions, radar and satellites — has been found in Russian weapons used in the war in Ukraine.
