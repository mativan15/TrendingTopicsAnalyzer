It looks like Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBGI) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Sinclair Broadcast Group's shares before the 31st of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of June.
