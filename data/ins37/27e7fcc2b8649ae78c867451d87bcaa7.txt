When Complex was first building ComplexLand, the virtual shopping experience created in 2020 to substitute for the popular ComplexCon shopping event due to the pandemic, words like 'metaverse' and acronyms like 'NFT' weren't yet mainstream.

Then in January 2021, one month after the first ComplexLand experience, the mainstream media caught up to Web3.0, NFTs and all things in the metaverse as well as the gamified shopping experience that Complex developed in lieu of its revenue-generating ComplexCon.
