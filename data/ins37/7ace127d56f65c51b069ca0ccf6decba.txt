ANIFormer Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shivraj PatilThe BJP on Friday stepped up its attack against the Congress over its leader and former Home Minister Shivraj Patil's claim that Bhagavad Gita also spoke of jihad, saying that this is one more attempt by the opposition party to smear Hindutva. BJP national spokesperson Prem Shukla alleged that the Congress has long been involved in the conspiracy to "insult Hindu, Hindutva and Hindustan" and Patil's remarks are yet another chapter towards this. Meanwhile, the Congress has distanced itself from Patil's alleged comments about Lord Krishna "talking about jihad" in the Hindu holy book Bhagavad Gita.
