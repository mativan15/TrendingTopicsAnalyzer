As his Telugu Desam Party took out joint rallies with Pawan Kalyan's Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday, Chandrababu Naidu said that over 3,000 farmers had died by suicide in the state since Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy became chief minister in 2019.
'Each farmer has already spent Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore per acre and suffered losses due to the heavy unseasonal rains, but the chief minister is least bothered about them,' the former chief minister said after visiting Palnadu district, from where large-scale crop damage was reported.
