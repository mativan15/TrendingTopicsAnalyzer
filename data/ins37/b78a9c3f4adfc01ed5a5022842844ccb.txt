Around the world — in 25,000 miles!
An extreme athlete is preparing to run 40,075 kilometers around the world — or 24,901 miles, which equals the circumference of the Earth — to raise money for UNICEF.
Tomasz Drybala, 44, plans to spend more than three years completing his goal.
The Polish man, who has lived in London for 21 years, will run from London to Athens, from Cairo to Kuwait City, from Indonesia up through South East Asia to Hong Kong, then from the West to the East coast of the US, starting in Los Angeles and finishing in New York.
