After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sought to out-hawk President Biden and the Democrats.He complained that Ukraine hadn't gotten enough help in advance and baselessly ventured that Russia 'probably' wouldn't have attacked if it had been provided with more weapons. He also pushed for the United States to provide aircraft to Ukraine when the Biden administration viewed that as impractical and of limited utility.In a new interview, though, McCarthy is singing a significantly different tune.
