Wisconsin football fell short of expectations last season, finishing with a 9-4 record, and a Las Vegas Bowl victory over Arizona State.

More importantly, Wisconsin failed to win the Big Ten West for the second consecutive year, forcing UW to make some significant changes this offseason.

Coach Chyrst brought in a new offensive coordinator, running backs coach, and shifted Bob Bostad and Chris Haering into new roles as the offensive line and tight ends coach respectively.

In addition to the changes on the coaching staff, UW will be tasked with replacing six offensive starters, and eight from the nation's top rated defense.
