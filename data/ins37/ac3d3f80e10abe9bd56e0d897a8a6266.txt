As the two best teams in the American League, they would have to meet in the A.L. Championship Series to decide the league pennant and the right to play in the World Series.

It was a more winding road for the Yankees, who earned a 5-1 victory on Tuesday in the winner-takes-all Game 5 of a division series against the Cleveland Guardians that felt like it may never end.
