The Delhi High Court Friday reserved its judgement on the Enforcement Directorate's petition against the trial court direction permitting a lawyer to remain present at a distance during AAP minister Satyendar Jain's questioning. Jain was remanded to the central agency's custody on May 31 till June 9 in a case of alleged money laundering.
The court however declined to stay the trial court permission, even as the central agency argued that its petition would become infructuous since Jain's custody with the ED would come to an end next week.
