British actor Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter film franchise, credited his co-star and longtime friend Emma Watson with encouraging him to write about his struggles with alcoholism and multiple stints in rehab in his new memoir.  In Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard, Felton says he began drinking more heavily after he moved to Los Angeles, 'craving normality' in the thick of Hollywood. It took Felton several tries to get sober, and he says his first stint in rehab didn't last long, with the actor walking off the grounds after just a few days.
