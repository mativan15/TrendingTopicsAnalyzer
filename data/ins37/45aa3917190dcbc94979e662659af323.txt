The deal is expected to close in November and will expand US-based FLEETCOR's lodging business into Europe as well as provide a platform for further international growth.

The acquisition comes after Roomex recently doubled its headcount and launched its preferred hotel programme in 2020 following an earlier Series A fundraising round that secured €8 million.
