Arsenal's Europa League campaign faces its biggest test tonight as the Gunners take on PSV Eindhoven in a rearranged clash after the initial fixture was postponed following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Three points tonight will put the London side a massive step closer to sealing a spot in the knockout rounds.

Since losing to Manchester United in early September, the Gunners have recorded a seven-match winning run defeating both Tottenham (3-1) and Liverpool (3-2) during that time as well as back-to-back Europa League victories over Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt.
