BOSTON – Eleven people, including two from Braintree and Canton, have been charged in connection with a sophisticated international money laundering and drug trafficking organization involving cocaine and the drug ecstasy, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI said.

Authorities identified the South Shore suspects as Licheng Huang, 39, of Braintree, and Feng Chen, 38, of Canton. The other suspects are from Winthrop, Saugus, Rhode Island and New York.

'We allege that this group of individuals conspired to sell deadly narcotics in Massachusetts communities, then laundered millions of dollars' worth of their drug proceeds through a global network to conceal their illegal activity," said U.
