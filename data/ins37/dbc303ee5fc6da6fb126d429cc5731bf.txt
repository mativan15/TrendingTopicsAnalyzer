May 28—A federal grand jury indicted a California couple Thursday for allegedly defrauding the Paycheck Protection Program of more than $1.36 million in loan funds.

Christopher Mazzei, 44, and Erin Mazzei, 41, of Arroyo Grande, Calif., were indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy in connection with a scheme to defraud the government of PPP loan funds meant to provide COVID-19-related relief to small businesses.

The couple allegedly submitted applications for PPP funds to a Hawaii financial institution and two other financial institutions on behalf of three purported businesses using interstate wires, the Hawaii U.
