Advanced Ionics, a climate-tech startup that hails from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is striving to drive down the price of green hydrogen by slashing how much electricity is needed for electrolysis by as much as 50%.
That's an admirable goal, because despite all the talk of hydrogen as a 'fuel of the future,' the industry is still filthy for the most part — driving climate chaos via pollution-spewing production methods.
Most of the hydrogen gas that humans produce is 'grey'; a classification that means the producers rely on methane (or worse, burning coal) to isolate the element for use in fertilizer and as fuel.
