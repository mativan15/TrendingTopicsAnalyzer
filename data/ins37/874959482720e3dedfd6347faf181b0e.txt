Amitabh, who is hosting Kaun Banega Crorepati 14 on Sony Entertainment Television, said on the latest episode that he is working on starting a podcast with Abhishek. While talking to contestant Surabhi Geetey, who shared with Big B that she had a podcast, the actor expressed his interest in the medium. He said that Navya's podcast features the women of the Bachchan family — Shweta Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan — and now he wants to start one with junior Bachchan because the men of the Bachchan family were not included in Navya's podcast.
