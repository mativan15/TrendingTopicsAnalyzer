Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Immersion Corp. (NASDAQ:IMMR) has filed a complaint against Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) in U.S. District Court, accusing the company of violating patents covering "haptic" effects in augmented reality and virtual reality. Immersion says that Meta's AR/VR products, including the popular Meta Quest 2 headset, infringe six of its patents covering haptic effects (that is, touch feedback technology). It's looking both to enjoin Meta from further infringement, and to "recover a reasonable royalty" for the alleged infringement.
