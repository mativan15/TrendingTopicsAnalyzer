A trickle of House GOP lawmakers have expressed support for or openness to banning assault-style rifles in recent years and in wake of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas last week. 
As a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Senate discuss potential legislative action on gun violence in wake of the massacre, the House GOP members' positions show a small yet notable contingent of Republicans in favor of some type of gun restrictions despite the party being largely averse to gun control measures.
