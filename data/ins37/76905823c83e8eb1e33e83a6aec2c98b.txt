May 27—Lisa Marie McDaniel and the Pint Pirates at Brunswick High School had plenty of reason to celebrate at the end of the school year.

The early childhood education program again this year had the full support of the student body during the annual Mr. BHS competition, when a group of students donned tuxedos and carried buckets from class to class and around the school encouraging students and staff to support the fundraiser.

"Mr. BHS is our biggest fundraiser," said McDaniel, early education pathway instructor at Brunswick High.
