Former partners Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis have issued a joint statement after their former nanny gave a bombshell interview about their breakup. In a statement, the pair alleged that the former nanny, who was not named in the interview, had been on an '18-month-long campaign' of harassment.'As parents, it is incredibly upsetting to learn that a former nanny of our two young children would choose to make such false and scurrilous accusations about us publicly,' the former couple wrote in their statement to People.
