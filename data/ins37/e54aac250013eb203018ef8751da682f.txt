When looking at the Nest Learning Thermostat vs. Nest Thermostat, both are go-to smart devices for adjusting temperature around the home. After all, they're Nests -- the flagship brand for home temperature automation. You can say that the Nest Learning Thermostat is the parent and the Nest Thermostat is the child. Before Google bought Nest, the company released the Nest Learning Thermostat (2011), which was revolutionary during its time for its sleek, understated design. The model is still alive and well today.
