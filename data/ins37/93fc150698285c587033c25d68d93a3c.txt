Frogs may not the first thing you think of when it comes to romance, but that's not stopping indie singer-songwriter Cavetown from writing a tender love song about them. See latest videos, charts and news 
 On Wednesday (Oct. 19), Cavetown — known off stage as Robin Skinner — debuted his new single 'Frog' off his upcoming album Worm Food (out Nov. 4 via Sire Records). The shimmery folk ballad follows Skinner as he proclaims his love for his partner through the lens of 'two amphibian lovers.' The accompanying video follows a similar vein: Skinner, seated on a toadstool in the middle of a mushroom-covered bog, sings plainly into the camera.
