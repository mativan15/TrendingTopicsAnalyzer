West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday once again batted for former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly and targeted the BJP-led central government for allegedly depriving him by not nominating him for the International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman's post, describing it as a "shameless political vendetta".



'Sourav Ganguly was deprived of the BCCI's nomination to fight ICC chief's election. He was deprived to secure someone else's interests; it was a shameless political vendetta,' Banerjee told reporters.
