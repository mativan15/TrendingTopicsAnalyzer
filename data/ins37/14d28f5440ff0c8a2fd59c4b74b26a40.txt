Two years of the pandemic have widened the gender gap in white-collar gig economy jobs in India, data from freelance platform Flexing It shows, suggesting that the new normal of working may be adding to the barriers women face at work. Indian women are opting out of the workforce even as freelancers, according to data from the white-collar gig jobs platform which was shared exclusively with ET.

While the absolute number of women consultants registering as freelancers on the platform increased in FY22 from FY20, the percentage of women consultants vis-a-vis total new registrations dropped.
