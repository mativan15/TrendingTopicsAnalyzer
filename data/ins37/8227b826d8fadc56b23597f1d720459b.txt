Jun. 5—METHUEN — The City Council made a relatively modest reduction of $165,524 to the proposed budget for fiscal year 2023 during its May 31 meeting.

The cut resulted in a slight decrease in this year's grand total, which is now $200 million. Within that figure, $184.2 million is from the General Fund and $15.8 million is from the Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund.

The Department of Public Works (DPW) took the brunt of the hit with a total reduction of $120,000, bringing its new budget figure to $7.
