Royal Bank of Canada has become caught up in efforts by Texas to limit action by banks against gun manufacturers and fossil fuel companies as attention intensifies on the divisive issues.Texas passed laws last year that bar state contracts, including in its sizable municipal bond market, from going to banks and other financial institutions that either boycott energy companies or "discriminate" against a firearm entity or trade association.RBC says it is in compliance with state laws, even as Texas officials are reviewing the bank's policy.
