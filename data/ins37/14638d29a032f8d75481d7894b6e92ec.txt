Tukwila voters will decide whether or not to raise the city's minimum wage by $3 on Nov. 8.

Historically, business communities have pushed back on campaigns to raise the minimum wage, but that's not the case in Tukwila.

Abdi Muhmmed is among the small-business owners now endorsing the movement. Muhmmed sees this as an equity issue, but also a way to increase traffic at his new restaurant, Dubai Cafeteria & Espresso. The more money Tukwila workers pocket, the more they've got to spend on sambusas at his place.
