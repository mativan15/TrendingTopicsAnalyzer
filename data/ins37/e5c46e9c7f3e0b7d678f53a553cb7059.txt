Russell Wilson might miss his first game with the Broncos, setting up Brett Rypien for his second career start against the Jets.Wilson is questionable with a hamstring injury he suffered in last week's overtime loss to the Chargers. Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett said it will be a game-time decision whether Wilson or Rypien gets the start Sunday at Empower Field.'We just want to be sure that (Wilson) can protect himself,' Hackett said. 'That's the most important thing.'Also in consideration is preserving Wilson's health for the long-haul of the season, which is already an uphill climb due to Denver's 2-4 start.
