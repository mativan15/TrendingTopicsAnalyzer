Published October 18, 2022 8:10pm EDT FOX Business anchor and correspondent Gerri Willis is no stranger to cancer. Willis first discovered she had advanced-stage breast cancer in 2016 after going in for a test when she noticed that her right nipple was inverted.  That marked just the beginning of her battle against stage 3 lobular breast cancer. Her nine-month road of treatment included a mastectomy of her right breast and four months of chemotherapy followed by reconstructive surgery and five weeks of daily radiation treatment.
