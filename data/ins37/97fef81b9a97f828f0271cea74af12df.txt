The market's focus is still on data, with the bloc´s harmonised consumer price index (HICP) due later in the session. A "notable upside surprise for our above-consensus record HICP of 8% seems required today to extend the sell-off as the above-average index extension provides support," Commerzbank analysts said in a note to customers, recommending buying Bunds in dips.
