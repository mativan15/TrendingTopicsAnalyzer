THE latest film by Rima Das, Tora's Husband, marks her return to familiar settings — her neighbourhood in Assam's Chhaygaon — under unfamiliar circumstances. Restless after being isolated in Mumbai during the first lockdown, when Das returned home in 2020, she spent about a month keenly observing how the lives around her had changed. The humdrum of everyday life was replaced with uncertainty and uneasiness in this small town. Though Das initially started writing it as a family drama, the feature film eventually became an insightful narrative about adapting to new realities as livelihoods were lost and relationships turned sour.
