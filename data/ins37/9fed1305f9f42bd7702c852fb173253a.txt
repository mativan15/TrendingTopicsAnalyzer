Jun. 1—Jackson County commissioners unanimously approved a $573.8 million county government budget Wednesday that includes $209.1 million in reserves.

The budget for the coming fiscal year that starts in July compares with the current fiscal year budget of $474 million with $190.8 million in reserves. In government accounting, governments must add their spending plus their reserves to get a budget total.

The county's already sizable savings got a big boost with $42.8 million from the American Rescue Plan Act, passed by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
