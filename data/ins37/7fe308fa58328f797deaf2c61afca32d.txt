May 28—A "pilgrimage" of faith leaders and community advocates plan to make a stop at the Yuba County Jail today in an effort to highlight those who have been "harmed by immigrant detention."

Yuba County Jail currently receives money from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency for the detention of individuals the federal agency brings in.

According to a release from the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, "faith leaders, community advocates, and immigrants impacted by the criminal-legal system have been hosting vigils and rallies demanding the just closure of these centers — meaning the release of those currently detained.
