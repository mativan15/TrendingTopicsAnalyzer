JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Reuters) - The South African rand slipped on Tuesday, as the dollar bounced back supported by demand for safe havens over ongoing inflation concerns.

At 1549 GMT, the rand traded at 15.6050 against the dollar, 0.89% weaker than its previous close.

The dollar index strengthened as Treasury yields climbed and worries over a further acceleration in global inflation kept investors' risk appetite at bay.

The South African government on Tuesday outlined new measures to curb steeply rising domestic fuel prices and ease pressure on consumers.
