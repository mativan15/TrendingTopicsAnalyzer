A Ukrainian orchestra conductor was murdered in the occupied city of Kherson over his refusal to participate in a concert put on by Russian authorities, the Ukrainian government said.
Yuri Kerpatenko — who was the chief conductor of the Kherson Philharmonic, as well as one of the city's chamber orchestras — had declined to join in a performance celebrating the 'improvement of peaceful life' in the occupied territory, Kyiv's Ministry of Culture and Information Policy said Saturday.
'On October 14, it became known about the brutal murder of the chief conductor of the Kherson Music and Drama Theater,' the agency said in a statement, citing local journalist Elena Vanina.
