The current inflation crunch and supply chain challenges have city administration proposing scaling back plans for the new west-end recreation centre and library. On Thursday, administration unveiled its recommended draft capital budget that council will spend the next two months considering. One suggestion was that the Lewis Farms Recreation Centre lose a few features to stick to the original budgeted amount. Site preparation work for the $311 million facility began this summer. To be located on the southwest side of 92 Avenue and Rosenthal Way, the new rec centre is to include indoor ice rinks, a fitness area, an aquatic centre, a gymnasium, an Edmonton Public Library branch, and a district park with sports fields.
