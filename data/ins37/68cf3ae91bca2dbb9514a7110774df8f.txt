Friday marks 100 days since Russia's President Vladimir Putin launched its invasion of Ukraine, killing more than 4,000 civilians, forcing more than 5 million people to flee and obliterating entire towns and cities.On February 24, Putin launched what he called a 'special military operation' on Ukraine to 'demilitarise and denazify' the country.While it was predicted the war would be quick, Ukraine held its ground and showed its resistance. This resilience came not just from its army, but also from its civilians and tech sector.
