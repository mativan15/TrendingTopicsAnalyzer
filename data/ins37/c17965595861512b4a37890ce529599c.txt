The Union government is planning to repurpose the Co-WIN platform for India's Universal Immunisation Programme and other national health programmes while continuing with its current function of recording Covid vaccination and issuing certificates. The vaccination record under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) is now maintained manually. 
"Once Co-WIN is repurposed to include the UIP, the entire vaccination system will become digitised, thus easing tracking beneficiaries and facilitating real-time monitoring," Co-WIN chief and CEO of the National Health Authority Dr R S Sharma said.
