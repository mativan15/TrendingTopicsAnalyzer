I've finally put something on eBay that people want – now I wish I hadn't

It was so exciting when eBay first started, a final reckoning with the fact that we all, between us, had enough stuff. We just had to keep it moving around so that it felt new to someone, and life's defining itch-scratch-itch cycle – earn-spend-earn – would be broken. All that would be left to destroy was private property, and wham, we would reach Arcadia (the state of simple pleasure, not the doomed fashion business).Then, it turned out that no one wanted my stupid stuff. I'd end up with a closing bid of £1.
