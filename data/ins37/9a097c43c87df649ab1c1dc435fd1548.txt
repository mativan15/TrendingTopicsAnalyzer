Picture yourself on the street you've seen in dozens of Hollywood films. Neat, colourful wooden houses; large front lawns; American flags; a cul-de-sac. We're in an every-neighbourhood in an anywhere-city in America in early 2016. Signs supporting Sanders, Clinton and Trump sit on neatly manicured (and not so manicured) lawns.But there's something strange in the neighbourhood — starting with the neighbours, which include Tom Hanks from The 'Burbs (1989) and Mike Myers from Wayne's World (1992). Annette Bening's Carolyn from American Beauty (1999) lives next door to Ice Cube in Next Friday (2000).
