The Washington Commanders are trending towards the top of the next NFL Draft. Could the team find its newest franchise quarterback?

The Washington Commanders are taking Sunday off after a 12-7 win over the Chicago Bears on Thursday Night Football.

This gives the team a chance to not only rest, but to scout talent more closely on the college and NFL fronts.

Compiling a 2-4 record through six weeks, the Commanders have not played up to expectations and the trade for Carson Wentz in the offseason hasn't proven to play out how Washington wanted.
