A man trying to run a woman over with his SUV crashed into a business when she jumped out of the way, according to a Florida police department.

Officers went to an address in Tampa, about 85 miles southwest of Orlando, at around 8 a.m. on Oct. 18 after a driver crashed his GMC vehicle through the front window of an establishment, according to a news release from the Tampa Police Department.

The 31-year-old driver was at the scene with a woman, who told police that she and the driver had been 'physically fighting all day,' the release says.
