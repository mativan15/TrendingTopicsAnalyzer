Britain is setting up a new hub for monkeypox research after nearly 3,500 cases of the virus were reported last month, dropping from the earlier surge seen in summer, according to the Government's latest update.  Health officials are trying to control the virus by assembling a new consortium of leading researchers and scientists from a dozen institutions. The hub is aiming to develop better diagnostic tests, such as lateral flows like those used during the Covid pandemic. It will also work to identify potential therapies and launch studies into the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine, which is currently being used to treat the virus.
