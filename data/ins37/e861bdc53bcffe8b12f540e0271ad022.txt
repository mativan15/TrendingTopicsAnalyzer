Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday barred Global Research and three individuals from the securities markets for 2 years for providing unauthorised advisory services without regulator's authorisation. The order came based on a complaint received by Sebi dated August 14, 2018 from the complainant against The Global Research and three individuals. Pursuant to complaint, the market watchdog conducted an examination of the activities of Global Research and thereafter issued a show cause notice in August 2021.
