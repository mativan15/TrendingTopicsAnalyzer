The downfall of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this year sent United Kingdom politics into chaos, worsened when his successor, Prime Minister Liz Truss, announced her resignation Thursday — only 45 days into her tenure.
 
Despite acting as premier during the historic transition between Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III, Truss' bigger legacy will be tarnishing her reputation as quickly as she built it, tanking the value of the British pound in her first few weeks at the helm.
 
Truss' hold on her own government weakened after announcing a tax plan that caused the pound to plunge and borrowing costs to spike.
