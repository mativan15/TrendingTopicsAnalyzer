Global police organization Interpol unveiled the first-ever Metaverse specifically designed for law enforcement worldwide at a surprise session of the 90th Interpol General Assembly in New Delhi on Thursday.

Fully operational, the Interpol Metaverse allows registered users to tour a virtual facsimile of the Interpol General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, interact with other officers via their avatars, and even take immersive training courses in forensic investigation and other policing capabilities – all from the comfort of their own home or offices.
