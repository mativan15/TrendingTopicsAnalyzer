Stocks in Asia are set to follow Wall Street higher after the S&P 500 closed above a key technical level and the reversal of the UK's vast fiscal stimulus bolstered global sentiment.

Equity futures rose for Japan, Australia and Hong Kong while a gauge of US-listed Chinese companies climbed the most in two weeks. UK bonds surged and the pound rallied in a boost to confidence that flowed through into the US session, with the S&P 500 rebounding above key support and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 notching its biggest gain since July.
