BJP spokesperson Nupur SharmaThe Congress on Sunday said the BJP's action against its two spokespersons over their remarks against Prophet Muhammad came under duress following "threats from external powers" and exposed its "muscular posturing". The ruling BJP on Sunday suspended its national spokesperson Nupur Sharma and expelled its Delhi media head Naveen Kumar Jindal after their alleged derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad. 
 Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused the BJP of pushing India into a dark age of religious polarisation to "subserve its parochial political agenda in the short term".
