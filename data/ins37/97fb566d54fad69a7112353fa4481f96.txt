More than 100 members of Edmonton's Chinatown community rallied in the name of safety at City Hall Saturday.
People who work and have businesses in the century-old area say they've had enough.'There is a serious problem facing Chinatown,' said Michael Lee, vice-chair of the Chinese Benevolent Association of Edmonton.'Our community is suffering because of a lot of disturbances culminating in the tragic loss of two innocent lives.'Those two community members were killed last week.Police initially responded to one attack Wednesday afternoon at an auto body shop near 106 Avenue and 98 Street, before quickly discovering another man had also been hurt a block south.
