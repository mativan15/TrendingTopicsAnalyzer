(AP) - New York Jets wide receiver Elijah Moore, who recently expressed frustration with his suddenly limited role, was excused from practice Thursday by the team to attend to a personal matter involving his family. Moore wasn't seen during the early portion of practice that reporters can watch. Coach Robert Saleh, who doesn't have a news conference on Thursdays, briefly updated reporters standing on the sideline on the reason for Moore's absence without providing details.
