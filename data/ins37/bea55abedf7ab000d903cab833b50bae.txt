From Marilyn Monroe's dress to Kris Jenner's bones, Kim Kardashian is all about turning Hollywood relics into wearable art.

Jenner made a shocking revelation at the top of Thursday's episode of The Kardashians, with the mogul matriarch telling daughters Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner that Kim made a "creepy" request ahead of her mom's hip-replacement surgery.

"Kim asked the doctor to save her my bones so she could make jewelry out of it," Kris told Khloe and Kylie (who listened via phone) as she recovered in her bedroom.
