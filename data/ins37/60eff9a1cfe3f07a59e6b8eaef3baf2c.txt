Manchester United icon Gary Neville made a blunt X-rated request after Liz Truss announced on Thursday that she would be stepping down as prime minister after less than two months in charge. Truss succeeded Boris Johnson in early September but the Conservative party has been left in political turmoil under her leadership, and she gave a speech outside Downing Street where she announced her resignation from the post. "I recognise that I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party," Truss said.
