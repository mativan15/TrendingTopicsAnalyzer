Amanda Holden accidentally gave fans a bit more than they bargained for as she shared an ad for a hair product in her dressing gown. 
The Britain's Got Talent presenter, 51, shared a clip of her in her bathroom with wet hair, holding up a purple shampoo designed for blonde hair, before undoing her bathrobe and suddenly being completely dressed up and ready for a night out. 
While it was a blink-and-you'd-miss-it moment, some eagle eyed fans immediately spotted that Amanda's nipple was visible for a fraction of a second when she ended the robe and turned to the side for the transition.
