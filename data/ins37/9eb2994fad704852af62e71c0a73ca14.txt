Web3 venture capital firm Paradigm has waded into the increasingly choppy waters of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) unprecedented attempt to sue a DAO in federal court.

Late Monday, the firm's attorneys filed a brief in the CFTC's ongoing lawsuit against Ooki DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization affiliated with decentralized finance company bZeroX. The CFTC recently fined bZeroX for 'illegally offering leveraged and margined retail commodity transactions in digital assets,' and for failing to collect mandatory information about the customers using its services.
