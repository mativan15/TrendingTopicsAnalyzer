A forecasted $14.6 million drop in photo radar and other fines has the city considering different ways to maintain funding for Edmonton police and traffic safety initiatives. On Wednesday, the city's executive committee proposed topping off the funding shortfall for the traffic safety automated enforcement reserve (TSAER) fund with a property tax increase between 2023-26. The TSAER, which gathers revenue from photo radar and other tickets, funded past snow and ice control programs and Vision Zero initiatives, like safe crossings, speed limit reduction projects, and safe speed toolkits.
