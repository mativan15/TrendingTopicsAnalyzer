NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG has approached at least one Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund for a capital injection, according to a source familiar with the situation, as the Swiss bank looks at ways to restructure its operations.

The size and other details of a potential injection could not be learned. Analysts have said the company might need as much as 9 billion Swiss francs ($9 billion), some of which may have to come from investors.
