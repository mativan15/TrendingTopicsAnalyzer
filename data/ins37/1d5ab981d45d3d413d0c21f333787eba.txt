A BLOKE so sick of forking out bucket loads of cash on his energy bills has decided to restore a WINDMILL in his garden to generate his own energy.
James Forsyth, 66, had been splurging £140 a month on electricity until he came up with a mind-blowing idea.

He decided to restore a derelict 1830s windmill in his back garden - defunct since 1925 - and it is now nearly ready to start spinning again.
