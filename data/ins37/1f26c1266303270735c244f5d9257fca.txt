miriam-doerr/iStock via Getty Images EZCORP, Inc. (NASDAQ:EZPW) operates over 1,150 pawnshops in the U.S. and Latin America. This is a segment recognized as being relatively countercyclical, meaning businesses can benefit from weaker economic conditions. Indeed, the attraction of pawnshops is that they represent an alternative form of financing for cash-strapped consumers while also offering an affordable retail option with a selection of used pawned merchandise. We last covered the stock with an article back in February which highlighted a bullish case into a shifting macro landscape and climbing inflation.
