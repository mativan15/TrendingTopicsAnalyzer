Scott Olson Investment Thesis Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is a company going through a transition in just about every conceivable way. FL's business is transitioning from physical stores to e-commerce, and its physical stores are transitioning from the mall to off-mall. Their products are transitioning from mainly Nike products to more diversified products from a mix of vendors, and if that weren't enough change, FL is transitioning to a new CEO. FL's customers are changing too by dressing more casually and becoming more health and fitness-focused, both trends benefitting FL.
