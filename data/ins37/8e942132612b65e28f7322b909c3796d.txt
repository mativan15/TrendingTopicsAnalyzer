UCLA Newsroom | October 19, 2022 Though President Biden's name won't be on ballot, the midterms will in many ways be considered a referendum on his presidency. UCLA professors weigh in on some of the nation's most pressing issues. Political parties and the ‘rules of the game' Lynn Vavreck Vavreck is a professor of politics and public policy and co-author, with Chris Tausanovitch, of 'The Bitter End: The 2020 Presidential Campaign and the Challenge to American Democracy.' The book's observations and insights are drawn from data collected as part of Nationscape, a national political survey conducted by the authors.
