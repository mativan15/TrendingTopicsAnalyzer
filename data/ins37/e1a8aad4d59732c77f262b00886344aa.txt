A young couple who were handed a $3500 bill by their mortgage adviser soon after the birth of their first child complained they were blindsided by the bill. The pair took their complaint to Financial Services Complaints, a scheme that deals with complaints about financial service providers that cannot be resolved directly. It does not identify the parties involved. In this case, the couple bought their first home in 2020, with help from a mortgage broker. But this year, they found they were expecting a baby and needed to move to a bigger place.
