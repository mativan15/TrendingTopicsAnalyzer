Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro Tuesday ripped the Democratic Party for focusing on abortion and the overturn of Roe v. Wade and said female voters care about more issues than just abortion as the midterm elections approach on "The Five." JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO: I want to talk about the abortion issue for just a second. I think it is so, so important. First of all, people think that women vote on one issue only, and they don't. And it is about time that they recognized women as more than just women who are concerned about people concerned about abortion.
