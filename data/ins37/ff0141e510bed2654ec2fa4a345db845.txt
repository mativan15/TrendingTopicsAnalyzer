Leo Cullen has confirmed that his injured trio of first-choice Irish internationals, Hugo Keenan, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park, will remain sidelined for Leinster's marquee fixture against Munster at the Aviva Stadium next Saturday (kick-off 5.15pm).'Unlikely I would say for any of them,' said Cullen. 'Not next week. They're not far off but we will see how they go this week.'Leinster will also monitor three players who picked up knocks in Friday's gritty 10-0 win over Connacht in the Sportsground.
