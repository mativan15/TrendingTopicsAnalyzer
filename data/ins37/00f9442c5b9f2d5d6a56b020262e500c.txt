Mr Martin said the sad reality is that 'far too little has been done' to meet some of the key objectives of the historic peace agreement, which will reach its 25th anniversary next year.

He was speaking as he addressed his party's annual commemoration of Wolfe Tone in Co Kildare.

He also used the address to attack Sinn Fein, accusing the party of trying to shut down debate.
