Gleyber Torres was absolutely merciless with this troll job on Josh Naylor.
On Tuesday, the New York Yankees bested the Cleveland Guardians 5-1 in Game 5 of the ALDS. Thanks to the win, the Yankees now move on to the ALCS to face the Houston Astros, who bested New York in six games back in 2019. Giancarlo Stanton got the ball rolling for the Yankees with a three-run home run in the first and the team never looked back from there.
Coming into Game 5, Naylor's 'rock the baby' home run celebration from the previous game was all anyone could talk about.
