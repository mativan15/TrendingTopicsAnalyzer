Washington D.C., Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SERB Pharmaceuticals today announces preclinical data demonstrating initial efficacy of a new polyclonal, ovine fragment antibody (Fab) developed as a treatment for COVID-19. The data will be presented as a poster at IDWeek 2022, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, held in Washington DC on October 19 – 23. Using a Syrian hamster model shown to be suitable for the assessment of interventions designed to prevent COVID-19 infection, transmission, and disease, subjects were treated with PR020, a polyclonal ovine-derived Fab raised against the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, or a vehicle control prior to viral challenge.
