Good manners cost nothing, they say. But in the case of this cafe in the UK it actually saves you a bit of money. 'Chaii Stop', a cafe selling desi chai in Preston city, gives discounts to those who ask for their order politely. And overcharges people who are rude while placing their order, ANI reported.

For the cafe, it's a bid to get customers to be kind and polite attitude towards their staff - something a lot of people forget or ignore while 'ordering' their food. A picture of their menu card that has gone viral on social media shows how different rates apply depending on what customers say when they order their tea.
