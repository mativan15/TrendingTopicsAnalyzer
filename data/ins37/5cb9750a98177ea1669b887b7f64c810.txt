Ethiopia aims to seize airports and other key infrastructure in the north of the country currently under the control of Tigray regional forces, the government said even as it stated it wanted a negotiated solution.
The Ethiopian government and its allies, who include neighbouring Eritrea's army, have been fighting Tigray forces on and off since late 2020. The conflict has killed thousands of civilians, uprooted millions and left hundreds of thousands now facing possible famine.
'It is … imperative that the government of Ethiopia assumes immediate control of all airports, other federal facilities, and installations in the region,' the government communication service said in a statement on Monday.
