Credit Suisse Group AG is considering a sale of its US asset-management business, and the firm's investment-bank chief is set to depart, as the company nears a strategy revamp that's likely to reshape the business and its top ranks.

The Swiss bank has recently begun a sales process for the US operations of Credit Suisse Asset Management, or CSAM, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn't public.
