Jin will be the next BTS member to release solo music, the singer announced during the band's free-of-charge 'Yet to Come' concert in South Korea on Saturday. Jin made sure to spare the details on names and dates, but he did state there was a single he made in collaboration 'with someone that I'd always really liked,' according to a translation by Soompi. 'It's not a huge album or anything, it's just a single,' he confirmed. 'I've filmed a lot different things recently, and there's still a lot left to film, so I hope you'll enjoy all of it.
