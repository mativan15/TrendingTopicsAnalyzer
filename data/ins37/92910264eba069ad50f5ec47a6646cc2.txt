Oct. 21—This year's finalists for the Third Olga Kern International Piano Competition reflect global turmoil.

The competition's debut year in 2016 lured 100 applicants. This year's group numbered just 96, said Marian Tanau, New Mexico Philharmonic executive director.

"I think that's because we missed the Russians," he said. "Their conditions of coming became a problem."

The Ukrainians also disappeared, he added. In 2019, Ukrainian pianist Tetiana Schafan took first place.

Competition namesake Olga Vladimirovna Kern is a Russian-American classical pianist.
