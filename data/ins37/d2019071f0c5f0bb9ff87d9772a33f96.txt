The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law Aug. 16, created some new tax incentives to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. A $7,500 tax credit for consumers carries many requirements for households and vehicles. But one for business owners, worth up to $40,000, doesn't have those restrictions. Medium- and light-duty trucks are "the fastest-growing fuel users and greenhouse gas producers in the United States," according to a 2019 Energy Department report. Business owners will be able to avail themselves of a new tax credit for electric vehicles starting next year — and it should be easier to get than a similar tax break for consumer households buying "new clean" passenger cars, according to tax and auto experts.
