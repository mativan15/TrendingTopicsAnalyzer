Bruce Bennett/Getty Images News Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reports its third-quarter results Friday before the market open - and with AT&T (T) riding high Thursday, the big red carrier has a tough act to follow. It's particularly vulnerable considering the ongoing strength of T-Mobile (TMUS), and the pressure to turn around three straight quarters of net declines in postpaid phone subscribers. (AT&T added 708,000 postpaid phone subs in its Thursday report.) And the expectation is that Verizon can pull it off, with the Street forecasting around 38,500 net postpaid phone adds, part of an expected 348,000 net wireless postpaid adds.
