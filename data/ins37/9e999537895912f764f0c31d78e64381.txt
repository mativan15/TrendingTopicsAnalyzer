October 15, 2022 / 6:17 AM / AP PITTSBURGH (AP) — General manager Ben Cherington believes there are better days ahead for the Pittsburgh Pirates despite having back-to-back seasons with 100 losses.During his season-ending availability Friday, Cherington said the Pirates are making progress in their goal of building a long-term winner."If you think about the talent level, it's not just that we think it's getting stronger but also where it's situated, that more and more of that young player talent is either starting to show up in the big leagues or at the upper levels and closer," Cherington said.
