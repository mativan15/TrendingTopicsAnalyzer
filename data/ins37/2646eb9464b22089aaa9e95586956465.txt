The data were derived from the registration-enabling Phase 2 cohort of KRYSTAL-1 study that involved 116 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. The results as of Oct. 15, 2021, indicated that the experimental drug at 600 mg BID led to 43% of objective response rate (ORR) out of 112 patients who were evaluable for response.
