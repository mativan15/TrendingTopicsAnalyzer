With three stores already in operation, La Ligne, the brand launched by two Vogue alumni, Meredith Melling, CBO, and Valerie Macaulay, CCO, and a former Rag & Bone fashion executive, Molly Howard, CEO, is setting its sights on Greenwich CT. Set to open this June, the new location exemplifies the independent label's recipe for success informed by trunk shows and online data. Much like the New York store that sits on Madison Avenue next to luxury businesses such as Sydney Garber jewelry, The Mark Hotel, and Sant Ambroeus, the Connecticut store will be on Greenwich Avenue and in proximity to Saks Fifth Avenue, Rag & Bone, Frame, Love, Shack Fancy and Veronica Beard.
