More than 800,000 Los Angeles County households—nearly a quarter of the total (24%)—experienced food insecurity over the 12 months ending July 2022, up from 17% in 2021. This follows a sharp drop from 34% in 2020, according to a new study released by Public Exchange at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. The research team included faculty from the Keck School of Medicine of USC, USC Dornsife Spatial Sciences Institute and USC Price School of Public Policy.
