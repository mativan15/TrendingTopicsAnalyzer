After Alberta's justice minister gave Edmonton's mayor two weeks to present the province with a public safety plan to address crime and violence in downtown, Chinatown and transit, the two are set to meet on Tuesday.
Amarjeet Sohi said Monday he would be meeting with Justice Minister Tyler Shandro, minister of community and social services Jason Luan, and associate minister of mental health and addictions Mike Ellis on Tuesday afternoon at the Alberta legislature.'We will lay out the work that (the city) is doing and have been doing, but we'll also ask them for their help.
