The Japanese investment company SoftBank has sold off the rump of its British connected gadgets business after a multi-billion pound bet on an internet-enabled world failed to pay off.
SoftBank has offloaded its Glasgow-based subsidiary Pelion to Scottish Equity Partners, in a retreat of its dream of dominating a future market where one trillion devices from cars to kettles would be connected to the internet.
SoftBank took control of the company which became Pelion following a £24m deal in 2018, merging it with British chip designer Arm.
