Tesla's third-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, prompting its stock price to drop more than 4% after markets closed.The company posted $3.3bn in profit and $21.45bn in revenue. The results come two weeks after the electric carmaker said it produced 22,000 more vehicles than it delivered, signaling to some analysts that the company was not able to maintain demand.The company attributed the delivery shortfall to transportation issues and said in its earnings report that it was becoming increasingly expensive to secure capacity to transport its vehicles.
