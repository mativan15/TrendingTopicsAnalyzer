Mongkol Onnuan/iStock via Getty Images Elevator Pitch My Buy investment rating for Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:AMG) stock stays unchanged. I analyzed AMG's above-expectations Q2 2022 financial results and determined that it still deserves a Buy rating as part of my previous August 5, 2022 article for the stock. Affiliated Managers Group's shares have outperformed the broader market on a relative basis since my earlier update. Between August 5, 2022 and October 17, 2022, AMG's stock price pulled back by -8.
