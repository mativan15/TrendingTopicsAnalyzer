"[Aimee Berger-Girvalo] voted for legislation which approved state tax credits for childcare-benefitting families in Ridgefield and across the state…" (Shutterstock)I am shocked and offended that Bob Hebert, from his campaign, sent a mailer in Ridgefield and to seniors in particular, maligning State Representative Aimee Berger-Girvalo. It is full of misrepresentation. State Representative Berger-Girvalo voted for $560 million tax cut-the largest in history-reducing the tax burden on all of us. She eliminated pension and annuity taxes for retirees making less than $75k/year.
