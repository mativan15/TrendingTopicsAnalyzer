Jun. 4—Local blues musician Pat Moss is in the process of recording new music, and he's getting ready for his Labor Day Dusk 'Til Dawn Blues Fest in Rentiesville, which will take place in September.

Moss came from a musical family that primarily played bluegrass music.

"I rebelled against that generation, and I learned to play the blues. After hearing a record of Jimmy Reed as a kid, I couldn't go back," said Moss.

Currently, he is also doing solo and acoustic shows with a band in Mississippi.
