Slash Film John Carpenter's "The Thing" was by no means a success when it was first released. It under-performed both at the box office and critically. Carpenter was no newbie to the filmmaking scene, either, with successes like "Halloween" and "Escape from New York" under his belt. The failure of "The Thing" was a big blow to his surging directorial career.Fortunately for Carpenter, history has viewed "The Thing" extremely favorably. The film has become known as a cult classic, a quintessential science fiction horror movie.
