The ninth episode of the House of the Dragon has been released. The Hightowers' scheme to displace Princess Rhaenyra as the heir to the Iron Throne comes into focus in the penultimate episode of the first season of House of the Dragon. After finding the body of King Viserys, Queen Alicent consults her father, Otto Hightower, for advice. She informs him about her final exchange with Viserys, during which she misunderstood his final wishes and believed he wanted their first-born son, Prince Aegon, to succeed him as king.
