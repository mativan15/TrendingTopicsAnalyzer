MILAN — Merchandise demand is exceeding supply, according to Brunello Cucinelli.

Relying on a strong manufacturing pipeline is a key added value that has caused the entrepreneur to expect a 25 percent increase in revenues for the year and a 10 percent gain in the top line for 2023 based on the order intake for the men's and women's spring 2023 collections.

'During and despite the pandemic over the past two years, we did not lay off anyone and having our production and sales facilities at full capacity is giving us a competitive advantage to cope with the large quantity of goods requested by the market where, in general, demand exceeds supply,' remarked Cucinelli, marveling at the general speed of the recovery after the pandemic.
