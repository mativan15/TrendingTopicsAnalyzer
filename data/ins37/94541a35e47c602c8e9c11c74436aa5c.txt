Wad of cash as a gift

The gift tax is a tax levied on any unilateral transfer (a gift) from one person to another. The federal tax is aimed partially at making sure wealthy families don't use gifts to bypass the estate tax.

The federal gift tax applies to any kind of taxable assets, including cash, securities and real estate. When the gift tax applies, it is the donor who pays, meaning that if you give a taxable gift you owe any applicable taxes. If you receive a gift, it is rare, if ever, that you owe taxes.
