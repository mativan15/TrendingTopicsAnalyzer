The Late Late Show's James Corden might currently be under the spotlight for his treatment of restaurant workers, but Conan O'Brien is said to have sacked one of his crew members for bring ‘rude' to a waiter. 
The claims were made by former Conan show writer Todd Levin, who said that the American comedian and TV host once reprimanded one of his employees for bad manners.
‘At CONAN there was a crew member who was fired because Conan witnessed him being impatient and rude to a server at a restaurant,' Levin tweeted.
