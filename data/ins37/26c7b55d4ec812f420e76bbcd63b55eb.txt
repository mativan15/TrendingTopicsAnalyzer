As education technology tools transform classrooms, particularly in the wake of COVID-19, schoolteachers in State schools too are learning how to become tech-savvy. The Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, (SSK) in association with the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education, is implementing a programme to make sure that teachers keep pace with tools and devices that create more engaging and fulfilling learning experiences for students. The Techie Teacher programme provides training to make schoolteachers not only at ease with IT but also to make them somewhat of an expert, as information and communications technology has increasingly been making inroads in academic and non-academic activities and there has been a change in use of high-tech equipment over time too.
