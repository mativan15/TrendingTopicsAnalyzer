By Jon Delano October 21, 2022 / 7:28 PM / CBS Pittsburgh PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - The race for the seat of Sen. Pat Toomey between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz continues to tighten, at least according to one poll out Friday. All signs point to a neck-and-neck race when voters head to the polls that count in 18 days. After a relentless assault on the airwaves from Oz and his Republican allies, Fetterman's summer lead over Oz has seemingly vanished. "This is going to be a nail-biter of a Senate race," said Republican strategist Mike DeVanney.
