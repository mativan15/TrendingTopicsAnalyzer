Scott Olson/Getty Images News Like recently covered Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD) ("AB InBev"), fellow brewer Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) has really struggled these past several years. Its shares have ultimately lost around half of their value since hitting a peak back in 2016, with total returns only a little better thanks to dividend cash. Data by YCharts Unlike AB InBev, I do feel that the issues facing Molson are more structural in nature. Yes, there are other factors - the debt load, which has tied up most of its free cash flow, not to mention exogenous issues like COVID - but really it's the firm's geographic and portfolio positioning that are holding it back at the moment.
