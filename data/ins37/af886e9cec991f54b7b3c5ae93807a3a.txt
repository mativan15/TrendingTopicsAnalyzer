Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Wednesday said the BJP high command will take a decision on the next chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, even as his party released the first list of candidates for elections in the hill state. "Be it Himachal or any other state, the party high command takes a decision," Thakur, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting, and Sports & Youth Affairs, told reporters here when asked about the next chief minister of Himachal Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh goes for elections on November 12 when Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur is hoping to return to power in the face of the challenge posed by the Congress.
