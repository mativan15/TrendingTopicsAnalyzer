As the Indian tea industry has a realistic chance to achieve the USD one billion exports target in the next two-three years, it is important to seek the Centre's help for rationalisation of international MRL laws for the crop, an official of a tea exporters' body said on Friday. Indian Tea Exporters' Association Chairman Anshuman Kanoria said it is also essential that the beverage produced for the overseas market is compliant with the safety regulations of importing countries. 
"This is essential to uphold the quality image of Indian tea in international markets and make our tea the preferred one worldwide," he said.
