William Gibson's 2014 sci-fi novel The Peripheral is cinematic. When I read it, every scene unfolded in my mind's eye – a testament to my highly-visual imagination, sure, but more so to Gibson's immersive and complex world-building. But although the book might evoke powerful visuals, I've always thought it would be monumentally challenging to adapt for the screen, with deadly swarms of nanobots and a giant garbage patch in the middle of the ocean floating by within the first 50 pages.If anyone's up for a challenge – and with a seemingly endless budget for new projects – it's Amazon.
