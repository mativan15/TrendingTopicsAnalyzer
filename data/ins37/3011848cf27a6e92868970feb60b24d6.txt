onurdongel Investment Thesis: Hyatt Hotels Corporation could see further upside on the basis of a strong recovery in revenue and earnings, along with growth across the luxury hotel sector potentially shielding the company from the effects of inflation. In a previous article back in August 2021, I made the argument that Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) might have potential for upside in the longer-term as a result of a continued acceleration in luxury travel demand. However, I also made the argument at the time that the stock could see downside in the short to medium-term as a result of revenues still remaining significantly below 2019 levels along with rising costs potentially eating into the company's margins.
