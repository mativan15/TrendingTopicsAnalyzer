Abortions are legal in Arizona but providers told Rep. Ruben Gallego Tuesday that reproductive care in the state is still hindered by politics.

Clinics that provide abortions in the state are struggling to find staff, patients are confused and fearful, and because of a new Arizona law, clinics must now turn away patients seeking abortions who are past 15 weeks of pregnancy, providers told Gallego, D-Ariz.

Gallego, whose 7th Congressional District includes parts of Phoenix and Glendale, hosted the roundtable discussion with reproductive health providers at Planned Parenthood Arizona's Phoenix headquarters.
