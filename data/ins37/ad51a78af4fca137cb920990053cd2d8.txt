If you're on the hunt for a new mattress, now is a great time to buy thanks to a bevy of Memorial Day mattress sales. But even after substantial markdowns, the best mattresses can still be quite pricey. So what can you do if your budget can't stretch very far right now? Look into purchasing a mattress topper instead. The best mattress toppers will extend the life of your current mattress by at least a couple of years, and make your bed firmer or softer, as needed. They're also much cheaper than full-fledged mattresses, so going the mattress topper route is a savvy compromise if you desperately want (or need) a new mattress but aren't ready to shell out the money for one.
