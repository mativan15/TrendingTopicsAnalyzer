Eric (played by Chris Chittell) was trying to help his son, David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden), with the village shop finances as Friday's episode of Emmerdale got underway, having discovered his son needed money to save his business. Unfortunately, the ITV soap veteran discovered there was nothing he could do to rectify the damage and suggested it would be worth selling up rather than trying to salvage the shop. However, David didn't take this too well and as Eric pondered on other ways to help his son, this led him to have a conversation with Brenda (Lesley Dunlop) about their future.
