Members of Calgary's firearms community said the federal government was missing the point with new restrictions announced Monday that they say will undermine their business. The feds said about 55,000 new handguns are imported each year in Canada. The thinking appears to be that while legal handguns make up a small portion of crime guns, the new laws will help limit the potential for them to make their way into the wrong hands. There are 2,500 stores in Canada that sell handguns. The Shooting Edge alone employs 40 people at two locations and they are concerned for their business.
