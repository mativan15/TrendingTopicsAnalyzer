Tory MPs gave Liz Truss a glimmer of hope as they voted against a Labour motion on fracking on a tumultuous day for the Prime Minister.
MPs were ordered to oppose the Labour move to ban fracking to show their loyalty to Liz Truss, or face expulsion from the parliamentary party.
The government has told Tory MPs it sees the vote as a confidence motion.
Labour tried to use a vote in the Commons this evening to force the introduction of a draft law banning the extraction of shale gas.
Labour's motion was defeated by 230 votes to 326, with a majority 96.
