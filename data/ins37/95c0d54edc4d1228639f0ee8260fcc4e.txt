Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Monday stopped short of announcing the date for the proposed mega rally to the federal capital, as he gave the Shehbaz Sharif-led government some more time to announce snap polls and the dissolution of the National Assembly.
Khan, the chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who made calls for the ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March' (real freedom march) earlier this month, made this assertion while addressing a press conference here after his party swept the crucial by-elections held on Sunday.
