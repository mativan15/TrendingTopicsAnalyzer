TUESDAY, Oct. 18, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- More than 1 million Americans with diabetes have to ration lifesaving insulin because they can't afford it, a new study shows.

Many people delayed picking up their insulin prescription, while others took lower doses than they needed, researchers found.

Experts said the findings are hardly surprising: Insulin prices have skyrocketed over the past 20 years, and surveys have suggested that many Americans ration the drug to save money.

"Our findings reinforce, in a nationally representative sample, what patients have been saying for years," said researcher Dr.
