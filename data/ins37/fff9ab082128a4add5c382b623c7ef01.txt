Sequoia Financial Group sold a minority stake to Valeas Capital Partners for $200 million as the wealth manager seeks additional capital for acquisitions.

Sequoia plans to use the money for expansion and to invest in its employees and technology, the firm said Wednesday in a statement. The Akron, Ohio-based registered investment adviser oversaw about $10 billion in client assets at year-end.
