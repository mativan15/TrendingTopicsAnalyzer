Say the words "episode 9" to a Game of Thrones fan and you'll likely get a worried reaction. For years, the number nine was either a harbinger of major character deaths or of epic battles (which often included major character deaths). The ninth episode of Game of Thrones seasons brought us such hits as Ned Stark's execution, the Red Wedding, and Shireen Baratheon's death at the hands of her own father. However, they also gave us the Battle of the Blackwater, the Battle of Castle Black, and the Battle of the Bastards, as well as Daenerys's first ever ride on Drogon.
