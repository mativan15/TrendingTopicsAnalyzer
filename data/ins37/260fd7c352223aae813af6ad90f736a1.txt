Kiriko is proving a popular pick in the early days of 'Overwatch 2.'Blizzard Entertainment
Despite all the launch week server issues and various bugs, Overwatch 2 still managed to pull in more than 25 million players in just 10 days. That's bound to be a big boost of confidence for Team 4, even as the devs beaver away to take care of some problems. For context, Blizzard said in a press release that the peak daily player count was nearly triple that of Overwatch 1 over each game's first 10 days. It's worth noting that Overwatch 1 had a sticker price, whereas Overwatch 2 is free-to-play (though new players need to connect a valid phone number to their account).
