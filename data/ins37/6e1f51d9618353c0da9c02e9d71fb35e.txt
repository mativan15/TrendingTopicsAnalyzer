Governor Cuomo also takes a close look at politics today with the midterm elections around the corner. "Republican leadership has allowed their extreme social conservative right-wing to push them way too far that they are now out of sync with the nation and probably their own party, and they're going to pay the price in the upcoming elections," said Governor Cuomo.
