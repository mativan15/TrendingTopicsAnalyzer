Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs speaks at a press conference outside Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich's office in Phoenix on Sept. 24, 2022.

Katie Hobbs was on CNN this Sunday performing a truth-bending contortion that Kari Lake isn't willing to do one-on-one interviews.

That's quite a stretch and required no small bit of chutzpah coming from someone who ducked the gubernatorial debate and then became the reason Kari Lake's most recent one-on-one was canceled.

Fortunately, CNN interviewer Dana Bash caught her on it, saying Kari Lake has, in fact, been willing to do an extensive interview with CNN.
