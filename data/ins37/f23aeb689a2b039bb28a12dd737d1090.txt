New Delhi: Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann on Monday ordered a probe by a judicial commission headed by a high court judge into the brutal killing of popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala. The police also detained a suspect in the murder in Uttarakhand. Mann said: "The Punjab government will request the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court to get the case inquired into by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court." 
The announcement came after Moosewala's father Balkaur Singh urged Mann to hand over the probe to CBI and NIA.
