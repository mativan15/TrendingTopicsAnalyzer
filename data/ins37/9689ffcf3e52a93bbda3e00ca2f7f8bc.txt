'We believe the UST market is fragile and potentially one shock away from functioning challenges' arising from either 'large scale forced selling or an external surprise,' said BofA strategists Mark Cabana, Ralph Axel and Adarsh Sinha. 'A UST breakdown is not our base case, but it is a building tail risk.'In a note released Thursday, they said 'we are unsure where this forced selling might come from,' though they have some ideas. The analysts said they see risks that could arise from mutual-fund outflows, the unwinding of positions held by hedge funds, and the deleveraging of risk-parity strategies that were put in place to help investors diversify risk across assets.
