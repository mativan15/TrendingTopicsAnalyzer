NEW YORK (WPIX) – As gas prices continue to soar, relief at the pump is coming.

The New York state gas tax suspension begins Wednesday. The state will cut a portion of its gas tax by 16 cents per gallon. Legislators and Gov. Kathy Hochul previously agreed to the tax holiday as part of the more than a $200 billion state budget.
