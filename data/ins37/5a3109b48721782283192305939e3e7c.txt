Tanner Morgan has started 45 consecutive games for the Gophers, a streak that dates to the eighth game of the 2018 season and one that's lengthy for a position that takes a lot of punishment. Whether Morgan's streak reaches 46 will play out this week.

Morgan took a hit to the head during the fourth quarter of the Gophers' 26-14 loss at Illinois and left the game after being tended to on the field. Coach P.J. Fleck said after the game that Morgan was taken to a local hospital for evaluation but did not know more specifics on the injury, saying it was upper body.
