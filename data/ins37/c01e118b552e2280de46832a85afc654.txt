A disappointing offense showing in Game 1 doomed the Yankees to a 4-2 loss, but the betting market hasn't soured on the Pinstripes. After opening around +145 for Thursday night's Game 2, the Yanks have taken some money and shortened to +125, depending on where you look. 
Is there still betting value on the Yankees at that number, or should you back the Houston Astros as -145 home favorites behind Framber Valdez?
