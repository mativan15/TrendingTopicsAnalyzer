Tilray Brands (TLRY 0.30%) is eyeing lots of growth in the years ahead in the Canadian, U.S., and European pot markets. The cannabis producer is the largest one in Canada, but a lack of legalization in other parts of the world is limiting its growth today, with the company's top line struggling in recent quarters to give growth-oriented investors much of a reason to buy its shares.
However, the company has been making moves to expand its position in the Canadian market as well as prepare for the possibility of a legal U.
