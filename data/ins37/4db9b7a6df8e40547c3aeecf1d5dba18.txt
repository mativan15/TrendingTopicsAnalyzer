Kindle eBooks are no more available for Android users, Amazon has declared! But there's a catch! Sad news for Kindle fans! Amazon has stopped all Android users from buying Kindle eBooks from the official Kindle app. The change has already been rolled out! As, of June 1, 2022, Android users will not be able to buy Kindle eBooks. This applicable not just to the Amazon Kindle app but also on Music and some other apps. So, if you try to buy a new Kindle eBook from Kindle app, then it will redirect you simply to a new page while reasoning out why the purchase option is not available.
