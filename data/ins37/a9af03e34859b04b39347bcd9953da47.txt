Every so often Tsewang watches Bigg Boss on her iPhone, sitting on a chair while her clients get their hair steamed. The beauty consultant uses every 5-minute break to watch a group of people argue, fight and compete on the Colors TV show.
She has barely watched anything else since the latest season of Bigg Boss Hindi started airing. Watching that episode, she immediately texted her friends and family on the group chats. Several have commented, people have taken sides, memes have been shared, and when she opened her browser feed, an awful lot of tweets and polls with the hashtag #SajidKhan were trending.
