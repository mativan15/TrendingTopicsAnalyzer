The US House Oversight Committee has told Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to turn over documents pertaining to the December collapse of an Amazon warehouse – and if he doesn't, the lawmakers say they will be forced to "consider alternative measures."
Penned by Oversight Committee members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Cori Bush (D-MO) and Committee chairwoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), the letter refers to the destruction of an Edwardsville, Illinois, Amazon fulfillment center that killed six people when a tornado hit.
