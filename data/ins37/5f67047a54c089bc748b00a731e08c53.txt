The members of K-pop band BTS will serve their mandatory military duties under South Korean law, their management company said, effectively ending a debate on whether they should be granted exemptions because of their artistic accomplishments. Big Hit Music said on Monday the band's oldest member, Jin, will revoke his request to delay his conscription at the end of the month and undertake the required steps. The six other BTS members also plan to serve in the military and are 'looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment,' the company said in a statement.
