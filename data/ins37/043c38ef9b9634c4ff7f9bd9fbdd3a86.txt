Conservative MPs are demanding that Liz Truss explains whether she is sticking to the 2019 manifesto commitment to reduce overall immigration after the resignation of Suella Braverman.In another sign of a major policy fracture within the party, fellow members of the European Research Group voiced support for the former home secretary, who stepped down on Wednesday after expressing reservations about government plans to grant more foreign work visas as part of a plan to stimulate the economy.Reports claimed that Braverman resigned after a furious 90-minute row with the prime minister and her new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.
