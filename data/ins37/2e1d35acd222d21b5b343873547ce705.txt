The Punjab government has decided to restore security cover for over 420 high-profile personnel from June 7. The decision comes five days after Bollywood singer Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead. Responding to the High Court's question on removing security, the government cited Operation Bluestar's anniversary as the main reason. It said that the security of these VVIPs was compromised as it needed the security personnel to maintain the situation near Golden Temple.
 State government led by CM Bhagwant Mann has been receiving heavy criticism for removing security of VVIPs post Moose Wala's death.
