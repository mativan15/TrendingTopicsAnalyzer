The Uttarakhand vigilance department investigating the alleged irregularities in the sub-inspector recruitment 2015 has found conspiracy in the destruction of OMR sheets of the candidates, a senior official said on Monday. 'There is a statutory process to weed out OMR sheets, but it wasn't followed in the SI 2015 exam as part of the conspiracy. It came to light when we tried to verify the gathered evidence during the investigation. Some staffers of the Pantnagar university, which conducted the exam, are under our lens,' said the official, who didn't wish to be named.
