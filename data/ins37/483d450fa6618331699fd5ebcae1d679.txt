Five years overdue, Arran's new ferry is finally progressing 'in leaps and bounds' and will enter service next year, according to the boss of the publicly owned transport business that commissioned it.MV Glen Sannox, which is under construction at the crisis-hit Ferguson Marine yard on Clydeside, is almost ready to be tested, says Kevin Hobbs, chief executive of Caledonian Marine Assets Ltd (Cmal).He said the company, which is owned by the Scottish government, had a 'higher degree of confidence in the project than we've had for a long time, if not ever', with work on the vessel expected to end in April.
