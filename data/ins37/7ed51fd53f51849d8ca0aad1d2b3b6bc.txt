Needy parents say they're being scammed by people pretending to sell infant formula.

Parents who spoke with Insider said they'd been conned out of hundreds of dollars.

Authorities are trying to clamp down on fake sellers and price gougers.

When Marie Brennan was contacted on Facebook by a woman offering six cans of the infant formula she'd struggled to find for her baby on the shelves, she agreed to pay her $300.

The cost, including shipping, was about $14 more expensive per can than the price at the supermarket.
