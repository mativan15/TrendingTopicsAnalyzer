When consumed in moderation, sugar is not bad for us, and humans' ability to detect sweetness is etched into our DNA, but with the abundance of it in today's food and drinks, we are getting more than we should.
Companies have created alternatives to sugar over the years, like Stevia, while others have tapped into technologies to come with new ways of sweetening foods in a way that is healthier. Some of those include Supplant, DouxMatok, MycoTechnology and Sensient.
Food tech startup Joywell Foods has been in this sector for nearly a decade, building up a sweet proteins platform and is nearing the commercialization of its first products, boosted by a cash infusion of $25 million in Series B funding.
