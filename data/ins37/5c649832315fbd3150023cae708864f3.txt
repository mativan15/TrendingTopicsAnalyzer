BOSTON and OXFORD, United Kingdom, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- RENEW Energy Partners ("RENEW") and Manufacture 2030 ("M2030") are announcing a new phase of their plan to help corporations and their suppliers measure, manage and reduce carbon emissions.
This collaboration is responding to the growing number of multinational companies committing to science-based carbon reduction targets. Hitting these targets in time requires cutting emissions across the entire value chain, particularly Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, which are located within the supply chain.
