A ceremonial turkey pardoning at the governor's mansion Thursday was quickly overshadowed by questions over the latest edition in a long-running series of tense moments and jabs thrown between the City of Jackson and the State of Mississippi.

On multiple occasions, during his answer to a question over who would field bids for staffing the city's water plants, Gov. Tate Reeves called Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba "incompetent" and said the mayor has "irrevocably broken" the Unified Command Structure that was put in place in August when the city's water system failed.
