With the control of Congress up for grabs in this fall's election, Democrats and Republicans can ill-afford to lose any House seats — and issues from the economy to abortion could help decide which way voters break in Illinois and elsewhere.

'In Illinois and across the nation, we're seeing an inversion of the old adage that all politics is local,' said John Shaw, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute. 'Politics, even at the local level, is national.'

With all 435 House seats up for election nationwide, Republicans, who currently are in the minority by a narrow margin, are pounding home worries about inflation, crime and illegal immigration.
