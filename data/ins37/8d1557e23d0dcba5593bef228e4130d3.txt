As the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigates Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft recently revealed in its filings with the CMA that it plans to create a new 'Xbox Mobile Platform' that will include mobile games by Activision and King.
'The transaction will improve Microsoft's ability to create a next-generation game store that operates across a range of devices, including mobile, as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard's content. Building on Activision Blizzard's existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform,' the company wrote in its filings.
