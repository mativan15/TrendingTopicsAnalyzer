Franklin County is finally ready to move forward with installing a new fire suppression system at the Fort Coombs Armory in Apalachicola. The project has been delayed because of the unexpected high cost of installing the system. Bids came in at more than double what the county expected. The lowest bid for the work was nearly 970 thousand dollars, far above the expected cost of 425 thousand. The engineers for the project managed to pare down the cost to about 690 thousand dollars, and the local tourist development council agreed this month to kick in an additional 270 thousand dollars to cover the costs.
