STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) — James Madison's first week in the AP Top 25 ended with a painful reminder that even ranked teams must avoid turnovers.

Kyle Vantrease threw four touchdown passes, including a 22-yarder to Derwin Burgess Jr. with 1:10 remaining, and Georgia Southern beat No. 25 James Madison 45-38 on Saturday to spoil the Dukes' first appearance in the AP Top 25.

James Madison (5-1, 3-1 Sun Belt Conference) committed four turnovers, including three interceptions by Todd Centeio. The Dukes also had a punt blocked and returned for a touchdown.
