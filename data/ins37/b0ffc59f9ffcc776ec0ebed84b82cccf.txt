Stocks ended the first full week of the earnings season on a strong note Friday, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +2.47%, S&P 500 SPX, +2.37% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.81% to their strongest weekly gains since June. It gets more hectic in the week ahead, with 165 S&P 500 companies, including 12 Dow components, due to report results, according to FactSet, making it the busiest week of the season. The bar for earnings was set high last year as the global economy reopened from its pandemic-induced state.
