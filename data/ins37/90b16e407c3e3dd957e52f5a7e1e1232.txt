Channel 4's celebratory Friday Night Live revival brought its fair share of highs – from Jordan Gray's iconic ending to Ben Elton kicking things off with a dig at Liz Truss.
But one moment fans had been desperately waiting for didn't disappoint.
That's right, Fonejacker was back.
The prankster returned for the one night special after the incredibly popular Channel 4 series stopped airing in 2008.
Bafta-winning Fonejacker saw Kayvan Novak play various characters as he prank-called unsuspecting business owners, and the results were truly hilarious.
