After 19 years, Krakow Polish Deli in Crown Point will close in mid-June as the owners retire.Mikolaj and Malgorzata Zieba first opened their business on Main Street in Crown Point across from Schoop's Hamburgers, Malgorzata said. They operated the store at that location for 3 years but moved to the current location at 701 N. Indiana Avenue because of high rent costs, she said.The store will close in about two weeks, just shy of its opening date of June 21, Malgorzata said. In February, Warsaw Inn closed after 50 years as the owners retired as well.
