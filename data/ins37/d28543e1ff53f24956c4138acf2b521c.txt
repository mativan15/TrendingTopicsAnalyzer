The great difference between politics and science is not that the first is full of chancers and the second isn't. Every sphere of human activity has its share of impostors.In science, there are outright fraudsters who rig trial results to advance their careers or to please corporate bosses.

There are hack professors with lucrative sidelines as consultants to pharma companies, who stifle doubts that might sink their patrons' profits.
