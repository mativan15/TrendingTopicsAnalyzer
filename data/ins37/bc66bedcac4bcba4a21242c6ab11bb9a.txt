Under-pressure Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard has been handed the dishonourable title of 'loser of the week' in a foreign newspaper's Premier League coverage on Wednesday. Gerrard is the firm favourite in the English top-flight's sack race amid a poor start to the season and faces two critical tests this week.Sunday's 2-0 defeat at home to Chelsea saw Villa drop one point above the relegation zone in 16th after winning just two games and scoring seven goals in their opening 10 Premier League games.
