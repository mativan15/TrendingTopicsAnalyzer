Logan, who has recently been named as the next President and CEO of the Dallas Fed, believes central bank digital currencies ("CBDCs") could lead to larger central bank balance sheets, she said in a prepared speech at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA workshop on monetary policy implementation released Thursday.
