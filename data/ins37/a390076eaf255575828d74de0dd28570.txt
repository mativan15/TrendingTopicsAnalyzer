The Memphis Grizzlies have finalized their 15-man roster for the regular season. Forward Killian Tillie and guard Dakota Mathias were waived, the team announced Saturday.

Tillie spent the last two seasons with the Grizzlies and played in 54 games. The 6-foot-10 forward shot 33.7% and played 11.9 minutes per game, including four starts.

A back injury limited Tillie's impact last season. He last played in a game on March 15 in a 33-point Grizzlies win against the Indiana Pacers.

During media day, Tillie revealed he wasn't 100% recovered from the back injury and that surgery "wasn't great.
