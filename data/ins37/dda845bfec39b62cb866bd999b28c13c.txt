Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won't attend the final day of events for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee.

The Platinum Jubilee Pageant is taking place on Sunday to celebrate the monarch's historic 70-year reign. A list of expected attendees from the royal family was released, which did not include the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who traveled to the U.K. from their home in California for the long weekend of festivities.
