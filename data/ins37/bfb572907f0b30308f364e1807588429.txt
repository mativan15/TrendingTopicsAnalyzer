Report: Patriots sign WR/special teamer off Ravens' practice squad originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

The New England Patriots have found their Cody Davis replacement, it appears.

The Patriots are signing wide receiver/special teamer Raleigh Webb to their 53-man roster off the Baltimore Ravens' practice squad, ESPN's Field Yates reported Wednesday.

News of Webb's signing comes after the Patriots placed Davis -- one of the team's core special teamers -- on injured reserve with a knee injury that will require season-ending surgery, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.
