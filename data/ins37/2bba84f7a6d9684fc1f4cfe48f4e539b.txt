(Reuters) -A Manhattan jury began deliberating on Thursday in the sex abuse trial of actor Kevin Spacey, who was accused in a civil lawsuit of making an unwanted sexual advance on a 14-year-old in 1986.
Anthony Rapp, now 50, claimed the abuse took place in Spacey's New York apartment when the actor was 26. Spacey denied the allegation on the stand and said he had never been alone with Rapp.
Rapp's lawyer, Richard Steigman, urged jurors to discredit Spacey's recollection of the events.
