May 28—Two Spokane car dealerships, Larry H. Miller Toyota and Lexus, have been purchased by Nevada-based Findlay Automotive Group, which has a history in the area.

The sale is the second since Larry H. Miller Group decided in 2021 to get out of the car sales business. In September , the company started by the late Miller, a onetime owner of the Utah Jazz, sold its 61 dealerships to Atlanta-based Asbury Automotive Group for $3.2 billion.

Findlay, based in Henderson, Nevada, this year purchased the Toyota and Lexus dealerships at 1128 W.
