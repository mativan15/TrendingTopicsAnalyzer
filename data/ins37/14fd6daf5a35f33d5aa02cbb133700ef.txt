Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon is embarking on his third major reorganization of the bank in four years, undoing changes made there as recently as 2020. The Wall Street giant plans to—once again—combine its expanded asset management and private wealth businesses into one unit. Goldman will also unite its investment-banking and trading operations under one group. The money-losing consumer unit will be broken up. Together, these moves mark a reversal for Solomon, 60, who had forged ahead with plans to separate the asset management and wealth business despite skepticism inside the bank.
