Two days after the seven-member committee of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) held a meeting in Ludhiana over the issue of return of few of the farmer unions to the SKM fold, five farmer unions under the leadership of Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal), met at Kisan Bhawan in Chandigarh on Tuesday and stressed the unity of the group.
'In the present circumstances, unity of SKM is most important. Five farmer organisations will always stand and strive for the unity of SKM based on principles,' Rajewal said.
