Former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon should serve six months in prison and pay $200,000 in fines for his conviction on contempt of Congress charges, federal prosecutors recommended in a Monday court filing.The erstwhile presidential adviser was found guilty in July of two counts of contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Friday. Because Bannon 'refused to disclose his financial records, instead insisting that he is willing and able to pay any fine imposed, including the maximum fine on each count of conviction,' he should be required to pay that maximum, the prosecutors wrote.
