CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — The State Auditor's Office maintains that its new role in selling delinquent tax properties will aid communities plagued with vacant, dilapidated structures.Previously, counties conducted their own sale of properties that had gone delinquent from property tax nonpayment. Those who had allowed their properties to become delinquent had 18 months to pay them, with interest, or see them auctioned off at respective county courthouses. Those sales usually took place each fall.The Auditor's Office plans to hold one sale a year in each county courthouse.
