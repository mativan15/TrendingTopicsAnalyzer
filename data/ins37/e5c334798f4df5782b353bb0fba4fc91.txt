By Reuters Published: 15:23 EDT, 1 June 2022 | Updated: 15:23 EDT, 1 June 2022 June 1 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin on Wednesday said he would need to see a big shift in the economic or inflation outlook to increase the pace of interest rate hikes, currently at half-a-percentage-point per meeting. "When we get to the fall I think we´re going to have a lot more information. ... The stronger the inflation and the stronger the economy, the more the case to do more and to the extent the two are weaker, the better the case to do less," Barkin said in an interview on Fox Business Network.
