Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should set up a "camp office" of the PMO in poll-bound Gujarat. His remarks came in the wake of Modi's frequent visits to the western state."The Prime Minister started visiting Gujarat the very next day after winning the Uttar Pradesh elections. Work is suffering in Delhi. He should open a camp office of the PMO in Gujarat so that work continues smoothly," Gehlot, the Congress' senior observer for Gujarat elections, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.
