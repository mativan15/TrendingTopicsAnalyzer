Set in an unnamed Latin American country and following an eccentric group of friends whose love for all things supernatural knows no bounds, HBO's "Los Espookys" is one of the most interesting comedies on television today. Comedians Julio Torres and Ana Fabrega created the show with former "Saturday Night Live" star Fred Armisen, and all three also star in the series. Torres plays Andres, the disillusioned young heir to a chocolate fortune with a killer wardrobe and a penchant for dramatics; Fabrega plays Tatí, whose childlike disposition equally frustrates and amuses those around her; and Armisen plays Tico, a former valet who leaves Los Angeles and returns to central America after cars with automated parking render his job obsolete.
