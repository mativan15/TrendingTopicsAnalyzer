Deji has admitted that he hopes to ‘steal some technique' from Floyd Mayweather when they square off on November 13 at the Coca-Cola Arena in Dubai. The YouTube star isn't sure what to expect when the bell rings but hopes to learn a thing or two from TBE."First and foremost I am expecting fun because I know it is going to be fun," Deji told the Ril & Wils podcast. "I am expecting him to show off his skills and everything because obviously, people have been saying stuff about him. The thing is though there is no blueprint to beat Floyd, so I don't really know what to expect.
