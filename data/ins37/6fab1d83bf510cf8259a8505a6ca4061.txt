The baby-formula shortage is well documented by now, but new data illustrates the impact is even more widespread than it might have appeared.Roughly six out of seven (84%) of baby-formula shoppers reported experiencing difficulties finding the product in the past month, according to a survey of 576 recent buyers by the retail analytics firm Numerator.More than half of respondents said they visited multiple locations of their preferred store, visited competing stores, and turned to family, friends, and coworkers for help to find supplies.
