The merger of two dough makers risks pushing up the price of cook-at-home pastries and pizzas if it goes ahead, the competition watchdog has warned.
The Competition and Markets Authority is threatening to start an in-depth investigation into Cérélia's takeover of Jus-Rol, a deal which would see the UK's largest manufacturer of bake-at-home dough items snap up the best-selling brand in the country. 
Together, Cérélia and Jus-Rol account for more than two-thirds of the sales of items such as puff and shortcrust pastry dough and ready-to-bake pain au chocolats in supermarkets.
