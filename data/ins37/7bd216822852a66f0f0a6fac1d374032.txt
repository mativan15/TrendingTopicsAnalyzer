By CBSBoston.com Staff October 18, 2022 / 8:06 AM / CBS Boston BOSTON -- David Pastrnak is going to score a lot more goals this season. But it will be tough to match his tally in Monday night's 5-3 win over the Florida Panthers. The Bruins winger turned in an early Goal of the Year submission in front of the TD Garden crowd, splitting a pair of Florida defensemen before going five-hole on goalie Sergie Bobrovsky. The goal gave the Bruins a 3-1 lead just before the midway point of the third period.
