Waldemarus/iStock via Getty Images The European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted orphan medicinal product designation to Applied Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:APLT) AT-007 (gavorestat) to treat Galactosemia. Galactosemia is a rare, genetic metabolic disorder which affects the body's ability to convert galactose to glucose. When not metabolized properly, galactose is converted to the toxic metabolite, galactitol, causing neurological complications, including issues with speech, cognition, behavior, and motor skills, and also juvenile cataracts and ovarian insufficiency in women.
