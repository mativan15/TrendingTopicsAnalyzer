Christchurch residents must have felt cursed. They'd faced an earthquake that threatened to destroy the city, and just five months later suffered a polar blast that delivered 20 centimetres of snow to their broken landscape. But 10 years ago, and 16 months after the quakes, the weather gods delivered another bolt from Mother Nature to give the city its coldest day on record. It was June 6, 2012 – a time of year people ease into wearing stockings and have a pot of lukewarm water on standby to pour over frosted windscreens in the morning – just mild enough to pleasantly walk the dogs in the evening, but brisk enough to add a blanket to the bed.
