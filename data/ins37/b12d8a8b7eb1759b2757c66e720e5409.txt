Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green emerged as the face of the franchise during his rookie season, as the No. 2 pick in the 2021 NBA draft wowed fans with his unique combination of athleticism and shot-making ability.

Green's No. 0 jersey became a common sighting at the Toyota Center during his rookie season, though those who jumped at the chance to rep his jersey may now be facing some buyer's remorse. Green changed his jersey number to No. 4 during the offseason, and he will likely don that number for the rest of his career.
