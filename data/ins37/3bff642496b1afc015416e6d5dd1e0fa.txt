 Daniel Craig now has another thing in common with James Bond. With a thoughtful and poignant nod to his screen character, the late Queen Elizabeth made Craig a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in January — just like the fictional spy. On Tuesday, the British star, 54, received his honor from the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne, at an investiture ceremony held at Windsor Castle. The royal family's official social media pages used a famous phrase from the Bond movies as they shared a photo of Craig's appearance at the castle: "We've been expecting you," they cheekily captioned the photo.
