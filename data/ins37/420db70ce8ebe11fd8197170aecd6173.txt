Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh Sunday said the government would conduct a house-to-house survey to crack down on illegal immigrants once the population commission is constituted in the state. The announcement came two days after 48 foreign nationals including Rohingyas were arrested in multiple drives conducted by the police across the north-eastern state.
Biren Singh said the influx of immigrants has reached an alarming stage in Manipur. He added that around 613 persons without valid documents and ILP (Inner Line Permit) passes were arrested till Saturday.
