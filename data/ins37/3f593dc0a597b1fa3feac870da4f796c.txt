Tesla CEO has no beef with his favorite crypto asset, Dogecoin, despite his dispute with one of its creators, Jackson Palmer. Amid the scornful exchange with the Australian developer, Musk found time to appreciate and praise Billy Markus, one of the creators of the world's first-ever dog-themed meme coin.
"You're humble, bro. Billy's sense of humor & irreverence is a big part of why people love Dogecoin," Musk told Markus who uses the Twitter handle Shibetoshi Nakamoto on the social micro-blogging site.
