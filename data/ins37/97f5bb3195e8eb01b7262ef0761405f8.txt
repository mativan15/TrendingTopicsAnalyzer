It was Margaret Thatcher in 1981 who applied a special additional tax on the profits of banks that had experienced windfall gains during a period of excessively high interest rates. The Treasury has had similar thoughts in the run-up to the budget on 31 October. The idea is to revert to the former chancellor Rishi Sunak's plans to raise corporation tax from 19% to 25% but drop Mr Sunak's offsetting move to reduce the surcharge on bank profits to 3% from 8%. Banks complain that high taxes already undermine London's competitiveness compared with rival European cities, with critics claiming it would be 'ludicrous' to impose any more levies.
