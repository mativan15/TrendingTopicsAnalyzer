Jason Quintana became senior manager of solutions engineering of Inc. 5000 company OneRail by the time he was 24 years old — but that's just one part of his tech resume.

Quintana, who works at Orlando-based logistics technology company OneRail, also started Miami-based startup Community Tech LLC in 2019. For his work at OneRail and his own startup, Quintana was named one of five honorees in the 2022 Inno Under 25 cohort.
