Jun. 2—GIFFORD — After 35 years as a family-owned and -operated auction and events center, Gordyville USA is for sale.

Champaign commercial Realtor Jon Fisher said he listed the 39.1-acre Gifford property Wednesday for $4 million — complete with a 144,000-square-foot building, another 11,000-square-foot building, more than 1,000 square feet of office space and parking for more than 500.

Established as an equine and auction showplace by the late legendary auctioneer Gordon Hannagan and his wife, Jan, Gordyville has been operated for decades by their children and some of their children's spouses.
