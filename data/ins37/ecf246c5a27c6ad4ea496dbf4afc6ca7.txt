Ron Rivera was visibly upset Thursday night.

With the press following the 12-7 win over Chicago, Rivera was asked concerning the ESPN report Thursday morning that Commanders owner Daniel Snyder had forced Rivera to trade for Carson Wentz.

Rivera responded, 'Honestly? I am going to speak my mind for a second.' He then proceeded to inform those present that report was 'bull—-.' While the Washington staff was attending the 2022 NFL scouting combine, it was Rivera himself who was also studying stats and analytics on Carson Wentz.
