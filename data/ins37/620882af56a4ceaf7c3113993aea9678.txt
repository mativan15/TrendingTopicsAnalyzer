There are times when swiping right goes all wrong.
Such was the case with a number of women who came across the Tinder profile of a man calling himself Simon Leviev. He was handsome, romantic, and apparently fabulously rich, the self-described son of a billionaire diamond broker. Norwegian beauty Cecilie Fjellhøy swiped right to signal her interest in meeting Simon, not realizing that gesture would put her in the clutches of a con man.
The story of how Leviev inveigled women to surrender massive sums of money to him is told in the Netflix documentary film The Tinder Swindler, a massive hit on the streaming platform and one of several Emmy-contending Netflix projects that fall on the true crime spectrum.
