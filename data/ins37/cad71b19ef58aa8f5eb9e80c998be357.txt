As the 2022-23 NBA season kicks off on Wednesday, the Chicago Bulls look to improve upon their first-round playoff exit last season.Chicago finished as the No. 6 seed last season before falling to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games in the first-round.The Bulls bring back the majority of their roster from last season with 12 returning players, outside the additions of rookie Dalen Terry and the veteran signings of Andre Drummond and Goran Dragic.With a revamped Eastern Conference, the Bulls will need to take a leap early on in the standings to avoid an uphill battle to even make the playoffs.
