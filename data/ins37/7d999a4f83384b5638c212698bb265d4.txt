JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) shares jumped more than 10% on Wednesday after the cloud computing company posted first-quarter results that topped expectations and issued guidance that was seen as "a major relief" by some Wall Street analysts. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who has an outperform rating on Salesforce (CRM) shares and a target price of $225 a share, noted that Salesforce (CRM) is seen as a bellwether for tech and with it reporting outside of the normal schedule, investors were "laser focused" on its report and comments to see if there were any signs of weakness.
