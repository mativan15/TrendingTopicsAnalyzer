A number of Conservative MPs have sought reassurance that Suella Braverman's departure as home secretary was not linked to a softening of immigration policy.Cabinet Office minister Brendan Clarke-Smith told his party's backbenchers in the Commons that the Government 'stands firm in tackling illegal immigration' and the departure was linked to a breach of the ministerial code.But he stopped short of outlining the Government's current immigration policy when asked to by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) for 'the avoidance of doubt', with the backbencher also asking if the policy is currently under review.
