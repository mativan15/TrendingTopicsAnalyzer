Thanks to man-made protection, the deer have multiplied in almost every state in the Union to the point where they constitute a national nuisance. What can be done about this is of concern to every conservationist, and especially to those who, like CLARK C. VAN FLEET,live in California where today the deer herds are so much larger than ever the Indians knew. Atlantic anglers will remember Mr. Van Fleet for his graphic and valuable book, Steelhead to a Fly, which was published under the Atlantic-Little, Brown imprint last autumn.
