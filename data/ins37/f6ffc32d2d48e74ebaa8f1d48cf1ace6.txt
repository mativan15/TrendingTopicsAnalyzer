Pushkin Industries has teamed with Tracksmith and Puma for a six-part podcast called 'Legacy of Speed' that highlights the history of the San Jose State track and field program of the 1960s.

Bestselling author and avid middle-distance runner Malcolm Gladwell will host the upcoming series. Legendary sprinters Tommie Smith, Lee Evans and John Carlos sprang from the team. Smith and Carlos medaled at the 1968 Summer Olympics and as the U.S. national anthem played during their medal ceremony, each man raised a black glove-covered fist overhead as a sign of solidarity with Black people and in opposition to racial injustice in the world.
