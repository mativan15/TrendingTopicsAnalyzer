Joe Lycett and Piers Morgan have added their names to a long list of people who will not be sorry to see Liz Truss leave 10 Downing Street. Former Good Morning Britain Piers was one of the first to respond to the Prime Minister's resignation earlier today, as he brutally mocked her short reign - after previously telling his 7.9million followers how the embattled politician had turned the United Kingdom into 'a laughing stock'. Piers wasn't the only celebrity to get political on their social media accounts as the news broke, with comedian Joe Lycett providing a hilarious response to the Prime Minister's resignation and many other stars chiming in with their views too.
