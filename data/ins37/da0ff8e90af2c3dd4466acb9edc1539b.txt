Granting bail to nine accused in a NIA case related to recovery of 504 gold bars at New Delhi Railway Station in August 2020, the Delhi High Court on Friday said mere smuggling of gold without any connection whatsoever to threatening economic security or monetary stability of India cannot be termed a terrorist act under UAPA.
The division bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Mini Pushkarna said that though the Financial Action Task Force report – which became the basis of the amendment to definition of terrorist act in UAPA — specifically deals with the gold, the ‘gold' has not been added while amending Section 15(1)(a)(iiia) of UAPA.
