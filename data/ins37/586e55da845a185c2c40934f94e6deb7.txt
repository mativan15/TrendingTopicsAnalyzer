Manchester United have seemingly been made to regret not heeding Gary Neville's advice and cashing in on Anthony Martial in the January transfer window following his underwhelming loan spell with Sevilla. The Frenchman managed just one goal with the La Liga side during the second half of the season and now the Red Devils face a battle to offload the misfiring forward, who has been accused of lacking "fire in his belly" during his time in Spain.Ahead of the January transfer window, Neville admitted he thought "the time had come" for United to move Martial on, imploring his old side to part ways with the struggling striker while they could still receive "good money" for him.
