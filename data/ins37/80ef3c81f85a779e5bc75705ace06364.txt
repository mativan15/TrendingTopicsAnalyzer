OAKLAND (BCN) Licensed cannabis businesses in Oakland are being robbed and burglarized, jeopardizing the safety of employees and prompting those businesses to think about leaving the city, according to a security consultant and a chief financial officer of a local cannabis business. An East Oakland cannabis business owned by DNA Genetics has been broken into three to four times in the past 18 to 24 months, the owners said. On one night alone thieves came back six times. The night they came six times they were carrying guns and put a child and others at risk, too.
