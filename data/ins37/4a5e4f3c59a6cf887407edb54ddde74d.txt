Launched in 2016, battery maker Northvolt continues to impress investors. In the last round of funding, the company was valued at more than $11 billion. From the start, cofounder and CEO Peter Carlsson has been on a mission to build the largest green-battery producer in the world. Where many saw a highly competitive and fragmented value chain, Carlsson spotted an opportunity in large-scale vertical integration of lithium-ion manufacturing at low cost and with low carbon intensity. Northvolt currently operates one gigafactory in Sweden and has plans to open several more.
