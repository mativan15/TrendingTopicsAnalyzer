This time last year, Ireland were flying home after a shock defeat to Namibia ended their T20 World Cup after just three games. This time around, an emphatic nine-wicket victory over a desperately out of form West Indies side guaranteed them another fortnight at least in Australia after qualifying for the Super 12s.A disciplined bowling effort, spear-headed by Gareth Delany (3-16), the man who by his own admission choked in that Namibia game last year, restricted the West Indies to just 146-5 as the Caribbean side confused many with their conservative approach with the bat.
