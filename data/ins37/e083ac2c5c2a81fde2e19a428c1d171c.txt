Montgomery County, Md., is one of the wealthiest counties in the nation, noted for its diversity and deep blue political liberalism, and a place where Democratic presidential candidates routinely command over 70 percent of the vote. It is hardly one of the first counties that comes to mind when one thinks of 'hotbeds for racism.'

But for today's social justice crusaders, racism is never far away, which requires fighting back with 'anti-racism.' That's why the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) leadership recently conducted a series of 'community conversations' as part of the district's ' anti-racist audit,' a comprehensive review of the district's policies and operations aimed at identifying and rooting out vestiges of racial prejudice in the school system.
