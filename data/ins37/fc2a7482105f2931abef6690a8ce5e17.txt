SAN DIEGO — One of San Diego State's toughest games this season won't count and nobody will see it. As a prelude to a season with even higher expectations than normal, the No. 19 Aztecs will host No. 8 UCLA in a closed scrimmage Sunday at Viejas Arena. They'll play a regulation 40-minute game with referees and a stats crew. The only thing missing will be screaming fans.

'It's good for both of us, who each have very good programs,' said SDSU coach Brian Dutcher, entering his sixth season with his deepest, most-talented team.
