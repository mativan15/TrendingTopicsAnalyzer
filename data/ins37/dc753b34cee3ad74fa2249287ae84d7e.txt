Published: 07:25 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 07:25 EDT, 20 October 2022 One of Britain's biggest ever national inquiries has warned that the scourge of child sex abuse is 'a national epidemic' and an 'ever-increasing problem', not simply an 'historical aberration which happened decades ago' - as its final report published today recommends that anyone who turns a blind eye to suspected assaults should be prosecuted. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), which was set up five years ago in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, called the abuse of children an 'epidemic that leaves tens of thousands of victims in its poisonous wake' and warned it 'is not uncommon, it is not contained within one sector of society, it is not always hidden, nor is it confined to girls'.
