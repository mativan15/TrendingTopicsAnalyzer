Paul Goldstein spent more than 12 hours running the grueling Everest marathon carrying the nine-foot tiger costume that weighs about 33 pounds. The race starts at 17,000 feet above sea level and took place on Sunday. It is considered to be one of the toughest marathons in the world, even for those not wearing a 30-pound apparatus.
