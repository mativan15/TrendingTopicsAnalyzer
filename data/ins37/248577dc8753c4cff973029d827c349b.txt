Warchi/iStock via Getty Images Introduction It has been over a year since I last looked at Great-West Lifeco (OTCPK:GWLIF) (TSX:GWO:CA). As the Canadian life insurance company has closed the sizable acquisition of Prudential's (PRU) US-based retirement business for in excess of US$3.5B, I'm obviously curious to see how Great-West is performing these days. The recent acquisition added in excess of $300B in assets under administration (based on the value when the deal was announced) and I hoped the company was well underway to realize the promised US$180M in annual expense synergies.
