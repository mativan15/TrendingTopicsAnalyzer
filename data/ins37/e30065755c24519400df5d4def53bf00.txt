Dave Armstrong is a playwright and satirist based in Wellington. OPINION: Dear Stuff, I finally get used to 20-somethings on the council telling me that my 1965 Wolseley is ruining the planet. I carefully negotiate my way past new cycle lanes full of scruffy young hippies on electric-powered bicycles (I refuse to add to the desecration of Her Majesty's language by overusing abbreviations like 'e-bike'). Yet now I learn that plans are afoot to try and lower the voting age to 16. Have these people calling for the change ever actually met a 16-year-old? Nor have I, but if you do meet one, don't go anywhere near the bedroom without a gas mask.
