(Bloomberg) -- Kakao Corp.'s co-Chief Executive Officer Whon Namkoong resigned after a widespread outage caused chaos in a nation heavily reliant on Korea's most popular messaging and social media service. Kakao's days-long outage halted a swath of services from banking to online deliveries across the nation, triggering a debate among policymakers and consumers about whether one company should hold sway over so much of the economy. The disruption stemmed from a blaze at an SK C&C data center in the south of Seoul on Saturday, raising questions about whether Kakao had done enough to safeguard services used across the country by millions of users and clients from government agencies to online businesses.
