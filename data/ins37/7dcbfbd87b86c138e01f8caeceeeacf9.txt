A tech thief stole £100,000 worth of goods including 30 laptops and tablets, two Rolex and Tag Heuer watches plus a haul of Apple Airpods.

Katien Rejise, 39, was caught with 48 mobile phones, 33 laptops and tablets, six pairs of Apple Airpods, two Rolex and Tag Heuer watches and 34 other stolen goods, including wallets and bank cards.

He was jailed for 20 weeks just 48 hours after being arrested by police who raided his home in Walthamstow, east London, earlier this month, after pleading guilty to six counts of handling stolen goods.
