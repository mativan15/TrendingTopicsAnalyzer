The wealthy donors who help bankroll the Conservative Party's election campaign have turned against Liz Truss over her U-turns on tax. Just two days before caving in and agreeing to a rise in Corporation Tax, the Prime Minister told a donors event with 250 of Britain's wealthiest people that she would stick to her tax cutting strategy. Now they feel betrayed.Even before she sacked her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng yesterday and performed a U-turn on keeping Corporation Tax at 19p, Ms Truss had failed to convince many of the millionaires and billionaires that she was worth backing, donors have told Express.
