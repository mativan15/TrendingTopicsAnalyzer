Progress in Mali's political transition and peace process is unfolding amid a challenging security, humanitarian and human rights situation with severe consequences for civilians, the top United Nations official in the country told the Security Council today, as delegates called for strengthened measures to ensure the safety and freedom of movement of peacekeepers following the deaths of four United Nations blue helmets just a day before. El-Ghassim Wane, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), said that the security situation remains volatile in central Mali and in the tri-border area between Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, with a sharp increase in the activities of extremist elements affiliated with Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.
