Eoneren Gladstone Investment (NASDAQ:GAIN) increased its monthly distribution from $0.075 to $0.08 per share last week and declared a special distribution of $0.12 per share to be paid in the fourth quarter. The business development company's dividend is covered by adjusted net investment income, and the stock has begun to trade at a larger discount to net asset value in recent weeks. Gladstone Investment, in my opinion, is an appealing income investment for investors seeking recurring dividend income and a higher margin of safety.
