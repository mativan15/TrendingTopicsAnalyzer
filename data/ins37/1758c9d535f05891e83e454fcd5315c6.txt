Federal health officials have launched a probe into a controversial Boston University study where scientists created a form of COVID-19 with an 80 per cent fatality rate.
The National Institutes of Health confirmed to DailyMail.com that it is probing whether the university would have needed to declare its experiment — which was partially backed by public money.
‘NIH is examining the matter to determine whether the research conducted was subject to the NIH Grants Policy Statement or met the criteria for review under the [guidelines put in place by the agency],' a spokesperson said.
