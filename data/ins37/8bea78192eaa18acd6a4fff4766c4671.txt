It's safe to say it was a good week for Garrison Smith and the New Mexico State men's golf team.

The Aggies won the Herb Wimberly Intercollegiate for the third straight season, cruising to a 20-shot victory over second-place Seattle University and Weber State.

Smith, a senior, ran away with the individual title, shooting a 15-under 198 at University Golf Course in Las Crusas, New Mexico. The 198 total is the lowest 54-hole score in New Mexico State history. This season, Smith has yet to finish worse than third place.
