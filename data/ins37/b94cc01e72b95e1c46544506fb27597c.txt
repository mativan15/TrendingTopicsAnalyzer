Despite numerous attempts by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the 'non-striker run-out' remains a questionable form of dismissal in the cricketing spectrum. When India's Deepti Sharma dismissed England's Charlie Dean in the manner, her action was portrayed in the bad light. Australia pacer Mitchell Starc, in a match against England, gave Jos Buttler a warning over not leaving his crease early while saying "I am not Deepti". Starc remains someone who is not a fan of the dismissal but also wants batters to remain inside the crease.
