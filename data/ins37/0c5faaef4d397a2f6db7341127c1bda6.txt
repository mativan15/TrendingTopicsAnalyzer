sasacvetkovic33/E+ via Getty Images Battalion Oil (NYSE:BATL) has taken a significant step towards reducing its costs and becoming more competitive with its joint venture agreement with Caracara Services to develop an acid gas treatment and carbon sequestration facility. This facility is expected to be operational in early 2023 and is expected to reduce Battalion's gathering and other costs by 20% to 30%. This could save Battalion around $3 per BOE, which could translate into around the same impact on its cash flow as a $6 change in oil prices (at 2022 production levels).
