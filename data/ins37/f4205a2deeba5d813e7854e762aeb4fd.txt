The post-Brexit move by Boris Johnson has been seen by many as a 'backwards' step and 'complete and utter nonsense', with a supermarket chief warning it will increase costs. Earlier this week a Conservative minister Stephen Parkinson struggled to convert imperial measurements during an interview on Sky News despite Downing Street insisting the system is 'universally understood'.The Arts minister was asked to convert ounces and grams into pounds and litres into pints, but was unable to do so.The Government announced it will launch a consultation into how to reintroduce and increase the usage of imperial measurements in the UK.
