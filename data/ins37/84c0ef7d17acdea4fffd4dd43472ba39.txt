ALBANY — Lee Zeldin downplayed an endorsement from former President Donald Trump on Monday as texts emerged showing the Long Island congressman was in touch with the former president's team amid efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

The Republican gubernatorial candidate, one of 147 House Republicans who voted against certifying President Biden's electoral win, said the support from Trump came as no surprise.

'It shouldn't have been news,' Zeldin said following a press conference in the Bronx.
