In a further step towards its consolidation as a global player of not only fiction but non-scripted entertainment content, international production powerhouse The Mediapro Studio has reached an exclusive deal with Belgium's Be-Entertainment to produce its formats for Spain and Latin America.

The pact also sees The Mediapro Studio developing non-fiction formats for VTM, a Flanders' leading TV channel with more than 30 years of broadcasting. Like Be-Entertainment, VTM is owned by Belgian giant DPG Media.
