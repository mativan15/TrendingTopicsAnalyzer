In their closely watched race for Colorado's U.S. Senate seat, Michael Bennet and Joe O'Dea present a distinct contrast about how active the federal government should be moving forward in boosting oil and gas production, fighting inflation and rolling back business regulations.

Bennet, a Democrat who has held the seat for 14 years, said the biggest business issues likely to face the body in the coming years are big-picture issues that need to be solved over the long term. Those include the ability to onshore supply chains for American companies, the need for a more robust workforce-development program to match labor with the needs of business and the need to address what he called a broken immigration system.
