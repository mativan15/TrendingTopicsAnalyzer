A graphic video posted by South Carolina's Myrtle Beach Police Department shows a group of people who worked together to lift a car off a motorcyclist.The clip was shared on the department's Facebook page on Tuesday where it was viewed more than 35,000 times. It shows the moment that a car drove over a motorcycle and the two occupants on it.As the motorcycle approached an intersection, a sedan pulled up behind it but didn't slow down. Instead, the sedan's fender appeared to catch the rear tire of the bike, propelling the sedan over the back fender of the bike, and pushing the rear passenger up and over the driver of the motorcycle.
