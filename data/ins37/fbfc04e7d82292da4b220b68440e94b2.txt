The cost of government borrowing has risen to its highest level for the month of September since records began, putting pressure on the new prime minister to bring down public debt.Interest payments on government debt rose by 48 per cent to £7.7 billion, up by 2.5 billion from the same month last year to record its highest level for September since monthly records began in 1997.The jump in interest payments is mainly because of the impact of inflation, as measured by the retail prices index (RPI), on index-linked gilts, which make up around a quarter of the government's gilt portfolio.
