Sutton's prediction: 0-2Southampton helped to finish off Arsenal's hopes of making the Champions League places last season when they beat them at St Mary's in April.This is a very different Gunners side, though. They should have too much quality up front for Saints to deal with, and they also have more steel if things are not going well.Arsenal's mindset in their last win, against Leeds, epitomised that. Yes, maybe they got a break or two, but they also have the belief now that they can get through games even when they don't play well.
