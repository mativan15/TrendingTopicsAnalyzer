River Lee's Pub in downtown East Dundee has lost its liquor license for a month after being found guilty of violating village liquor codes for the second time in a year, officials said.

The East Dundee Liquor Control Commission suspended the business' license starting at noon Friday, Oct. 21, through 11:59 a.m. Sunday, Nov. 20. The bar at 6 E. Main St. was also fined $2,000 for violating two ordinances.

'River Lee's ... was found liable for two counts of violating ordinances regarding liquor sales — one for allowing a patron to leave with alcohol in hand and one for disturbing the peace,' said Village Board Trustee Scott Kunze, who also serves as a liquor commissioner.
