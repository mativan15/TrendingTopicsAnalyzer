WASHINGTON — As Republicans regain momentum on concerns about the economy, the only thing Democrats seem to agree on about their message on issues like inflation and high gas prices is that it needs improvement — and time is running out. 'What is our message about why inflation is going to be worse if Republicans win?' Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told NBC News in an interview. 'I don't think our economic message has been loud enough or sharp enough.''We'll have to message it better in the next three weeks ahead,' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in an interview with Punchbowl News this week, when asked about inflation.
