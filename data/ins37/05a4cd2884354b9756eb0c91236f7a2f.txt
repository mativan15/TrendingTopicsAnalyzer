SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shanghai plans to build a 3,250-bed COVID-19 quarantine facility on a small island close to its city centre as China stands by its stringent zero-COVID controls, rather than relaxing curbs as many other countries have done.

The city awarded a 1.38 billion yuan ($191 million) contract to build the centre on Fuxing Island, located in the Huangpu River, to state-owned builder China Communications Construction Corp, according to a government document.

The document said the site, which will take in positive cases and their close contacts, would be 140,000 square metres large and have 3,009 rooms.
