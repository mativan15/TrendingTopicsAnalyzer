The owner of popular NYC restaurant Balthazar is taking James Corden's latest comments about their ongoing dinner drama with a grain of salt.

In case you haven't been keeping up with the ongoing food feud, The Late Late Show host was banned from Balthazar by owner Keith McNally earlier this week, with McNally alleging the comedian was "the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago." The restaurateur subsequently removed the ban after Corden apologized.
