Lifelong coffee lover Mike Murphy acquired Auckland business Kōkako Organic Coffee Roasters 15 years ago to fulfil a long-held dream of supplying Kiwis with ethically sourced, locally roasted coffee. The company, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, has experienced two of its most transformative years during the Covid-19 pandemic, embracing e-commerce and targeting new customers. After serving New Zealand cafes with Fairtrade, organic coffee for years, Kōkako has digitised during the pandemic.
