Oct. 16—When it came time to open a new business, Oscar Contreras knew downtown Logansport was the place to be.

Yummy Mi Camino Real, 121 S. 6th St., a new Mexican restaurant, sits across the street from Black Dog Legacy and near the The Science Project, businesses that Contreras admires.

He's no stranger to Logansport. His previous venture, Mi Camino Real, was open for nine years.

Contreras has seen downtown Logansport change over the last couple of years. He said it was common to find the area closing down around six in the evening most nights.
