Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Thursday appeared before a Mansa court in a 2019 defamation case filed by the then Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia.
Manshahia had won the 2017 assembly elections from Mansa on an AAP ticket, but on April 25, 2019, he switched to Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.
Two days after Manshahia's switchover, the then Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann had accused the Mansa MLA of switching to other party in lure of money and also to get chairmanship of Punjab Pollution Control Board.
