Asian Cricket Council president Jay Shah on Tuesday said that Team India will not travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023 and the prestigious tournament will be held at a neutral venue. Flagship tournaments are supposed to be held in Pakistan as the Asian giants will host the forthcoming edition of the Asia Cup in 2023 followed by the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy. 
 There is no doubt that the cricket rivalry between India and Pakistan is perhaps one of the most fierce in the globe. 
 BCCI secretary on Tuesday completely dismissed the speculations of Team India travelling to Pakistan for the event and said that the Asia Cup will be held at a neutral venue.
