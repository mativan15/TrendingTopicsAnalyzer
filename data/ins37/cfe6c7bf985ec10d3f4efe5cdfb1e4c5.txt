This information is not intended as personal financial advice and should not replace advice from a professional. Q: I'm curious as to why the maximum KiwiSaver contribution rate is 10%. I can't find information on why the government has chosen the particular contribution percentages that exist, but especially why 10% is the maximum. Why not 15%? Why can't we choose a maximum we want? I understand it is possible to add voluntary contributions on top of this directly to my KiwiSaver provider, but that's net income and it feels like a loss (I've noticed the Aussie super scheme allows top-ups but they're taxed at a rate of 15% up to a point).
