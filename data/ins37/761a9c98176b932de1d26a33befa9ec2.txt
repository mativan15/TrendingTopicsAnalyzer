The issue of alleged Hindi imposition is being politicised in Tamil Nadu to win votes, Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) president G.K. Vasan said on Wednesday. In a statement, he said there was no reason to believe that the Union government was trying to impose Hindi. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a recent meeting with the State Law Ministers and Secretaries, had called for using the mother tongue in court proceedings in each State for people to understand.
