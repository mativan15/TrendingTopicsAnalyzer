Barack Obama is Risen!

The Chosen One has returned to the political flesh and emerged from his kingdom on Martha's Vineyard to help Democrats in this election. Apparently, the immigration crisis there has become unbearable, even for the Father of Hope & Change.

He returns not as the washed-up, angry race-hustler that he became during his two terms as president, but as the charming smooth-talker he played back in 2008 to get himself elected America's first Black president (after Bill Clinton, of course).
