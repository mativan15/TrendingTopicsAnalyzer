SOUTHERN PINES, N.C., June 2 (Reuters) - Ingrid Lindblad shot the lowest round by an amateur at a U.S. Women's Open, a six-under-par 65 that left the Swede trailing only leader Mina Harigae in the opening round at the $10 million championship on Thursday.

Though American Harigae later went to the front as the sun dipped below the Carolina pines, Lindblad earned plaudits with a near flawless performance on a day of low scoring in benign conditions at toasty Pine Needles.

The world's number two amateur has a long way to go to emulate the feats of compatriot Annika Sorenstam, the 72-time LPGA winner whose victories included the 1996 Women's Open at this very place.
