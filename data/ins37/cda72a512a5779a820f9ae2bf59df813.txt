First-time buyers who want to take advantage of the government's help-to-buy scheme will have to reserve a property by the end of October, it has emerged – two months earlier than had been expected.The scheme, which offers an equity loan to buyers to enable them to buy a new-build property with a deposit of just 5%, is set to end in March 2023 – a decade after it was launched to kickstart the housing market after the financial crisis.Buyers must complete their purchase by then, so the deadline for applications was expected to be at the end of this year.
