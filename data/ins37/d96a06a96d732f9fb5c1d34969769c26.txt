PrathanChorruangsak While it would be nice for investing to be nothing more than simple math, the fact of the matter is that sometimes the outcome of an investment is determined by factors that cannot be calculated. A great example of a firm with relatively robust and improving fundamentals that is trading on the cheap but that is riskier than it initially appears is Power REIT (NYSE:PW). This company, which owns a variety of real estate, such as 112 miles of railroad assets, solar farm land totaling 601 acres, and greenhouses dedicated to both cannabis and produce, happens to have robust fundamentals but is the subject of tremendous scrutiny related to some of the disclosures in its financial reports.
