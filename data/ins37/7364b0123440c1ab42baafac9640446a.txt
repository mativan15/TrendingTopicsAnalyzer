With the CBI issuing summons to his deputy, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday termed his government's fight with the Centre as the "second freedom struggle"', and compared AAP leaders Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain to martyr Bhagat Singh. Kejriwal also said that prayers of crores of poor people are with them. His remarks came after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) summoned Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia for questioning on Monday in connection with alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped excise policy.
