Members of my CEF Insider service and I always look for big dividends we can collect for the long haul. I'm talking 8%+ payouts here, many of which come our way monthly. (This is possible with CEFs, and these funds' discounts to net asset value, or NAV, give us some nice upside to go along with those payouts). By thinking long term, we give our CEFs' discounts the time they need to close, propelling their share prices higher.
