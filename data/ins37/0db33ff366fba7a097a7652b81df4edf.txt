LET us think of the several million business enterprises of the country as parts of one vast productive establishment. Its plant and equipment have cost almost $200,000,000,000, and when operating at capacity it employs over 50,000,000 persons. It is capable of producing about $1600 worth of goods each year for every worker. This is not a large amount, but it is more than the industries of any other country are able to produce, and it is five times as much as our own industries could produce a century ago.
