Tesla CEO (and prospective Twitter buyer) Elon Musk has issued a vexing ultimatum to his office employees: work 40 hours a week in-office or quit.The mandate was first sent in an email, which was leaked by Tesla investor Sam Nissim, Tuesday afternoon to the company's 'ExecStaff' listserv.  'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,' Musk said in the email. 'This is less than we ask of factory workers.' He does leave the smallest amount of wiggle room for 'exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible' — noting that he has to 'review and approve' any remote employees himself.
