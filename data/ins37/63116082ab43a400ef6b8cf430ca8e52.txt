The chief executive of Creative New Zealand has condemned a 'racist rhetoric' behind criticism of its decision to cut funding of a popular Shakespeare programme in schools. In a joint statement on Tuesday, chief executive Stephen Wainwright and arts council chairperson Caren Rangi said they were pleased the Ministry of Education had stepped in to work with the Shakespeare Globe Centre New Zealand to secure funding for the programme. 'This is a great outcome for SGCNZ, but we've found some of the rhetoric over the last few weeks alarming, misleading and racist,' they said.
