serts Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) are all large globally systemically important European banks that are trading at extremely distressed valuations currently. CS is trading at ~0.24x tangible book value, DB is at 0.33x, and Barclays is at ~0.45x. Banks that trade at a fraction of their tangible book suggest that they are destroying capital for shareholders. The year-to-date performance has been dismal for these banks. The strong USD compared to the Euro and GBP has exacerbated the steep decline.
