Published: 22:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 00:39 EDT, 18 October 2022 BOSTON (AP) - Jake DeBrusk scored 21 seconds into the game and added an empty-netter as the Boston Bruins beat the Florida Panthers 5-3 on Monday night. DeBrusk also assisted on the go-ahead goal, splitting a pair of defenders in a race for the puck and feeding Patrice Bergeron with a behind-the-back pass to put Boston up 2-1 with 7:25 left in the second period. DeBrusk, who turned 26 on Monday, said he wasn't even sure in the morning he'd be able to play because of an injury he suffered in the season-opener that kept him out of Boston's win over Arizona on Saturday.
