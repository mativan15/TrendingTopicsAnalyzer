Shares of Roku (ROKU -4.35%), Peloton (PTON -7.31%), and Beyond Meat (BYND -4.58%) were all down more than the market today, each falling more than 5% by mid-day, before Roku recovered to a 3.2% loss, Peloton fell 6.2%, and Beyond Meat dropped by 3% as of 3:25 p.m. EDT.
There wasn't any material news out of these companies today. However, all are affected by general economic conditions. A slowing economy could slow down ad sales, which would affect Roku's revenue, as well as purchases of large-ticket discretionary items like a Peloton bike.
