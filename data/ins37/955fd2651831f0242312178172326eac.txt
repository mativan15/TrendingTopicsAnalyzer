CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A cybercriminal was holding for ransom an Australian health insurer's customer data including diagnoses and treatments, in the nation's second major privacy breach in a month, officials said on Thursday.

Trade in Medibank shares has been halted on the Australian Securities Exchange since Wednesday when police were alerted that the company had been contacted by what it described as a 'criminal' who wanted to negotiate over the stolen personal data of customers.
