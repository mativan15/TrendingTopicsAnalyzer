Alanis Morissette's daughter, six-year-old Onyx, apparently calls her mum by her full name – instead of, you know, just saying ‘mom'.
The Canadian-American singer-songwriter, who had a string of massive hit singles in the mid-1990s, is a mother to three children. 
As well as daughter Onyx, who was born in 2016, she has two sons, 11-year-old Ever Imre and three-year-old Winter Mercy. 
Alanis, 48, whose 1995 album Jagged Little Pill was certified 10x platinum in the UK, married her husband Mario Treadway in 2010.
