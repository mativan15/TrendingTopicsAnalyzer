New Delhi, War in Ukraine has spurred over $70 billion of fresh investment in green hydrogen in just a few months as costs drop and has made fossil fuel-produced hydrogen uneconomic as gas prices soar.As a result of higher gas-feed prices, $100 billion of 'dirty' hydrogen assets may become stranded by 2030, a report published by Carbon Tracker on Thursday found.Since the start of the conflict, natural gas prices, a major feedstock for producing fossil fuel-produced hydrogen (blue and grey), has soared by more than 70 per cent on international markets, triggering an energy crisis and pushing lawmakers worldwide to urgently source alternative sources of fuel.
