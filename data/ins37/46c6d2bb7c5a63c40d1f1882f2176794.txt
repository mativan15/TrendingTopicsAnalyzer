Investing.com -- Unilever (AS:ULVR) stock rose 7.48% at the open on Tuesday after the consumer giant said it had appointed US-based activist investor Nelson Peltz as a non-executive director.

The move represents a big concession to outside shareholders who have long pressed for more outside influence on its strategy after suffering years of relative underperformance.

Pressure on the board increased earlier this year after it bid what was seen to be an unrealistically high sum of 50 billion pounds ($63 billion) for the healthcare arm of GlaxoSmithKline (LON:GSK).
