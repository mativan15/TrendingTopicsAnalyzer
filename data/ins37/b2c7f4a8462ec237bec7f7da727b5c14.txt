China's leader warns of 'stormy seas'

In his nearly two-hour address at the Communist Party congress yesterday, Xi Jinping defended his hard-line reign and presented himself as the leader who saved the nation from the pandemic and who can guide the country through danger and uncertainty.

Xi, who is poised to claim a third term as leader, used his opening report to argue that his decade in power had brought historic gains: a campaign against corrupt officials, a cleanup of the environment and a crackdown on antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong.
