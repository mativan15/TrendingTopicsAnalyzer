By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:26 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 21:26 EDT, 19 October 2022 Special legislation will be introduced to the South Australian parliament to clear the way for construction of Adelaide's new women's and children's hospital. The legislation allows for construction on the site of the existing police barracks, which includes some buildings that are heritage-listed. Premier Peter Malinauskas said he hoped the government's bill would receive bipartisan support after its introduction in the upper house on Thursday.
