The Baltimore Ravens had another inexplicable collapse, this time in Week 6 against the New York Giants. They fell by the final score of 24-20 in a game that they were well on their way to winning, but a fourth quarter collapse is once again the key storyline, as they got outscored 14-7 in devastating fashion.

Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson gave away the ball two times late in the contest, first one an ill-advised throw into the arms of a Giants defender that gave New York the ball deep into Ravens territory.
