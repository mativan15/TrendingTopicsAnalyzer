"You want to make sure you don't put it off until the very last minute in the hopes that fares are gonna get cheaper because in all likelihood, the opposite is going to happen," he tells CNBC Make It.

That's because plane ticket prices for the peak summer travel season are only likely to go up from here, according to Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of Scott's Cheap Flights , a Portland, Ore.-based newsletter that sends daily airfare deals to 2 million-plus subscribers.

If you're planning on taking a vacation this summer but haven't booked your airfare yet, it's time to stop waiting.
