Ellen McCallum, professor in the Department of English and Faculty Fellow at the Center for Gender in Global Context, or GenCen, shares how the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Sexuality Studies program at MSU offers an opportunity to gain a broader historical and social context for understanding personal and collective identities. As associate chair of undergraduate studies in the Department of English in 2010, McCallum introduced a course on literature and sexuality that became part of the LGBTQ minor program.
