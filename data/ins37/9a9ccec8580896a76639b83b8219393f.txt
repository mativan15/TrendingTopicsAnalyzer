About 6000 years ago, the Pacific Ocean rolled ashore near where Christchurch's Avonside Girls' High School used to be. Avebury House​ and Porritt Park​ aren't far away. As a bird flies, Christ Church Cathedral is 2.6 kilometres southwest and New Brighton Library is 5.6km northeast. At the time, Earth was undergoing a warming phase after the last ice age and the sea level was higher than now, said Dr Colin Meurk,​ the retired ecologist who spent more than 40 years at Manaaki Whenua–Landcare Research.
