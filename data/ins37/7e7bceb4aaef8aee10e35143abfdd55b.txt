The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Silver Lake Resources Limited (ASX:SLR) stock is up an impressive 243% over the last five years. In the last week shares have slid back 7.1%.

In light of the stock dropping 7.1% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return.
