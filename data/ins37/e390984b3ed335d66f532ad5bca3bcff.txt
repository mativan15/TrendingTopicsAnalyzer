New research by used car buying service ChooseMyCar.com, showed that 46 percent of the age group have asked friends and family for money, due to huge spikes in fuel costs. This was in contrast with older age groups, with only 21 percent of 35-54 year olds in the same boat, and just four percent of the over 55s.The Government was forced to step in with a 5p fuel duty cut back in April, however this hasn't done much if anything to improve the situation.More worryingly, the study showed that 42 percent of 18-34 year olds have gone to banks to borrow money due to fuel and cost of living rises.
