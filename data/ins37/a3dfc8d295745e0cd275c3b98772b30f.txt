Elma Pazar has vowed never to leave her "true passion" behind despite rising to fame on reality TV shows Love Island and TOWIE. The public was first introduced to the brunette beauty in 2019 when she made a short-lived but big impression in the Majorcan villa. The now-29-year-old arrived as a bombshell alongside Maura Higgins in season five of the hit dating show, but she was given her marching orders after just a week. Now, she is gracing our screens once again after landing a spot on the cast of The Only Way Is Essex earlier this year.
