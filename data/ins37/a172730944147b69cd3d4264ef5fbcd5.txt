The campaign was carried out by iBooster, the reference agency for the development, growth and marketing of Crypto projects, based in Lugano.
In the light of PlanB and this communication initiative, we were very curious to learn more about the real opportunities, and advantages, for companies in the Crypto market, within the new Swiss ecosystem.The Crypto and Blockchain industry is in its early life years and Lugano Plan B is a project that will allow all companies in the sector to find an ecosystem conducive to future development, populated by professionals in the sector but not only, able to support new companies at 360° from physical headquarters or coworking up to legal advice or marketing.
