The first gameplay footage of Street Fighter 6 has brought with it a lot of official details, but also leaks revealing all the new fighters.
Street Fighter 6 was one of the biggest reveals during Thursday night's new State of Play, with Capcom releasing a ton of new information afterwards, including the fact that the game will be multiformat.
However, Capcom only officially revealed four fighters (Ryu, Chun-Li, and newcomers Luke and Jamie). Although there were a few hints at others in the trailer none of them were announced and yet what seems to be the full 22-person roster has just leaked online.
