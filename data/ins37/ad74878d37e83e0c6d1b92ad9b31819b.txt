The war between Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant and the NBA media continued this week in a series of tweets stemming from, of course, something Stephen A. Smith said on ESPN's "First Take."

Durant took offense when Smith said Michael Jordan changed the game of basketball for the worse because of how he "individualization the sport." Smith argued the NBA focused more on players rather than teams after Jordan's ascension which negatively changed the dynamic of the game.

"Michael Jordan is responsible as much as anybody for changing the game for worse," Smith said.
