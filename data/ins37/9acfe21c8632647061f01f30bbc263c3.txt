The S&P 500 broke a seven-week losing streak last week, rising 6.6%.

LPL shared three reasons for investors to feel optimistic that the bear market might be over.

The broker-dealer, which manages assets worth around $1 trillion, said that last week's strong market performance could set the tone for markets this summer.
