The athletic director at the University of Utah, Mark Harlan, told Sports Illustrated this week that a Utes football player was contacted by an NIL collective associated with another school and offered 'about a million dollars' to transfer.

Collectives are booster and business-driven entities that have sprung up to offer Name, Image and Likeness money to college athletes. While schools can't officially offer a player anything, a private collective can — i.e. come to our favorite school and we'll give you x-amount in 'endorsement' money.
