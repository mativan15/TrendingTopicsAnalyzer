A bit more than a year ago, it was reported that a new dining and drinking spot was planning to open where one of the oldest gay bars in Boston had been, and now we have learned that it has debuted.Universal Hub is reporting (via a post from BosGuy) that The Kartal is now open in the city's South End, moving into the former Boston Eagle space on Tremont Street. The article indicates that this is a soft opening, and that the new spot will be a cocktail bar, though few other details are known at this point in time.
