The average price of charging an electric car on a pay-as-you-go, non-subscription basis at a publicly accessible rapid charger in Great Britain has increased by 21 percent to 44.55p per kilowatt hour (kWh). The data has been analysed by the RAC's new Charge Watch initiative which will track the price of average EV charging, similar to its Fuel Watch tool.The 7.81p per kWh increase, from 36.74p at the end of last summer, means that the average cost to complete an 80 percent rapid charge of a typical family-sized electric car with a 64kWh battery has increased by £4 over this period, from £18.
