(The Hill) – The National Rifle Association (NRA) is moving forward with its annual summit in Houston, Texas, this weekend despite calls for the event to be canceled.  The pro-gun group's three-day convention, which starts Friday, is located less than 300 miles from the site of the deadliest school shooting in nearly a decade. On Tuesday, an 18-year-old shot and killed 19 children and two adults at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas using guns he bought just days before. The NRA, the most powerful gun rights group in the nation, has lobbied GOP lawmakers to oppose bills to expand background checks on gun sales, ban assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines and enact 'red flag' provisions that allow authorities to take guns away from individuals who pose a threat.
