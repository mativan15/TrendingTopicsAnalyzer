Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday launched a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), saying they want to make people 'AAP nirbhar' or dependent on AAP while BJP wants to make people 'atmanirbhar' or self-reliant.
'(Arvind) Kejriwalji gives a press statement every day, gives big advertisements and… he has believed that by giving advertisements, people can be misguided. This could work for five or seven years but slowly people come to know. I am here to say that AAP wants to make people ‘AAP nirbhar' and we want to make them ‘atmanirbhar',' Shah said, inaugurating the Municipal Corporation of Delhi's (MCD) waste-to-energy plant in Tehkhand.
