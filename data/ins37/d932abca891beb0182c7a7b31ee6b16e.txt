Jaipur: A government school teacher in Rajasthan's Alwar district is training disabled girls in self-defence, using specialised techniques. Asha Suman feels that these girls are more vulnerable to sexual assaults and therefore it is important to train them so that they can protect themselves if such a situation arises. Ms Suman, 40, who teaches at a primary school at Kharkhada, Rajgarh in Alwar district of Rajasthan, started training girls facing various disabilities especially vision loss in 2015.
