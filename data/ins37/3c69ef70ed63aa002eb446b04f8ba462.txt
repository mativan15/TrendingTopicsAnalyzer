The strategy from the onset has been quite clear for us - profitable growth through physical availability, anchored by a strong e-commerce experience and premium wholesale presence. We aim to do retail differently than it has been done before. NEW YORK (PRWEB) May 31, 2022 New York-based menswear brand Psycho Bunny is accelerating its global expansion, capitalizing on its hyper-growth in recent years, to grow its portfolio of brick and mortar stores to 70 stores worldwide by the end of 2022. With 29 stores in the US and 30 stores in Latin America at present, and four new stores set to open in Canada to mark the brand's debut in the new market, Psycho Bunny stands out in its brick and mortar retail domination and has seen its business triple in the last year.
