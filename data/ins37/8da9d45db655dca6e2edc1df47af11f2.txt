Prince Albert - Inmates at Pine Grove Correctional Center north of Prince Albert are on a hunger strike to protest unsafe drinking water and a lack of access to programming. 'The water tastes and smells like raw sewage,' inmate Faith Eagle said in an interview with CTV. 'And it's the only thing that you can drink, so when you drink it you'll get a bloated stomach or a stomach ache, but you have to drink it because you need water.' Eagle says she has refused food for five weeks and only had broth and juice when she feels weak.
