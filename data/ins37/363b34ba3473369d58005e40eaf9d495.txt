Medvedev opens serving with a double fault, and so at 0-30, Kecmanovic is the more composed of the two, calming returning as Medvedev scrambles at the baseline. 
Medvedev gets his first points on the board with a driving serve, and follows it up with an ace, as if refocusing himself after the smallest of false starts. 
He taps a neat volley over the net that a wrongfooted Kecmanovic can't return, and although the Serbian saw break point, he couldn't claim it.

A whistlestop opener for Kecmanovic, as Medvedev's opener goes long.
