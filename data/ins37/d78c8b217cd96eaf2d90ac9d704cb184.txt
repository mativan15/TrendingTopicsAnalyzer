The New Brunswick government is using some of its budget surplus to create 380 new public housing units over the next four years. The $102.2-million project will also include "immediate renovations" to 110 units that have been sitting empty, Social Development Minister Dorothy Shephard said at an announcement in Saint John on Monday. Shephard said there will be 120 new housing units divided evenly between Saint John, Fredericton and Moncton, with another 68 units in northern New Brunswick. A further 192 units will be established in areas of greatest need — in both rural and urban settings.
