At the age of eight, Wilbur Smith was given his grandfather's Remington rifle, which had 122 notches on the butt. He shot his first lion when he was 14. Such a boy seemed destined to become a hunter, but it was on paper that Smith realised his dreams of adventure – and millions shared them through his 49 novels over half a century.In recent years Smith, who has died aged 88, would say proudly: 'I don't write literature, I write stories,' and added that he always saw himself as the hero in his books and always fell in love with his female characters.
