An escaped murderer is believed to be connected to the murders of two adults and three children this week in Centerville, Texas, a small town between Dallas and Houston, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The murders occurred in the area where Gozalo Lopez, a convicted murderer, escaped from prison last month, launching a massive manhunt. Authorities found the bodies Thursday while conducting a welfare check at the home at the request of a relative. A 1999 white Chevrolet Silverado was also missing from the home, which Lopez may have stolen.
