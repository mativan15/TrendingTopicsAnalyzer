Stating that a liability of Rs 171.92 crore is pending against real estate firm M/s GLM Infratech Pvt Ltd, the Haryana Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (HREAT) has dismissed the firm's two appeals challenging orders in favour of allottees of Amazon The Defence County – a residential project at Panchkula's Sector 30 which has not been completed by GLM Infratech since 2008.
Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) had allowed the allottees, gathered under the banner of GLM Buyers' Welfare Association, to take possession of the incomplete multi-crore housing project in May and September 2022.
