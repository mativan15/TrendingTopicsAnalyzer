The request came after four leaks were found on the Nord Stream pipelines in late September. The European Union suspects sabotage was behind the leaks in the subsea Russian pipelines to Europe. "Belgian gas infrastructure in the North Sea is deemed a priority," Van der Straeten said, adding the inspections are subject to a "strictly confidential follow-up".
