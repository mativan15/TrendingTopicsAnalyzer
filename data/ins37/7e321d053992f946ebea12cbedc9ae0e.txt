Drew Angerer Thesis Twilio stock (NYSE:TWLO) is down by about 76% year to date and 85% from all-time highs. The valuation is now very attractive - trading at a one year forward EV/Sales of about x2.3. And given a reasonable 3-year CAGR outlook of about 30%, this ratio should contract towards x1 by 2025 (assuming flat market capitalization and net debt). Moreover, profitability doubts should soon disappear, as CEO Jeff Lawson is convinced that the company will achieve positive operating income as early as 2023.
