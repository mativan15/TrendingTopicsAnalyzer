There is serious concern among Ukrainian officials, lawmakers and experts over the outcome of the coming November midterms in the U.S., as several conservative Republicans have made a point of declaring they would cut off support to Kyiv if the GOP takes the House in November."Statements of some representatives of the Republican party in U.S. media, especially among supporters of ex-president Trump in U.S. Congress to cut the military and financial support to Ukraine, do concern Ukrainians a lot," Maxim Yali, Ukrainian political expert and foreign affairs commentator, told Newsweek.
