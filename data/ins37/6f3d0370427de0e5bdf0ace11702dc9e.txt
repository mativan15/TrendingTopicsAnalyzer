ferrantraite/E+ via Getty Images Corporacion America Airports (NYSE:CAAP) operates 54 airports around the world. This makes it the single largest private owner globally based on the number of facilities held. The company handled 84 million passengers in 2019, which is roughly equal to the number of passengers going through Los Angeles International "LAX" in that same year to give a sense of perspective. CAAP's primary airport holdings are in Argentina, where it operates both main Buenos Aires airports along with a host of smaller regional facilities around the country.
