A divorced stepfather in China has demanded his former stepson repay the money he spent supporting him during his university studies. The ex-stepfather, surnamed Tang, from Sichuan province in southwest China, filed a lawsuit in March this year demanding his ex-stepson, surnamed Liu, repay him 35,200 yuan (S$7,200). Tang claimed the money had been spent on covering Liu's tuition and living expenses including food and clothes during his four years of university study. Tang married Liu's mother in 2009 when the boy was 10 years old.
