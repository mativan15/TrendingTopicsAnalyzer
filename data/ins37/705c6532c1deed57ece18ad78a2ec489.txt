Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has slammed Iran for supplying drones to Russia. He said it is having a major impact on people's lives. In an interview with Canadian media on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said, "Iran supplies them drones. Supplies them killings. Killing of Ukrainians. This is what they agreed on. Agreed on for money. This bloody money that Iran is earning." He said the drones have struck hundreds of infrastructure facilities, schools and universities. The president also said the attacks on the country's energy system are threatening people's lives heading into the winter.
