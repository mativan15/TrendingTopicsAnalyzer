A detailed biomechanical study by Brooks showed I need a shoe with additional support.

Next year Brooks will release its first 3D-printed midsole, an infinitely customizable technology.

The shoe is the latest sign of the industry trend towards mass customization.

One of the first next-generation treadmills sits in the second floor R&D lab of Brooks' headquarters in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. This month, I got to try it out.
