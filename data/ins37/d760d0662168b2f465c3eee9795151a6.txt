Twin Cities-based HomeServices of America now owns another of the top real estate brokerages in New Jersey. HomeServices, the behemoth national real estate holding company that owns Edina Realty, said Thursday that it had acquired Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices New Jersey Properties. The business is headquartered in Martinsville, N.J., and has 19 locations and more than 800 agents mostly in northern and central New Jersey. Since 2014 the company has been an independent franchisee of HomeServices, but will now be a wholly-owned company.
