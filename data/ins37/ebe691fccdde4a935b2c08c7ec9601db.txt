The Techne UK poll for Express.co.uk shows that 54 percent want international aid cut to help tackle the cost of living crisis at home compared to 43 percent who support sending money abroad. The result comes ahead of a crucial week for Boris Johnson, who has been warned he needs 'to be more of a Conservative Prime Minister' if he wants to see off a vote of confidence. Tory backbenchers have been pressing for him to go back on a pledge to restore foreign aid to 0.7 percent of GDP and instead reduce it.
