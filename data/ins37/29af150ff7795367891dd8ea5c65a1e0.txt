Published: 10:35 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 10:40 EDT, 4 June 2022 GoFundMe shut down a fake fundraiser seeking to raise $1 million to help Amber Heard to pay off Johnny Depp after the ex-couple's defamation trial saw her owe him $15 million. A Justice for Amber Heard page was launched on the crowdfunding site by someone named Kimberly Moore, who alleged to be in contact with Heard's legal team, shortly after the jury reached a verdict in the trial.'I believe Amber, and social media protected the abuser,' the GoFundMe page read.
