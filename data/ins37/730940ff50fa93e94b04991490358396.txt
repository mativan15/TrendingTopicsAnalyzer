Well, here it is, the 24th "Bones" mystery.

Carolyn Haines of Semmes, Alabama, is surely one of the most productive, indeed relentless, mystery writers of all time.

The novel, "Lady of Bones," opens at Hilltop, the home of Tinkie Bellcase Richmond, Sarah Booth's business partner, in Zinnia, in the Mississippi delta.

Tinkie, after unspeakable difficulties, has had her baby, Maylin. In fact, in the previous novel, Tinkie delivered Maylin, two days earlier, in a neighbor's backyard. Now the gang is decorating the house for a Halloween party.
