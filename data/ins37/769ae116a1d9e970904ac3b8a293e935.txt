After seven years, 325 days of public hearings and evidence from 725 victims, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales has published its final report. It makes 20 recommendations for change, the first three of which are described as the 'centrepiece' recommendations: A statutory requirement for people working (whether paid or voluntary) in regulated activity or positions of trust to report allegations of child sexual abuse. The report says failure to comply should be a new criminal offence where a mandated person was in receipt of a disclosure of child sexual abuse from a child or perpetrator or witnessed a child being sexually abused.
