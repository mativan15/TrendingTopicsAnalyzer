Going into the 2022 football season, Aggies Wire will be looking at each scholarship player listed on the Texas A&M roster.
Over the preseason, each profile will cover where the player is from, how recruiting websites rated them coming out of high school, and what role they will play for Jimbo Fisher this season.
Layden Robinson is entering his junior season at the starting right guard position after spending his sophomore year as the starter during the 2021 season. As one of the veteran linemen and overall players on offense, Robinson has the opportunity to not only help the team progress throughout the season but also help his draft stock as a current prospect with a whole lot of upside.
