With 5G rolling out in some parts of the country, scammers have found a new way of conning people. According to a recent report by Check Point Software, scammers are posing as customer care executives from Vodafone, Airtel or Jio and offering assistance to unsuspecting customers in upgrading their 4G SIMs to 5G.
The new phishing method works by sending customers phishing links that require them to enter personal or sensitive information such as bank passwords or OTPs and taking money from their account.
