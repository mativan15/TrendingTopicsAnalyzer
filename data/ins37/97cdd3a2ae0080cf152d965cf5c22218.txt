(AP) - Texas' current seniors lost the 2019 NCAA title after predictions of severe weather pushed up the championship match tee times to just after dawn. The Longhorns are back in the title match, and this time they don't have to worry about tornadoes. This year's tournament is in the desert, not Arkansas. Texas beat Vanderbilt 3 1/2-1 1/2 on Tuesday to earn a spot in the championship match against Arizona State, giving its seniors a second shot at winning a national title.
