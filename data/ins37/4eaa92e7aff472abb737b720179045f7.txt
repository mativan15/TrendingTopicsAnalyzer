The Indian Army on Monday issued initial tenders for the procurement of 363 drones to boost its logistics chain and enhance operational preparedness along the sensitive border regions, officials said. While 163 drones would be for high-altitude regions, 200 are being procured for use in medium-altitude areas, officials said. The drones are being procured under emergency procurement through fast track procedure under Buy (Indian) category. 
 The initial tender or request for proposal (RFP) for buying 200 medium-altitude drones says the platforms should be capable of withstanding strong winds.
