The Punjab government has deposited ₹5 crore to the Punjab and Haryana high court registry amid the ongoing indefinite protest outside Malbros International Private Limited, an alcohol-making unit at Mansurwal village of Zira assembly segment in Ferozepur. 'In compliance with the order of the Punjab and Haryana high court to Punjab government, ₹5 crore has been deposited,' said Ferozepur deputy commissioner Amrit Singh. A petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana high court on behalf of Malbros International Private Limited, Ferozepur, alleging that there had been an indefinite protest outside their company due to which it was lying closed since July 26.
