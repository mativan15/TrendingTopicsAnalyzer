Love Island star Callum Macleod has become engaged to his partner after a romantic sunset proposal.
The aircraft engineer headed out to the villa in 2019 but failed to find love, becoming the first Islander to be sent home after a dramatic recoupling. 
He had initially been paired up with then 21-year-old Amber Gill, who said he was ‘too old and nice' for real romance to blossom.
However, it appears the reality TV star has had much more luck outside of the programme, revealing he was going to marry his partner Jade Olivia.
