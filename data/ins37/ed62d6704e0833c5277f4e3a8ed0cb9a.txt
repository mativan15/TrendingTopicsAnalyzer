Oct. 17—SUMMERVILLE — The upcoming Tuesday, Nov. 8, election will not impact the makeup of the Summerville City Council.

The city council has two candidates running for open seats and both are incumbents. Sheri Rogers is running for reelection to Position 1 and Kent Smith is running for reelection for Position 3. Rogers and Smith are both running for four-year terms.

Rogers has served on the city council since the late 1990s and has been Summerville's mayor for the past two decades.

Summerville's mayoral position is determined by a vote of the members of its city council.
