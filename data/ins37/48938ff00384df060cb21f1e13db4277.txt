Malaysian caretaker Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition must work 'very hard' to secure the overwhelming majority it needs to form a strong government in the coming general election, Bernama reported.

Gone were the days when the coalition could field a songkok -- the black cap traditionally worn by Muslim males in the Southeast Asian nation -- and still win, Ismail told reporters Tuesday night in Perak, a state in the northwest of peninsular Malaysia.
