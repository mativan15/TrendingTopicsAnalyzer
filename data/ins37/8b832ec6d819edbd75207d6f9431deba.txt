The Federal Reserve recently released the minutes from its latest meeting in September, which showed that Fed members plan to continue raising interest rates in the months ahead. Although the Fed recognized that it may need to slow the pace of interest rate increases, it is likely to raise the federal funds rate further before pausing, according to the minutes. "Several participants noted that, particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environment, it would be important to calibrate the pace of further policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook," the Fed minutes stated.
