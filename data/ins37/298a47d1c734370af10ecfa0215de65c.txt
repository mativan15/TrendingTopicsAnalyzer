May 27, 2022 / 12:23 PM / CBS San Francisco OAKLAND – A tax increase on Oakland big businesses will be up to voters in November following a city council vote Thursday afternoon. The council voted unanimously to place a measure on the ballot that will tax businesses more when they earn more. The progressive tax would raise nearly $22 million annually and the revenue would be placed in the city's General Fund. The aim is to make Oakland's tax structure "more fair" and provide money for needed city services to address problems like homelessness and illegal dumping, according to the council.
