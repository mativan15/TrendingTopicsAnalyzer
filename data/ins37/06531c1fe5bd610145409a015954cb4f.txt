Meghan Markle has revealed she has absolutely no intentions of venturing back into the world of acting… but if her children wanted to pursue careers in entertainment, she'd support them wholeheartedly.
All the way back in 2018, a year before her lavish Windsor wedding to Prince Harry, Meghan appeared in her final episode of legal drama Suits, having played the role of Rachel Zane since its 2011 premiere.
Following the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to step down as senior members of the royal family, the pair have been pursuing ventures including an upcoming Netflix docu-series and Meghan's Spotify podcast Archetypes, on which she's welcomed guests including Serena Williams and Mariah Carey.
