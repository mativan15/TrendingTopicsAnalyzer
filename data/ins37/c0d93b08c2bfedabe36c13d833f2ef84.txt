India's burgeoning e-commerce market is expected to reach US$120 billion by 2026, a more than a threefold increase from US$38 billion in 2021, according to a joint repor
t by FICCI-Anarock. Despite the booming market, the Indian e-commerce sector is largely dominated by a few big players like home-grown online marketplace Flipkart and global tech giant Amazon.
