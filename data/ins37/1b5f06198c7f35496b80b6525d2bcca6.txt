ljubaphoto/E+ via Getty Images U.K.-based medical devices manufacturer Smith & Nephew (NYSE:SNN) has seen its business recovering and it is expected to grow in the next several years. The shares are not cheap but I think offer fair value for a company with long-term growth prospects in an attractive industry. Business Performance has Improved Sharply Full year results were issued in February. Revenue, profits and profit margins all improved markedly from the prior year. That largely reflects the company moving on from pandemic-era challenges (revenues were just 1% above 2019 levels, while earnings per share were 13% lower) but that is still a significant and welcome achievement.
