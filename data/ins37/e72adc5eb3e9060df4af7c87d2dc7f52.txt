PORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said testimony and video from last week's Jan. 6 committee hearing, which featured congressional leadership in tense phone calls with Pentagon and White House officials, was "devastating."

Biden was speaking to reporters during a stop at an ice cream shop in Oregon as he helped campaign for Tina Kotek, who is running for governor or Oregon.

"I think the testimony and the video are actually devastating and I've been going out of my way not to comment," Biden said.
