Ravens tight end Mark Andrews, fullback Patrick Ricard and cornerback Marcus Peters returned to practice Friday, bolstering their chances of playing in Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns.

Andrews and Ricard, both Pro Bowl selections last season, missed practice Wednesday and Thursday with knee injuries. Peters, who's missed only a handful of defensive snaps since Week 3, was out with a rest day and then a quadriceps injury.

Running back J.K. Dobbins missed his third straight practice and is unlikely to play Sunday in Baltimore.
