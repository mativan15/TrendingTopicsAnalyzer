The government is considering a Goods and Services Tax (GST) dispute settlement scheme offering a one-time opportunity for businesses to settle tax cases and avoid litigation, officials aware of the development said. It will be a time-bound scheme covering only minor GST offences while offering a one-time opportunity to settle past disputes under excise duty, service tax and customs duty, they said. 
The scheme will need to be approved by the GST Council, the apex decision-making body for the indirect tax.
