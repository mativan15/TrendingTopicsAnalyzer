A private charter service based in Kinston is going public at a valuation of $600 million.

FlyExclusive and EG Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: EGGF) announced today they have entered an agreement that will take flyExclusive to the public market. EG Acquisition is a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, a method of going public that has diminished in popularity this year amid rocky markets.

The transaction expects to provide up to $310 million in proceeds, including $85 million of immediate funding through committed convertible notes and up to $225 million of SPAC cash held in trust.
