President Joe Biden is co-hosting a fundraiser with Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman today in Philadelphia.

Biden is lending his support to Fetterman as the Democratic lieutenant governor strives to maintain a slim lead over Republican candidate Mehmet Oz. The GOP nominee has nearly wiped away the significant polling advantage Fetterman had held through the summer months, and the two candidates now appear to be neck-and-neck going into the final stretch of the campaign.
