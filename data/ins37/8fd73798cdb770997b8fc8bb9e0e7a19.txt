(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia is proposing about $4 billion of projects to funders including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to help wean itself off of coal, with a deal possible as early as next week.The funds would go toward accelerating the retirement of up to 2 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants, according to a public consultation document. BloombergNEF data shows Indonesia has about 37 gigawatts of such plants. The financing would be done through a platform meant to let the projects tap a mix of sovereign, multilateral and private investors, instead of only bilateral funding.
