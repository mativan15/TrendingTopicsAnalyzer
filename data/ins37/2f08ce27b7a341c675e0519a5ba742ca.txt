HP recently announced its Spring lineup of Spectre and Envy laptops that closely follows what it announced last Fall, targeting the hybrid work environments we live in post-pandemic and how we are all creators. HP stands out from the crowd because it approaches who a creator is. Pre-pandemic, it was very apparent who would be considered a creator, specifically those who create entertaining media on our favorite media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Tik Tock, Reddit, etc. I believe inherently we are all creators, created in the image of God to imitate Him in being creative and artistic.
