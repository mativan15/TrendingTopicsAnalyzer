VOCES8, an internationally renowned musical group that has been called 'the Rolls-Royce of British a cappella ensembles,' will perform Saturday at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach.

Inviting VOCES8 was the brainchild of Bethesda-by-the-Sea Associate for Music and Liturgy, organist and choirmaster Stuart Forster. He's wanted to see the ensemble perform live in person since trying to get tickets to a show in Cambridge, Massachusetts, about five years ago, only for the show to quickly sell out.
