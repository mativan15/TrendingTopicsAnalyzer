The markets saw a gap up opening on Monday and saw the index opening well above 16,400 levels. The markets remained their gains throughout and did now show any inclination to correct. The headline index closed while posting strong gains of 308.95 points (+1.89%).Very much on the anticipated lines, the Nifty made a strong breakout from the broad 15,700-16,400 trading range that it had formed over the past couple of weeks. In the previous technical note, it was mentioned that if the Nifty is able to move past and sustain above 16,400, it may see a strong move on the higher side.
