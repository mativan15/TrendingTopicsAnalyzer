Britain's housing market lost momentum this month after Prime Minister Liz Truss's economic plans upset financial markets and triggered a repricing of the mortgage market, data from property website Rightmove showed on Monday. Britain's housing market had already been showing signs of cooling after a more than 20% surge in prices since the start of the pandemic as the cost of living rose and the Bank of England steadily increased interest rates. But last month Truss's government announced a plan to boost economic growth through unfunded tax cuts that alarmed financial markets.
