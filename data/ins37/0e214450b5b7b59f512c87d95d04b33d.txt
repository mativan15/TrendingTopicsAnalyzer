A specially-abled boy doesn't let his disability dampen his determination. He jumps and hops on his one leg to school every day to pursue his dreams. This boy from Kashmir named Parvaiz lost his leg at a tender age. However, he is currently studying in Class 9 at Government High School in Nowgam. In an exclusive conversation with ANI on Friday, the 14-year old child said, "I cover a distance of about two kilometres daily while balancing on one leg. Roads are not good. If I get an artificial limb, I can walk.
