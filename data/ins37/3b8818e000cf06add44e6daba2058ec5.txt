HEINEKEN® is addressing this growing work life imbalance with The Closer, an outlandish high-tech bottle opener that immediately shuts all work applications when a bottle of Heineken is opened with it. Dramatized in a campaign film as the antidote to the increasing demands of our always-on work culture, The Closer bottle opener itself is a satirical symbol for the power every worker has to close down at the end of the day.

"As a brand, we have always stood for creating moments of shared connections with others," said Bram Westenbrink, Global Head Heineken® Brand at HEINEKEN.
