Is the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT% really the definitive racing shoe to splurge on? The answer isn't a simple yes or no. For starters, Nike's tech-loaded ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2 and Adidas's Adizero Adios Pro 2.0 may have something to say about that. But this is a good time to delve into the discussion considering it is the first Wednesday of June; the Global Running Day.Of course, there is the subjective matter of comfort with convention compared with radical designs. This may also be a good time to establish the fine distinguishing line that separates running shoes (that you may be familiar with) from racing shoes (they are running shoes, with a different implementation of tech).
