By Khristopher J. Brooks October 21, 2022 / 2:52 PM / MoneyWatch American Airlines is eliminating first-class tickets on international flights, saying the carrier isn't selling enough of the pricey seats."First class will not exist on the 777, or for that matter at American Airlines, for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it," Vasu Raja, chief commercial officer, said in announcing the company's third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Raja said many passengers are avoiding first-class and instead buying less expensive business-class tickets.
