Oct. 20—The Joint Economic Community Development Board is seeking a change in its bylaws following a transfer of financial management from the city of Crossville to Cumberland County.

"I would like to get the interlocal agreement to match what we actually do," said Rebecca Stone, 3rd District commissioner, during the Sept. 22 meeting.

Meetings have moved from Crossville City Hall to the Cumberland County Courthouse and Beth Davis from Cumberland County Mayor Allen Foster's office will be providing administrative support for the board.
