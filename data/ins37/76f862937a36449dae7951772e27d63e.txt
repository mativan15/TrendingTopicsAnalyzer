By Reuters Published: 14:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 14:24 EDT, 18 October 2022 The Los Angeles Kings placed forward Alex Iafallo on injured reserve Tuesday with a lower-body injury. Iafallo, 28, was injured during the 5-4 win Monday over the host Detroit Red Wings. He extended his season-opening point streak (two goals, three assists) to four games before leaving late in the third period, assisting on Gabriel Vilardi's first-period goal. That also marked the 100th career assist for Iafallo, who also has 73 goals in 365 games since making his NHL debut with Los Angeles in 2017.
