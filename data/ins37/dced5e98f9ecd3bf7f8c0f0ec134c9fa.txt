Arborists across the region say they are working 12 hours on some days due to the high demand since the derecho windstorm smacked the Ottawa-Gatineau region more than 10 days ago.Tree felling, pruning and brushing experts have jettisoned around the region to clean up the hundreds of downed trees hit by the strong winds on May 21.One tree maintenance expert says the storm gave his company 18 months worth of work."The first night was tough. We worked until midnight in pitch black making sure some people had the trees free from their roofs," said Jared Carden.
