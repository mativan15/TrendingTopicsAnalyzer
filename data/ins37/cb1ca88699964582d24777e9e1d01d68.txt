Kamikaze drones are crewless aerial vehicles loaded with explosives that can fly directly to tanks or units and explode on collision. The technique has been advanced in modern warfare. Japanese kamikaze pilots knowingly crashed their aircraft into enemy targets during World War II. These small, lethal drones can be programmed to hit targets without human intervention through facial recognition. It can also stay in the air doing nothing for a long time. They are also cheaper than their larger counterparts and can overcome traditional defences to strike their targets.
