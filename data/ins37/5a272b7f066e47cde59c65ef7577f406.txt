Well-wishers from around the world have raised enough money to help four orphaned siblings buy their family home after their parents died of cancer within months of each other.

More than €380,165 (£320,000) has been raised to help the sons of Padraig and Elaine Clifford, from County Kerry in Ireland, after their deaths left their children, aged five to 21, orphans.

Padraig, 46, died of cancer in January, five months after his wife passed away.
