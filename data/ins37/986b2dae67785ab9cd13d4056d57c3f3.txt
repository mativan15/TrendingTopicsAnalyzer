The B.C. government says it will introduce amendments to legislation that would allow the federal government to join a B.C.-led class-action lawsuit seeking to recover health-care costs related to the sale and marketing of opioid-based pain medication. The province says the changes to the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act would allow Ottawa to join B.C. and other provinces and territories in the class-action suit that is pursuing damages from companies that allegedly contributed to the opioid addiction crisis.
