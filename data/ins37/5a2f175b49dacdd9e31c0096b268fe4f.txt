Former Punjab Cabinet minister and two-term Congress MLA Sunder Sham Arora was arrested by the state Vigilance Bureau late on Saturday. The 63-year-old, who is currently in the BJP, was arrested for allegedly offering a Rs 50-lakh bribe to an officer of the bureau in return for exoneration in a corruption case.
A Congress leader said Arora made it big as a real-estate businessman and his journey to politics was facilitated by his proximity to former Congress minister Chaudhary Jagjit Singh. Arora contested his first Assembly election from Hoshiarpur on a Congress ticket in 2012.
