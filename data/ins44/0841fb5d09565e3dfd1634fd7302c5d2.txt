CLEVELAND — Whatever happens to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the American League Division Series, they have Gerrit Cole to thank for being there at all. No matter what maladies or mayhem have threatened them against the Cleveland Guardians, Cole was good enough twice in four games to ensure none of it doomed them before they had a chance to advance.

With his Yankees one loss from a frustrating winter of oblivion, Cole pitched seven sturdy innings that ensured the runs they did score and the relievers they did have were enough for a 4-2 win in Sunday night's Game 4.
