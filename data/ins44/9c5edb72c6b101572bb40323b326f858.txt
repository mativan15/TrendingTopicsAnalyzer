Better rest and relax now while you can. Another big Apple news dump is just a few days away.Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference is back again, as the company officially confirmed last week. The big keynote address, where all the major announcements are made, is set to air on Monday, June 6 at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. As usual, watching the event couldn't be easier. The first and easiest option is to just go to the Apple Events website, where it will be streamed live on Monday. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, it's also available on Apple's YouTube channel.
