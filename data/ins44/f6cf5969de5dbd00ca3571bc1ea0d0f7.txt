Ed Sheeran had already started writing his James Bond theme for No Time To Die when he was replaced by Billie Eilish, he has revealed.
The Bad Habits chart-topper was in line to pen a song for the iconic spy film saga when Danny Boyle was attached to direct the most recent movie.
However, the filmmaker was later replaced by Cary Joki Fukunaga, and Eilish was then brought on board to write and record her Grammy and Oscar-winning anthem No Time To Die.
Explaining that he felt it was almost a rite of passage for any UK-born singer to be keen on doing a Bond song, Ed gave insight into just how far along he'd been with his until it was canned.
