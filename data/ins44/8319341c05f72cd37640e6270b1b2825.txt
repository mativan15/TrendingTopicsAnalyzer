Shares in copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX 9.10%) were up by more than 8% by early afternoon today. In general, it was a good day for cyclical mining stocks -- usually a sign that the market is taking a positive view of the economic growth outlook. That said, there are some stock-specific reasons why Freeport outperformed, and they come down to management's commentary around the company's third-quarter earnings released the day before. 
The results themselves brought few surprises; after all, investors can see where the price of copper is in the market and therefore ascertain the trend in Freeport's revenue.
