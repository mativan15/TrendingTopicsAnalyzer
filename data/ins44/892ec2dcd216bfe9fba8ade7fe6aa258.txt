Chikka Thimmaiah, a resident of Bapujinagar and a schoolteacher, was returning home from work and stopped at the petrol pump. He noticed a minor boy working as an attendant and asked him about his age. As the boy was reluctant to reply, he approached the manager and objected to the boy working as an attendant and informed him that it amounts to child labour.
