TAMPA — The Lightning outplayed the Philadelphia Flyers for most of Tuesday's home opener. But they let their opponent hang around, and a resilient team burned them late.

Despite leading by two goals in the second period and owning zone time for most of the first two frames, Tampa Bay lost its first game on home ice, 3-2.

The Lightning have dropped three of their first four games to open the season. Their first two losses came against top competition in the Rangers and Penguins, but the upstart Flyers snuck up on Tampa Bay from behind with two third-period goals.
