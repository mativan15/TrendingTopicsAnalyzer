By PA Media Published: 20:41 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 03:01 EDT, 30 May 2022 Ministers have reportedly been warned of potential power cuts to as many as six million households this winter, with the Government drawing up plans for rationed electricity if supply issues deteriorate. According to The Times, Government modelling of a 'reasonable' worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages in winter if Russia cuts off more supplies to the EU. The paper writes limits could be imposed on industrial use of gas, including on gas-fired power stations, causing electricity shortages.
