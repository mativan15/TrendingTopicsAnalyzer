Home to a similar number of art deco buildings as Napier, Hastings mayor Sandra Hazlehurst​ says raising the profile of the city's character architecture had been a priority, pointing to refurbishment of the Hastings Opera House and Municipal Building. Revitalisation projects have included street upgrades, creating pocket parks and upgrading green spaces with outdoor seating and eating areas, which had encouraged new businesses to invest in Hastings. 'We're creating a beautiful, safe, vibrant city with funky green spaces, art and culture, where people want to live, shop, dine out and attend events,' she said.
