China has rubbished the American government's plans to assist India in building semiconductor manufacturing capacity, calling it 'lip service' in state-run Global Times. During US government official Afreen Akhter's visit to India, she said that the Biden administration will help the subcontinent boost its semiconductor manufacturing capacity.

Akhter - US deputy assistant secretary, South and Central Asia - led a semiconductors trade mission to India and met top government officials.

According to the Global Times story, the announcement is designed to "lure India into a geopolitical game to exclude China from the global chip industrial chain, rather than a commitment with real investment plans to support India's chip manufacturing.
