In April I cashed in £20,550 of Premium Bonds to take advantage of the savings rate offered by Chase. I had already used NS&I's online facility to change my nominated bank to Chase without a problem.When I tried to transfer my money I had a call from someone at NS&I who took me through an extremely thorough set of security questions before they informed me that they couldn't verify my Chase account. This was because Chase has not implemented confirmation of payee yet. Despite me confirming over the phone that the Chase account was genuinely mine, NS&I wasn't satisfied with this and tried to recall the money.
