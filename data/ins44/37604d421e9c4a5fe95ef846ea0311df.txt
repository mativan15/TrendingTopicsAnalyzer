The 49ers are shutting down defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw for the foreseeable future. In a set of roster moves announced Saturday, San Francisco added Kinlaw and cornerback Emmanuel Moseley to IR. They also activated linebacker Curtis Robinson off IR and elevated CB Dontae Johnson and WR Willie Snead IV from the practice squad.

Kinlaw has been dealing with some issues in his surgically-repaired knee. He tried to play in Week 4 and couldn't make it onto the field. He was out last week and ruled out again Friday before being placed on IR.
