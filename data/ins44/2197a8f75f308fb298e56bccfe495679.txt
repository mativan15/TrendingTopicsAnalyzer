Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has missed six games. After five more, he'll be able to return to action.

But it's not simply a matter of missing the games. He also has to comply with the other terms imposed upon him by the league.

On Tuesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters that Watson has complied to date with all requirements. They primarily relate to evaluation and treatment.

Last week, another lawsuit was commenced against Watson.
