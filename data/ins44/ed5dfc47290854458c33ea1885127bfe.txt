REVIEW: Singers and drummers popping off for solo projects is nothing new and widely considered a healthy habit. Life in a band can be much like a marriage and well-structured time apart can help keep the flame alive. But when half your band makes a record without you, it must feel a bit more on the nose. A Light For Attracting Attention by The Smile sounds a lot like Radiohead, because it is quite literally half of Radiohead. Thom Yorke's iconic voice is right at the front. Unmistakeable, mostly unadorned and largely intelligible.
