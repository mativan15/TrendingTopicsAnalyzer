Wolverhampton Wanderers' search for a manager continues with Michael Beale, their No 1 target, having turned down the role to stay at Queens Park Rangers.
Beale, 42, a former assistant of Steven Gerard at Rangers and Aston Villa, took QPR top of the Championship on Wednesday night with victory over Cardiff City. He was one of a number of options that Wolves were looking at, including the Dutch manager Peter Bosz. Over the past 48 hours, Beale had emerged as the first choice despite him having managed only 15 games at QPR.
