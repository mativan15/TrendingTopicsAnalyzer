sanfel/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) have rallied back significantly from their June lows, but they do remain about 10% lower from last year. This company was a tremendous beneficiary of COVID-19 as spending on sporting goods soared. The question now is how much of its revenue gains does it give back over the next 12-18 months as spending patterns normalize. I expect the company has about $7 in earnings power, so at 16x earnings, I would use the recent recovery to sell shares and look for value elsewhere.
