BP will pay $26 per share, a 38% premium to the average share price in the 30 days to Oct. 14, Archaea said Monday in a statement. The Houston-based company, which captures waste-gas emissions from landfills and farms, will become a key part of BP's bioenergy business and accelerate its growth, according to the statement.
