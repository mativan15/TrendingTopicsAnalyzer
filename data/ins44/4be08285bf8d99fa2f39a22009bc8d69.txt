Olympic hurdles champion Brianna Rollins-McNeal's experience echoes Richards-Ross's claims. Rollins-McNeal is currently serving a five-year ban for 'tampering with the results management process' connected with her missing a doping test two days after she had an abortion in January 2020.
The 30-year-old, who faced a previous ban for missing three whereabouts tests, claims she changed the date on letters provided to anti-doping officials by her doctor because she thought they had made a clerical error.
