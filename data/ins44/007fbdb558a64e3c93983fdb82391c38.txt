A girl I share some social circles with with just got engaged and I'm not happy for her. I'm terrified. 
Her fiancé is, in the kindest words I can stomach, a horrible person. He has been party to numerous affairs, at least once with a married woman. While dating his fiancee, he has cheated on her multiple times. One of the people he cheated with was my former roommate (who was unaware of the other relationship).
