Savers are getting extremely different pension projections in their annual statements.The growth assumptions used by pension companies to estimate how much savers will have in retirement can vary hugely. Someone with a pension pot of £50,000 who is 30 years from retirement can be told that they could have as much as £297,000 in retirement or as little as £136,500, according to the pensions consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock (LCP). This is based on a pension pot that is 70 per cent invested in equities (the stock market), 10 per cent in corporate bonds (company debt), 10 per cent in gilts (government debt) and 10 per cent in cash.
