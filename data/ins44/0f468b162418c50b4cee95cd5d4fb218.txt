Published October 17, 2022 9:49am EDT In a FOX Business exclusive interview Monday, Parlement Technologies CEO George Farmer - who runs the parent company of free-speech platform Parler - confirmed rapper and fashion mogul Ye West, formerly known as Kanye, will acquire the company. "Parler needs Ye in many ways, because Parler needs this brand to expand," Farmer told FOX Business' "Mornings with Maria." "And I think Ye is very interested in expanding his social media presence."According to the current CEO, West's suspension from social sites including Instagram and Twitter is what motivated conversations about the acquisition.
