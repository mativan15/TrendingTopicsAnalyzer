The corporate regulator has alleged errors in ANZ Bank's systems led to more than 165,000 credit card accounts being wrongly charged fees or interest, as it launched legal action against the bank for misleading conduct.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on Monday said it was taking Federal Court action against ANZ, alleging the bank overstated the funds that were available on credit card accounts. It said customers relied on this incorrect information when making withdrawals, and they were then wrongly charged fees and interest by the bank.
