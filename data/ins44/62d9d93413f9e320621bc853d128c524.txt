TWO thirds of reviews left online are negative with 1 in 20 people hoping they will pick up a freebie or money off the purchase, a study has found.
A survey of 2,000 adults who leave comments on social media or websites about a business, product or experience found they leave an average of 36 reviews a year or three a month.

But on average, 24 of those will be negative.
More than four in 10 (41 per cent) leave unfavourable comments to warn others of bad service, while 15 per cent claim they feel awkward if they leave anything which is too glowing.
