Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) has issued an urgent warning to customers as the number of 'advance fee' loan scams has surged in recent months.

Loan scams happen when a victim is asked to pay an upfront fee for a loan, the bank said on Monday.

Reports of this type of fraud have already increased by more than 90% in 2022, with the number of cases continuing to jump sharply. Lloyds said that victims lost £231 on average.
