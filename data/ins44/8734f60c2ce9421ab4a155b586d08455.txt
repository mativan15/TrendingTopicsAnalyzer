Beta, a statistical measure of a stock's relative volatility to the broader market index, is often interpreted as a measure of riskiness. A beta of more than 1.0 means that the stock is more volatile than the overall market and a beta less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility than the benchmark index. Thus, stocks with higher betas tend to gain more in bull markets but also plummet harder in bear markets.
