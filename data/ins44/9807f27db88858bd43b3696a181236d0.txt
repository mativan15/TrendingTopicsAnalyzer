Small-cap value stocks offer investors incredibly cheap valuations and strong potential returns, albeit at an elevated level of risk. There are several small-cap value funds out there, but the Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (BATS:CALF) is a particularly strong, effective choice. CALF invests in small-cap U.S. equities with strong free cash-flow yields. Cash calves, basically.
