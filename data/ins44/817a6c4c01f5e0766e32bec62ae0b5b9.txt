They say lightning never strikes twice, but this past weekend, Southern California's lakeside Lightning in a Bottle made repeated hits with a perfect storm of electrifying dance music artists. While not shocking considering the Do LaB's tradition of introducing dance music that many attendees may have never heard before, this year was supercharged with pent-up energy after a two-year hiatus brought on by the pandemic. Taking place on the outskirts of Bakersfield, Calif., the five day festival (May 25-29), drew roughly 25,000 attendees to its post-pandemic return.
