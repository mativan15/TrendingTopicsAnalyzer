Gert-Jan van Vliet/iStock via Getty Images Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) said on Friday it has resumed operations at its Hammerfest liquefied natural gas plant in Norway and is preparing to restart LNG production, following a 20-month outage due to a fire in September 2020. The restart is welcome news for the natural gas market, which is searching for alternatives to Russian supplies. Hammerfest, Europe's only large-scale LNG plant, can process 18.4M cm/day of gas when fully operational, ~5% of Norway's gas export capacity.
