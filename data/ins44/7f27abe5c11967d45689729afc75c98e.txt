Amid high drama, 37 temporary licences for the sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali were issued by the Ludhiana administration through a draw of lots on Saturday. A number of applicants, however, created a ruckus outside Bachat Bhawan alleging that many genuine applications have been omitted from the final list. The draw was held in the presence of Ludhiana deputy commissioner Surabhi Malik, police commissioner Kaustubh Sharma and joint commissioner of police Soumya Mishra. Heavy police force and anti-riot squad personnel were also deployed.
