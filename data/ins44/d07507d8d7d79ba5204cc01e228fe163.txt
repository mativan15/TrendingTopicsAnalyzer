We've all been on a plane when turbulence hits, and for the most part, it isn't too bad. But for one flight attendant, turbulence caused by a severe storm knocked him off his feet and caused him to break his ankle. His colleague was also injured, though less severely.

The event happened in July 2021, but it's making its rounds again following a report by Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (BEA). The French air agency which investigated the incident, released the report last Monday.
