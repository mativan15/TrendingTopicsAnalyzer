By Ed Frankl Assicurazioni Generali SpA said Friday that its second-largest investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone has resigned from its board with immediate effect. Mr. Caltagirone had led a boardroom battle seeking to unseat the Italian insurer's Chief Executive Philippe Donnet and install his own slate of board members. However, Mr. Donnet won a re-election vote at the company's annual general meeting in April to keep his position as boss, though Mr. Caltagirone secured enough votes to retain his seat on the board.
