Elon Musk gave a strong indication today that his purchase of Twitter is indeed on track in a reference to the tortured deal, not via tweet, but towards the tail end of an earnings' call for Tesla. He said the social media platform he's looking to acquire by a court-imposed Oct. 28 deadline is currently overvalued, but 'has incredible potential.'

'Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,' the billionaire Tesla founder said after the electric automaker's quarterly results.
