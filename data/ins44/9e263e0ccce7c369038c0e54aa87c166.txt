Two days into his new job, Jeremy Hunt set fire yesterday to many of the measures announced in last month's mini-budget.The new chancellor promised a series of U-turns, including retaining the 20 per cent basic rate of income tax indefinitely and a rise in corporation tax in an effort to fill the £62 billion black hole in the public finances. The tax will go up to 25 per cent from next April, as previously planned before Kwasi Kwarteng slashed it in his disastrous economic statement in September.
