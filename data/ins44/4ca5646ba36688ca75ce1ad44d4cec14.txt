Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum (ETH 1.02%), was aware all the way back in 2016 that an upgrade would be necessary to increase its transaction capacity and speeds.
Since 2016, there have been multiple announcements claiming that The Merge, as the update is known, would be completed. Unfortunately, each of those dates has been extended.
Now there might actually be an end in sight. Recently, an Ethereum core developer announced that his group believes an upgrade to the core network will arrive sometime in August.
