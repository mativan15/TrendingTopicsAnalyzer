Thousands of people visited Surrey farm Heppell's Potatoes on Saturday to take advantage of the fifth "Ugly Potato Day," an initiative that farmer Tyler Heppell launched this year. He joined his family farm about nine months ago and soon noticed how much food was being wasted, so he thought of an idea to help reduce the amount. "Instead of the produce going to cow feed or rotting or not even being sold at all, we decided to give it out to the general public," he said. He said Saturday's event was a success and that the number of visitors has grown exponentially each time the farm has run it.
