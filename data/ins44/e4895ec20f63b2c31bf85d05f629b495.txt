When your flat is so cold you can see your breath indoors, you know there's an issue. Especially when it doesn't even really get that cold in south-east England.Luckily, musty clothes will be no more for me. This admittedly rather cumbersome-looking heater is actually a dream to use. All you need to do is fold the horizontal shelves and clip them into the vertical stand, before turning it on. It then proceeds to heat up very quickly.It comes with a cover designed to aid the drying process, but I've never really felt the need for it, as it's already much, much quicker than I'm used to.
