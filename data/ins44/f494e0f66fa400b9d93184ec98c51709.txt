Nadine Dorries has been announced as a guest presenter for Piers Morgan Uncensored.

The former culture secretary will sit in for Morgan on 24 and 25 of October during what is a very eventful time in British politics following the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss.

In a statement, Dorries said: "I try to avoid TV these days and I'm not one of the MPs you find running across to the cameras on the green or in and out of TV studios but I'm excited about TalkTV and the opportunity to do this during what could turn out to be one of the most eventful weeks we have ever known in British politics.
