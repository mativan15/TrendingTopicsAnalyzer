"Trade deficit is actually growing," she said. "It is growing across the board, meaning we are importing a lot more than exporting. And the net is definitely going against us. But, we're also keeping a watch as to if there's a disproportionate increase against any one country," Sitharaman said, responding to a question on the increase in trade deficit against China to nearly USD 87 billion.
