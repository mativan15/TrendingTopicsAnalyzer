A publicly traded financial services firm is moving its headquarters from New York's Fifth Avenue to South Beach, according to a document from the City of Miami Beach.

Siebert Financial Corp. (Nasdaq: SIEB) will move from its current HQ on the fourth floor of 535 Fifth Avenue in NYC to a two-story commercial building at 653 Collins Ave. Siebert bought the 12,000-square-foot building, completed in 1940, for $6.75 million in Dec. 2021.

The building is currently undergoing a $1.1 million renovation that includes the creation of conference rooms and a kitchen, a Miami Beach memo stated.
