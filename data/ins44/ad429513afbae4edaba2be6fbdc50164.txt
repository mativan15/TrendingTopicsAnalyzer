In July, I added "sex work" to my LinkedIn work experience.Most of my other roles have been director-level titles for in-house brands or small marketing agencies. I resigned from my former position this summer, leaving a great paycheck and even better benefits behind because I felt disrespected and taken advantage of.The reason I could leave that job at all was because of the online sex work I've been doing on the side for the past two years. I outlined my reasons for leaving in a LinkedIn post with a screenshot of my updated professional experience attached:  Arielle Egozi on LinkedIn The post blew up on social media and made headlines across the globe, putting me in the crossfire of a movement I didn't mean to start.
