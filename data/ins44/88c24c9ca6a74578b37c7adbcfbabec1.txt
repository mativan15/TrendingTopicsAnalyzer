The 59th meeting between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic was so long that it started in May and finished in June. After four hours and 12 minutes, finally it came to an end at 1.15am local time with Nadal stamping his authority as the King of Clay in an intense French Open quarter-final.Despite the concerns of Nadal and his camp over the prospect of playing at night, he was still too strong on his favourite surface over four sets. He defeated his arch-rival 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) to move to within two wins of a 14th title at Roland Garros.
