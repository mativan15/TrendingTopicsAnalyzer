ADragan/iStock via Getty Images Athabasca Oil Corporation (OTCPK:ATHOF) reports provable and proven reserves with a life of 100 years, and is currently benefiting from lower western Canadian sedimentary basin supply growth. Management also announced a large increase in the free cash flow for the year 2022, which could have an effect on the share price. Besides, the company will likely benefit from a recent transformation and a significant reduction in the debt levels. Putting everything together in a discounted cash flow model, in my view, Athabasca looks like a buy.
