As students prepare for college costs this summer, they may find that certain pandemic support they got two years ago could affect the amount of financial aid they're entitled to receive.

Those who received unemployment benefits in 2020 may not get the maximum financial aid they deserve from FAFSA, or the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, while those who got the Child Tax Credit or a stimulus payment could receive too much, according to the federal government.

Having an accurate FAFSA is crucial since the application is often the first step in the financial aid process with students using it to gain access to federal aid, grants, loans, work-study programs – as well as state-based non-federal aid and scholarships.
