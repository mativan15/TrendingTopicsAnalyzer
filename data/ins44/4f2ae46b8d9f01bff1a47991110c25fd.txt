Britain's new finance minister Jeremy Hunt said some taxes would go up and government spending would rise by less than previously planned as he warned of difficult decisions ahead to restore Britain's economic policy credibility.

With financial markets in turmoil, Prime Minister Liz Truss fired Kwasi Kwarteng as finance minister and scrapped parts of their controversial economic package on Friday in a bid for political survival less than 40 days into her premiership.

Ms Truss said corporation tax would increase, abandoning her plan to keep it at current levels.
