Many top companies in China have set clear goals and launched realistic plans to achieve green development after the country proposed the "3060" carbon target three years ago, with significant progress made in different industries, said Tony Xiong, senior vice-president and head of strategy and business development of Schneider Electric China.
In an exclusive interview with China Daily, Xiong said China's green transformation will contribute a lot to the world, and the world cannot achieve any carbon neutral objectives without China.
