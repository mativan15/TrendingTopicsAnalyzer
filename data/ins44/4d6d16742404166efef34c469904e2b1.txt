PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The NFC East went from least to beast in less than two years. After sending a losing team to the playoffs in 2020, the division boasts three of the four NFC teams with winning records through six weeks. The Philadelphia Eagles (6-0) stand alone atop the East as the only unbeaten team in the NFL following a 26-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys (4-2) on Sunday night. The New York Giants (5-1) are right behind Philly after upset wins over the Ravens and Packers in consecutive weeks proved they're no fluke.
