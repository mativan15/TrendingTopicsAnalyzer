The White House is hoping to announce the shipping plans this afternoon when Biden meets virtually with Bubs and other infant formula companies. Biden announced the initial deal that Bubs would provide 27.5 million bottles worth of infant formula to the U.S. several days ago. Australia's former Ambassador to the U.S. Joe Hockey and his firm Bondi Partners helped broker the initial deal between Bubs and the Biden administration. The company's stock shot up after.
The current shortages are especially dangerous for babies, children and adults who rely on specialty formulas for their only source of nutrition.
