Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond were thrilled after beating The Chase's tough professional quizzer Mark Labbett in a round of TV questions from his new book.
Beating Mark – known as his alter-ego the Beast on the show – at his own game filled the presenting duo with delight on This Morning on Monday.
Appearing on the programme to chat about his book, Can You Beat the Beast?, the former mathematics teacher revealed that even he, as a formidable quizzer and competitor, had topics he found tough.
