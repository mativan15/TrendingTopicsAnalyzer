TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average closed sharply below the key 27,000 mark on Friday, taking cues from overnight Wall Street declines amid worries that U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes could trigger recession.

However, losses were capped by strong gains for chip-related stocks amid a rise in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index , along with strong earnings from IBM and domestic chip equipment supplier Disco Corp.

The Nikkei slid 0.43% to end the day at 26,890.
