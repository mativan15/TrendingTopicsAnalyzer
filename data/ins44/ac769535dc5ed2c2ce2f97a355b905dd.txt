Mumbai: Eighteen-year-old S Patil has been spending sleepless nights since April this year ever since he discovered that his admission via the management quota of a famous deemed-to-be medical institute in Maharashtra was not valid. Patil had paid ₹ 55 lakh to an agent only to find later that he had been duped by the agency. Patil is one of eight students who were cheated of ₹ 2.5 crore collectively by a firm called Medico HelpDesk which promised admission through the management quota of a medical institute.
