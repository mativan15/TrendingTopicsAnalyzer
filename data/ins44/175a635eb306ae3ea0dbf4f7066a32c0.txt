CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA —Raymond Huffman, 61, of Varnville, has pleaded guilty to stealing funds from 10 military veterans. According to information presented to the Court, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ('VA') provides and cares for United States military veterans. Among its many programs, the VA administers a fiduciary program designed to protect veterans. Huffman was appointed to be a fiduciary to receive payments on behalf of veterans who, as a result of wars, injury, disease, or infirmities of advanced age, could not manage their VA benefits.
