Saudi Golf chief Majed Al Sorour has denied claims that sport legend Tiger Woods refused a deal worth £600million to join the breakaway series. Woods, aged 46, could have been a key player in helping turn perceptions for the series, but reportedly refused an offer worth $700-800m. Al Sorour told the New Yorker that the total sum apparently also including sponsorship deals. He said: 'It's not straight-out money. I never offered him that money, not even close to that.' This is in contradiction to LIV Golf chief executive Greg Norman who had previously agreed that Tiger had been offered around £600m to join the controversial series.
