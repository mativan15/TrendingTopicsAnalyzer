SAN JOSE, Calif. — Chicago Blackhawks forward Jason Dickinson is like the new kid at school, only he has exams the first day.

'Lot of information, lot of learning, but it's been good so far,' said Dickinson, who was acquired Oct. 7 from the Vancouver Canucks for defenseman Riley Stillman and a 2024 second-round pick.

'Honestly I didn't see it coming,' he told reporters at SAP Center hours before his first Blackhawks game against the San Jose Sharks. 'I'd heard rumblings there were cap issues for Vancouver and they had to move pieces to get out of the cap, so I guess I fit that bill.
