Former Congress MP and senior leader V. Hanumantha Rao has criticised the Central Government's reported efforts to change the Indian national flag and said that the very character of India would be decimated if it happens.At a press conference here on Tuesday, he questioned the morality of the BJP of even thinking of changing the flag and said that such an attitude was expected from those who had no role to play in Indian Independence. 'India will remain a secular country forever and the BJP's efforts to turn it into a Hindu nation will never fructify,' he said.
