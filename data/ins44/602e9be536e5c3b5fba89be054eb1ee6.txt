While a number of Winnipeg School Division trustee candidates seem to be running similar campaigns — evidenced by their websites, Facebook videos and advertisements — it's unclear if there's any co-ordination between the candidates.That's because the people involved are tight-lipped, and Manitoba doesn't have any laws requiring disclosure about who is financing those campaigns.At the federal, provincial and municipal levels, the influence of outside parties is limited by regulations that restrict donation amounts and require transparency around the support received.
