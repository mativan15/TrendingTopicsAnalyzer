Billionaire hip-hop artist and fashion designer Ye — who legally changed his name from Kanye West last year — has continued his spiral into racist and disturbing remarks with a new interview.

As Blavity previously reported, Ye faced a series of controversies that began when he prominently featured shirts with the 'White Lives Matter' — a racist slogan used to detract from the Black Lives Matter movement — in a recent fashion show. He then made a series of racist and anti-Semitic remarks on social media.
