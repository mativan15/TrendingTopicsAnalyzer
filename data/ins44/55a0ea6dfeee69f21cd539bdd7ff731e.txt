A rising rate environment could spell trouble for solar stocks Sunrun and Sunnova Energy in the near term, according to Wolfe Research. Analyst Steve Fleishman downgraded shares of both companies to peer perform, citing concerns over rising costs of capital despite his long-term confidence in the stock. "Headwinds from the interest rate spike on financing costs and valuation are tough to ignore despite strong demand growth from IRA and rising utility rates," he wrote in two separate notes to clients Wednesday.
