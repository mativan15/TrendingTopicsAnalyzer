MPs are urging the Government to tap into the UK's vast geothermal reserves in what could be a major lifeline amid a deepening energy crisis. As surging global gas prices have hiked up energy bills for consumers across the country, who now face energy bills of over £4,000 when the Government's energy price guarantee is set to end,  alternative energy sources could prove vital at driving bills down. Geothermal energy, a low-carbon power source, is harnessed by tapping into the hot water at the bottom of oil and gas basins.
