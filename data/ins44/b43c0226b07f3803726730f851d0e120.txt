PHILADELPHIA–The Philadelphia 76ers fell to 0-2 on Thursday as they dropped a close one to the Milwaukee Bucks 90-88. The Sixers put on a spirited comeback effort led by James Harden, but they weren't able to finish it off as the Bucks closed it out late.
One reason why Philadelphia wasn't able to finish it was due to Joel Embiid's poor play. The big fella had a tough night as he shot just 6-for-21 for 15 points and he didn't score in the second half as he shot 0-for-7 with three turnovers.
It was a performance Embiid would like to forget as the team moves forward.
