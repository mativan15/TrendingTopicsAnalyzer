Justin Sullivan By Brian Nelson, CFA Everything seemed to be going fine at PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in 2021. The stock continued on a very strong upward growth trajectory, earnings growth looked strong, and its outlook was solid. Then in October of 2021, Bloomberg ran a note saying that "PayPal Is Exploring a Purchase of Pinterest." We were taken aback. Though PayPal has put the Pinterest rumor to bed, we were left wondering what in the world was going on. However, when it issued its third-quarter 2021 results on November 8, we started to grow more and more concerned about its outlook for this year.
