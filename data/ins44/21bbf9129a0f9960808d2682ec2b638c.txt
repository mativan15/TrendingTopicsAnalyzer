Jon Stewart said it blows his mind how easily antisemitism flows out of people while singling out rapper Kanye West and former President Donald Trump for their recent comments about Jewish people.

On 'The Problem With Jon Stewart' podcast on Wednesday, Stewart discussed West's remarks about Jewish people in business as well as Trump's call for Jewish people to 'get their act together.'

West, who legally changed his name to Ye and tweeted that he would go 'death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE' earlier this month, has since doubled down on antisemitic remarks on several media platforms in recent weeks.
