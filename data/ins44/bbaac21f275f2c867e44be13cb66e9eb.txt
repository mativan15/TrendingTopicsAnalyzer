A new beer garden has opened at Chicago Premium Outlets mall in Aurora.Tapville Social, owned by Final Stretch Events LLC, opened its beverage kiosk in the outdoor plaza near Saks off 5th at the outlet mall. The facility is similar to those Tapville operates in Naperville, and in Fox Valley Mall in Aurora.The difference is that Tapville employees are pouring the beer for patrons at the outlet mall. At the other Tapvilles, people pour their own beverages.Eventually, the Chicago Premium Outlets mall facility could become self-pour also.
