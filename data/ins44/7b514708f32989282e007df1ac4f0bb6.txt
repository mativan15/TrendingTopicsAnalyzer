Dame Deborah James, 40, has been spending some quality time with her family as she posted adorable photos from a slumber party they had. But the BBC podcast host admitted she was "feeling down" and that it was "hard" to make memories when she is so unwell. In view of her 896,000 Instagram followers, Deborah posted photos with her sister, daughter, and some friends who were beaming in matching pyjamas and eye masks. She said in the caption to the post: 'Making memories can be hard why you are dying! Oh the pressure!! (Sic) 'I'm now only getting some very grabbed hours between the sleeping and side effects, but this girly sleepover managed to put such a smile to my face having spent most of yesterday in tears!'I'm getting less and less able to leave the house, or bed really now, so was feeling pretty down about it.
