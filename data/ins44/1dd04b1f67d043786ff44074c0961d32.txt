The Ottawa International Airport saw its busiest travel day of the year on Thursday, as the summer tourism season begins to ramp up in the capital. According to the Ottawa International Airport Authority, June 2 saw 4,653 passengers depart the airport on flights. Air travel plummeted in 2020 and 2021, with passenger volumes only a fraction of pre-COVID levels. Recently, more flights have been added to the airport and leisure travel is recovering well. The airport says the return of events to the capital such as CANSEC, Canada's largest global defence & security trade show, is helping to boost visitors and is "vital for recovery.
