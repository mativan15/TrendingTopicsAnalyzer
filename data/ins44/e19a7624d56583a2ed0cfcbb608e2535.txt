By Michele E. Buttelman  Now that social gatherings have returned to family calendars there are  many opportunities to make family birthday celebrations fun and unique in  the Santa Clarita Valley.  Kid's Parties  Children's birthday parties are fairly easy to plan. Options include  commercial venues such as the traditional Chuck E. Cheese, ice skating at  The Cube, mini golf and other activities at MB2 Entertainment, Scooter's  Jungle and more.  For a fun and active party try Top Out Climbing where kids can expend  their excess energy climbing rock walls and more.
