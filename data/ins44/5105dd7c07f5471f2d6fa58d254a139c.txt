A little dog lost in Las Vegas found a guardian angel while wandering the streets.

The meeting happened in the early morning when Edie Dotan was on shift as an Amazon Flex driver in Las Vegas.

"As an Amazon Flex driver, I use my own vehicle to deliver packages for Amazon. It's a way for me to earn extra money and set my own hours. I work early in the morning — it's a great way to start my day," Dotan tells PEOPLE about the job.

During a recent shift, Dotan was surprised by a sound on her usually quiet route.
