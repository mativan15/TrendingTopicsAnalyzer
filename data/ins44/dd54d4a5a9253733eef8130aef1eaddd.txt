'I'm very concerned,' said Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who currently represents an adjacent district. 'The Republicans are all in and they have invested heavily in the district. And this election will certainly test the commitment of the DCCC to the Rio Grande Valley, to South Texas and to Latino districts in this country.'
'If we don't keep the seat blue on June 14,' he added, 'it will be a tragedy. It really will be a self-inflicted tragedy.'

 

The special election is two weeks away and will advance the top two candidates to a likely August runoff if no one receives 50 percent of the vote — a probable scenario because two Democrats and two Republicans have filed.
