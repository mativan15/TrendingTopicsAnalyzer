Out of the five games this week, there are a few intriguing games to watch. At noon EDT, Iowa faces Ohio State. The Buckeyes' offense will get their first true challenge against a top-10 Iowa defense.
At 3:30 p.m. EDT, the high-flyer Boilermakers will take a trip to Madison to play the Badgers. Purdue and Illinois are tied for the top spot in the West division, so the Boilermakers will need to continue their winning ways with the Illini having a bye week.
