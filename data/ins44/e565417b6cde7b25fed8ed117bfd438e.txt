Holcim supports the agreement reached by Lafarge SA with the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") to resolve the DOJ's inquiry into Lafarge SA and its long-defunct subsidiary Lafarge Cement Syria ("LCS") related to the legacy conduct of certain former executives during the Syrian civil war, before Holcim acquired Lafarge SA.

Under the terms of the resolution, Lafarge SA and LCS will pay a financial penalty of $777.78 million and have agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations in Syria between August 2013 and October 2014, by which time LCS had ceased operations in the country.
