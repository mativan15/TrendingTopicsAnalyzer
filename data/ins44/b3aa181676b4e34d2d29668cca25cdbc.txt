Snap (NYSE: SNAP) fell in after-market trading as results did not meet investor expectations. Snap's stock declined by 25%, and this was most likely due to losses surging to $360 million and growth slowing significantly compared to previous years. But things were not as bad as they might seem, after adjusting for one-off restructuring charges, which cost the company $155 million, the losses were much lower. The decline in the stock price could be an overreaction, but investors are far less willing to assign high valuations to stock when compared to a couple of years ago.
