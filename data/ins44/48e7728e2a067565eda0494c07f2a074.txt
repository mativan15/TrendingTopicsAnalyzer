Alabama head coach Nick Saban has responded following video of wide receiver Jermaine Burton seemingly striking a female fan of the Tennessee Volunteers following Alabama's 52-49 loss Saturday afternoon. Burton, who transferred from Georgia during the offseason, can be seen on camera sticking his arm out, which appears to make contact with a female fan rushing the field following the Tennessee win. Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Jermaine Burton runs with the ball against the Razorbacks on Oct.
