Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse views her impressive weekly hairstyles as a form of celebration after being previously told to ‘hide' it.
The 41-year-old ballroom and Latin pro has wowed viewers at home with her impeccable box braids, and fans were in awe after her eye-catching blue braids stole the first live show last month.
However, Motsi revealed that her daring looks are more than just a fashion statement.
‘So even things that I'm really loving to celebrate now, which seem so little to other people, like celebrating my own hair — the way my hair grows, what I can do with my hair — it's something as a child I didn't see,' she said.
