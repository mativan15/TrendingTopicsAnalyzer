Is our honours system a little wonky? Euan Blair gets an MBE for 'services to education' (Euan Blair: from PM's son to £700m business and an MBE, 1 June). Doubtless he's a fine fellow. I've been doing 'services to education' for more years than he's been alive (I was at Oxford with his dad).I've done – if I say so myself – a few good things; I like to think that I've helped people make their lives better. Education, I imagined, was about service – not business.I never sought to make shedloads of money out of it; an adequate salary has been plenty.
