A woman said she was forced to sleep on a 'piece of wood' during a $7000 nightmare holiday – and that was just the start of her problems on the trip.

Sarah Kershaw, from Greater Manchester, in the UK, took her family on an all-inclusive holiday to Turkey in July this year.

What was supposed to be an amazing first holiday for Sarah, 42, husband Stephen and kids Paige, 16, Patrick, 13, and Stephanie, 12, turned out to be 'disgusting', The Sun reports.

The family-of-five had the trip rescheduled twice due to Covid-19 – which they had to fork out extra money for on top of the $7000 they'd already paid.
