Germany has drafted plans to legalise cannabis.Under new rules, people over the age of 18 would be able to buy the recreational drugs, though they will only be sold at specific shops with special licences. Legalising cannabis was a key pledge of the Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens in the 2021 federal election. The coalition of the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and FDP has highlighted reduction of cannabis being sold on the black market and gangs as one of the key benefits of the legalisation.The draft plans were leaked to the RND newspaper group on Wednesday after circulating around the government before being implemented for the parliamentary term.
