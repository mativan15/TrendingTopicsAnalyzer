The stock market may have trimmed its recent losses, but investors can't relax just yet, according to Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson. Last week, the S & P 500 climbed 6.6% to break a seven-week slump. The Dow also gained more than 6% to snap an eight-week slide. However, Wilson said in a note to clients on Tuesday that the recovery looks more like a bear market rally that is already running out of steam. "Outside of a peace agreement in Ukraine, it's difficult to construct a case for more than a bear market rally, which could carry another 5%, in our view," Wilson wrote.
