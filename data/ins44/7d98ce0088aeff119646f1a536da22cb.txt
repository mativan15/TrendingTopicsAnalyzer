Ten years ago, Carly Rae Jepsen established herself as one of pop's leading chroniclers of love with "Call Me Maybe," a sugary, infectious anthem for the crushed-out that became 2012's most inescapable single. In the decade since, she has put out a steady run of albums rife with musings on romance in all its forms, her lively and polished delivery lending each forlorn lyric an immediacy that only makes the beats hit harder.

The Loneliest Time, Jepsen's sixth album (and the outcome of her being in pandemic lockdown), retains the ardor of her pop-cognoscenti-beloved albums Dedicated and Emotion, but it flaunts a new self-reflective streak that both energizes its highlights and opens the door for Jepsen to play with — and expand — her sound.
