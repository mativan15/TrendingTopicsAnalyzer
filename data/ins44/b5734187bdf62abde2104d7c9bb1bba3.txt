Chico, CA, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The leading authority on commercial vehicles, Work Truck Solutions®, released its third quarter ComTrend Analysis of new and used commercial vehicles. Continuing supply chain issues with new commercial vehicles induced predictable results in used work trucks and vans, but there was also a bit of good news for dealers and buyers alike. Although persistent manufacturing obstacles have kept new inventory per dealer drastically lower than last year, there was an uptick in inventory of almost four more vehicles per dealer compared to last quarter.
