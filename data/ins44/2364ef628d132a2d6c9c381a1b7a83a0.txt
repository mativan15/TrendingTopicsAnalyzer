State-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Wednesday raised its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by 15 basis points or 0.15 per cent across all tenures, a move that will lead to an increase in EMIs for borrowers.
The new rates are effective from June 1, PNB said in a regulatory filing.
The revision follows an off-cycle rate increase by the Reserve Bank in May. The central bank hiked the repo rate — at which it lends short-term money to banks — by 0.40 per cent to 4.40 per cent.
With the revision, one-year MCLR has increased to 7.
