Against the odds — and the run of play — the New York Rangers are into the Eastern Conference Final. It's taken two Game 7's, five elimination-game wins and quite a bit of luck to get here, but that doesn't matter anymore. All that matters now is whether the Rangers can continue their run by upsetting the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions.
And even though the Rangers are the higher seed and have home-ice advantage, it would be an upset if the Blueshirts advance to the Stanley Cup. Oddsmakers have installed the Rangers as a +150 underdog against the Lightning, meaning they have roughly a 40 percent chance of winning the best-of-seven when you convert the odds to implied win probability.
