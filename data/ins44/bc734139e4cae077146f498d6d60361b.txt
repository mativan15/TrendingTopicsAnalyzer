'For me the metaverse means freedom,' says Idiat Shiole, a Nigerian virtual fashion designer, 'I say that because I'm Muslim. When I worked as a fashion illustrator for most fashion houses, their first impression of me was normally ‘won't this lady just draw Islamic dresses for us or can she even draw?' But in the metaverse, nobody cares who you are, they only care what you can do. I just wanted to do what I love without being oppressed.'In 2018, Idiat Shiole, stumbled on a software called marvelous designer to help her create locomotive 3D models and fabrics.
