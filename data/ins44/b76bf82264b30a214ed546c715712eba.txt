These days it's easy to simply buy an index fund, and your returns should (roughly) match the market. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Forafric Global PLC (NASDAQ:AFRI) share price is 12% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 26% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. We'll need to follow Forafric Global for a while to get a better sense of its share price trend, since it hasn't been listed for particularly long.
