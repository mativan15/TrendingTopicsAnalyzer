After five months, the secret is out: the Girl Scouts – North Carolina Coastal Pines council is the recipient of a $2.4 million donation from none other than MacKenzie Scott, the philanthropist ex-wife of Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.

CEO Lisa Jones calls the sum, part of an $84.5 million donation from Scott to Girl Scouts of the USA and 29 local councils, 'unprecedented and transformative.'

It's the biggest single donation in her council's history, and it started with a phone call in May.
