More than £45,000 has been raised for the Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research UK after a new white rose, named in honour of Dame Deborah James, launched at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.

The Dame Deborah James Rose is a stunning new white rose variety introduced by World of Roses and bred by The Harkness Rose Company. The floribunda produces masses of white blooms with a subtle 'ballet slipper pink' centre (as Deborah would describe it), set against dark green, glossy foliage.
