The Victorian government has announced it will revive the publicly owned State Electricity Commission and bring forward its net zero emissions goals if it is re-elected in November. The premier, Daniel Andrews, described the move as Victoria's 'most significant energy announcement' for 30 years.It includes a $1bn investment to deliver 4.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, to be owned by the state and run by the rekindled SEC.'Those power stations won't be for profit, they'll be for people,' Andrews said.
