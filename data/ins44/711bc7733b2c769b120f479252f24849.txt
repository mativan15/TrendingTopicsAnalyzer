The M2 iPad Pro is expected to launch this month and may coincide with iPadOS 16.1's release. With it comes Stage Manager and external monitor support, bringing users one step closer to a laptop-like experience. However, If you don't care for these updates or simply want to add an iPad to your tech arsenal on a budget, you can save hundreds of dollars by exploring the refurbished market.
One option worth considering is this refurbished first-generation, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which is on sale for just $280 for National Apple Day, which falls on October 21.
