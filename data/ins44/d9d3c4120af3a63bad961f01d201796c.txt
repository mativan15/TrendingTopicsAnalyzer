The leader of Brothers of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, says she and her allies have asked the nation's president to give her the mandate to form what would be Italy's first far-right-led government since the end of World War II.
Meloni and her campaign allies on Friday met President Sergio Mattarella for about 10 minutes at the Quirinal presidential palace.
She emerged to tell reporters that the coalition had unanimously indicated to Mattarella that she deserved the mandate to govern.
A Quirinal official indicated Mattarella's decision might be announced later in the day.
