The Danuri is being examined by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) employees at the institute's satellite integration hall in Daejeon. [KARI] Korea is set to launch a spacecraft into orbit around the moon. And there is actually a BTS angle to the mission. The Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO), the country's first moon orbiter, is set for launch in early August from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. It will be carried into space by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. "There have been a lot of questions like, 'what's the point of doing this now when a crewed moon landing already happened in 1969?'" said Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) Director Lee Sang-ryul during a press conference held at the institute's headquarters in Daejeon, Friday.
