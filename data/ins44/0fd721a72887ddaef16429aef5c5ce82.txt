Biddy O'Loughlin is funny and can sing and is not just Fiona O'Loughlin's daughter.For those needing convincing, just check in with her closest fan, quite literally, 11-month-old daughter Dolly.For her comedy gigs, the single mother straps the ever-smiling baby onto her chest before starting her routine."As soon as we're on stage, it's like she just stops and listens and it's a bit of a sight gag as well, but it wasn't the intention," O'Loughlin said."I just didn't have any options and then people go 'wow, you're doing comedy with a baby, I love that, that's great' and I go 'well, I didn't really have a choice'.
