Following a first-look cinematic trailer starring a digital rendering of A$AP Rocky, EA and Criterion now release the first gameplay trailer for Need for Speed Unbound, the 25th installment of the classic Need for Speed street racing series. With Criterion returning as a main developer for the first time since 2012's Most Wanted, Unbound maintains the same attitudes and similar gameplay mechanics as previous titles while introducing ambitious cosmetic elements including cel-shaded characters and comic-style animation effects.
