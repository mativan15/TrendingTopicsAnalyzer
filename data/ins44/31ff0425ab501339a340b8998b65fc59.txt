BBC news anchor Huw Edwards has paid tribute to the victims of the Aberfan disaster, 56 years to the day since the tragedy which saw 144 people killed.

In a social media post, Edwards called for people to 'remember the criminal negligence that caused' the disaster and 'shameful response of [the] government and coal board'.

On 21 October, 1966, a colliery slag tip slid down the side of a hill and engulfed a row of houses, a farm and a school in the Welsh mining village.
