To the editor: In an earlier column than his most recent one on the mayoral candidates and homelessness, Steve Lopez called Rick Caruso's plan to build 30,000 housing units a "short-term fix at best." I've worked with homeless people for nearly a decade, and I believe that we need a short-term fix.

New York does not have sidewalk encampments like Los Angeles.
