If ever there was a week to showcase the wide variety of ephemera that comes to the Irish auction world, this one would be a fine place to start.

This Monday and Tuesday, October 24th and 25th, auctioneer Aidan Foley, in conjunction with Niall Mullen, will hold a sale of hundreds of implements and farm machinery collected by octogenarian Tommy Shannon in Cavan over the past seven decades.
