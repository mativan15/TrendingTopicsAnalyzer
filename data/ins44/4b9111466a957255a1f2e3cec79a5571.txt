Four candidates are challenging incumbent Assemblyman Alex Lee's re-election bid to represent redrawn District 24, which now includes Milpitas, Fremont, Newark and parts of San Jose
They are former San Jose councilmember Lan Diep, former Assembly member Kansen Chu, Fremont Councilmember Teresa Keng and businessman Bob Brunton. The top two voter getters in Tuesday's primary will face each other in the November election.
Lee' current District 25 seat overlaps with much of the new 24th district that was redrawn to reflect population and demographic changes stemming form the latest U.
