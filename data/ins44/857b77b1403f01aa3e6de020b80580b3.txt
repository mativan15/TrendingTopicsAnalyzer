While the broader market and stocks in several major sectors, like tech, are in the red due to macro headwinds, energy stocks have been rallying this year. Improved demand following the reopening of global economies led to higher oil and gas prices. Also, Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused supply disruptions and a further rise in energy prices.

However, oil and gas prices have been volatile recently and might continue to be due to several factors including tight supply, the impact of the European Union's decision on a potential embargo of Russian oil, and the easing of China's Covid-19 lockdowns.
