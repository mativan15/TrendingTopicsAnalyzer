The Los Angeles Rams didn't have an easy time containing Christian McCaffrey in their Week 6 win over the Carolina Panthers, and unfortunately for them, they'll be tasked with slowing down the All-Pro running back again in Week 8.
The San Francisco 49ers have acquired McCaffrey from the Panthers, sending Carolina second-, third- and fourth-round picks in 2023, as well as a fifth-rounder in 2024. It's a massive haul for the star running back, likely making the 49ers the favorites in the division.

It's rare for a team to face the same player in consecutive games, but that's what the Rams will do against McCaffrey.
