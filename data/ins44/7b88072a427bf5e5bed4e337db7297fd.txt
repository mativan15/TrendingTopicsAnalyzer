Scottsdale-based workplace technology company Cloverleaf Networks says its acquisition of Ryver, a software company from the same Valley city, gives it a top-to-bottom stack of business connectivity offerings for its customers.

Ryver produces a workplace collaboration app to manage team communication, task management and workflow automation in a single place. The company's website presents its app as a challenger to other tools such as Slack or Trello.
