With more than 12,000 bus stops, shelters and light-rail platforms in the Twin Cities area, Metro Transit has a tall task when it comes to keeping them clean. "Facility staff can't be everywhere all the time," said Pam Steffen, Metro Transit's customer relations manager. So the agency has brought back its Adopt-A-Stop program after it had been on hiatus for a several years and is leaning on members of the community to keep the stops looking good. One participant is Jason Stephens, who looks after five bus stops near the massage therapy business he runs on Hennepin Avenue near the Uptown Transit Station.
