[Photo/Xinhua] Access to foreign markets is often tough for many companies in inland provinces. But Zhuzhou, an industrial hub in Hunan province, has sufficient strength to turn its goals into reality. The city, famously known for its products such as electric multiple unit (EMU) trains, maglev trains and subways, has maintained a high speed in transforming itself from a rail transit equipment manufacturing base into an innovation hub with a number of industrial clusters, especially in the fields of new energy vehicles, civil aviation, new materials and biomedicine.
