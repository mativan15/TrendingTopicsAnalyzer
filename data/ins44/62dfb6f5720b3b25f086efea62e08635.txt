Devin Anderson, African American Roundtable membership and coalition manager, speaks during a rally to demand input on how the city of Milwaukee spends American Rescue Plan Act funds at the group's office on Thursday.

A local community group is again calling for federal pandemic relief funding to not go toward city of Milwaukee police coffers.

Instead, the group wants residents' input on how the next round of American Rescue Plan Act money should be spent through a participatory budget process.
