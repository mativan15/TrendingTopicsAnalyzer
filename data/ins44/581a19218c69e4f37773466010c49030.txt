For the fifth time in just 4 months, China has come to the rescue of Pakistan-based terrorists at the UN. In the latest instance, China put on hold a proposal by India and the US at the United Nations to blacklist Hafiz Talah Saeed, the son of Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed...the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. In April this year, he had been declared a terrorist by the Indian government. He is the head of the cleric wing of the terrorist organisation actively involved in recruitment, fund collection, and planning and executing attacks by the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in India and Indian interests in Afghanistan.
