Vladimir Putin said he believed the 'partial mobilisation' of army reservists would be completed in two weeks. The Russian president said after attending a summit in Kazakhstan on Friday that a total of 222,000 reservists would be called up, down from the 300,000 figure initially circulated after the order last month. The Belarus defence ministry said Russian troops would start arriving in the country 'in the next few days' as part of its joint force. The US and Germany are to deliver sophisticated anti-aircraft systems to Kyiv this month to counter attacks using Russian missiles and kamikaze drones, Ukraine's defence minister said.
