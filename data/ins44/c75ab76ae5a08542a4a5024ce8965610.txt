A motorist who deliberately drove into a biker at nearly 70mph has been convicted of murder after fleeing to Ireland to try and escape punishment. BMW driver Keith McCarthy slammed into the moped of father-of-three Kerrin Repman on April 15, 2020, in Dovercourt - killing the 29-year-old biker and also seriously injuring a bystander. McCarthy, 40, of no fixed abode, fled the scene on foot and left the country - being tracked down in Ireland. He arrived back in the UK on February 3, 2022, where he was charged with murder and grevious bodily harm with intent, both of which he denied.
