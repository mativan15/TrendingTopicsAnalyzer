So here is my day 4 in the day-in-the-life series of blogs.  For Day 4 I will summarize the key themes, frameworks shared with attendees, and the topics across the week.  First, of course, is my Muse and the state of my brain Thursday morning.

My score for Thursday was 706, and the line looks quite stable.  For Wednesday my score was 745, for Tuesday it was 757, and for Monday 699.  So, it seems I actually improved towards the middle of the week, but my mind became a little more active after that.
