Jeremy Hunt will face questions from the BBC's Laura Kuennsberg as he attempts to restore stability following the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng.

Later on Sunday, Mr Hunt will meet with the prime minister at Chequers in a bid to thrash out their economic plans.

On Saturday, the new Chancellor faced a series of questions where he was forced to defend Liz Truss's economic plan, albeit adding that mistakes had been made surrounding the mini-Budget.

In his first full day in office, he warned of "very difficult decisions" to come as he suggested taxes could rise and budgets - including health and defence - are likely to be squeezed further in the coming months.
