It has been a week where Mark Robinson's ownership style at the Warriors has come into question, following news that Matt Lodge's early departure from the club was partly caused by an argument the two of them had last December. Although, Lodge says there wasn't an argument, just a verbal attack on him by Robinson, which convinced him he didn't want to stay at the club long term. But his departure has been very messy and very public and neither Lodge or Robinson have come out of it well. Earlier this year Lodge made it clear he wouldn't be taking up the option in his contract to be with the club in 2023.
