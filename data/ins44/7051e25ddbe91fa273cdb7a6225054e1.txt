‘Community resilience' is one of those policy buzzwords that has emerged through the pandemic.

This does not mean that standard public health and technical measures are abandoned, but they must go hand-in-hand with community resilience-building. For some, this is at last a recognition that local efforts count, and that centralised health systems are not the only solutions.
