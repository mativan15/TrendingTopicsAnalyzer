VioletaStoimenova While screening for companies near their 52-week highs, I came across FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE:FCN). I believe FCN's strong price momentum is driven by expectations on its countercyclical bankruptcy and restructuring consulting practice. Momentum traders may wish to participate in the current strong uptrend, as revenues and earnings are likely to beat estimates into 2023. However, valuations may already be pricing in a 'Bull Case' scenario, so I think any shortfall could see swift selling.
