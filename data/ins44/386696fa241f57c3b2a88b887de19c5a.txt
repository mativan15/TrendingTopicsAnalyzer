OTTAWA - An executive from the Montreal company that repaired a turbine for a Russian gas pipeline earlier this year says it sought an export permit to get 'guidance' from Ottawa.

Siemens Energy Canada Ltd. says it halted its scheduled maintenance work on a turbine for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline when Canada imposed sanctions on Russia in March after its invasion of Ukraine.

The company's managing director, Arne Wohlschlegel, told a parliamentary committee that in May, the German government advised its headquarters and the Canadian government that an energy crisis was unfolding in Germany.
