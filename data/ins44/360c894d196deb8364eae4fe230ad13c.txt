RT.com 29th May 2022, 18:13 GMT+10An immediate embargo would let Russia sell its oil elsewhere and get more money, Ursula Von der Leyen saysEurope cannot place an immediate embargo on Russian oil, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen has said, as it would allow Moscow to sell its fuel elsewhere and possibly earn more money to fund its military offensive in Ukraine."If we would completely, immediately, as of today cut off the [Russian] oil, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin might be able to take the oil that he does not sell to the EU to the world market, where the prices will increase, and sell it for more - and that would fill his war chests," the EU leader said in an interview with MSNBC earlier this week.
