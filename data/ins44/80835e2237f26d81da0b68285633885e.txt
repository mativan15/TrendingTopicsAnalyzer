The Georgia Southern baseball team is hosting an NCAA regional for the first time. Can the Eagles take advantage and move on to the Super Regionals?

Georgia Southern opens against UNC Greensboro on Friday night, after Notre Dame and Texas Tech kick off the Statesboro Regional in the afternoon. The regional is double-elimination.

The Eagles were supposed to play Friday night, but rain throughout the day delayed the first game of the day between Notre Dame and Texas Tech. Georgia Southern and UNC Greensboro are now slated to go Saturday morning.
