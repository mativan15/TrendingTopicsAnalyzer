This is because making food the proper Buddhist way with good ingredients and sharing it with many is to practice the Buddha's teaching that 'Food is good medicine.' Its purpose is also to spread the spirit embodied in temple food, based on the belief that 'What we eat creates our body and mind.'Eight years ago, Ven. Kyungwoon fell ill when she was about to finish her junior year at Unmunsa Monastic College.
