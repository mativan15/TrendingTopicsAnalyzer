The USDA has canceled $800 million in debts for 13,100 farmers, it said Tuesday.

The Inflation Reduction Act included $3.1 billion in assistance for distressed farm loan borrowers.

The USDA said Tuesday's announcement was "just the first step" in aiding distressed farmers.

The US Department of Agriculture has already canceled $800 million of farmers' debts as part of the Biden administration's debt relief programme, it said Tuesday.

This came from the $3.1 billion in assistance for distressed farm loan borrowers included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in August.
