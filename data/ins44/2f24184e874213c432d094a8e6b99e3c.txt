May 31, 2022 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Aircraft Leasing: Commercial, Legal and Technical Issues" conference has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



Further to its previous success in Washington DC, Dubai, London, Dublin and online, we are delighted to offer this high-level interactive seminar for the 30th time.

We have fine-tuned the workshop over the years and recently have made some major changes, which we are introducing this year. The format is different, and in addition to the legal side of leases, we are including significantly more material on the technical side and including the commercial issues.
