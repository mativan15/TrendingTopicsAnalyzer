Two Republican candidates for Will County Board's District 4 say they have extensive experience in government while their Democratic challengers say that although they are newcomers, they want to jump in and make a difference.

Republicans Steve Balich, the only incumbent seeking reelection, and James Richmond will face Democrats Sheri Boniecki-Cooling and Andrew Englebrecht for the two board seats to be elected in District 4, which includes all or portions of Homer Glen, Mokena, Lockport, Orland Park and Tinley Park.
