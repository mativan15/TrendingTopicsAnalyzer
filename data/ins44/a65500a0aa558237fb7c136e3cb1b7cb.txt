Tom Hanks has questioned his decision to play Colonel Tom Parker — who was Elvis Presley's infamous longtime manager — in the upcoming biopic 'Elvis.'
The 65-year-old Oscar winner discussed why he decided to portray him — and how director Baz Luhrmann convinced him to do so — at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday.
'I'm not interested in playing a bad guy just for the sake of, ‘Before I kill you, Mr. Bond, perhaps you'd like a tour of my installations.' That's OK, I get it, but that's for other stuff,' the 'Forrest Gump' actor noted via People.
