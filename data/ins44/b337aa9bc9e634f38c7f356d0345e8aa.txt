A strong quarterly report is the start of a solid recovery for Ulta Beaty , according to investment firm Jefferies. On Thursday, Ulta blew away estimates for the first quarter, generating $6.30 in adjusted earnings per share on $2.35 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting $4.46 in earnings per share on $2.12 billion of revenue. The company's guidance also topped expectations. Analyst Stephanie Wissink upgraded the beauty stock to buy from hold, saying that a strong first-quarter report served as a signal for investors that a rebound is in full swing.
