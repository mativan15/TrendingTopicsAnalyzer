Commuters are set for further rush-hour chaos on Tuesday morning as Just Stop Oil protesters are determined to remain on top of the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge until they are 'brought down', the group has said.The major road bridge linking Essex and Kent was closed after it was scaled by two climbers from the group, whose demands include that the Government 'halts all new oil and gas licences and consents'.The closure of the M25 Dartford Crossing caused delays of two hours during rush hour on Monday, with six miles of congestion on the anti-clockwise carriageway and five miles in the opposite direction, National Highways said.
