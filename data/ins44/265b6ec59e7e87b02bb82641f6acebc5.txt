Tuskegee football coach and athletic director Reginald Ruffin says he received death threats for recent comments he made about Nick Saban and Alabama.Last week, Ruffin, who coaches the smaller Division II program in Alabama, suggested that Saban and the Crimson Tide should consider scheduling more games against historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) programs. "To see those comments over what was misconstrued from my post — my post was not to suggest to coach [Saban], to tell coach or demand coach or tell him what to do," Ruffin told HBCU Sports Wednesday.
