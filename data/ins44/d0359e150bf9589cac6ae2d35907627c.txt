Russia could have stooges ready to tip the balance of the Tory leadership race if it goes to an online vote, a top cyber expert has warned - with GCHQ airing fears of an online strike.

Peter Ryan, a professor of applied security at the University of Luxembourg, said little is known about the Conservative Party membership.

Figures vary for how many members there are, with 180,000 to 200,000 usually given as estimates.

The party's website has a membership option called 'Conservatives Abroad', which says 'anyone living anywhere in the world is welcome to join Conservatives Abroad from just £25 per year'.
