A leading ally of departing Prime Minister Liz Truss has become the third cabinet minister to declare for Boris Johnson. Levelling-Up Secretary Simon Clarke joins Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg in getting behind a return to the top job for Mr Johnson less than 50 days since he left Downing Street.With Ms Truss quitting yesterday after just 44 days in office following a collapse in support as a result of her mini-budget causing an economic crash, Mr Johnson has flown back to Britain with momentum gathering for an unlikely comeback.
