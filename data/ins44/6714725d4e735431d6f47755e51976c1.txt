Sauce Gardner has already made his case as perhaps the best defensive rookie in the NFL in just six games.
The fourth-overall pick has been shutting down receivers and putting up ridiculous coverage numbers. He allowed one catch Sunday in Green Bay when Aaron Rodgers threw his way six times. Pro Football Focus tweeted these impressive stats: In single coverage this season, Gardner has allowed four catches on 17 targets and forced seven incompletions. He has a 19.5 passer rating allowed.
'He's a special talent,' Jets coach Robert Saleh said Wednesday.
