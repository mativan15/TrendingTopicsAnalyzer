MONROE, Ore. — Democrats haven't lost a governor's race in Oregon in four decades. Two years ago, Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the state by 16 percentage points. The only Republican to win a statewide election since 2002 died before finishing his term.

And yet this year's race for Oregon governor is now among the tightest in the country, illustrating both frustration with one of the nation's most progressive state governments and the power of a single billionaire donor to shape an election to his whims.
