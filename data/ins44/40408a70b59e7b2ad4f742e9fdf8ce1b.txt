PTIRajasthan Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot with party leaders Miffed over his name not figuring in the list for the Rajya Sabha polls, Independent MLA from Rajasthan Sanyam Lodha, who is also an adviser to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, on Monday said the party should re-reconsider its decision to field candidates to the Upper House from outside the state. The Congress had on Sunday announced 10 candidates for the June 10 polls, of which three would represent Rajasthan, but the discontented leaders said none of them hailed from the state.
