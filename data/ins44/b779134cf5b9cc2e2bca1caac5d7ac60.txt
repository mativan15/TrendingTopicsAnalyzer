Indian teacher Pratibha Hilim lost her hands and feet to gangrene Indranil MUKHERJEE AFP Karhe (India) (AFP) – When gangrene robbed Indian teacher Pratibha Hilim of her hands and feet three years ago, her dreams of returning to class gave her the strength to endure. The 51-year-old now gives her lessons from home, wielding a pen or a stick of chalk strapped to her arm, for youngsters in a remote community where opportunities for education are scarce."I am a teacher, which means someone who cannot sit still but has to do something with children -- teach them or be with them," she told AFP in sun-baked Karhe village, a few hours' drive east of Mumbai.
