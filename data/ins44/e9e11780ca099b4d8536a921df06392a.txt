Week 6 was a chaotic NFL experience, and we're getting ready for another with our best early NFL week 7 picks.

The pregame narrative: The Tennessee Titans were on bye in Week 6 and we're betting on that playing a large role in their upcoming game against the Indianapolis Colts. The Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons are two other teams that made our card after checking out the opening lines.

Here are our best early NFL Week 7 picks.

Odds as of 4:43 p.m. on 10/17/2022.

The Colts have won three of their last four games but we're still not sure if they're any good.
