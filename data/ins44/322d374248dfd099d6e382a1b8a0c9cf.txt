European Union member states drove up energy prices by bidding against each other for gas contracts, amid 'nervousness' in Germany while it strove to fill its depleted gas storage, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.The chief of the EU's green transition spoke to the media as the commission unveiled proposals for common purchases of gas, taking inspiration from joint vaccine buying at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.'One of the reasons why our prices are higher in Europe than in Asia, for instance, is because member states have been competing against each other,' Mr Timmermans said.
