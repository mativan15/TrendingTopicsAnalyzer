PARIS (Reuters) - Strained relations between France and Germany amid the war in Ukraine and energy crisis need a "reset" to forge a stronger alliance between the two biggest EU countries, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.

Ties between the two countries, traditionally the driving force behind broader EU policy initiatives, have hit a rough spot with their governments postponing a meeting planned for next week until January.

Le Maire, a fluent German speaker with long-running political contacts in Germany, said that relations were currently "difficult", firstly because the war in Ukraine had prompted Berlin to turn towards Washington while Paris championed "European sovereignty".
