The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by Primo Water Corporation (TSE:PRMW) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 13%. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 7.9%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 3.5% higher than it was three years ago.
