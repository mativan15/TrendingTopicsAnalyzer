Taiwan has engaged with the United States, and the European Union, in separate talks aimed at securing tech supply chains.
On Wednesday, the US and Taiwan launched an "Initiative on 21st Century Trade" that is very similar to the recently-announced 14-country Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) that aimed to secure regional supply chains.
Taiwan is not a party to the IPEF – an omission possibly intended to avoid provoking China. But the Office of the United States Trade Representative has described the Initiative as addressing "trade partners that deploy non-market policies and practices, which threaten the livelihoods of [US and Taiwan] people and harm their workers and businesses.
