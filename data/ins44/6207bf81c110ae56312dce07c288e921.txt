(Reuters) - Block Inc will work with Apple Inc to integrate Square payments with "Tap to Pay" feature on iPhones and launch it later this year, the fintech company said on Thursday.

The San Francisco-based company's shares rose 7% on the news.

The company said sellers would be able to accept in-person contactless payments with only their iPhone and a Square Point-of-Sales (POS) app, without the need for additional hardware.

Block said an Early Access Program will help sellers test the integration with iPhones this summer.
