Hasbro Inc. shares slid 3% Tuesday after the toy company reported third-quarter net income that was roughly half that of the same period last year. This happened as retailers sped up shipments to avoid supply-chain snags and customers showed sensitivity to high inflation. The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company HAS, -1.83%, which produces toys and games including Monopoly and My Little Pony, posted net income of $129.2 million, or 93 cents a share, for the quarter, down from $235.2 million, or $1.
