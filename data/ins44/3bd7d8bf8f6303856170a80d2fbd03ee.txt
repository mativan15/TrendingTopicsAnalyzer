Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner is revved up for the band's long-awaited album The Car.
But the singer admitted he thought their music career would have stalled already.
‘The records we're making now are definitely different to the ones we probably thought we would be making when we started out – actually, we didn't think we'd be even making records any more,' he began. 
‘Twenty years ago, I didn't envision ourselves going beyond – well, the fact we gave ourselves the name Arctic Monkeys alludes to the extent of the ambitions we had.
