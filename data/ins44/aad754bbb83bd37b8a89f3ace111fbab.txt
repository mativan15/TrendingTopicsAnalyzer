Hear that? It's the sound of luxury automakers revving up the transition to electric vehicles (EVs). And despite the artificial engine sound of EVs, some models, like the 2022 Audi e-tron GT ($102,400), still pack a ton of power: up to 637 horsepower and 612lb-ft. of torque, in this case. The corporate cousin to the Porsche Taycan, this Audi model features a striking exterior, boasts a high-end interior, and supports fast charging. But its limited battery range (compared with other high-end sedans), unremarkable brake regeneration feel, and poor rear visibility make it tough to recommend to anyone but ardent performance car fans.
