Thank god for elections! With the 2022 midterms imminent, President Biden has decided to release more oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to put downward pressure on gasoline prices. He's no dummy, Biden. He has clearly made the connection between gas prices—still fairly high, at around $3.85 per gallon—and the electoral prospects of the incumbent party, which happens to be his own.But another Biden move may be more important. The Energy Dept. plans to purchase oil to replenish the reserve at prices ranging from $67 to $72 per barrel and sign contracts with producers locking in the price two or three years in advance.
