The Bank of England has warned of higher interest rates than expected next month. Speaking in Washington this morning, the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: 'As things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps thought in August.'He added that the Bank 'will not hesitate" to raise interest rates to curb inflation.'The bank previously predicted the rate of inflation would peak at 11 per cent in October.The Bank is due to announce its next decision on interest rates on 3 November and many investors think it will either raise them from their current level of 2.
