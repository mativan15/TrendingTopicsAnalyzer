Jim Dwyer has spent the last fifty years in the hospitality industry. He spent the first 30+ years with the airlines before moving on to the cruise lines and the group tours. In 1993, Jim joined Skål in Toledo before moving to the Detroit Club and then onto New Jersey.   "After attending NAASC in Calgary in 2005, I realized that Skål was more than just dining with friends once a month and sharing stories," Jim said when he met members from around the world at that meeting. "The passion and dedication I saw opened my eyes to Skål's global networking possibilities and how it could help me professionally and personally," and he hit the ground running after that.
