NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc expects to raise the price of its COVID-19 vaccine to about $110 to $130 per dose after the United States government's current purchase program expires, Pfizer executive Angela Lukin said on a call with analysts on Thursday.

Lukin said she expects the vaccine will be made available at no cost to people who have private insurance or government paid insurance.

The U.S. government currently provides the vaccine for free to all but pays about $30 per dose to Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE.
