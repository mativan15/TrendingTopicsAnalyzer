MIAMI — Holding a 15-3 lead Friday night with their go-to position player pitcher knocked out of the game, Giants manager Gabe Kapler was left to survey the dugout again to find someone to cover the ninth inning.
If not Luis González, apparently Donovan Walton is the Giants' second option to pitch in blowout games.
'For me it really is about who wants to do this, without putting anybody at risk,' Kapler said. 'Donnie wanted it.'
'Kap asked me and I said yeah, absolutely,' Walton said. Both González and Walton have some credentials that lead to being natural candidates to step on the mound, even if it isn't their primary job.
