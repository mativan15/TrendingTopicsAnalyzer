New census data is shining more light on the Bay Area's pandemic exodus: The region saw the largest drop in median income of any big U.S. metro area as wealthy people moved away — and current residents of all incomes are more likely to relocate soon than in any other major population center.
Household income in the San Francisco metro area fell 4.6% from 2019 to 2021 to $116,005 a year, according to a census report released this month.
The metro area, which includes San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Marin counties, still had the highest median income of any large region.
