Published: 06:10 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 06:11 EDT, 3 June 2022 A frog species forms 'boy bands' that sing in unison to woo females into their pools, a new study shows.Researchers have recorded wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) at ponds in New Hampshire to learn more about individual contributions to a frog chorus. Findings indicate that females are generally attracted to songs in lower frequencies – likely because they indicate bigger bodies and good physical health.Males, meanwhile, time their songs to other chorus members and may even be choosy about singing with certain other males to enhance their breeding success.
