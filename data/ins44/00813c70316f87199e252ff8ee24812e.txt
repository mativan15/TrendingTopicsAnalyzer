When Bros creator, Billy Eichner made an impassioned plea for people to see his queer-centred romantic comedy, he shared concerns on Twitter that straight people 'just didn't show up.'

The subsequent 'flop' discourse surrounding Bros appears to ignore the positive reviews from audiences who have seen the film – focusing more on the failure of a queer romcom to have mainstream appeal, and a corresponding bottom line at the box office.

Variety's Zack Sharf and William Earl suggest that 'the star power just wasn't there' to support Bros success.
