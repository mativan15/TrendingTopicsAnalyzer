During his latest "My Take," "Varney & Co." host Stuart Varney discussed the "unsettling" inflation spiral sweeping through the country and the "political change" that could take place as a result of dwindling living standards.  STUART VARNEY: It is particularly unsettling when you see prices rising rapidly. You get the feeling that you're in a spiral, and you don't know where it's going to end.There are many people getting that feeling today: gas went up a full 5 cents overnight to a new record: $4.
