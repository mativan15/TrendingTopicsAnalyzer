Pokemon Sword and Shield are holding one more Max Raid event before their online updates end next month. Until Oct. 23, Glastrier and Spectrier, the legendary steeds introduced in Sword and Shield's Crown Tundra expansion, are appearing in Max Raid dens. While you won't be able to catch these Pokemon, you'll earn some very valuable rewards if you manage to defeat them, including Ability Capsules and Bottle Caps.Before the featured Pokemon can begin appearing in your game, you'll first need to refresh your raid dens.
