WASHINGTON - A critical group of swing voters was asked to give a brief, one-word description of the emotions they feel upon seeing President Biden.

The answers were bleak: "Indifferent . . . mixed to indifferent . . . bored . . . ambivalent . . . frustrated . . . flabbergasted . . . lost."

Then the same voters, who had cast ballots for Donald Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, were asked for a show of hands for those who would support the former president in a rematch vs. the sitting president.

"None of you," Rich Thau, president of market research company Engagious, said to his focus group Tuesday night in Pennsylvania.
