Backsliding a bit against a backdrop of decent economic indicators, hawkish overtones to Fed rhetoric and the uncomfortable need to wait weeks or months for the key market swing factors to reveal themselves. Call it a "benign now, pay later" sentiment hovering over the Street and keeping risk appetites in check after a nice rebound rally. The S & P 500 has now retraced a bit less than a quarter of the 9.1% rip from the May 20 low through Friday's close. That's well within the normal range for a consolidation but uncomfortable enough given the fickleness of several doomed rally attempts this year.
