Criminals are regarding fines for fly-tipping as "business expenses" making the deterrent ineffective, MPs have said.Rather than cracking down on waste crime, the government's approach is closer to "decriminalisation", the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said.
It said that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was not doing enough to prevent fly-tipping and does not have a solid plan in place to meet its target of eliminating £1bn a year of waste crime by 2043.
