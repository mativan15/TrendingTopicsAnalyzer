A federal judge on Friday rejected a motion from former President Trump's attorney John Eastman requesting that the Department of Justice (DOJ) return his phone, which it obtained from a search warrant in June.

Senior U.S. District Judge Robert Brack said in his ruling that Eastman failed to show either irreparable injury resulting from not having possession of his phone or an 'inadequate remedy at law.'

Brack previously denied the Trump attorney's motion for a temporary restraining order preventing investigators from accessing his phone in July, ruling that he failed to demonstrate an 'immediate, irreparable harm' that would result.
