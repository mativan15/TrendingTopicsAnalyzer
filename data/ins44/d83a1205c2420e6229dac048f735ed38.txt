There is no fooling financial markets and there is no scope for cuddling up to them or asking for their loyalty. There is nothing equivalent with regard to foreign, defence, education, transport, health policy or anything else.
The upshot of all this is that whatever you think of the financial orthodoxy, you would do well not to throw it out of the window and/or disparage those who still embrace it. And because of the importance of confidence, it is as well to follow established norms of behaviour and to cleave to established institutions and procedures.
