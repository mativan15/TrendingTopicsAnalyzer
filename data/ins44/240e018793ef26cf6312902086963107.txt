HOUSTON — The Yankees have a new 26-man roster as they try to take down the Astros in the ALCS.
Ahead of Wednesday's Game 1 at Minute Maid Park, the Yankees announced their roster that added Oswald Peraza, Frankie Montas and Greg Weissert and subtracted Aaron Hicks, Marwin Gonzalez and Lucas Luetge from the group they used to beat the Guardians in the ALDS.
DJ LeMahieu (right toe), Andrew Benintendi (broken hook of the hamate bone) and Ron Marinaccio (right shin stress reaction) also remained off the roster because of their respective injuries.
