London CNN —

Liz Truss's ill-fated tenure as British Prime Minister was engulfed in yet more chaos on Wednesday when Suella Braverman, her Home Secretary, resigned seven weeks into her role over the use of a personal email address that breached ministerial rules.

Braverman said she 'sent an official document from my personal email to a trusted parliamentary colleague as party of policy engagement.'

'This constitutes a technical infringement of the rules,' she wrote in a resignation letter which was also scathing of Truss's leadership and indicated deep fissures in the heart of her government.
