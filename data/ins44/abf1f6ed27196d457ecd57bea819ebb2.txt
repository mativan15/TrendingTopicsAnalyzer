Through 64 minutes as a Knick, Jalen Brunson has flashed his ability to score, distribute and make others around him better. But perhaps the most impressive statistic has a zero on it: turnovers.
Brunson, despite playing with the ball in his hands frequently, has yet to commit a turnover while registering 15 assists.
'He has a great understanding of the game, and I think that's probably the most important thing,' coach Tom Thibodeau said after the Knicks blew out the Pistons, 130-106, in the home opener at the Garden.
