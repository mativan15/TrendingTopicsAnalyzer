AARP Innovation Labs is heading to Las Vegas for a series of tech conferences, hosting competitions for innovators looking to help empower people to choose how they live as they age. Next month, we'll host a startup pitch event during the annual HLTH conference for tech entrepreneurs focused on developing technology to help improve older adults' cognitive abilities. Finalists can win up to $10,000 for their companies and may also be invited to our AgeTech Collaborative program, where they'll receive mentorship and guidance for connecting with an older audience.
