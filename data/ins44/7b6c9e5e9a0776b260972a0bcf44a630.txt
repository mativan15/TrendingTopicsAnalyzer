Voice of America 16th October 2022, 06:06 GMT+11Mogadishu, Somalia - Somalia's government Saturday threatened to sanction businesses that pay extortion money to al-Shabab, looking to choke a lucrative cash pipeline the Islamist militants use to fund a deadly insurgency.Somalia's ministry of commerce and industry said the full force of the law would be brought against traders who pay the al-Qaida ally, which experts say raises millions of dollars through a complex and extensive taxation system.The ministry said any business found to have paid or collaborated with al-Shabab in any way would 'face legal action' including having their government-issued trading permits revoked.
