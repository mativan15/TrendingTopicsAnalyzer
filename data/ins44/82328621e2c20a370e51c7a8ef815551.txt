When Krishna Stanton felt like giving in on her way to a world record at the London Marathon this month, she thought about her absent friends.Twenty years earlier, Stanton was competing in the Commonwealth Games marathon in Manchester.She won silver that day, and was flanked on the podium by fellow Australians Kerryn McCann and Jackie Gallagher, completing a remarkable and rare 1-2-3 finish — something not achieved before or since. "I get a bit emotional when I talk about 2002, because I'm the only one still here," Stanton says.
