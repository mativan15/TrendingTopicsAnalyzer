The Jacksonville Jaguars ran for 243 yards, only threw two incomplete passes, and didn't turn the ball over until there were zeroes on the clock in the fourth quarter. Yet, the Jaguars still found a way to lose 34-27 to an Indianapolis Colts team they beat 24-0 four weeks ago.
Colts quarterback Matt Ryan racked up 389 yards and three touchdowns against a Jaguars defense that couldn't get off the field.
