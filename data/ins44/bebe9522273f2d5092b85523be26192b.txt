Simon Cowell's new project to pair music industry heavyweights with TikTok users (Headland/PA)

Simon Cowell says his latest project pairing some of music's biggest songwriters and producers with social media creatives may be the industry's 'missing link'.

The music mogul said very few unestablished artists would have the opportunity to gain studio time with industry heavyweights 'in the real world' nowadays.

His latest endeavour, StemDrop, grants TikTok creators worldwide access to exclusive music 'stems', inviting them to produce their own versions of a brand-new song written by prolific hitmakers.
