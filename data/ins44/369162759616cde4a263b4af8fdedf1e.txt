Little has gone as expected for former Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, who was pressed into action for the Dolphins during the second quarter of Minnesota's 24-16 win in Miami one day after he was cleared to return from the concussion protocol.

Bridgewater replaced seventh-round rookie Skylar Thompson, who was knocked from the game with a right thumb injury after being hit by Vikings linebacker Jordan Hicks on a third-down blitz. In the 30-year-old Bridgewater's latest turn as spot passer for a needy NFL team, the Vikings' up-and-down defense forced a season-best six sacks and three turnovers to spoil his 329-yard day.
