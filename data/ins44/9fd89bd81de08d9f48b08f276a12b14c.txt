Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon is planning a massive reorganization of the Wall Street giant that will consolidate its key businesses into three units, according to a report.
The corporate rejiggering — the third restructuring effort chief executive Solomon has made in the last four years — will place the company's investment banking and trading divisions under one roof, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The new unit — which combines two divisions long seen as rivals, with former CEO Lloyd Blankfein having risen to the helm from the trading unit and his successor Solomon hailing from investment banking — will be helmed by Dan Dees, Jim Esposito and Ashok Varadhan, according to the report, which cited unnamed sources.
