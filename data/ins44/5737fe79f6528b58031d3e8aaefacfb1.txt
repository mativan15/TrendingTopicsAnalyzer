May 29—The future of West Gray Street as a two-way downtown thoroughfare has again been delayed.

"The Gray Street 2-Way Conversion Project was originally planned to begin construction in fall 2022," Public Works Director Shawn O'Leary said last week. "The project is now planned for construction to begin in spring 2023."

As reported by The Transcript, the project is one of five in the voter-approved 2019 Transportation Bond to be fully funded with that money.

"The downside to the use of federal funds for the Gray Street Project was a six-month delay in construction in order to meet federal project guidelines," O'Leary said.
