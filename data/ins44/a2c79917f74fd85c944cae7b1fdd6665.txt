While taking the stand to deny allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances toward an underage Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey told jurors Monday that his "white supremacist and neo-Nazi" father made him reluctant to live openly as a gay man.

Testifying for the first time in the $40 million civil lawsuit Rapp filed against him in New York, Spacey responded to allegations that in 1986, when he was 26 and Rapp was 14, he lifted Rapp up "like a groom carrying a bride over the threshold" and took him to a bed, where he climbed on top of him.
