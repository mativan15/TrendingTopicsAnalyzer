(CNN Business)Microsoft is leaving the door open to employees who want to form or join a union. The tech giant will "respect" the right of its workers to organize and is "committed to creative and collaborative approaches" to work with unions, according to Microsoft's president and vice chair, Brad Smith. "Recent unionization campaigns across the country — including in the tech sector — have led us to conclude that inevitably these issues will touch on more businesses, potentially including our own," Smith wrote in a blog post Thursday.
