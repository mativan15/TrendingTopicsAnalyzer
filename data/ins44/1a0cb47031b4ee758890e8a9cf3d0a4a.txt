The Delhi High Court dismissed a plea challenging tender conditions issued by the Delhi government for the preparation and supply of midday meals to children of primary and upper primary classes in government-aided schools and alternative and innovative education (AIE) centres under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.
A division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad held on October 17 that the tender conditions cannot be said to be 'whimsical, capricious, arbitrary or meant to be suited for a select few'.
