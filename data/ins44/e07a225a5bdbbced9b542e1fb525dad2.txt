Donald Trump is an antisemite.

He regularly employs antisemitic tropes, essentializes Jews as a monolithic group, and entertains base stereotypes of Jews. He suggests that Jews are—or at least should be—more loyal to Israel than the United States. And yet, his defenders insist he can't truly be antisemitic because his son-in-law is Jewish and his daughter converted to Judaism. Plus, he supports Israel.

Trump himself has said he is 'the least antisemitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.
