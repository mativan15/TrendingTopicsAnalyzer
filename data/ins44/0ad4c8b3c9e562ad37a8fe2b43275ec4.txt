Montreal Canadiens draft pick Owen Beck banged in a rebound 2:07 into overtime as the Mississauga Steelheads defeated the London Knights 5-4 on Friday night.
The goal ended an entertaining game that burst back and forth and saw the teams tied three separate times.It also marked the debuts of George Diaco and Alec Leoonard in London uniforms.Diaco did exactly what he was brought in to do as he scored a goal, broke up plays and had a couple of key shot blocks. Leonard was a solid presence on defence and ended the game a plus-one.
