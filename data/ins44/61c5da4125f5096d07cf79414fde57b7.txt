New Delhi: Crypto market continued to remain range bound on Friday with enough pressure on altcoins to drag them lower. The sudden spike in US bond yields dented the appetite for risky assets. On the technical front, Bitcoin might be undervalued, but the macroeconomic environment is still so sketchy that investors might not want to hop in just yet, said analysts.

Barring Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, which posted mild gains, all other crypto tokens were trading lower. Uniswap plunged about 4 per cent.
