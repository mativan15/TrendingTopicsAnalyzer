Elon Musk has appeared to recommit SpaceX to providing Starlink satellite internet terminals to Ukraine, days after he complained it was too expensive for his company.The billionaire has said that providing the war-torn country with 20,000 units has already cost SpaceX $80m, and will top $100m by the end of 2022.But on Saturday the Tesla boss, who has a personal fortune of around $198bn, took to Twitter to suggest that SpaceX will continue to fund the programme.'The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free,' tweeted Mr Musk.
