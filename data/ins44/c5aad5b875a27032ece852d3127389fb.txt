A new Universal Parks & Resorts patent could be in line with rumored plans for another Despicable Me-based attraction at a Universal Orlando Resort theme park.

Why this matters: Theme park technology can provide the region opportunities for partnerships, manufacturing and advancements. It also improves the experience for tourists and can result in return visitation to Orlando.

The patent, dubbed "Interactive Environment with Portable Devices," describes a portable device that allows guests walking or riding through an attraction to interact with their environment.
