luismmolina/iStock via Getty ImagesIonis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) is a pharmaceutical company best known for developing Spinraza, which is licensed to Biogen (BIIB), producing $60 million in royalty revenue in Q2 2022. Ionis specializes in a type of RNAi therapy known as antisense. It has two approved, commercial drugs beyond Spinraza, though they are not very significant sources of income. The real prize for investors is Ionis's extensive pipeline. In this article I will argue that given the pipeline and current price of the stock, Ionis is a strong candidate for long-term investors.
