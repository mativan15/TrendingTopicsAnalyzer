Patrick Reed recently predicted there would be 'a media s---show' when a LIV player won on one of the game's two main tours. 
Although Adrian Otaegui's victory in the Andalucia Masters on Sunday hardly caused a vitrolic explosion - social media apart, of course - there can be no doubt that the Spaniard's dominating success would have been celebrated on the Saudi circuit and lamented in the corridors of the DP World Tour's Wentworth HQ.
Otaegui is not one of the contracted LIV players, because if he was he would have been competing in the £22million LIV 54-holer in Jeddah and not the £1.
