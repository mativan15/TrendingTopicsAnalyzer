OTTAWA, June 2 (Reuters) - An extra C$8,300 ($6,600) in your pocket.That is roughly how much the average Canadian saved during the pandemic, with the central bank betting on C$40 billion in added spending through the end of next year as consumers draw down those stockpiles.But soaring inflation has already offset two-thirds of the buying power of that excess cash, according to one estimate, with some Canadians dipping in to pandemic savings to pay for everyday essentials instead of a new paddleboard or a weekend getaway.
