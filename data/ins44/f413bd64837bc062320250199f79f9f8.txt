NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Monday observed that the speech delivered by former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested in connection with the 2020 north-east Delhi riots here, in Amravati in February 2020 was in 'bad taste' but that did not make it a terrorist act.'That the speech is in bad taste, does not make it a terrorist act. We understand that extremely well. If the case of the prosecution is premised on how offensive the speech was, that by itself would not constitute an offence,' a Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said.
