Market Driver - The reduction in installation and retrofit costs is a major factor driving the global industrial wireless market in process industries' market share growth. A wireless system involves significantly lower installation and retrofit costs when compared with a wired system. In the case of repair and reconfiguration requirements, wired systems involve the installation of new cables and associated labor and trenching and hardware needs. In contrast to these expenses involved in a wired system, a wireless system can be easily scaled up according to the requirements of an industry without the addition of any new hardware.
