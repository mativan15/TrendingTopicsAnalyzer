The late movie star Anna May Wong has become the first Asian American pictured on United States money.
Wong worked in Hollywood during a time of open racism and stereotyping of actors. During her career, Wong also became the first Asian American woman to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California.
Wong's face and hand are shown on a new version of the American quarter, a coin worth 25 cents. The United States Mint recently announced Wong is part of a five-part series of quarters released as part of its American Women Quarter Program.
