Piper Sandler called D-Wave Quantum a unrivaled leader in quantum computing that is poised to thrive in what will likely become a multibillion dollar market. Analyst Harsh Kumar initiated the stock at overweight with a price target of $12, which would provide an upside of just under 130% over its last closing price. D-Wave's big-name partners, which include Deloitte, Volkswagen, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin , and its focus on a process called annealing will make the stock stand out in the growing industry, Kumar said.
