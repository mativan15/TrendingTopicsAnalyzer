June 01, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CloseFactor today announced a $4.5M seed funding round led by Sequoia Capital to reimagine the business to business sales process, bringing the benefits of greater automation and precision targeting to sales teams.



CloseFactor, already in use at several companies such as Zuora, LaunchDarkly, and Chronosphere, uses machine learning to deliver customized sales insights about target accounts and buyer personas.

Alignment between go-to-market strategy and feet-on-the-ground execution has always been hindered by the lack of visibility into a dynamic total addressable market (TAM) that also incorporates the details behind every account's initiatives and buyer personas, which is actionable by sales and marketing teams.
