The defamation trial between actor Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard came to an end Wednesday when a Virginia jury ruled in favor of Depp. While the trial has ended, the fight over paying for monetary damages has only started.
Heard's trial lawyer Elaine Bredehoft appeared Thursday on NBC's "Today" and spoke about the evidence that was suppressed in the trial and the plan to appeal. The questions later turned toward whether Heard is able to pay the $10.35 million judgment. 
'Oh no, absolutely not,' Bredehoft told host Savannah Guthrie.
