MIDDLETOWN, Pa. — As part of a pilot program through Penn State's Bellisario College of Communications, Penn State Harrisburg is offering four grants ranging from $3,000 to $7,000 ($20,000 total) to full-time faculty and staff members working on news literacy projects.
The funds will support direct or indirect costs for research, creative projects, or the design and implementation of teaching/curricular materials or initiatives that directly relate to news literacy.
The Bellisario College's News Literacy Initiative is sponsoring a Commonwealth Campus grant with Penn State Harrisburg as the pilot site for the grant in fall 2022.
