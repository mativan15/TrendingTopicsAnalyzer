naphtalina/iStock via Getty Images We monitor dividend announcements for stocks in Dividend Radar, a spreadsheet we update and publish for free every Friday. The spreadsheet provides key data of stocks with dividend streaks of five years or more. The Dividend Radar spreadsheet separates stocks into three categories: Champions (with increase streaks of 25+ years), Contenders (10-24 years), and Challengers (5-9 years). During this period, ten companies on the Dividend Radar list decided to increase their dividends, including one of the stocks I hold in my portfolio.
