Two days before the Congress presidential election, Mallikarjun Kharge, one of the two candidates and a senior leader from Karnataka, joined Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra for the first time.
Kharge joined the yatra in Ballari on Saturday, its 38th day, and walked for more than 2 km. The MP was expected to participate in the yatra on October 6 but stayed away on account of his campaign for the October 17 poll and fears that he would be seen as being officially backed by Rahul and party president Sonia Gandhi.
