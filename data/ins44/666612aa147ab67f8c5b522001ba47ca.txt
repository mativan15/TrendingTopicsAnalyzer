Tennessee Titans outside linebacker Rashad Weaver has been one of the bigger surprises on the team through five games of the 2022 season.
Thrust into a bigger role upon the season-ending injury to outside linebacker Harold Landry, Weaver has responded in a big way, notching four sacks, which is tied for the team lead with defensive lineman Denico Autry.

Weaver failed to notch a sack in Week 5, did he did have one pressure and one QB hit, as well as a pass defensed in the victory over the Washington Commanders.
