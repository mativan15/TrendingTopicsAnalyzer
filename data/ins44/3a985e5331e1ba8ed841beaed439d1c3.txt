RXR, a New York-based development company, has topped out Maven, its first South Bronx development.

Maven, a 145,00-square-foot, 200-unit residential tower, is located at 2413 Third Ave. The site is blocks away from the Third Avenue Bridge and the 4,5 and 6 trains.

Maven will also include 60 rent-stabilized units for middle-income households, 81 on-site parking spots, and a 720-square-foot retail space that will be leased to a Bronx-based business.

'RXR is honored to be developing much-needed apartments as the demand for housing in NYC intensifies,' RXR's senior vice president for residential operations Jarrod Whitaker said.
