For the second time this month, the FTC has sued a credit repair operation that it says combined fake promises to swiftly and substantially boost people's credit scores with the offer of a bogus money-making opportunity selling credit repair services. In this latest case, the FTC says the supposed money-making opportunity was a pyramid scheme. The complaint alleges that Michigan-based Financial Education Services (FES), five related companies, and owners Parimal Naik, Michael Toloff, Christopher Toloff, and Gerald Thompson bilked consumers out of more than $213 million.
