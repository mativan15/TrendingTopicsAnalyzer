LOS ANGELES (CNS) - One week after three council members and a top county labor official were heard on a taped 2021 conversation attempting to impact last year's redistricting process in favor of themselves, the City Council voted Tuesday to begin the process of placing a measure on the 2024 ballot or sooner that would create an independent redistricting commission. Under the proposal, the independent commission would be charged with establishing district lines for both the city and the Los Angeles Unified School District.
