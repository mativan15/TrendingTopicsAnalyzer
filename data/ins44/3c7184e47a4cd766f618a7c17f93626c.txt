I dated my first serious girlfriend for eight years from 1983 to 1991. Catia was studying architecture and interior design in Florence and introduced me to the beauty of such arts. It has stayed with me ever since.I met my wife, Lara Gilmore, in New York in 1993. I needed a coffee, saw an Italian sign in a small cafe in Soho and thought that maybe I could get an espresso. I ended up showing the guy there how to make a cappuccino. The owner, Ray, messaged me offering me a shift a day later.Lara got the same message.
