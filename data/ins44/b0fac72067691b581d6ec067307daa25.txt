As of Oct. 14, shares of major lithium producers Albemarle (ALB 4.71%), Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM 4.76%) (also known as SQM), and Livent (LTHM 4.41%) have returned 155%, 156%, and 144%, respectively, over past two years.
For context, the S&P 500 index has returned 5.9% over this period, and in the wake of 2022's bear market, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is underwater, with a total return of negative 11%.
The main driver for these lithium stocks' powerful performances has been the surging demand for the material, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles (EVs).
