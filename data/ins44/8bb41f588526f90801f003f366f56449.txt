Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, and with it we're expecting an early look at iOS 16 -- likely the name of Apple's next software version for the iPhone. Apple is expected to share previews of iOS 16, iPadOS 16, WatchOS 9, MacOS and other software.

So it will truly be a surprise to see what new iOS features are revealed.
