Balenciaga's parent company Kering issued a statement confirming the end of its professional relationship with Kanye West.

In September, Ye's lawyers sent a letter to Gap stating his plans to terminate his 10-year deal with the retail giant.

Sportswear giant Adidas says their partnership with Ye is under review following his controversial comments online.
