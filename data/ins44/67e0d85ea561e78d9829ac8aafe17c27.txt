Published: 00:47 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 00:48 EDT, 20 October 2022 Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is returning to his alum mater to teach a class on public service. De Blasio, 61, will be putting on his professor hat come January 2023, nearly 40 years after he graduated from New York University in 1984, where he majored in metropolitan studies and engaged in activism. He will be teaching a graduate course at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service as a fellow. The former mayor, who failed to secure a spot in Congress after handing over his role to Eric Adams, will begin working with the school in January and he said he is 'excited' about the opportunity.
