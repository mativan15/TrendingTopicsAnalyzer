Becerra had ordered the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reassess its record-high premium increase in 2022 for Part B, which covers doctor visits, diagnostic tests and other outpatient services. The $21.60 basic premium hike in 2022 was the largest dollar increase in the health insurance program's history.
