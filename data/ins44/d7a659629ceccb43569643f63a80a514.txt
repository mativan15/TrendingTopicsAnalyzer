Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 16% in the last quarter. But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. The share price marched upwards over that time, and is now 111% higher than it was. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.

Since the stock has added US$1.
