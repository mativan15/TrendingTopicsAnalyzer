The One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust – a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by One River Asset Management – has been rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The proposal to list on the NYSE Arca exchange lacks sufficient investor protections, the SEC said, which is similar verbiage used by the agency in denying other spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.
