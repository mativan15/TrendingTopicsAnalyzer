Jets wide receiver Elijah Moore may want to be traded, but for now he's preparing as if he'll still be playing for the Jets when they face the Broncos on Sunday.

Moore is back at the team facility today, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.

The Jets gave Moore the day off yesterday, even though he was fully healthy, as he and the team continue to be at odds about his usage in the offense.

Although Moore is the only wide receiver on the Jets' roster who has been in the starting lineup for all six games this season, five players on the team have more catches than he does.
