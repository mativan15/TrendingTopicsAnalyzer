Number 1: (People born on 1, 10, 19, and 28 of any month)
Ganesha says the stars of this week will be favourable to expand work and business. With this, you will be able to complete works related to film, art, acting, dialogue, and information. If you are preparing for competitive exams, and are engaged in grooming your career in the private and government sectors, there will be continuous progress. So try with all your heart. And don't let your mind wander. In terms of health, most of the week will be good, but towards the end, there may be weakness.
