It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Sensata Technologies Holding plc (NYSE:ST) share price is down 30% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 25%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 22% in the last three years.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
