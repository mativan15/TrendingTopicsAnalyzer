France has introduced a list of French words and expressions to replace common English gaming jargon in the country's latest battle against 'franglais'.The alternative expressions were published in the Sunday (May 29) edition of France's Journal Officiel—the government gazette of the French Republic—making them the official terms to be used by government workers.Among the expressions affected are 'early access', which now becomes 'accès anticipé', 'pro-gamer' which is now 'joueur professionnel', and 'cloud gaming', which will now be known as 'jeu vidéo en nuage'.
