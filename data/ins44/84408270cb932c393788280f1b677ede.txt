The drama between James Corden and restaurant owner Keith McNally shows no signs of slowing down, after the food mogul took aim at the star once again on Instagram.
Earlier this week, the Late Late Show host was banned from Balthazar, in New York, amid allegations that he was ‘nasty' to waiting staff.
The 44-year-old reportedly apologized and the matter appeared to be over, before he addressed the reports in a new interview, claiming that he hadn't done ‘anything wrong'.
Keith has now responded on social media, calling the actor out for his latest comments.
