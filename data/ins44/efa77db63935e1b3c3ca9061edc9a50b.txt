The FDA greenlit Novavax's (NVAX) original COVID-19 vaccine Wednesday for use as a booster in some adults, marking the first monovalent vaccine to receive authorization as a booster against the latest Omicron variants.The authorization specifies that adults who have not yet received a bivalent booster but have completed their primary vaccine series can received the Novavax dose at least six months after their last shot.That includes if their primary doses were mRNA and if an mRNA bivalent booster is not available or clinically appropriate, according to the FDA.
