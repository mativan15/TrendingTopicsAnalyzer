The UK's skies won't be as bright as normal on Bonfire Night as many fireworks events are axed amid the cost of living crisis.
Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow, Norwich, Dundee and Nottingham are among the cities that have cancelled displays.
It comes as inflation rises to 10.1% and the choice between food and heating looms for many this winter.
Nottingham City Council announced on Tuesday they had ‘reluctantly' taken the decision due to ‘huge budget difficulties which have been exacerbated by rising inflation, energy costs and other pressures'.
