Ben Kepes is a Canterbury-based entrepreneur and professional board member. He's a pacifist but still intrigued about The Art of War. OPINION: My introduction to business was fairly prosaic. Thirty years ago, a triumvirate of largely unemployable dirtbags who liked to spend their time mountain biking, climbing and tramping, came together to build what was then the very nascent idea of Cactus Outdoor. Fast-forward to today and the same business employs 100 people and makes the toughest workwear and outdoor equipment on earth.
