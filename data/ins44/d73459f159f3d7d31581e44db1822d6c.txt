Chinese leader Xi Jinping has signaled that his government will maintain policies that have put it at odds with the US and other nations and deepened Communist Party control of the economy and society. Xi, speaking at the opening of a twice-a-decade party congress that is expected to give him a third five-year term, extolled the achievements of the past five years and said the party would strive to achieve what it calls the 'rejuvenation' of the nation. 'Our future is bright, but we still have a long way to go,' Xi said to the more than 2000 delegates attending the opening, held in the massive Great Hall of the People that overlooks Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing.
