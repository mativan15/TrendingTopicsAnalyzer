Why did both sides elect to wait on a rookie scale extension for Boston Celtics reserve forward Grant Williams? The Celtics might find themselves paying much more for the former Tennessee player's next contract as a result of letting Williams get to restricted free agency. And the former Vol assumes the risk of losing money due to a bad season or injury.

As counterintuitive as it might seem from a casual glance at the situation, there are actually some very good reasons for both the Celtics and Williams to wait on getting a new contract signed by the Charlotte native.
