A majestic 3-metre-tall ficus stands in a terracotta pot in the centre of a cavernous theatre. Its audience? 70-odd plants — including a fiddle-leaf fig, a variegated rubber plant and an elephant ear — filling the aisles and seating bank.A juvenile Dendrocnide excelsa (or giant stinging tree) — one of Australia's most venomous plants — watches on from the safety of a cage.These are not set dressing or props: these are the stars, co-creators and spectators of Hundreds + Thousands, a theatre show made with and for plants, by artists Daniel Kok and Luke George.
