$2 million issued to 882 producers in Florida. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) announced nearly $2 million will be issued to 882 producers through the 2021 Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment (RTCP) program beginning on May 19, 2022. The RTCP helps eligible farmers and ranchers outside the contiguous U.S., including those in Florida, offset a portion of the cost of transporting agricultural products or inputs used to produce an agricultural commodity over long distances.
