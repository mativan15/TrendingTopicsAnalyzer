FTC vows to tighten grip on platform operators after Kakao service disruptionBy Kang Yoon-seung SEOUL, Oct. 21 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's antitrust regulator said Friday it plans to come up with measures to build grounds for fair competition in the online platform market amid growing criticism that the government has failed to properly monitor Kakao Corp.'s dominant position in the market. The move came after nearly all services by Kakao -- a tech giant with a vast business portfolio ranging from mobile messenger KakaoTalk to online banking and ride-hailing services -- suffered a massive disruption from Saturday to earlier this week due to a fire at its data center near Seoul.
