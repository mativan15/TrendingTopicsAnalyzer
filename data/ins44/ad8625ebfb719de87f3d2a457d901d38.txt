Washington — 
As China's COVID-containment lockdowns stall goods en route to price-conscious U.S. consumers, New Jersey manufacturer Mitch Cahn is finding traces of gold in the snapped links of the global supply chain.
Eleven miles from Manhattan, business is surging at Cahn's textile company, which boasts a 100% local supply chain.
"We manufacture everything from scratch right here in north Newark. We have been in business for 30 years, we now have about 155 workers, and we are hoping to hire another 25 immediately," said Cahn, founder and president of Unionwear.
