It was blamed for the collapse of some suppliers, who were forced to sell energy at huge losses, and for failing to shield low-income households from eventually big price rises that ensued when the cap was recalculated by Ofgem.
That prompted MPs on the Business Select Committee to call on ministers to consider possible alternatives to the price cap in July.
For example, they said a social tariff or a limit on how far apart a supplier's least and most expensive tariffs can be could also help to protect consumers.
