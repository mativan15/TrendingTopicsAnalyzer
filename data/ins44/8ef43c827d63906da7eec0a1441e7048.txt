Mortgage rates rose again, with the 30-year and the 15-year hitting their highest in over a week.
 
The average rate offered for a conventional 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to 5.68% from 5.61% the previous business day, while the average 15-year rate rose to 4.77% from 4.72% the previous business day. 
 
Rates have leveled off some after spiking in April to as high as 6.19% and 5.26%, respectively—the highest levels we'd seen since at least 2019 (and likely much farther back.) Even with the most recent increases, both rates are still around half a percentage point below those April peaks.
