Snowflake (SNOW 2.45%) posted its first-quarter earnings report on May 25. The cloud-based data warehousing company's revenue rose 85% year over year to $422.4 million, which beat analysts' estimates by $9.4 million. Its net loss narrowed from $203.2 million to $165.8 million, but its corresponding loss of $0.53 per share missed expectations by two cents.
Investors didn't seem impressed by those mixed headline numbers, and Snowflake's stock on May 26 briefly slipped below its IPO per-share price of $120.
