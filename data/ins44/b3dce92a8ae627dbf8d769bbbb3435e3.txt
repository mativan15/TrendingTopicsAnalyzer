Score Media and Gaming will shut down its namesake sports book in the United States on Canada Day, ending the Toronto-based brand's uphill battle for visibility south of the border.

The move comes nearly eight months after theScore's acquisition by Penn National Gaming (PENN) in a US$2 billion cash-and-stock deal aimed at growing market share in the crowded North American sports betting market.
