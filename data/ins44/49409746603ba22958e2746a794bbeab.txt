Japan's largest petroleum wholesaler, Eneos Holdings, is building up its electric vehicle-charging business.
The company has acquired the rights to operate the charging network of Japanese electronics firm NEC. Eneos is shifting its business model in line with the push for decarbonization. It set up an EV business development department in June last year. The company plans to centrally control the nationwide network of several thousand EV chargers placed at supermarkets and other locations. Eneos faces the challenge of offering other services than pumping gas with about 13,000 filling stations across Japan.
