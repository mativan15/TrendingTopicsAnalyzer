Chief Whip Wendy Morton resigned from Liz Truss's UK government following a brutal fight to contain a parliamentary rebellion on Wednesday, according to two people with knowledge of her decision.

Morton's deputy, Craig Whittaker, also quit, the people said, as Labour MP Chris Bryant called for an investigation into scenes of apparent manhandling as whips tried to get people into the voting lobbies.
