The concept of identity theft denotes unauthorised use of someone's personal information. Having obtained your sensitive data by fraudulent means, a perpetrator can leverage it to perform various financial operations. For instance, they can take loans in your name, diminish your credit score, withdraw funds if they get lucky, and do lots of other things you won't appreciate, to put it mildly. To top it off, a crook may commit non-financial criminal felonies while impersonating a compromised person.
