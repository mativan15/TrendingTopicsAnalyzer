Delhi's air quality in May this year was the poorest for the month in the last three years, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data. Experts attributed the poor air quality to the lack of rainfall in the first half of the month. The city received just 1.4 mm of rainfall from May 1 to May 20, according to the India Meteorological Department. 
Delhi recorded an average air quality index (AQI) of 212 this year as against 144 in 2021 and 143 in 2020. 
It saw 21 days of "poor" air quality in 2022 as compared to three in 2021 and just two in 2020.
