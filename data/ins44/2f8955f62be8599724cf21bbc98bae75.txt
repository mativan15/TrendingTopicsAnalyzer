On October 16, we will celebrate World Food Day. As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations has set a global objective to 'end hunger by 2030'. The theme wrapped around that goal is 'leave no one behind.' But, we are currently far from attaining this objective. According to Welthungerhilfe, one of Germany's largest private aid agencies that advocates 'Zero Hunger by 2030', almost every 13 seconds, a child dies from the effects of hunger. Up to 828 million people are going hungry – whilst there is enough food, knowledge and resources for all and what's more, food is a human right.
