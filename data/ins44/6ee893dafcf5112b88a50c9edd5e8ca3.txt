Ever wondered what is the super-glue holding the BJP together? Ashoka University associate professor political science and legal studies Vinay Sitapati says it is the top leadership's jugalbandi, and RSS's emphasis on teamwork and coordination. 'The Modi phenomenon is result of a 100-year-old project nurtured by the RSS and Jan Sangh, the forebear of BJP,' said Sitapati, while in conversation with Hindustan Times executive editor Ramesh Vinayak on his book 'Jugalbandi: The BJP Before Modi' at Vibrant Networking Forum's Fabulous Confabulations, which was held in association with Ashoka University on Saturday.
