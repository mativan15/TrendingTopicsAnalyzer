Liz Truss is facing calls for a reshuffle just days after she brutally sacked her chancellor in a bid to save her premiership.The prime minister has faced furious criticism for firing ministers who backed her opponent Rishi Sunak in the Tory leadership contest. Former health secretary Matt Hancock led calls for a reshuffle, saying Ms Truss had to bring the breadth of the Conservative party "into her government".His comments came as Jeremy Hunt insisted that Ms Truss had "changed" as he urged Conservative MPs not to oust her from office.
