Even though her short, six-week stint as the UK's prime minister came crashing down on Thursday, Liz Truss will still get to claim a yearly £115,000 allowance reserved for former prime ministers. According to the UK's government, the Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA) grants all former Prime Ministers a yearly allowance intended to pay them back for expenses spent while fulfilling public duties in the role. To be eligible for the allowance, you only has to have been a former Prime Minister, meaning Truss qualifies, despite being the shortest-serving Prime Minister in the nation's history.
