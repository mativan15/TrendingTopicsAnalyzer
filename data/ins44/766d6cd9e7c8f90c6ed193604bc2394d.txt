Oct. 19—A jury heard opening statements Tuesday in the trial of Steven Turner, who was charged with attempted murder after shooting his wife on Aug. 26, 2020.

Around 10:30 a.m. that day, Turner, 43 at the time, called 911 to report that he accidentally shot his wife at her home in the 2000 block of Cove Road in Gainesville.

On Tuesday, his wife, Katie Lawson, 45, testified against him, saying he shot her in the stomach during an argument in which she demanded that he remove the dozens of marijuana plants he was growing in the basement of her home.
