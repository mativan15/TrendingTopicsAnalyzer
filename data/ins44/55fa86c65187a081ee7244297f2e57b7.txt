US stocks skidded lower on Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping more than 2% following a stronger-than-expected jobs report. US nonfarm payrolls showed an increase of 390,000 jobs in May, beating the 328,000 economists had estimated. The signal of labor-market strength highlights that the Fed is unlikely to slow down its pace of rate hikes, dimming the stock market's hopes for a so-called "Fed pause". Each of the three major indexes capped off a losing week to start June, following last week's gain.
