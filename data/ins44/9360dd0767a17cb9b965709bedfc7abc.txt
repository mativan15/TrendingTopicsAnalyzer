The world celebrates May 31 as World No Tobacco Day. The celebration aims to spread awareness regarding the ill effects of smoking and convince people to quit smoking and adopt a healthy lifestyle. Quitting smoking comes with a range of benefits, both immediate and long-term. While reduced expenses and bettering of taste buds can be considered immediate positive effects, easy breathing, healthy lungs, and an active lifestyle can be called long-term effects. No doubt, both the effects are immense.
