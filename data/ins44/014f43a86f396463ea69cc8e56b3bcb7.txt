AMAZON shopper Carl Harper was stunned when he bought a £569 iPad and a driver delivered a £1 packet of Cadbury cookies instead.
Carl, 43, thought the package felt light when he took it inside and as he opened it he found the packet of biscuits rather than a tablet.

The parish councillor ran back outside but the delivery man had gone so he called Amazon and was told to send the cookies back so they could deal with the mix-up.
