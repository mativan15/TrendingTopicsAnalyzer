May 26 (Reuters) - The world is moving rapidly toward increasing use of digital payments and an official digital version of the U.S. dollar could help safeguard its global dominance as other countries issue their own, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said on Thursday."I don't think we should be taking the global status of the dollar for granted and in a world where other major jurisdictions move to the issuance of their own digital currencies it is important to think about whether the United States would continue have the same type of dominance without also issuing one," she told lawmakers in Congress.
