The remarks by Darren Rodwell, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council, at an event earlier this month, prompted a complaint that the outburst was 'offensive' or at best 'ignorant'.Dressed in an African headpiece and footwear, the councillor, who is white, opened the event by saying 'you might have noticed that I've got the worst tan possible for a Black man'.
