A 'fat-finger error' by a London-based trader at Citigroup that triggered a flash crash across European stock markets could cost the bank at least $50m (£39.8m).The trader was working from home last month when they incorrectly added an extra zero to a trade, Bloomberg reported, quoting 'people familiar with the matter'.That split-second mistake, on the 2 May bank holiday, wreaked havoc on markets across Europe, triggering a sell-off that reportedly wiped out as much as €300bn (£256bn) at one point.
