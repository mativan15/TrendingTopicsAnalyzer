Oct. 15—Jim Pritchett has been coming to Anniston City Council meetings for months.

The tow truck owner has been pleading with city officials to allow his business to be in the rotation of those police call when a vehicle needs to be taken away.

Pritchett's business, known as 102 Towing, used to tow vehicles for the city.

But in November 2021, the City Council amended its requirements for the city's "nonconsensual" towing services — meaning the vehicle's owner didn't call and request the work, but city authorities needed to have it done for reasons of public safety.
