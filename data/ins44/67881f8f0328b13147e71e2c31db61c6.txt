In last week's Survivor strategy column, we successfully avoided not one, but TWO pitfalls that would have knocked us out.

Ultimately, we elected for the Philadelphia Eagles at home against the Dallas Cowboys. That won with ease, but our two other considerations, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the San Francisco 49ers against the Atlanta Falcons, both lost outright.

With that result, we're on to Week 7, which yet again features a number of big favorites. All told, seven teams sit as a six-point or higher favorite with two teams favored by more than a touchdown.
