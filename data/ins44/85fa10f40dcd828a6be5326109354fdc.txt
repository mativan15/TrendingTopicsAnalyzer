Mapletree Industrial Trust ("MIT") dropped to a day's low of S$2.21 per unit today (17th Oct 2022)- setting up a new 52 weeks low record. Forward distribution yield now hovers around 6.2%. I have purchased additional 2,500 units at S$2.24 per unit (totaling S$5.6K ) using my CPF OA investment account. This should leave sufficient headroom of another S$4.5K in CPF OA reserved for any dilutive effects from rights issue. Personally, I think that the essence of the current SREIT market blood bath is whether the US inflation is under control else borrowing rates hikes will be further extended by the Feds well into 2024 which I should elaborate further below:1.
