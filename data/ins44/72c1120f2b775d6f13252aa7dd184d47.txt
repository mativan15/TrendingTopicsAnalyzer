Lester Piggott, who has died aged 86, was one of only a handful of jockeys in British racing history to cross the boundaries of their sport to become a household name.
Piggott rode 4,493 winners in Britain and won 30 English Classics, among them an extraordinary nine victories in the Derby, a record which still stands today. He won eight St Legers; six Oaks; five 2,000 Guineas; and two 1,000 Guineas. He rode 116 winners at Royal Ascot and was champion jockey on 11 occasions – in 1960, in every season from 1964 to 1971, and in 1981 and 1982.
