English French OTTAWA, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Conference Board of Canada's latest Canadian outlook calls for economic output to slow to a near standstill over the next three quarters. Real GDP growth of just 1.2 per cent is forecast for 2023, followed by a modest rebound of 2.7 per cent for 2024. This follows an estimated 3.0 per cent gain in 2022, as remaining pandemic restrictions were lifted and households regained more normal consumption patterns. 'The main forces impacting Canada's economic outlook have been largely unchanged over the past several months, but the crosscurrents have become more intense,' said Ted Mallett, Director, Economic Forecasting at The Conference Board of Canada.
