Fashion and politics have been intertwined since ancient times, when Roman Sumptuary Laws dictated which citizens were allowed to wear what. There have been countless examples of similar statutes in the years since, such as during the French Revolution (1789-1799) when the extravagance of the aristocracy was outlawed. In more recent examples, the US Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) had a dress code asking protesters to wear their Sunday best, while the political organisation the Black Panther Party (1966-1982) adopted black berets and leather jackets.
