When my children were young teens, I used Snapchat to have a window into their online lives (I have never used any other social media, but they have used Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat since they were about 13 or 14). I became really concerned when I saw that getting a high number of likes on a post became outsized affirmation for them. Nothing about what they posted included real-life disappointment and challenges. It's highly curated 'look at how fun my life is!'A thousand friends or followers? This is not real, and it is dangerous to everyone's psyches: impressionable young people and mature adults alike.
