While there might be an opportunity for drama to arise today, we can best steer clear of it by minding our business and staying focused on more productive tasks. Avoiding cliquish behaviour and being respectful of other people's boundaries will also be helpful. However, advocating for ourselves or others in the face of injustice or inequality might also be necessary. On a lighter note, if we're hoping to catch up on work or whittle down our to-do list, the timing is perfect. We can get much accomplished, especially toward the second half of the day.
