Just two years ago, the American Library Association honored Chicago Public Schools librarian Nora Wiltse with an award for her 'courageous efforts' to raise awareness about the effects of district cuts to library and school media positions.Now Wiltse says her own job is in jeopardy. She expects to receive a pink slip Wednesday after 19 years as a CPS librarian, the last 14 at Coonley Elementary. The 900-student school in the North Center neighborhood is one of several in CPS that may cut positions because of budget constraints, even though the district is sitting on more than $1 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds.
