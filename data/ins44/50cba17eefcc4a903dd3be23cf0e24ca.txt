The business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has been accused of launching a 'power grab' as new legislation proposes to hand sweeping control over the energy industry to the government.The government last week introduced the energy prices bill to parliament to formalise the energy price guarantee, Liz Truss's flagship policy to reduce household bills by limiting the cost of electricity and gas for two years.However, the Guardian understands that energy suppliers have raised concerns with the business department that the legislation contains proposals for the government to be able to effectively overrule Ofgem, the sector's independent regulator.
