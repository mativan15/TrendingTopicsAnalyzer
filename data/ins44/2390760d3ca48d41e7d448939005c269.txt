Loitering munitions—sometimes referred to as "kamikaze" or "suicide" drones due to their function of flying into a target to bomb it—have become a new and terrifying facet of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This week, Russia hit Kyiv with Iranian-made suicide drones in attacks largely seen as revenge for Ukraine's recent battlefield successes.

But Russia isn't the only country using these novel weapons. The U.S. has sent Ukraine a good deal of Switchblade suicide drones built by defense contractor AeroVironment.
