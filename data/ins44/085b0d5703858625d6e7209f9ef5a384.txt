Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in The Artisanal Spirits Company plc (LON:ART) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 36%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 0.5%. Artisanal Spirits hasn't been listed for long, so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly, it may still prove itself with time.
