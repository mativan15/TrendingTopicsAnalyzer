Some Ukrainian refugees in Edmonton are approaching their first winter in Alberta and a local church is hoping to help a few families weather the cold. The St. Basil's Aid for Ukrainian Newcomers Committee has been collecting donations, and Tuesday night they sent 16 Ukrainian families shopping for winter gear. "We call it Operation Winter Clothes for Kids," said Kathy Sosnowski, from St. Basil's Ukrainian Catholic Church, adding it's hard to clothe three or four children and fewer winter coats to buy means more money for food and other necessities.
