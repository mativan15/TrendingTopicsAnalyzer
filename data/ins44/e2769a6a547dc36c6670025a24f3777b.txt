The construction tech company Trimble Inc. has moved its headquarters from Sunnyvale to Colorado, but isn't ditching Silicon Valley completely.

Earlier this month, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis personally welcomed the company as it officially designated its office in the northern Denver suburb of Westminster as its new base of operations.

"Trimble has been and will continue being such a strong and dynamic part of Colorado's tech community," Polis said Oct. 6. "We are thrilled that you are deepening your roots in our state with the new headquarters.
