Meanwhile, taxpayers will also have to shoulder the growing burden of gold-plated 'defined benefit' public sector pensions that pay out an inflation-linked guaranteed income for life to millions of state workers. The total bill could rise by £4.5bn if consumer prices increase 10pc in the year to September as expected, according to analysis from Canada Life. 
These pensions are much more generous than the modern money purchase 'defined contribution' pensions held by most private sector workers, who must decide how to turn a pot of cash into an income in retirement.
