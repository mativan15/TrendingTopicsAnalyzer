Washington state's new Highway 99 tunnel lost so much traffic because of work-from-home that toll increases and a bailout by the Legislature are needed to solve a permanent budget shortfall, the state Treasurer's Office predicts.

Project planners couldn't have foreseen that the COVID-19 pandemic would slash toll revenues, which are supposed to cover $200 million in construction debt plus operating costs for the $3.3 billion tunnel and connecting roads.

But in trying to boost revenue, the state's hands will be tied by its own construction of a giant Alaskan Way surface street, which will give drivers more leeway to pass downtown Seattle without paying tolls.
