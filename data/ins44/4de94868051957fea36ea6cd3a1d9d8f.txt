Americans are seeking EU citizenship in greater numbers than ever before, Bloomberg revealed on Wednesday, citing government statistics and independent citizenship consultancies. According to citizenship firm Arton Capital, four times as many Americans are seeking second citizenships in 2022 than in 2020 – a number that doesn't include those applying for third or fourth country passports.True to the country's reputation as a melting pot, some 40% of Americans are eligible for European citizenship, according to Global RCG, a consultancy that helps Americans secure foreign citizenship and residency permits.
