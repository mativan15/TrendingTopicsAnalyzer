At the press conference following Michael Gunner's shock resignation as the Northern Territory's chief minister in May, his future employment prospects were front and centre in the line of questioning."Have you been in negotiations about a future job?" a journalist asked. "No … I can actually rule that out," he said.After six years at the helm, the outgoing NT leader said his "head and heart" were no longer in the role, and he wanted to spend more time raising his two kids. Michael Gunner says he left politics to spend more time with his family.
