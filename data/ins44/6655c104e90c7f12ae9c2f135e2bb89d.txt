The energy and enthusiasm that we've been feeling for the past few days begin to fizzle out. We can expect to feel more contemplative and insular. The focus turns toward our need for comfort and tenderness, rather than work or socializing. Emotions may be heightened at this time. As a result, we might find ourselves turning to things like good food and "bad" TV for respite. Sleeping in might offer some relief, too. On a similar note, spending quality time with those we love can also be a cure for stress or the blues, as is doing something kind for others.
