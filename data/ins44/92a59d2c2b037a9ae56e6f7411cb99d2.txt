Soaring food prices drove UK inflation back into double digits in September, adding to pressure on the government and central bank to act.The Consumer Prices Index rose 10.1% last month from 9.9% the month before, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. That matched a 40-year high reached in July and exceeded economists expectations for 10%.The figures leave inflation well above the Bank of England's 2% target, adding to pressure on policy makers to lift the key rate significantly next month.
