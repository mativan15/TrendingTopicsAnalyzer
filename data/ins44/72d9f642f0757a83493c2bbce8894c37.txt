A Manchester doctor live-streamed himself doing more than 20,000 pushups — a feat meant to not only beat a world record, but to help local animals in need of care.  On Wednesday, Dr. Joseph DeMarco, a chiropractor and former bodybuilder, held a push-up marathon at MAC Fitness in Gloucester. His goal was to beat the current Guinness World Record for push-ups, which is currently set at 20,085 push-ups performed in 12 hours.  The 57-year-old doctor managed to finish 21,008 pushups in 12 hours; he's in communication with the Guinness World Records to update the current record.
