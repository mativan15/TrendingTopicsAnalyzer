As much as €9 billion or 60 per cent of the Government's corporate tax take may be 'temporary', meaning it cannot be counted on in the future, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) has said.In its latest report, the financial watchdog said the Government's over-reliance on volatile and vulnerable corporation tax receipts posed a significant threat to the public finances and needed to be reduced as a matter of urgency.It suggested the Government could unwind this over-reliance by rebuilding the so-called rainy day fund or by paying down debt.
