When Megan Kristie, 25, went on maternity leave with her first child, she wanted to come up with a way to bring in some extra cash. 
Side hustles were the solution, allowing her to earn money while spending time with her family. 
Thanks to that – along with some smart budgeting – the mum has managed to reach a load of savings targets. 
Since September 2021, she has saved more than £5,000, which has helped her reach her goal of £10,000 for a house deposit. 
‘I have always been a saver but have never budgeted,' said Megan.
