The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the Kerala government's petition against the takeover of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport by Adani Enterprises, as per a 50-year concessionaire agreement the company entered into with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). 'Considering the fact that private entity has been in operation since October 2021, we see no reason to entertain the special leave petition. Thus, the appeal stands dismissed,' said a bench of Chief Justice of India Uday Umesh Lalit and justice Bela M Trivedi, rejecting the state's appeal against the October 2020 judgment of the Kerala high court.
