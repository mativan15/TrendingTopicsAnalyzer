It would be ‘crass' to spend public money on Platinum Jubilee celebrations amid the cost of living crisis, Glasgow councillors say. 
The city's council has come under fire over a lack of major events to mark the Queen's 70 year reign this weekend. 
Glasgow's main tribute to Her Majesty will be a Jubilee themed menu at schools and a service of worship at the city's cathedral tomorrow. 
Some criticised the lack of events, but Green councillor Leodhas Massie defended the decision not to throw any big street parties or parades like in other parts of Scotland.
