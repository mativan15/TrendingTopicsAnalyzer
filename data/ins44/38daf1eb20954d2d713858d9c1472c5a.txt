Snap Inc. reported a wider third-quarter loss compared with a year ago as revenue grew slower than expected.

The Santa Monica, California-based company, which operates the photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, on Thursday posted a third-quarter net loss of $360 million, hit by a $155 million restructuring charge due to company layoffs. It had a net loss of $72 million a year earlier.

Revenue for the quarter rose 6% from a year ago to $1.13 billion, but was less than the $1.14 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to CNBC.
