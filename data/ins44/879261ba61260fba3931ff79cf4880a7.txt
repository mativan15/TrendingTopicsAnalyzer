Published: 11:46 EDT, 27 May 2022 | Updated: 12:02 EDT, 27 May 2022 Manchester United are set to make a final push to sign Portuguese midfielder Ruben Neves as they look to bolster their ranks ahead of next season. Erik ten Hag, the new Manchester United boss, is reported to be looking to rebuild the club's midfield with the expected departure of Paul Pogba on a free next month freeing up room for new additions.  Neves' contract with Wolves is until 2024, but the West Midlands club's attempts to renew it appear to have been brushed away.
