The Titans were hoping to get back some injured players this week, and there's some good news and bad news on that front.
Head coach Mike Vrabel revealed on Monday that the players on injured reserve, a list that includes cornerback Elijah Molden, linebacker Chance Campbell and wide receiver Racey McMath, won't be returning this week.
However, Vrabel did leave the door open for the possible returns of players who were ruled out last week, like outside linebacker Bud Dupree, safety Amani Hooker and right guard Nate Davis.
