Allan Coady, who fishes out of Covehead Harbour, says Fiona has devastated the whole community. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)Fishermen on P.E.I. say the federal government's $300-million fund for Atlantic Canada is a good start to recover from post-tropical storm Fiona, but falls far short of what is needed.It will cost millions just to fix the wharf at Covehead Harbour alone, said Allan Coady."It's unbelievable, the damage. It's almost a condemned wharf the way it is right now."Coady said the goal now is to patch the wharf back together as well as they can, so fishermen can get back to work next spring.
