Dozens of leaders in the tech sector have called on lawmakers to take a hard line with the cryptocurrency industry as it increases its influence in Washington. In an open letter on Wednesday, 26 computer scientists, software engineers and academics -- including Harvard computer security expert Bruce Schneier and Google Cloud principal engineer Kelsey Hightower -- urged Congress to "resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists and boosters to create a regulatory safe haven for these risky, flawed and unproven digital financial instruments," The letter was addressed to lead Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as members of the Senate Committee on Banking and the House Financial Services Committee.
