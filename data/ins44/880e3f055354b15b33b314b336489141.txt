From 2h agoPaul KarpThe Liberals' Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, has said that Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has 'serious questions' to answer about her undisclosed relationship with a former bikie boss while she sat on parliament's law enforcement committee.Birmingham told Sky News the conduct 'may well give rise to a privileges investigation and inquiry, and we will be pursuing those in the Senate in next week'.The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, and deputy, Sussan Ley, have gone further in saying she is unfit to sit in parliament – but the significance of a privileges committee referral is that it could result in an investigation about who knew what when and why Thorpe didn't disclose the relationship to the committee or her party leader.
