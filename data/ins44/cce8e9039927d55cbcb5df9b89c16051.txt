(SNAP)By: Niloofer Shaikh, SA News Editor As the macroeconomic environment deteriorated faster than anticipated, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has lowered the revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook last week and expects it to come in below the low end of Q2 2022 guidance range provided on April 21. The company has forecasted a return to 20%-plus revenue growth (between 20-25%) and adjusted EBITDA between break-even and $50M. Vertical Group downgraded Snap to Negative from Buy as near term growth is poised to disappoint.
