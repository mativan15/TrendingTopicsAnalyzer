Those gathered stood quietly, some with their heads down, as Maria Trajkovich read the names of the 19 children and two teachers fatally shot at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.As Trajkovich, a member of the Lake Ridge Educational Foundation, read each name, Bailey and Chloe Patrick, 17-year-old twins and students at the school, hung a photo of the victim on a piece of yarn with a clothing pin.'After reading the names, I got chills. They won't feel that, the chill, the unity,' Trajkovich said.
