Before last week, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Nury Martinez oversaw a mid-San Fernando Valley district facing myriad issues, including homelessness, major transportation plans and the 2028 Olympics.

Now, she's stepped down in the wake of explosive, leaked audio that captured her racist remarks. And speculation has already surfaced about who will run for City Council District 6, which includes Van Nuys, Arleta, Panorama City, Lake Balboa and Sun Valley.

Cindy Montañez, who twice ran unsuccessfully against Martinez for the District 6 seat, told The Times on Sunday that three political consultants were among those who called her last week in the wake of the scandal to see if she would be interested in running.
