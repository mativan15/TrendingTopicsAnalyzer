Earlier this month, a company called HYBE spent US$32 million to acquire another South Korean company called Supertone. Its main asset is some software that it claims can create 'a hyper-realistic and expressive voice that [is not] distinguishable from real humans.'
And it works pretty well. In January 2021, Supertone revealed its Singing Voice Synthesis technology.The big party trick was to present Kim Kwang-seok, a Korean folk superstar who sold millions of records at home, singing a new brand new song.
