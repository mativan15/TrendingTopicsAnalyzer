'Any vaccine development takes 8-10 years, but in the case of Covid-19, it was delivered in 9 months. However, we need to ensure that there is one global pandemic treaty so that in the event of future pandemics, capacities are raised,'Rajinder Suri, CEO of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturing Network (DCVMN), a network of more than 40 vaccine manufacturers and spread across all WHO regions said. 
Talking at the sidelines of the 23rd annual general meeting of the DCVMN held in Pune, Suri told The Indian Express that they had contributed 8 billion Covid vaccine doses, which is 60 per cent of the global volume of vaccine production in 20 months.
