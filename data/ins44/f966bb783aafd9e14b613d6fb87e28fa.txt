At the end of 2019, 14.1 million of the 34.1 million federally held student loans that should have been getting paid were either in default, deferment, or forbearance, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System. And that doesn't count any of the loans in an income-driven repayment plan requiring $0 payment (because the borrower doesn't make enough money). That's millions more, according to estimates. 
 
Advocates for wiping out a portion of everyone's student loan balance point to these numbers as evidence the student loan system is broken.
