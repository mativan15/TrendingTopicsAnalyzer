President Biden on Wednesday said he was not personally aware of the severity of the infant formula shortage until early April, months into the shutdown of a manufacturing plant operated by Abbott Nutrition and subsequent recall of its products.
'I became aware of this problem sometime in early April, about how intense it was. We did everything in our power from that point on,' Biden said during a White House roundtable with formula manufacturers. 
'I don't think anyone anticipated the impact of the shutdown of one facility,' Biden added.
