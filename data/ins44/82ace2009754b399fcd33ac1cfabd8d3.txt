SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on Sunday called for swift measures to resume all services offered by Kakao Corp and Naver Corp, a day after a fire at a data centre damaged their servers and caused outages.

Service disruptions, some of which continued into Sunday, hit some of the country's most-used apps and websites, including Kakao messenger and the company's online payment, gaming and music streaming services.

The outages highlighted how reliant South Korea is on Kakao messenger, which is the default form of communication for many government and business services.
