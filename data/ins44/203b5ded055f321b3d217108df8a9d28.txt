OTTAWA— Ottawa will introduce legislation by the end of next year to ban the use of replacement workers in federally regulated businesses, Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan said Wednesday.

O'Regan said the government would start the process by consulting with employers and unions on developing the legislation.

'Anti-scab' legislation has been a long-standing objective of the federal New Democratic Party, and introducing a law to ban it was one of the conditions of the agreement under which the NDP has agreed to support the minority Liberal government until June 2025.
