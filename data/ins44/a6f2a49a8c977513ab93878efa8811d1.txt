It appears that the Pac-12 conference is doing what it can in order to get as many eyes on the Oregon Ducks as possible.

This week, after putting No. 9 Oregon's bout with the No. 10 UCLA Bruins at 12:30 p.m. kick on FOX — a game that will draw ESPN's College GameDay to Eugene — the Ducks are getting another mid-day kick next week against the California Golden Bears, again on FOX.

This will be the fourth time this season that Oregon will appear on FOX, and should make a lot of fans, and media members, happy that the game will not hear the final whistle come late at night, as we've seen with some Pac-12 games that draw few eyeballs starting as late as 11 p.
