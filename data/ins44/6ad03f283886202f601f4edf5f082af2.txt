Hello everyone, well if you want to learn about storytelling you are the right place. I really wanted to learn storytelling in general. I don't have any intention to become a professional storyteller but I wanted to use this skill in teaching or during public speaking to make the impact more effective.Anyways, I found this course on frontrow — A bangalore based ed-tech startup in India, which mostly makes courses related to the creative field. I saw an ad on instagram that they are selling a storytelling course by zakir khan (who is a very famous standup comedian and has a lot of standup specials and has written few shows for an OTT platform).
