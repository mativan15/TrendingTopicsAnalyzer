Readers hoping to buy WPP plc (LON:WPP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. In other words, investors can purchase WPP's shares before the 9th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of July.
