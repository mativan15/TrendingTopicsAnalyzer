Last week, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) created a new occupation in Beijing: "bridge keepers".After a protester unfurled a banner on a busy overpass criticising Chinese President Xi Jinping and his key policies, the government recruited dozens of people overnight for the new roles."Strike to remove the dictatorial traitor Xi Jinping, stand up the people who do not want to be slaves," the banner read.In the capital city under strict surveillance, it was a rare expression of opposition from ordinary Chinese people, and one of the most vocal examples of dissent since the infamous Tiananmen Square massacre.
