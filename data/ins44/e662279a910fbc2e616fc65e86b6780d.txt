The Kentucky State Police conducted a traffic stop on Oct. 10, which resulted in the charge and arrest of Michigan man and Washington woman for trafficking illegal narcotics, including heroin.

Diquan King, of Detroit, was pulled over by KSP after failing to make a complete stop at a traffic sign when turning on to US 25. He had a female passenger in the vehicle with him at the time of the incident.

According to an arrest citation, when the officer approached King's vehicle, he immediately detected the odor of marijuana and observed a black handgun beside the King's right hand.
