National Grid will hand households £3 per kilowatt hour instead of the originally planned 52p if they avoid activities that use up high amounts of electricity, such as cooking or using the washing machine, during periods of high demand in peak hours. The scheme, drawn up by National Grid ESO, is aimed at alleviating pressure on the UK power grids this winter as fears of a potential energy shortage continue to grow. Russia has already slashed gas deliveries to Europe travelling through major pipelines, but the Kremlin has issued fresh warnings, claiming it will not hesitate to make the continent "freeze" this winter.
