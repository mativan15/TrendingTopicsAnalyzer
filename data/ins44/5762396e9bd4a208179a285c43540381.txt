SIR – Faced with the need to cut billions from public spending, can it really still be worth splashing billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on HS2 (Letters, October 4)?
Allowing for inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics the cost of HS2 will be £155.52 billion. Phase 2b alone is going to involve eye-watering amounts of extra funding to cross the most challenging geology of the entire stretch. The total cost of the Integrated Rail Plan – including much of HS2 – was forecast at £96.
