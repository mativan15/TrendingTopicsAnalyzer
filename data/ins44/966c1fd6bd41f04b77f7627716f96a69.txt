Schedule would have Longhorns open league with Arkansas, close with Texas A&M

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – A theoretical 2025 Texas football schedule posted by Kyle Umlang, cohost of the Statistically Speaking Podcast, not only features a road trip to Arkansas to kick off the Longhorns' SEC history, it gives Texas fans a clear idea what the conference move will mean for their team.

While it's theoretical, the first two games on the schedule are legitimate non-conference games that are already slated.

While this is a schedule similar to what SEC teams face each year minus dropping Vanderbilt to have room to schedule a weak non-conference opponent between Alabama and LSU to heal up before closing the season, it's jarring to think of Texas trying to make the run even for those of us who have covered the league for a long time.
