India's ranking at 107 in the Global Hunger Index is part of a consistent effort to taint the country's image as 'a nation that does not fulfil the food security and nutritional requirements of its population', the Centre said on Saturday and added the index suffers from serious methodological issues and is 'erroneous measure of hunger'.
The Women and Child Development Ministry, in a statement, said the matter was taken up with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) not to use such estimates based on FIES (Food Insecurity Experience Scale) survey module data in July 2022 as the statistical output of the same will not be based on merit.
