Just Stop Oil has sparked nationwide outrage over the last few days following a selection of high-profile protests. Public backlash from a stunt that saw activists pour canned soup on a Van Gogh painting has endured after others climbed the Queen Elizabeth II bridge in Dartford, forcing authorities to close the throughway to traffic. Speaking to Express.co.uk today after another day of action, the organisation refused to back down, and other eco groups are preparing to follow suit.Just Stop Oil's campaign will continue for the remainder of the month, with events planned until October 30.
