Continental Resources announced Monday it has agreed to company Chairman Harold Hamm's $4.3 billion offer to take the energy company private.

Hamm will acquire Continental Resources' outstanding 58 million shares for $74.28 each, bringing the energy and production company full circle, returning it to the same ownership status it held when Hamm, who originally started the operation as the Shelly Dean Oil Company, created the business in Enid in 1967.

A release issued by the company before markets opened Monday stated Hamm's bid price includes 28 cents per share to compensate owners for a third-quarter dividend they would otherwise receive if the company were to remain public.
