I didn't like the mini-budget. I reject its policies and philosophy. But even though I'm on the populist wing of conservatism, I resent what's been done to Liz Truss and regret this 'very British coup'. Any Tory who welcomes it is a fool.
Reputationally, the Conservatives are sunk. Labour will win the next election; Brexit is imperilled. Hitherto the argument against Brexit was emotional, but watch as it becomes technocratic: 'in light of our political and economic turmoil', the grey men will say, 'it's not something we can afford.
