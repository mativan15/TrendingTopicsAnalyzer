'Branded' is a new weekly column devoted to the intersection of marketing, business, design, and culture.Honest Tea founder Seth Goldman described it as a 'gut punch.' This week, the Coca-Cola Co. announced it is killing the brand he created back in 1998. That's quite a twist in a story that had long seemed like a case study in how a mission-driven brand built around ethical principles—organic ingredients, Fair Trade Certified partners—could capture a changing consumer zeitgeist, connect with an audience, and go big.
