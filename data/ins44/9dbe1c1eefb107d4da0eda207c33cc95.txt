People living in direct provision centres and who are working full-time may be charged rent or fees under new proposals due to be considered by the Government as part of an attempt to find space for Ukrainian refugees.A group of senior officials will next week finalise a list of options in relation to how the State will manage the humanitarian crisis in the longer term and this paper will be discussed at a Cabinet committee on Monday, October 24th. Two senior Government sources have confirmed that Ministers will also consider whether Ukrainian refugees should contribute towards monthly bills in pledged accommodation and if social welfare supports should be time limited.
