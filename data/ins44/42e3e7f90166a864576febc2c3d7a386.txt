New Zealand's main opposition National Party doesn't want the government to reappoint Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr for another five-year term, preferring a 12-month extension until after the 2023 election.

That would mean the next governor could be appointed by a new government rather than by the current administration, National Party Leader Christopher Luxon suggested in an interview with NewstalkZB radio on Tuesday. Orr's first term expires in March 2023.
