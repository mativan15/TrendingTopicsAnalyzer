The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked Texas from enforcing its new social media law that intended to prevent digital censorship by directing platforms with more than 50 million active users to not discriminate against Texans' viewpoints. In a 5-4 vote, the justices granted the tech industries emergency request to overturn a federal appeals court that allowed the Texas no-censorship law to take effect. The law took aim at prominent platforms including Twitter and Facebook, barring them from blocking or demoting posts.
