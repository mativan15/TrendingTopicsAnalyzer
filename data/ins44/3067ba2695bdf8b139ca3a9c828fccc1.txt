Infosys has allowed employees to take up ‘gig' jobs on the side with prior consent of managers provided such an engagement does not compete with the company, its clients or pose conflict of interest.
The company, in an internal communication to employees, detailed how staff can take up ‘gig' work.
Analysts say, the move may help the company to address some attrition challenges, since it allows employees to take up additional source of earnings, and chase their tech passion, albeit with firm riders.
