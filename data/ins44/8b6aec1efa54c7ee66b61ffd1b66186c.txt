Climate tech is an emerging industry that budding entrepreneurs should definitely keep an eye on. And not just because they can solve urgent environmental issues — they can also generate profit.
I spoke with Aaron Cohen, co-founder of Therma, which has managed to do exactly that.
The US-based company has developed a sensor for commercial refrigerators (in restaurants, schools, convenience stores, etc), which monitors the temperature and humidity levels in real-time.
That way, manual checks can be replaced by automated alerts and reports via the respective app, protecting the inventory 24/7 from equipment failures, power outages, and human error.
