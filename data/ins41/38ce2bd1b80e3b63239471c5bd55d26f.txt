He has been out walking in the harsh sun over the last 40 days as part of his Bharat Jodo Yatra, but Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says he does not use any sunscreen. Gandhi says this in a video, 'What's up, Yatris?', put up on YouTube by the Congress social media team which shows him sharing a banter with fellow yatris at a camp somewhere in Karnataka.

"My mom (Congress president Sonia Gandhi) has sent it, but I have not been using it," Gandhi replies when asked which sunscreen he uses. When the others persisted, he pulled up his his sleeve to show them the contrast in the skin tone.
