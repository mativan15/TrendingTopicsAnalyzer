Paul Merson has warned Chelsea that they may fall down the same route as Manchester United have with the Glazer family once Todd Boehly is finally announced as the Blues' new owner - whilst also being warned off a move for Raheem Sterling due to their different style of play to Manchester City.Current owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned back in February due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. With multiple embargoes placed upon the Blues, a new owner has been imperative to their future if they are to continue to compete at the top of the Premier League.
