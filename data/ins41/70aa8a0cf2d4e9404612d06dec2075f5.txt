NEW DELHI: Led by capex revival, strong domestic demand and expectations around peaking of Fed's rate hike cycle, investors are hopeful that the domestic stock market will bounce back with a bang by next Diwali which marks the beginning of the Hindu calendar year Vikram Samvat. While Sensex has lost around 3.5% since last Diwali, a survey by ETMarkets shows that market participants believe that the Sensex can not just touch record high but also cross the 70,000 mark by next Diwali. The highest target for Nifty goes up to 22,000.
