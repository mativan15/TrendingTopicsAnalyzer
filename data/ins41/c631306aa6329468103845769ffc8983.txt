At least four people were killed and another 61 injured when a fire broke out at Iran's Evin prison, known for housing political prisoners and infamous for its human rights abuses, the country's judiciary said Sunday.

Iranian authorities alleged the fire, which started Saturday evening, was extinguished hours later and that no prisoners had escaped.
