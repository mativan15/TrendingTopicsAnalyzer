A Bluff chef says increasing costs and regulations around the use of local kaimoana is preventing indigenous ingredients being used in restaurants. Haylee Simeon said restaurants wanted to use as much locally caught and foraged kai as possible, but costs were creeping up and people would soon simply not be able to afford it. Under MPI fishing laws, recreational fishers are allowed to catch up to 10 pāua and up to 50 kina per day. But to use the products in her meals at her restaurant, Simeon says she is paying suppliers about $125 for a kilo of pāua and about $35 for a punnet of kina.
