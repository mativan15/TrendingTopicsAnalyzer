'Logan is a very lonely man driven by one idea, and his Achilles heel is that he loves his children,' Cox says. 'If he didn't love them, he could carry on in his mercenary ways, but it doesn't work. It just exacerbates the situation. It is easy to describe [the characters] as monstrous, but they are also victims of a society and a value system. Even though it is brilliant satire, there's a tragic element to them, too.'
The series has been a critical hit and won truckloads of awards. Nevertheless, all of his exposure to extreme wealth since Succession began has clearly weighed on Cox's mind.
