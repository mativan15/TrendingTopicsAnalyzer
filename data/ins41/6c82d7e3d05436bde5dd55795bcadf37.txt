Randall Cobb's 2022 season isn't over, but the Green Bay Packers are still expecting the veteran slot receiver to miss a few upcoming games after he injured his ankle in the second half of Sunday's loss to the New York Jets.

Coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that Cobb avoided what was originally feared: a season-ending injury.

'Yeah, it's not going to be a one-week deal or anything like that, he's going to miss some time, but he definitely avoided a serious injury,' LaFleur said Monday.

The broadcast showed Cobb with a towel draped over his head as he left the field on a cart on Sunday, clearly emotional about the potential of his season being over.
