stockcam Thesis Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) crashed as much as 27% following a worse than expected Q3 2022 report. And no surprise: investors needed to stomach lots of negativity, including slowing topline growth, widening operating losses and a depressed outlook for digital advertising. But did markets overreact? I do not think so. Although Snap stock is now down more than 90% from all time highs, the valuation is not yet necessarily cheap. Investors should consider that SNAP is still trading at x3.5 EV/Sales and around x45 EV/EBITDA.
