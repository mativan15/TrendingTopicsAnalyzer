Washington Capitals forward Evgeny Kuznetsov has been suspended one game for high-sticking Vancouver Canucks defenseman Kyle Burroughs during Monday's matchup between the two teams.

The incident occurred late in the second period after Kuznetsov drove to the net, colliding with Burroughs as he moved across the crease. Kuznetsov was knocked to the ice, then swung his stick at Burroughs' face once he got back on his feet.
