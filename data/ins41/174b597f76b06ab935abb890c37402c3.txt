It's an unfortunate fact of birth, forever being referred to as the son of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. But perhaps Euan Blair's latest achievement rather takes the edge off: by ignoring his famous father's education policy, the 38-year-old is now not only three times richer than his dad, with an estimated fortune of £160m compared to his father's reported £44m, but now also owns a grander house. By quite a way. According to reports, the Yale graduate and former Morgan Stanley banker has just bought and moved into a £22m, five-storey townhouse in west London, featuring an 'iceberg basement' with a swimming pool, 50-foot reception room and a lift for his fleet of expensive cars.
