Fans who have wanted to see former starter Taylor Heinicke back under center for the Washington Commanders are closer to having that wish granted.

Carson Wentz has a fractured ring finger on his throwing hand and will visit a specialist in Los Angeles on Monday to determine the next steps for the injury, putting Heinicke in line to start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers — and possibly more — if Wentz has to miss time.

Heinicke did a commendable job as Washington 's starter last season — and the offense actually ranked better statistically — but make no mistake: Wentz's injury complicates what has already been a messy season for the Commanders (2-4).
