Laying foundation stones for several development projects in Junagarh on Wednesday, Prime Ninister Narendra Modi said, "any progress made by anyone anywhere in the country is a matter of pride for everyone across the country, however, some people with perverted mind do not like it whenever something good happens for Gujarat or a Gujarati achieves something. They insult Gujarat and abuse Gujarati people." Modi further said: "Don't you think time has come to teach a lesson to those who abuse and insult Gujarat and its people day and night?" Earlier in the day, he had launched Mission Schools of Excellence at Trimandir, Adalaj, where he had stressed upon the importance of education in one's mother tongue.
