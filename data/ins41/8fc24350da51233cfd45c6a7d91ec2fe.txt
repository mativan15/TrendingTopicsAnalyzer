Adidas said its partnership with Kanye West was "under review" nearly two weeks ago after the rapper and designer posted a series of social media attacks against the apparel company.

Since then, West has only fueled more controversy, including over antisemitic statements. In light of the growing backlash against West, what will it take for Adidas to cut ties with its Yeezy brand partner?

Shannon Berg, founder and CEO of a Portland-based crisis communications firm Berg Associates, said Adidas is likely evaluating its financial, operational and legal options right now.
