Ron DeSantis has punished the Tampa Bay Rays for speaking out about gun violence by blocking $35m in state funding for a new training facility, a report says.The Florida governor made the move after the team called for action in the wake of mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, a source told CNN.Mr DeSantis used his powers to veto the money for a sports training and youth tournament in Pasco County, which officials hoped would have been used by the MLB team.Following the Texas massacre in which a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school, the team donated $50,000 to the Everytown for Gun Safety groups.
