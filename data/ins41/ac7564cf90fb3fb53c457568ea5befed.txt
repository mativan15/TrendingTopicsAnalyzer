Leo Varadkar also questioned whether Sinn Fein is using legal threats as a strategy to stifle debate, echoing similar comments by the Taoiseach at the weekend.

'I know of at least three Fine Gael elected representatives who received legal letters from Sinn Fein figures,' Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin on Monday.
