It's a pretty undercovered stock that has fallen from highs of $99.27 late last year to just above $25 at the time of writing this article. Apart from the current market situation of rising rates, a large reason for the selloff was also the fact that the company did not meet analysts' expectations in Q1 2022, which saw the price of the stock tank over 30% in April 2022.
