I was happy to vote with the Government in opposing Labour's windfall tax plans when they put them to Parliament. Ministers were right to say then that windfall taxes make the UK a less attractive place for business to invest. They introduce a more unpredictable element into planning long-term business investment. It is particularly strange to single out the production of oil and gas from domestic sources for such a tax. After all, surely the Government wants to cut carbon dioxide output which we do by collecting and using our gas instead of importing foreign gas in LNG tankers.
