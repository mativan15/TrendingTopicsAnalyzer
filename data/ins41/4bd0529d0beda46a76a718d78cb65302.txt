Washington: Canadian gun sellers are running out of weapons after a surge in demand in the run-up to a proposed ban by Justin Trudeau.

The prime minister announced plans for a freeze on handgun sales after a mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas in which 21 people, including 19 children, were killed.

The bill, which still needs to pass through parliament, would outlaw buying, selling, transferring and importing short-barrelled firearms.
