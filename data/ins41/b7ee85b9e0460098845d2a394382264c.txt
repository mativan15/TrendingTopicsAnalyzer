The Bihar government on Monday filed a petition before the Patna High Court seeking a review of the recent order that declared as "illegal" reservations for Other Backward Classes and Extremely Backward Classes in urban local body (ULB) polls. The state's Advocate General Lalit Kishor said the petition has been listed for hearing on October 19. The court, vide its judgement on October 4, had also ruled that the elections, which were due this month, could be held only after re-notifying the reserved seats as general category.
