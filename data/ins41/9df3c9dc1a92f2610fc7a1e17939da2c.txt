The telecom regulator will shortly examine whether operators are complying with its September 2021 directive that barred telcos and their channel partners from making any differential tariff offers to attract customers through the mobile number portability (MNP) route, a senior official said. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will also check whether telcos are offering tariffs that have not been filed with the regulator, and which may be construed as discriminatory and in contravention of the rules around pricing, the official told ET, requesting not to be named.
