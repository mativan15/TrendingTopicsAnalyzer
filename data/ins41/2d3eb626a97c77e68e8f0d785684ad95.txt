1654066235Brent crude futures are sharply lower at $115 a barrel, having risen earlier in the week after the EU banned Russian oil and China reopened key cities following Covid lockdowns.Last night's 6% decline came after the Wall Street Journal reported that Opec+ is planning to exempt Russia's sanctions-hit output from its production calculations.This would then allow other members to pump additional supplies in order to meet the oil cartel's monthly quotas.
