Nordstern Capital, an investment management firm, published its first-quarter 2022 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. In its 2022 first-quarter letter, the fund emphasized that valuation is important, that prices will climb and shortages will worsen until inflation beneficiaries are rewarded by profits high enough to attract additional investment. Additionally, the fund mentioned that any ideal investment is priced cheaply in relation to the present value of its future cash flows, and the future cash flows should be benefitting from inflation and should be antifragile in a recession.
