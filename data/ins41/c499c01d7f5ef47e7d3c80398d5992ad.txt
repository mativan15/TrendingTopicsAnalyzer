Sea Limited's (SE -3.76%) first-quarter earnings report on May 17 allayed some concerns about the Singapore-based tech giant's future. Its revenue rose 64% year over year to $2.9 billion, which beat analysts' expectations by $40 million. Its adjusted net loss widened from $320 million to $445 million, or $0.80 per share, but still topped estimates by $0.60.
I reviewed Sea's earnings report last month and concluded that its stock would remain cheaply valued (at about three times this year's sales) until it meaningfully narrowed its net losses.
