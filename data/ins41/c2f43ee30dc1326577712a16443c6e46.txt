The former veterans minister says Liz Truss laughed at him while she sacked him, as he accused the prime minister of breaking her word and pushing him into depression.
Johnny Mercer says the PM promised during her leadership campaign that the veterans' affair brief would not be downgraded under her government.
But the Plymouth Moor MP says that as soon as Ms Truss took office, she fired him and folded his post into the defence minister's role.
He added that the exchange – in which he claims the PM was looking at the floor and giggling – badly hit his mental health.
