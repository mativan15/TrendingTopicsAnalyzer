(Bloomberg) -- Laurentian Bank of Canada advanced the most in more than a year after a surge in commercial lending helped fiscal second-quarter profit top analysts' estimates and signaled that the firm's turnaround is proceeding ahead of pace.

The shares climbed as much as 8.8% to C$42.02 in Toronto on Wednesday, the biggest intraday gain since March 2021. The Montreal-based bank is up about 4% this year, the best performance in the eight-company S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.

Chief Executive Officer Rania Llewellyn, who took the reins in October 2020, has been cutting costs and working to streamline and modernize operations with additions like its first mobile app.
