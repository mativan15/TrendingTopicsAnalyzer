Twilio is at an inflection point, and that could be bad news for investors in the short term, according to Barclays. Analyst Ryan MacWilliams downgraded the communications software stock to equal weight, saying that a slowdown in the digital economy means Twilio may need to tighten its belt at the expense of growth, especially in its lower margin international businesses. "This could create the possibility of deceleration in consolidated organic revenue growth, and we believe shares could see near-term pressure if TWLO embarks on this higher profitability, lower growth path forward," wrote MacWilliams, who previously rated Twilio overweight.
