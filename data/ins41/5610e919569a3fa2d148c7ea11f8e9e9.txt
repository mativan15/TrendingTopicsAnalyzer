It's a digital offer they couldn't refuse.
A trio of fintech brothers aim to take their beloved but often-mocked borough out of the landfill and into the future of cryptocurrencies and NFTs by creating the Staten Island metaverse, a virtual environment where they hope to gain money, respect and power.
The metaverse is shaping up to be a bare-bones recreation of the island with some notable landmarks including the Staten Island Ferry and the Snug Harbor Chinese Garden, but the most anticipated property is the home of a fictional Mafia don.
