LJUBLJANA, Slovenia — Voters in Slovenia are preparing to choose a new president in a weekend election that is seen as a test for the European Union nation's liberal government, which took power from populists six months ago amid a soaring crisis fueled by the war in Ukraine.

Opinion polls ahead of Sunday's balloting suggested no candidate will receive more than half of the vote, the threshold needed for an immediate triumph. In that case, a runoff election will take place three weeks later.

Seven candidates are running, but only three are considered serious contenders for the presidency.
