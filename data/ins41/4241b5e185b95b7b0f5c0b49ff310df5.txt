Online dating is hard, especially if you're one of the most well-known singers in the world. That's what Camila Cabello found out when she jumped back into the dating pool after calling it quits with boyfriend of two years Shawn Mendes last year, and now she's revealing the message that made her quit a dating app within a day. The "Bam Bam" singer opened up about her experience on a dating app while visiting The Drew Barrymore Show on Tuesday (October 18), telling the host that she was on the app for 24 hours before she left it completely.
