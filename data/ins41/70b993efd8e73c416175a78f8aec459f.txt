The words of Steven Gerrard that followed Liverpool's Champions League final defeat against Real Madrid in 2018 will be ringing in the players' ears on Saturday as they attempt to exact revenge on the La Liga giants. The Reds legend pointed out three areas for improvement after their 3-1 defeat in Kyiv, but it seems those problems have been resolved four years on.Goalkeeper Loris Karius was mostly at fault for the defeat after two catastrophic errors that led to goals for Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, although there was nothing he could do to stop the Welshman's incredible bicycle kick.
