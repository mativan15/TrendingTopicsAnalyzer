Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company Meta, has announced that she is leaving the business after 14 years.

Ms Sandberg announced her departure in a Facebook post, saying she hoped to focus on her foundation and philanthropic work going forward.

Her departure comes as Meta faces a slowdown in advertising sales and more competition from rivals such as TikTok.

Ms Sandberg is one of the most high-profile women in the tech industry.

"When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years," she wrote.
