By Jaime Llinares Taboada Caspian Sunrise PLC said Monday that the main impact on its business from sanctions against Russia remains the discount at which its oil is traded. The company operates in Kazakhstan, though its production is referenced to Russia's Urals oil benchmark, which has recently traded at a $30-$35 a barrel discount to Brent, representing a significant loss in revenue. However, Caspian said this discount is likely to decrease as natural market arbitrage takes effect and some Asian countries are expected to take advantage and switch their purchases to Urals oil.
