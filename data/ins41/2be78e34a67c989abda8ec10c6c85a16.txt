Well if not, you might want to reconsider since that penny could be worth a lot more than one cent, and if it is from before 1982, it is definitely worth more than its a cent. It turns out all pennies with a date of 1981 or earlier were made from nearly pure copper, which means they are actually worth three times their face value - three cents. That probably isn't too impressive, but that's just the start. There are many pre-1982 pennies out there that are valued at way, way more than three cents.
