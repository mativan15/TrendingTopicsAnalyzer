BJP pitting a third candidate for the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra has led to allegations of horse trading from the Shiv Sena. There are six Rajya Sabha seats, with the Congress and NCP having numbers to send one each, while the BJP has enough MLAs to send two. The Shiv Sena has the numbers to send one candidate to the Rajya Sabha. However, it needs 30 more votes from its allies and other independents to ensure its second candidate is elected. The BJP has made the election interesting by putting forth a third candidate -- Dhananjay Mahadik.
