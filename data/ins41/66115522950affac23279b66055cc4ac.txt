By Australian Associated Press Published: 22:15 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 00:15 EDT, 3 June 2022 The cashless welfare card has failed to prove it has helped in reducing social harm, a scathing report from the auditor-general has revealed. The Department of Social Services also failed to implement previous recommendations for evaluating the program and undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. Auditor-General Grant Hehir said in the report, tabled in parliament, the government had not "demonstrated that the cashless debit card program is meeting its intended objectives".
