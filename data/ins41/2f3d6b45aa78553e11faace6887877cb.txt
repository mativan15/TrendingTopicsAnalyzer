When my husband and I purchased our first home, it was all about price. We needed something we could afford. The house we bought wasn't in a great neighborhood and it was small enough to clean by spinning around a couple of times, but I loved it because it was ours.By the time we purchased the house we are currently moving out of, we were in a different position. We had enough money to be choosy. It isn't huge, but the house we ended up buying is custom-built and has loads of neat architectural details.
