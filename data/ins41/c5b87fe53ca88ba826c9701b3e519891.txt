Andrii Yalanskyi/iStock via Getty Images Introduction I've been long Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) since 2014, with an average cost of $25.6 per share and a current yield on cost at 5.9%. The total return has been fairly good, coming in at 126%, on par with the S&P 500, which it outperformed for a long period, until the middle of 2020. The downtrend in performance coincides with my increasing impatience with management as the financials have deteriorated slowly but surely in the last couple of years.
