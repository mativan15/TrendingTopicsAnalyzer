The pound has edged a little higher against the dollar in early Asia trading, following PM Liz Truss's partial reversal of her initial economic plan.It had fallen to a record low against the dollar at the end of September, after the short-lived then chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled the biggest programme of tax cuts for 50 years.
Mr Kwarteng's downfall, after just 38 days in the job, not only pushed the pound to almost parity with the dollar, but sent the cost of government borrowing and mortgage rates up and led to an unprecedented intervention by the Bank of England (BoE).
