Conservative lawmakers and commentators have called for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to be fired or resign after she admitted in an interview Tuesday evening that she was 'wrong … about the path that inflation would take' — as annual price increases reach levels not seen in 40 years. 
During a sitdown with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Yellen was played a clip from March 2021, when she told ABC's 'This Week': 'Is there a risk of inflation? I think there's a small risk, and I think it's manageable.'
In a second clip, from May of that year, Yellen said: 'I don't anticipate that inflation is going to be a problem, but it is something that we're watching very carefully' during an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal.
