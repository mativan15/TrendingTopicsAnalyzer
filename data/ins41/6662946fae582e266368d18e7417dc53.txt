The recent price decline of 10% in ECO Animal Health Group plc's (LON:EAH) stock may have disappointed insiders who bought UK£306k worth of shares at an average price of UK£1.46 in the past 12 months. Insiders purchase with the hope of seeing their investments increase in value over time. However, due to recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth UK£223k, which is not great.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
