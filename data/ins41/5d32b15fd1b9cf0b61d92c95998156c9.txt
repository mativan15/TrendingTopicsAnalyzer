No other foundation day (October 17) of the AIADMK would have generated as much anxiety among the party members and sympathisers as the event this year. When founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa were alive, the AIADMK went through trying times. But the leaders' charisma and ability to reach out to different parties and stitch coalitions, coupled with other factors, helped the party cope with the difficulties. But, with no charismatic leader at the top and with little possibility of reunion of all those who have moved out of its fold, the party, which suffered successive electoral setbacks, is facing its toughest challenge in the last 50 years.
