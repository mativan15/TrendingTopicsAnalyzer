No matter what year it is, May 29th (5/29) is always 529 Day — a holiday of sorts meant to celebrate and encourage the use of 529 college savings plans. With that in mind, many states and plan administrators offer extra incentives to get consumers to use their plans on this date. These incentives can include matching funds for opening a 529 plan and adding money as well as 529 plan-inspired sweepstakes and contests. If you haven't started saving for college yet but you would love to dive in as soon as you can, you may be wondering whether a 529 plan is right for you.
