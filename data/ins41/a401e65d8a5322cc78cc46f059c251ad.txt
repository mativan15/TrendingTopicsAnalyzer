ST. CLOUD — Several St. Cloud-area state races will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, with candidates including both incumbents and newcomers.

In the State Senate 14 race, five-term State Rep. Tama Theis will take on incumbent Aric Putnam, who was first elected in 2020. In that race, Putnam beat popular Sen. Jerry Relph, who later died from COVID-19.

With Theis running for a Senate seat, there's no incumbent in the House 14A race. Republican Bernie Perryman will take on Democrat Tami Calhoun, who unsuccessfully ran for the seat against Theis two years ago.
