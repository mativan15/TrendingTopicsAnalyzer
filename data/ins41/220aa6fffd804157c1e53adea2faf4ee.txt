In terms of being a game changer, this week's US Women's Open fits the bill to a tee. With a $10million (£7.9m) purse, the Pine Needles tournament highlights that the game is indeed changing, as inroads are at last made into the outrageous deficit between prize money on the male and female circuits.
It says so much about the US Golf Association's' decision to hike the purse by almost 80 per cent from last year's $5.5million (£4.4m) bounty that it dominates the narrative going into the major despite so many other intoxicating themes.
