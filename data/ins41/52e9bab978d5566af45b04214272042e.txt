'Deterioration in market conditions, a bloated cost structure, and high cash burn' are causing Wedbush analysts to foresee a darker future for used car dealer Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA). The Analyst Seth Basham downgraded Carvana's rating from Outperform to Neutral while lowering its 12-month price target from $50 to $15. The Tempe, Arizona-based company will likely execute a capital raise or a real-estate sale in the coming months to compensate for an upcoming lack of cash.
