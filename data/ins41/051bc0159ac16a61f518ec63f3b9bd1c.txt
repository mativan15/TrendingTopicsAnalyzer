In his new memoir, 'Islander: My Life in Music and Beyond,' Chris Blackwell looks back on an unmatched career in the music business. Written with Paul Morley, the book recounts Blackwell's boyhood growing up between Jamaica and London, crossing paths with the likes of Ian Fleming, Noel Coward, and Errol Flynn. His early success, however, began with a rebellion: After being expelled from an elite British school for bad behavior in 1954, at age 17, Blackwell moved back to Jamaica, and within five years, had founded Island Records.
