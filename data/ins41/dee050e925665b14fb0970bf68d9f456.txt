Snap (SNAP -3.77%) shareholders trailed the market this week as the stock fell 4% through Thursday trading compared to a 0.5% increase in the S&P 500, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The drop added to significant losses for the social media platform's shares, which are down roughly 50% so far in 2022.
The decline was powered by increasing concerns from investors about a tougher selling environment in the online advertising business.
