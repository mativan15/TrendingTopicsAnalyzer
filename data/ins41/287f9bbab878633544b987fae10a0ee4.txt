October 19, 2022 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time NASSAU, Bahamas & GREAT EXUMA, Bahamas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In an unprecedented step for Web 3.0 and real estate, AGIA International Ltd officially announced today that it plans to sell 60 ultra-luxurious pavilions and villas to be built atop the Bahamas' Great Exuma Island via a series of upcoming non-fungible token (NFT) mints on the Ethereum blockchain.



Set to be the only community strictly sold via NFTs, AGIA International's development is radically recreating land used by the infamous Fyre Festival in 2017.
