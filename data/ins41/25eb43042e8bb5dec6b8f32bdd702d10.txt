Technology companies led a broad rally for stocks on Friday as Wall Street notched its best week in 18 months. The gain broke a seven-week losing streak for the market, the longest such stretch since 2001.

The S&P 500 rose 2.5 per cent and finished 6.6 per cent higher for the week, its best weekly gain since November 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 3.3 per cent. It sets up the Australian sharemarket to rise sharply on Monday, with futures pointing to a gain of 83 points, or 1.
