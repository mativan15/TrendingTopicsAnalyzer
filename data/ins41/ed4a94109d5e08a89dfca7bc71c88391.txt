Britain's railways are going nowhere.Literally, that is the case, as I found to my cost this week. I was due to speak at a conference near St Paul's in London. I left home in ample time, caught the train to Waterloo and then, between Barnes Bridge and Barnes, we stopped.Eventually, the loudspeaker crackled into life and the guard said there was a problem ahead with a level crossing. At least, we thought that's what he said because his voice was barely audible.
