An unassuming seaside town in Portugal is in the midst of a major glow-up, and a new wave of deep-pocketed surfers could be why.

Located on the west coast of the country, Ericeira offers five miles of prime shoreline with outstanding beaches that have long attracted surfers. After it was named a World Surfing Reserve by Save the Waves in 2011, the fishing village slowly but surely grew more popular among travelers. New surf schools and yoga studios began popping up. Ericeira even started hosting surf competitions on the pro circuit.
