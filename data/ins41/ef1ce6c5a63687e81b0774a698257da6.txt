Shares of American Eagle Outfitters have cratered 48.3% this year, and further downside is in store, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Kimberly Greenberger downgraded the retail stock to underweight from equal weight, citing risks to margins and sales. Greenberger also slashed her price target on American Eagle to $8 per share from $22, implying downside of nearly 39%. "Our analysis suggests heightened risk to topline growth at both AE & aerie, and significant risk to 2022 margins & EPS, that put even management's lowered 2022 financial targets out of reach," Greenberger said in a note Tuesday.
