BRIT fighter pilots are being offered £240,000 salaries by China to train enemy top guns, intelligence sources have warned. 
At least 30 former UK Armed Forces pilots are already betraying Britain by working with troops in China to help ramp up the country's military capabilities and tactics.

Headhunting of both serving and former UK pilots has been "consistent and widespread" since the end of 2019, a Western official said.
