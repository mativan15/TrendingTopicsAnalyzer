Brian Cashman finally sprung into action on March 13.
After months of offseason inactivity due to the MLB lockout, the Yankees general manager pulled off a trade that he later said 'settled a lot of business,' landing Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa — along with catcher Ben Rortvedt — from the Twins in exchange for Gary Sanchez and Gio Urshela.
The Yankees believed the blockbuster trade allowed them to get better at three positions in the infield, as well as behind the plate. At the time, the Yankees had not yet acquired catcher Jose Trevino from the Rangers (for practically nothing, as it turned out).
