LOVE ISLAND is back!
And this year will be just as interesting as the previous six editions. The contestants going into the villa to start have been revealed by ITV with the show getting underway shortly.
And Betfair have priced up Tasha Gouri, the show's first-ever deaf contestant, as the favourite to win it at 2/1.
She heads Michael Owen's daughter Gemma at 5/2 and Indiyah Polack at 6/1 on the female side.
Luca Bish is 5/2 favourite of the men ahead of Liam Llewellyn at 3/1.
Punters can get odds of 50/1 on either member of the winning couple to steal the £50,000 cash prize, something which is yet to happen on the show.
