Internet freedom in India has improved marginally. According to US government-funded NGO Freedom House, internet freedom in India improved by two points - reaching 51 in global rankings.Freedom House said on Tuesday that the score also reflects the reduced frequency and intensity of internet shutdowns in India."Internet freedom in India marginally improved over the last year, following four years of decline, as efforts to bridge the country's digital divides expanded access to the internet. While the government continues to impose internet shutdowns, they have reduced in their frequency and intensity," Freedom on The Net 2022 said.
