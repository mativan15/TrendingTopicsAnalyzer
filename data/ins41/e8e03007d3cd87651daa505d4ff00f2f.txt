ZAMBOANGA CITY – The Office of the Ombudsman has dismissed
charges filed by a veteran radioman in 2019 against Mayor Maria Isabelle (Beng Climaco) Salazar for violating the Code of Conduct and Ethical standards for Public
Officials and Employees. Rey Bayoging, president of eMedia Production Network, Inc.,
filed the charges after he failed to secure a business permit from the local
government. eMedia is engaged in the business of advertising, promotion, radio
and television production. And since 2013, is the exclusive program and content
provider and blocktimer of Westwind Broadcasting Corp.
