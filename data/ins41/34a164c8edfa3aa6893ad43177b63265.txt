Jang Won-young of K-pop girl group IVE attended the FRED Gala Dinner in Paris last month and received praise from Korean netizens for her traditional hairpin, but backlash from some Chinese media.

In a video from Vogue Korea, Won-young explains her full outfit before highlighting the accessory, saying, 'Today's outfit goes so well with updo hairstyle. We styled each element together. I also put on this hairpin to show the look of Korea in Paris. How does it look? I did my best to bring this friend from Korea.
