'I have strong opinions … And I stick to those views, not till I feel vindicated, until I am vindicated on the facts, as I have been on almost every point,' Cotton said when asked if he feels redeemed by his steadfast views. 'It's not a matter of ‘I feel vindicated.' It's a matter that I have been vindicated.'
Cotton doesn't say 'no' when asked if he's planning to run for president in 2024. And for a party still reeling from the peripatetic ideology of Donald Trump, Cotton could offer a predictable alternative: He builds few bridges to Democrats and isn't afraid of clobbering Republicans, either.
