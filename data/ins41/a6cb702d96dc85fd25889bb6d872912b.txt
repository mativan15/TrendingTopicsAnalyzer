By Michelle Toh and Wayne Chang, CNN BusinessCNN — "Top Gun: Maverick" is now showing Taiwan's official flag after outcry, putting its release in mainland China in jeopardy.
The box office mega-hit — which is by far Tom Cruise's biggest-ever commercial debut — now features his character sporting the flag on his iconic bomber jacket, including in the version shown in Taiwan.
Initially, the film's trailer in 2019 had shown otherwise. During the preview, the patches on Cruise's jacket, which originally bore flags that represent Taiwan and Japan, appeared to have been swapped out and replaced with two ambiguous symbols in the same color scheme.
