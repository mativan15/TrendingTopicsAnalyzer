ReutersSonia Gandhi and Rahul GandhiThe Congress on Wednesday tried to put up a brave face in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summons to party president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul in the National Herald Case-AJL-Young India "money laundering" case, calling it a "fake case", part of "political vendetta" by the ruling establishment and its effort to "divert public attention" from livelihood issues and vowed to fight it legally and politically. While the lawyers have sought more time for Rahul by citing he would take a few more days to return to India, Sonia Gandhi would appear before the ED on June 8.
