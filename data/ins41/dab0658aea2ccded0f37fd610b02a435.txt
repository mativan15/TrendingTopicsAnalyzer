RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) has opposed the ban announced by many state governments, including Delhi, on firecrackers during Diwali calling it 'unscientific' and saying that it was aimed at 'hurting sentiments'. The organisation has argued that earlier, pollution was caused due to Chinese firecrackers, which have been banned, and Indian firecrackers do not cause much pollution.
'Swadeshi Jagaran Manch strongly opposes a complete ban on firecrackers by Government of NCT of Delhi, during the festival of Diwali, which is inappropriate, aimed at hurting the sentiments, apart from causing a blow to the employment of millions of workers and others engaged in the production and distribution of firecrackers in the country,' SJM convener Ashwani Mahajan said.
