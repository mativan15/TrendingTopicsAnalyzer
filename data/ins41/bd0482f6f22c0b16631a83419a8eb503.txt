Elon Musk is aiming for a "wide release" of Tesla's long-awaited full self-driving (FSD) beta for all Tesla owners by the end of this year—"probably a month from now," he said during a Wednesday Q3 earnings call.

He also said anyone who buys a new Tesla going forward will have access to FSD, as long as they can cough up the extra $15,000 it costs to receive it via a vehicle software update.

"The safety we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is significantly improved over when it is not, which is a key criteria to releasing the beta," Musk said on the call.
