England suffered the first setback of their tour of Australia on Monday when Reece Topley tripped on the boundary advertising cushions at the Gabba during a fielding drill and turned an ankle, making him a serious doubt for the T20 World Cup opener against Afghanistan on Saturday.The 28-year-old wore a protective boot on his left foot as he left Brisbane with the rest of the squad on Monday morning to travel to Perth, where they play their opening game. He will be closely monitored over the next couple of days, with no training scheduled until Thursday.
