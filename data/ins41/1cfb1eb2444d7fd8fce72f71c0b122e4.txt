By Reuters Published: 15:19 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 15:19 EDT, 19 October 2022 ACCRA, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Streets were quiet in the normally bustling heart of Accra's central business district on Wednesday as traders in the Ghanaian capital closed their shops to protest worsening economic conditions. The Ghanaian cedi plummeted to a new low of 12.3 to the dollar on Wednesday, compared to 10.5 last week, as inflation surges despite repeated rate hikes by the central bank. Ghana's government is in the process of negotiating a support package with the International Monetary Fund, but some merchants say that help is not coming fast enough.
