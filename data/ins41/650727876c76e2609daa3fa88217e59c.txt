Rapper Kanye West, who is now legally known as Ye, could be in control of the right-wing social media network Parler by the end of the year.The move comes after Ye's Twitter and Instagram accounts were suspended over anti-Semitic posts.When Parler announced the proposed sale to users, it did so by failing to blind copy them according to entrepreneur Adam Ryan who tweeted: "Now hundreds of people are replying and everyone has access to the personal emails of many verified users and Parler investors".
