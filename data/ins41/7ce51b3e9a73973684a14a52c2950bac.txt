Okta (OKTA 10.39%) shareholders beat the market on Thursday as the stock gained 11% by 3 p.m. ET, compared with a 1.4% rally in the S&P 500. The surge erased just a small piece of the software company's recent losses, and shares remain lower by over 50% so far in 2022.
It was powered by rising optimism in the tech industry, but also by hope from investors that Okta will have good things to say in its upcoming quarterly report.
