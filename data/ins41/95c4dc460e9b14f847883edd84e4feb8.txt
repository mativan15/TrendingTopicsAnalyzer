Since I posted this question formerly in the 'Quant SubReddit', which may have had biased answers, though I believe them to be founded, have merit and be true.

But in all fairness, I felt it only equal to ask the question in this ethereum trader SubReddit.Long story short, I was debating between buying one whole ethereum token, or investing that money into buying more Quant. At this time there was some information I was not privy too: such as that ethereum is theoretically unlimited, and it's previous ATH was less than 5K.So with the scarcity, utility and greater profit potential, I chose to get some more Quant. Thoughts??
