The Deer Lake Boy Scout Reservation in Killingworth, Conn., sits empty, Wednesday, May 11, 2022. The camp is among many nationwide being sold by local councils as membership dwindles and the organization raises money to pay sexual abuse victims as part of a bankruptcy settlement. Conservationists, government officials and others are scrambling to find ways to preserve them as open space. (AP Photo/Pat Eaton-Robb)
