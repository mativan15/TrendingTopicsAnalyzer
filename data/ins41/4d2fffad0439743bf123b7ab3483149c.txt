A government watchdog warns New York is suffering from another outbreak — not of COVID, but emergency orders from Gov. Kathy Hochul.
In its new report, Reinvent Albany charges that the Hochul-controlled orders are rife with opportunities for 'waste, fraud and abuse of state funds' amid allegations of pay-to-play schemes with campaign donors.
'The Digital Gadgets COVID test [deal] … That purchase was allowed because the comptroller didn't get to look at that contract,' Reinvent Albany's Rachel Fauss said, citing a no-bid, $637 million contract inked by a New Jersey company tied to $300,000 in campaign cash to Hochul.
