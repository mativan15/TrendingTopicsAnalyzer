Melissa Gorga is giving new insight into BravoCon 2022's biggest off-stage drama.

In a video leaked on Oct. 16, The Real Housewives of New Jersey star Jennifer Aydin was seen throwing a drink in the direction of her co-star Melissa and her husband Joe Gorga in a hotel lobby. Now, Melissa shared her side of what really went down on the Oct. 20 episode of her Melissa Gorga On Display podcast.

"I had the fans at BravoCon, for the first two days, coming up to me, telling me I had another cast member that was basically bashing me," she said on the podcast, noting that the co-star was not her sister-in-law Teresa Giudice.
