Sam (played by James Hooton) has been having money troubles on Emmerdale recently, with the father of one resorting to poaching from Home Farm for food. However, just as he gets himself a job, Lydia (Karen Blick) has told him she would like a caravan so they can go travelling around the country and have holidays away from the village. Lucikly for him, Vinny Dingle (Bradley Johnson) offered him a solution to all his problems by finding him a motorhome at the scrapyard. Unfortunately, his wife's reaction isn't what he'd expected in upcoming scenes on the ITV soap and it could lead him to take drastic action.
