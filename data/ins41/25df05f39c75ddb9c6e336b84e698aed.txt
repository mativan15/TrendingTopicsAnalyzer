It's well known that the meltdown in the market for home mortgages wrecked the economy in 2007 and '08, but what caused the meltdown? Too many layers of middlemen, argues Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University. And Judge says the same phenomenon explains massive recalls of tainted ground beef, the erosion of American manufacturing, and why the supply chain for everything from furniture to electronics is out of whack today.In her new book, 'Direct: The Rise of the Middleman Economy and the Power of Going to the Source,' Judge makes the case that having too much separation between buyers and producers makes markets fragile and overly opaque to consumers and regulators.
