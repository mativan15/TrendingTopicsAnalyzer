What have been the key highlights of the assembly meeting today? Can you share details of the decisions taken or proposals approved?Most importantly we approved proposals for the risk management facility that will enable investments to flow into countries, particularly in Africa, where investments have not been flowing. The Assembly agreed to create this facility. Another proposal was about creation of entrepreneurs in Africa through a competitive programme and we recognise up to 20 entrepreneurs who are provided with finance in our partnerships with WAIPA, technology through our partnership with AMDA and GOGLA.
