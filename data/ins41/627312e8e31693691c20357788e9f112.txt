Federal authorities filed lawsuits Tuesday against six vape companies, including one in Columbus, that alleges the businesses or associated individuals illegally manufactured and sold electronic nicotine delivery system products.

'Today's enforcement actions represent a significant step for the Food and Drug Administration in preventing tobacco product manufacturers from violating the law,' said Brian King, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.

The lawsuit filed by the U.S. government alleges that the companies manufactured and sold 'electronic nicotine delivery system products' without seeking FDA authorization.
