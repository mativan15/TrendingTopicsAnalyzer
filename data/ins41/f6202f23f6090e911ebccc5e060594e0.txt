After having his antisemitic content deleted on Instagram and Twitter, Ye appears to be looking for a place where anything goes.

Kanye West says he's buying Parler, the right-wing social media app that bills itself as an 'uncancelable free speech platform' and known for its lax moderation policies. The move comes a little more than a week after Instagram restricted West, who legally changed his name to Ye, on the platform and Twitter locked him out of his account.
