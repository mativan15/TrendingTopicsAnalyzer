Accusing the BJP government at the Centre of misusing probe agencies and constitutional institutions, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday said he was perhaps the only person in the country who, as an accused (of holding an office of profit), was pleading at every possible forum to make public his crime public as well as grant him punishment at the earliest.In his first detailed interaction with reporters ever since he was caught in a string of controversies, including allegations of corruption, earlier this year, the chief minister said it's the responsibility of the authorities concerned that anyone guilty of illegality should not be holding a constitutional post and it seems 'he was being punished by not making the decision (on ECI recommendation related to his mining lease) public'.
