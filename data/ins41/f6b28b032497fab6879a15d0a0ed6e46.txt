The UK is considering guaranteeing at least $1bn (R15.5bn) of SA debt as part of a deal designed to cut the nation's reliance on coal and drive a shift to green energy.Further negotiations are taking place on how the guarantee will work, with some of it to apply to debt provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB), said people familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified as the talks aren't public. The guarantee is part of a larger $8.5bn funding package proposed by the UK, the US, Germany, France and the EU.
