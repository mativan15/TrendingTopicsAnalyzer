The Chinese Communist Party is holding its 20th congress this week in Beijing to choose a new leadership and set out policy parameters for the next five years. Two thousand delegates representing some 100 million members will endorse Xi Jinping as general secretary and military leader, elect 200 members of the central committee and witness the selection of 25 politburo members and seven members of the party's most powerful standing committee. A prime minister, government and president will be appointed next March.
