Alphabet (GOOG 1.10%) (GOOGL 1.29%) and Amazon.com (AMZN 4.40%) knew exactly how to fire up investors earlier this year. Both tech giants announced 20-for-1 stock splits a few months ago -- Alphabet in February and Amazon in March. And both stocks jumped after the news.
Amazon's stock split will happen first, with trading on a split-adjusted basis expected to begin on June 6, 2022. Alphabet's stock split should be done soon afterward on July 15. But which stock is the better buy ahead of its stock split?
