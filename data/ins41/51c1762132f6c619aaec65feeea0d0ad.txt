The Jacksonville Jaguars are now on a streak of 11 consecutive quarters without forcing a turnover after beginning the year with nine takeaways in their first 13 quarters played.

The lack of big plays on defense has taken its toll on the team, forcing the Jaguars offense to consistently drive the length of the field for points, and keeping the defense on the field for extended periods. For the fourth team this season, the Jaguars lost a game by one score.

Jacksonville's Week 7 opponent, the New York Giants, haven't had the same issue.
