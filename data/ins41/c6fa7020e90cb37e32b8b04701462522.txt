Margrethe Vestager, who spearheaded the European Commission's pursuit of the Apple tax case, has expressed her hope that the appeal will be successful, saying it is 'not nice' to lose.Europe's second-highest court ruled in 2020 that Ireland did not give Apple illegal state aid, overturning a previous European Commission decision that the tech giant owed Revenue €13.1 billion in back taxes.The Irish Government and Apple had both appealed the commission's original 2016 ruling in the Luxembourg-based General Court.
