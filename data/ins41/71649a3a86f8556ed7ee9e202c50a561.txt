The sound of fiddles, guitars and other instruments were heard across Cape Breton this past week, as the Celtic Colours International Festival returned to the island for the first time in two years. 'Nine days, 48 concerts, 200 community events. There's something going on in every community around Cape Breton Island,' said Celtic Colours CEO Leanne Birmingham-Beddow. Post-tropical storm Fiona's fury and path of destruction nearly derailed plans for the event this year, but organizers and community volunteers pushed through -- and it's both music and money to their ears.
