A recent school board meeting at which about 1,000 people gathered in Dearborn, Michigan, to pressure district officials to censor books with LGBTQ+ themes was in most ways similar to hundreds of other recent book ban hearings across the US.Speakers alleged the books 'promote mental health issues' and 'self harm', while the school district and liberals were seeking to 'indoctrinate children'. Gay people, they said, were 'creeps and pedohiles', and gay lifestyles were equated with zoophilia.'American values and the American way is not child pornography,' one angry parent told the Dearborn public school board.
