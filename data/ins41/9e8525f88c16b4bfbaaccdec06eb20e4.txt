Investing.com -- ASML (AS:ASML) stock rose in early trading on Wednesday after the Dutch-based lithographer said it won't be badly affected by the latest U.S. restrictions on sales of silicon chips to China.

"Based on our initial assessment, the new restrictions do not amend the rules governing lithography equipment shipped by ASML out of the Netherlands and we expect the direct impact on ASML's overall 2023 shipment plan to be limited, ASML's president and chief executive officer Peter Wennink said in a statement.
