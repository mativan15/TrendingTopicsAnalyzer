Elon Musk has a penchant for the letter 'X.' He calls his son with the singer Grimes, whose actual name is a collection of letters and symbols, 'X.' He named the company he created to buy Twitter 'X Holdings.' His rocket company is, naturally, SpaceX.
Now he also apparently intends to morph Twitter into an 'everything app' he calls X.For months, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has expressed interest in creating his own version of China's WeChat _ a 'super app' that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments _ for the rest of the world.
