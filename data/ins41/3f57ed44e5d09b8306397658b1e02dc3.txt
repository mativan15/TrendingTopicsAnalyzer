The group of oil-producing nations known as OPEC Plus agreed on Thursday to a larger increase in supply than planned for July and August.The higher output was hailed by the White House as a diplomatic breakthrough after months of lobbying Middle East oil giants to raise production to ease price pressures. But the amount of added crude was unlikely to cause gasoline prices to fall. In fact, the price of oil rose after the meeting.After a videoconference, the group said it would raise production by 648,000 barrels a day in July and then again in August, an increase of about 50 percent over the monthly rise set under a program last year.
