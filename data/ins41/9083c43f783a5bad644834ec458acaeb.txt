As the NFC East has established itself as the dominant early-season division in the league with a 12-3 record outside its confines, the biggest internal test has arrived. The Dallas Cowboys, led by Dan Quinn's defense and directed by backup QB Cooper Rush has traveled east to take on the Eagles of Philadelphia. Undefeated, the Eagles found their first bit of depth test last week and barely escaped with a 20-17 victory over Arizona, who missed a last second field goal.

They enjoy the NFC's best point differential (+47, tied with 49ers), but Dallas is next up (+21) and has faced a tougher schedule.
