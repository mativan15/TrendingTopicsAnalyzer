Collider.com For Saturday Night Live's Season 48, Grammy Award-winner Megan Thee Stallion served as this season's first host and musical guest combo and is only the second woman rapper to do so since Queen Latifah in 2004. The powerhouse followed the previous week's host, actor Brendan Gleeson promoting his upcoming film The Banshees of Inisherin, and musical performer Willow, with her own one-woman show. In a move not unusual for the singer-songwriter, Megan opened up the show with a monologue that not only introduced herself and her recent accomplishments but highlighted important issues.
