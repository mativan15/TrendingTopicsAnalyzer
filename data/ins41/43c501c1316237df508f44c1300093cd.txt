LONDON — Britain is getting a crash course this fall in two things that are uniquely American — Reaganism and televangelism — in an upbeat new musical based on the life of Tammy Faye Bakker, the garishly dressed gospel singer who, with her husband Jim Bakker, brought God into millions of U.S. homes in the 1970s and 1980s.

'Tammy Faye,' which runs at the Almeida Theater through Dec. 3, has been in the works for roughly a decade. About five years into the process, and after Elton John and the Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears wrote the music and lyrics for the show, they brought on James Graham to write the book, shaping the story and characters.
