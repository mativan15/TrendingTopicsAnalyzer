Marilyn (Emily Symons) has had her world turned upside down since newcomer Heather (Sofia Nolan) arrived and took a disturbing interest in her. The fascination soon turns sinister as Heather takes photos of Marilyn and asks the locals questions about her.
The situation only escalates when Heather sneaks into Marilyn's house in the middle of the night. Marilyn is sleeping on the couch, and Heather sets her up with a near-empty bottle of wine, a glass and a photo of a baby. What is she up to?
The next morning, Marilyn is left in shock – and unable to defend herself when Roo (Georgie Parker) comes downstairs, assesses the situation and offers her water and painkillers for her ‘hangover'.
