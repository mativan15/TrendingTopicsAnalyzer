Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the region's hospitality and tourism sector has been hit especially hard.

But according to new research from the American Hotels and Lodging Association, Pittsburgh's hotel industry may be seeing some signs of recovery by year's end.

The research, which consists of analysis by Kalibri Labs, compares projected 2022 hotel revenue for both leisure and business travel to revenue in 2019. For Pittsburgh, hotel revenue for leisure travel is projected to be even higher than it was in 2019, though the research notes that the projections are not adjusted for inflation and that real hotel recovery is expected to continue for several more years.
