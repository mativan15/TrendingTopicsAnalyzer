(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories said on Friday it was recalling some ready-to-feed baby formula liquid products including Similac-branded items due to inadequate sealing of some bottle caps. The recall, which equates to less than one day's worth of infant formula used in the United States, is not expected to impact the overall formula supply, Abbott said in a statement. Abbott has been at the center of a baby formula shortage in the United States that earlier this year sent parent scrambling for supplies.
