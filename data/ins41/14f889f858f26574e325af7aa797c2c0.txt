I can put up with a certain amount of inconsistency, muddle-headedness and even hypocrisy in politics. As the American poet Walt Whitman wrote: 'Do I contradict myself?/ Very well then I contradict myself,/ (I am large, I contain multitudes.)'But I draw the line when pundits self-righteously demand more action on net zero while at the same time complaining of 'fuel poverty'. I bridle when lobbyists rage against the Australia and New Zealand trade deals because they will 'flood' us with 'cheap food', and then have the nerve to moan about 'food poverty'.
