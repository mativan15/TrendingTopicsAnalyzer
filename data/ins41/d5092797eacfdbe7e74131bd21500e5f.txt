WhatsApp Payment users in India, here's an important update for you. The instant messaging app has started identifying "legal" names of users who have enabled the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) based payments feature on its app. These are the names that are there in users' bank accounts and so may be different from their profile names. "When you use payments on WhatsApp, other UPI users will be able to view your legal name. This is the same name on your bank account," says WhatsApp on its FAQ page.
