A California eye doctor has said an elderly patient who came in complaining of blurry vision ended up having 23 disposable contact lenses in her eye. 'To this day, she herself does not understand how it took place,' Dr Katerina Kurteeva, a Newport Beach ophthalmologist, told a local TV news channel. 'She's still baffled by it all.'
