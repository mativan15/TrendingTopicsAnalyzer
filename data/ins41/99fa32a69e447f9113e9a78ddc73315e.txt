Dame Deborah James has joked that she can't die over the Jubilee weekend because the limelight would be stolen by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
The 40-year-old You Me And The Big C and campaigner revealed last month that she is receiving end-of-life care at her family home in Surrey.
She was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016 and began documenting her journey with treatments on social media, which led to a huge following.
‘I'm determined not to die over the Jubilee weekend, I don't want Meghan stealing my thunder,' Dame Deborah quipped.
