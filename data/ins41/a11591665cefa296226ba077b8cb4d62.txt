The 2022-23 Raptors look a lot like the 2021-22 Raptors, the key additions being currently injured veteran wing Otto Porter Jr. and rookie centre Christian Koloko.

Team officials are banking on internal growth and improvement along with increased chemistry and cohesion to build on a team that won 48 games last season but one that didn't get out of the first round of the playoffs.

The 15-man roster, plus the two-way players:

Fred VanVleet

Vital stats: Six-foot-one, 197 pounds, 28 years old.

Dollar sign: $21.
