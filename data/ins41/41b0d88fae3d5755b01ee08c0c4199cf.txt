The ninth episode of the House of the Dragon affirmed Mysaria as the White Worm or the spymaster. It shows that Mysaria is much more powerful than we thought earlier. Mysaria is not just a worker in brothels, after all. In the original books, Mysariais known as Lady Misery and the White Worm due to her bloated appearance and pale complexion due to her age. However, the name seems like a code in House of the Dragon to keep her identity a secret. We first heard about the White Worm in the fourth episode when it came to light that Daemon and Rhaenyra were together in a brothel.
