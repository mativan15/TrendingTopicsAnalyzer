Sydney: Australia's biggest carbon emitter AGL abruptly announced the departure of its chairman, CEO and a string of board members Monday, while scrapping a long-planned move to spin off its lucrative coal business.In a statement to investors, the company said Peter Botten would resign as chairman and Graeme Hunt would step down as CEO when a replacement is found.Operations at AGL -- Australia's largest energy company -- have been under fierce scrutiny since billionaire green activist Mike Cannon-Brookes tried to buy the firm for about US$6 billion.
