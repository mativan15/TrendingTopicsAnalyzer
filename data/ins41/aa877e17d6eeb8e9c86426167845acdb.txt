naphtalina/iStock via Getty Images Baird has downgraded drugs savings platform GoodRx Holdings (NASDAQ:GDRX) on Wednesday to Hold from Outperform, citing its dispute with a retailer that led the management to lower the company's revenue estimates for this year and the second quarter last month. The analysts led by Vikram Kesavabhotla argue that the retailer in question was Kroger (KR) which, according to them, continues to work with other platforms to offer drug discounts, while GoodRx (GDRX) essentially shows retail prices for its stores.
