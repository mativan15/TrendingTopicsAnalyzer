Students taking a special class at an Edmonton high school are learning how to run professional sports broadcasts. In what originally began as a way to share athletics at Strathcona High School with the broader community, a massive video operation is giving students the chance to learn about and work on live productions showcasing volleyball and basketball games and tournaments. The media club was first offered in 2016 when students put together video recaps of sports matches. That then grew into a class offering high school credits for students to learn the different aspects of live media production.
