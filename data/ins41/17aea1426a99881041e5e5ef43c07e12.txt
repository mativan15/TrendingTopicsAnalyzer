METZ, France, June 01, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agoraverse, previously known as the Lofts Business Club, an NFT project based on the Solana platform, has scheduled the distribution of their $AGORA tokens for Friday, June 3, 2022. The Agoraverse team highlights the fact that the token will be a bridge between blockchain-related and real-life utilities. The $AGORA token will be used as a shopping currency within the Agora, a pioneering Web 3.0 shopping metaverse currently under development. Oscar Bellei, CEO of Agora said, "Obviously the main utility for the token will come out when we release the shopping center, but the token is an active part of our ecosystem and will enable multiple blockchain features such as the mint of a new NFT collection, the upgrade of our Lofts Access Cards amongst other things.
