Published: 17:31 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 17:40 EDT, 15 October 2022 A little under a year since Mark Zuckerberg rechristened Facebook as Meta, internal documents have revealed that his Metaverse virtual reality universe is struggling to meet its goals. That's according to documents that were seen by the Wall Street Journal. The company planned to hit 500,000 users of its virtual reality platform, Horizon Worlds, by the end of 2022. The number at the time of writing is less than 200,000, still well below a revised goal of 280,000 by the end of 2022.
