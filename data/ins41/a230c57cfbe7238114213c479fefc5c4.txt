When Paul Rouleau kicked off the inquiry into the federal government's use of the Emergencies Act, he warned against allowing the proceedings to become "adversarial.""I recognize that different points of view will be forcefully advanced. This is to be expected. It is important, however, that at all times disagreement be respectful," Rouleau said, adding that he would "actively control the proceedings."As the head of the inquiry into the federal government's use of emergency powers in response to the anti-COVID-19 vaccine mandate protest that gridlocked parts of downtown Ottawa this past winter, the Ontario Court of Appeal justice will be the public face of what could be a polarizing and politically tense six weeks.
