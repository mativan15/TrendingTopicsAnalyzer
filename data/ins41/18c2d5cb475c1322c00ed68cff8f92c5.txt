(NASDAQ:ENPH), the stock had risen by 14.96% from $173.05 on 9 March to $198.93 on 3 June 2022. It is evident that the company demonstrated stellar execution in FQ1'22 and provided excellent FQ2'22 guidance, despite the ongoing supply chain issues. In addition, with ENPH's entry into the EV charging market, we anticipate a vast potential for adoption and growth in the future, given that the EVs still constitute the minority in comparison to ICE vehicles.
