It's a good week for Novavax.

The Gaithersburg vaccine maker has earned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation to make its protein-based shot available as a booster to adults in the U.S., the last hurdle required before people can use it beyond a primary series.

The CDC said late Wednesday that its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, greenlit the decision — which gives initially vaccinated adults the choice to get Novavax's jab as a booster instead of the updated Omicron-specific shots from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.
