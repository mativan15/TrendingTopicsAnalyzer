By Australian Associated Press Published: 19:06 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 21:06 EDT, 20 October 2022 Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek hopes new funding measures for the Great Barrier Reef will turn around the health of the natural wonder. The government has announced $1.2 billion will be spent on the reef in the upcoming budget. The previous coalition government had pledged to spend $1 billion on the reef, but Labor has committed to an extra $200 million. The additional funds will help to address gaps in long-term sustainability plans and speed up protection activities.
