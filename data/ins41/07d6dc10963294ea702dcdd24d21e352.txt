The Houston Astros embark on their sixth consecutive ALCS appearance tonight as they host a well-travelled New York Yankees squad in Game 1.

The pregame narrative: A pair of rainouts in the Yankees/Guardians' ALDS matchup forced New York to begin this series without any rest days. Houston, on the other hand, hasn't played since Saturday's 18-inning marathon clincher against the Mariners.

Here are our Yankees vs. Astros picks for Game 1 of the ALCS on October 19.

Odds as of 12:50 p.m. ET on 10/19/2022.
