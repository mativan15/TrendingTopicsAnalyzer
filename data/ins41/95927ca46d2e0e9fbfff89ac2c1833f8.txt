Tory rebels are plotting with Labour to bring fresh humiliation on Liz Truss today. Sir Keir Starmer's party will this afternoon force a vote in the House of Commons which looks to derail the Prime Minister's plans for fracking.If a majority of MPs back the Labour motion it would force the Government to have a binding vote on whether fracking should be allowed to go ahead.Many Tory MPs were left furious last month when ministers announced plans to lift the moratorium on shale gas extraction.The Conservative manifesto at the last election promised fracking would not take place until more research had been carried out.
