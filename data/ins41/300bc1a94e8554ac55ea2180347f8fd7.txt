Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger reportedly confirmed to employees on Thursday that layoffs are coming and promised more details on Nov. 1.

He delivered the news in a video address to staff, according to The Oregonian, about a week after Bloomberg reported that cuts at the Santa Clara chip giant could involve thousands of its employees.

"These are always hard decisions, but our costs are too high and our margins are too low. We have to take actions to address them," the Oregonian reported that Gelsinger said on Thursday.
