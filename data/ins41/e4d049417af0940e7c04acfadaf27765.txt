In recent years Bielinski Homes, one of the largest area home builders according to Milwaukee Business Journal research, has been increasingly focused on ranch-style duplex condominiums, a product it says particularly appeals to baby boomers.

That type of housing now accounts for about 30% of the company's business, up from around 20% five years ago, Bielinski Homes CEO Paul Bielinski estimated.

Unlike multi-story condo buildings common in cities, the ranch-style condos Bielinski and other local home builders are focused on look a lot like single-family houses or duplexes, except they provide services including lawn care and snow removal that residents pay for through a condo association.
