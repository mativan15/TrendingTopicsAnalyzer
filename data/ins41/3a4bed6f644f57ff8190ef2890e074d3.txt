A Minnesota-based development firm recently bought a 55-acre plot of land in Lebanon where they plan to develop 59 homes, Wilson County records show.

Tamarack Land Development bought the property for $1.27 million earlier this month. Calls to the company were not immediately returned.

The community, which planning documents refer to by its address – 1920 Coles Ferry Pike – is zoned for single-family detached homes.

The property sits near the intersection of Hartmann Drive and Coles Ferry Pike, and is one of several residential projects planned for the area.
