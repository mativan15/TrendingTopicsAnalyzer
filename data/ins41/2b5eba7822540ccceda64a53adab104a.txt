The post A Timeline of Kanye West's Antisemitism appeared first on Consequence.

Kanye West has gone off the rails once again. After publicly feuding with Gap and Adidas all summer over his dissatisfactory partnerships with the companies, he kicked off October by wearing a 'White Lives Matter' sweater at a surprise Yeezy fashion show.

The message received strong pushback from many celebrities, including Diddy. West made their heated exchange public by posting screenshots of their texts on Instagram, including one message in which he implied Diddy is controlled by Jews.
