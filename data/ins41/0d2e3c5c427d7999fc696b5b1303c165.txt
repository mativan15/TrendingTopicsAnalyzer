Former Big Brother contestant turned TV host Alison Hammond is petitioning to be crowned presenter of the iconic reality show if it does come back to air. For weeks, speculation has swirled that ITV have bought the rights to revive the long-running reality show which aired for 18 years from 2000 until 2018 and spawned a number of spin-offs including celebrity versions and companion shows and are planning to bring it back in 2023. Alison, 47, was a contestant on season three of the show back in 2002 – featuring alongside Kate Lawler and the late Jade Goody and survived 15 days on the show before she was voted off.
