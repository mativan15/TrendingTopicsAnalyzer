Published: 20:58 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 20:58 EDT, 31 May 2022 Two-time major champion Dustin Johnson intends to play in the debut tournament of the LIV Golf Invitational Series next month in London, according to the field that LIV released Tuesday night. Johnson, 37, was the biggest previously-unreported name in the field, which does not include Phil Mickelson. The circuit, seen as a potential rival to the PGA Tour, became controversial for accepting financing from Saudi backers. Other notable names in the field include Englishmen Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Richard Bland, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, Kevin Na, Talor Gooch, Germany's Marin Kaymer and South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace.
