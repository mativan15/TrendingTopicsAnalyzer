Alexey_Lesik Golden Ocean Group Limited (NASDAQ:GOGL) stock price has dropped by 38% in the past six months as bulk carrier freight rates decreased. Due to the hiked inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain disruptions, and global economic recession, the demand outlook for iron ore is not strong. However, the negative effect of low iron ore demand on the dry bulk carriers market is partially offset by the increased coal demand as a result of the energy crisis in Europe. The stock is a hold.
