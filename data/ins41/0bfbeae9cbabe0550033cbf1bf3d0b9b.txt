One of the tallest leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), V S Achuthanandan who often donned the role of a corrective force in Kerala, will turn 100 on Thursday. A colossus in Kerala's politics for over seven decades, VS, as his is popularly known, retired from active politics three years ago. He will celebrate his 99th birthday at his son's residence in Thiruvananthapuram, family members told HT. In the last two decades of his political journey, VS took on several social issues and fought legal battles against several high profile political leaders — the 1994 palm oil import case against former chief minister K Karunakaran, corruption cases against former power minister R Balakrishna Pillai, the ice cream parlour sex racket of 1990s as well as the 2015 bar bribery case against former minister K M Mani are some of his most high-profile cases.
