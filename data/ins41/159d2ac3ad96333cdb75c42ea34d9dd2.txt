One of the more under-the-radar NFL signings in the offseason was the Pittsburgh Steelers addition of safety Damontae Kazee. Originally signed to be the starter if Terrell Edmunds didn't re-sign, it looked like Pittsburgh had a top-notch reserve once he did.

However, Kazee went on IR just before the start of the season with a wrist injury and is still working his way back. In the midst of that, Kazee also served a three-game suspension for violation of the league's substance abuse policy.

Kazee told the media he is very close and hopes to be cleared next week.
