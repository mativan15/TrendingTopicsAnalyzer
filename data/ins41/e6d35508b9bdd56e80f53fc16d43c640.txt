Following years of speculation among watch collectors, Patek Philippe on Oct. 18 introduced the latest iteration of its highly coveted Nautilus wristwatch. And though people unfamiliar with the brand might be hard-pressed to distinguish the model from its predecessor, the new Nautilus boasts one key difference: a luxurious 18-karat white gold case and bracelet.

It just might break the horological internet.

The white gold Ref. 5811/1G-001 is a successor to the Ref. 5711/1A, the stainless-steel Nautilus with a black-blue dial that has been one of the world's most sought-after wristwatches.
