British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned on Thursday October 20, 2022, after saying she couldn't "deliver the mandate." Truss began her six-week stint by saying she'd lower taxes and help kickstart economic growth in the country, but newly appointed — and now dismissed — Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng's policies put forth in a September 2022 mini-budget were not received well.
After clearing office in less than two months, Truss is now the undisputed shortest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
