Halfway through the year, Samsung has reportedly cut how many phones it expects to produce this year by 10%, citing lower global demand due to high inflation and unrest due to the war in Ukraine.While Samsung originally estimated it would ship 310 million phones by year's end, that number has been reduced to 280 million phones, a source in the company's supply chain told Maeil Business News, South Korea's main daily business newspaper. Samsung will reduce production by 35% in May and another 10% later in the year, an analyst at Shinhan Investment told the publication.
