The financial and economic world is at an inflection point. Inflation is at levels not seen in a generation. Growth is slowing, technology stocks are in a tailspin, energy prices have soared and globalization is being unwound. Interest rates are again on the rise. Against this backdrop, the world must still find ways of managing serious secular issues from climate change to pandemic prevention to improving inequality. To try to make sense of it all and the likely path forward, I caught up with the renowned economist Dambisa Moyo, one of the world's leading experts on global growth and governance and the author most recently of How Boards Work, for her views on what is causing the current inflationary spiral, her outlook on the economy and interest rates, and her insights into how we can properly navigate the major economic issues facing the world.
