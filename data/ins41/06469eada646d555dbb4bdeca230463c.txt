Mike "Chumley" Gaines and Marcus Darnell met in 1995 while they were attending the Florida Institute of Technology. Both spent their college years hanging out at long-defunct Melbourne watering holes like Panther Pit, College Campus Café and Big Al's Lounge.

Gaines earned a bachelor's degree in aviation management with flight. But instead of working at airports, his local legacy took flight when he founded Chumley's — Florida Tech's off-campus tavern — in 1999 at University Plaza on Babcock Street.
