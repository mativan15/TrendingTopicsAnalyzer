ST. JOHN'S, N.L. - Newfoundland and Labrador's premier says he was not in a conflict of interest when he vacationed last year at a luxury fishing lodge owned by a billionaire with significant energy interests in the province. Andrew Furey faced a barrage of questions in the provincial legislature after news site allNewfoundlandLabrador.com reported on his July 2021 trip to the Rifflin' Hitch Lodge, which is owned by Clearwater Seafoods co-founder John Risley. Risley is the chief executive officer of CFFI Ventures, a company leading a massive wind and hydrogen energy project proposed in June for Newfoundland's west coast.
