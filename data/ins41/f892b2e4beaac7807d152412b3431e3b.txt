Doctor Who showrunner Chris Chibnall has teased more details about Jodie Whittaker's regeneration, promising ‘so many Easter eggs' and a ‘tear-filled goodbye' to our 13th Doctor.
The upcoming special, titled The Power of the Doctor, will see Jodie step down once and for all as the 13th Doctor, with Ncuti Gatwa set to take over the keys to the Tardis.
Chatting to Metro.co.uk about the emotional feature-length episode, Chris teased that Jodie's regeneration will look very different to past Doctors.
