Oct. 21—WILKES-BARRE — Eight people who likely would have been sentenced to probation or prison for drug possession and various related offenses were honored Friday for successfully participating in Luzerne County's Drug Treatment Court.

Beginning in 2006, the alternative sentencing court has graduated 258 participants, which includes 10 military veterans, while 74 have earned their high school diploma or GED. Participants can avoid incarceration by staying drug free for a year and complete an intensive treatment program, which includes a set amount of community service hours.
