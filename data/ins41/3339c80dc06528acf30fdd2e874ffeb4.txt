RiverNorthPhotography Introduction Seeking Alpha's recent headline about Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) reads: "Bank of New York Mellon Non-GAAP EPS of $1.21 beats by $0.13, revenue of $4.28B beats by $80M", but sometimes quarterly earnings beats are not really "beats". In this article, I will share my valuation process for Bank of New York Mellon, which shows that BK stock looks like a good value for investors. Then I will explain why, in my view, it's not. I will also share the bank stock I swapped Bank of New York Mellon for in the fall of 2020, and why I think it's a better long-term value for shareholders right now.
