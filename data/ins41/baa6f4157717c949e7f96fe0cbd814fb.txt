Former President Donald Trump heads to Wyoming on Saturday for a rally to campaign against one of his most prominent Republican critics, the western state's Representative Liz Cheney—showing support for her GOP primary opponent Harriet Hageman.While the little polling data that has come out shows that Cheney faces an uphill battle to maintain her seat against her Trump-backed challenger, Trump is coming to her state fresh off major endorsement failures in the Georgia Republican primary. Meanwhile, the former president's legal woes continue, as New York judges ruled against him multiple times this week.
