(Bloomberg) -- Representative Steve Scalise, the number two House Republican, defended his party's approach to Medicare and Social Security, which has become a campaign issue ahead of US midterm elections in November.

It's a mis-characterization to say the GOP plans to 'cut' the programs, Scalise said on 'Fox News Sunday.'

'That is not something we have proposed,' he said. 'We have proposed strengthening and shoring up Medicare and Social Security.'

He noted that under current law, the trust funds of both programs will become insolvent and be forced to cut benefits.
