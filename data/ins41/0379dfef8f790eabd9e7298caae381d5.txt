Stock market volatility cut into the price tag of ChannelAdvisor (NYSE: ECOM) to the tune of nearly $1 per share.

Last month, CommerceHub announced a $663 million deal to buy the Morrisville e-commerce software company, a move that would take it private for $23.10 per share. But securities filings show prior offers by CommerceHub had been rejected by ChannelAdvisor's board – including one in late February that would have paid $24.05.

That adds up to a difference of nearly $27.3 million.

ChannelAdvisor's board and executives 'regularly review' opportunities.
