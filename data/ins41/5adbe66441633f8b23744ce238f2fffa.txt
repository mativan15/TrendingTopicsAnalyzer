Many stocks that Cathie Wood has been bullish on have been struggling this year. Her ARK Innovation ETF has fallen 52% already in 2022, while the S&P 500 has declined by a more modest 13%. With such a sharp decline, the bearishness has undoubtedly created some attractive deals in the process.
A few Cathie Wood stocks that look especially attractive right now include Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings (DNA -3.25%), Zoom Video Communications (ZM 0.19%), and Coinbase Global (COIN -12.12%). Although these stocks are all down at least 40% year to date and more than 70% off their 52-week highs, here's why they might be worth adding to your portfolio anyway.
