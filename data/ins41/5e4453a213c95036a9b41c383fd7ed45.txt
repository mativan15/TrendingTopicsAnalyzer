Weapons sent to Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February will end up on the global hidden economy and in the hands of criminals, the head of Interpol has said.Jürgen Stock says once the conflict ends, a wave of guns and heavy arms will flood the international market and he urged Interpol's member states, especially those supplying weapons, to cooperate on arms tracing.'Once the guns fall silent [in Ukraine], the illegal weapons will come. We know this from many other theatres of conflict. The criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,' Stock said.
