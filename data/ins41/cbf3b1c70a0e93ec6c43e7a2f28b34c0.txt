I'm 19 studying psych . However , I'm very insecure about it since I don't know what to do as a job and I don't want to end up unemployed. I'm doing bad at maths , I liked biology in HS and I can do well in English . I'm an introvert , I hate overcrowded places and I don't like socializing much , in fact I get very anxious when having to talk in front of people and I prefer not to be the centre of attention . I wouldn't describe myself as very smart , I had hard time especially to anything related with maths like physics etc .
