BMW has revealed the new X1 small SUV, giving it a smart new look inside and out and an all-electric option. The new X1 looks quite rugged, with a large, upright grille, angry arrow-shape daytime running lights in the headlight clusters, and purposeful coloured accents in the lower fascia. The wheel arches are almost square, while the taillights are quite long, swooping up at the edges. All the lights are LED, while adaptive Matrix headlights are standard. Wheel sizes range from 18 inches to 20 inches, the first time an X1 has offered such a size.
