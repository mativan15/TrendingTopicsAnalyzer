With the midterms two weeks away, what are candidates talking about in political ads?

With the midterm elections less than a month away, a new USA TODAY analysis of political ad data shows Republicans dominating on issues of the economy and immigration while Democratic candidates are doubling down on abortion and health care.

In October, Republicans out-messaged Democrats roughly 2-to-1 on the economy while Democrats have 8 times as much messaging on abortion as the GOP, according to USA TODAY's analysis of AdImpact data.
