The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will realign its businesses in the wake of "the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the market."

The New York City bank (NYSE: GS) reported Tuesday that its third-quarter net revenues fell to $11.98 billion compared to $13.6 billion a year earlier and diluted earnings per share fell to $8.25 from $14.93 a year earlier.

Despite the drop-offs, the results bested expectations from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters First Call, who anticipated revenues of $11.
