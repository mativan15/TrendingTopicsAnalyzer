Insiders who bought US$468k worth of Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VRCA) stock in the last year have seen some of their losses recouped as the stock gained 14% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be a costly gamble, since losses made by insiders have totalled US$354k since the time of purchase.
