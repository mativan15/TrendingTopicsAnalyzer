Jun. 2—In February, The News Courier brought you a story on the Hill Family in Cullman County. Molly Luba Hill and Stephanie Hill's biological families live in Ukraine including Molly's brother Dima. He is currently a member of the Ukrainian Army on the front lines defending against the Russian invasion. Molly's mother, Becca Hill, has provided updates as she has been able to get them.

The last update came in late April and since then, messages from Dima have become less frequent. On May 17, Dima messaged that he was "good" but indicated that phone service has been down in Ukraine as Russians had been bombing cell towers.
