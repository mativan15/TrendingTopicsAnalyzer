Solskin Back in January, I expected Medical REITs to slightly underperform the REIT average. Instead, they have slightly outperformed, returning (-30.49)% YTD, compared to (-32.70)% for the Equity REIT index, according to Hoya Capital Income Builder. Hoya Capital Income Builder Thanks to the broad sell-off in the REIT sector, there are a lot of tasty Yields available. For example, while the average Medical REIT now yields 5.41%, Community Healthcare Trust (NYSE:CHCT) yields slightly above that, at 5.
