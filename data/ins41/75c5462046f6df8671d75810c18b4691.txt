Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images So far we've covered almost every major Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company listed in the US. We found that mining companies adopt different capital structures to sustain operations and growth. In our previous coverage of Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), we found that RIOT's operation and growth are sustained through dilution, which saw RIOT increase its shares outstanding by 40% since 2021. We made a similar observation in Hut 8 Mining (HUT) as well, where HUT increased outstanding shares by 89% during the same period and will increase by 75% more in the coming quarters.
