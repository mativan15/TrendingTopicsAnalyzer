President Joe Biden's loan-forgiveness plan could include $10,000 in relief for federal borrowers who made under $150,000 in the previous year, three people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post last week.As part of his presidential campaign, Biden pledged to enact widespread student-debt forgiveness. In 2020, borrowers had $1.5 trillion in federal student-loan debt, three times the total of about $516 billion in 2007, according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, an education and entrepreneurship nonprofit.
