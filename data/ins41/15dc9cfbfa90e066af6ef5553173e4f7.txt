Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Chief Commissioner Tushar Giri Nath, during an inspection at the Yelahanka zone, Friday instructed the civic officials to repair the footpath near the road adjacent to NES bus stop in Bengaluru city. He also directed the officials to ensure that rainwater flowed directly into the side drain through the water grates.
'He instructed the officials to ensure that rainwater does not accumulate on the road and instead flows into the side drains. Directions have been given to install water grates in places that need them,' a statement from the BBMP read.
