The government has a strong stance against corruption and local self-governments should also set an example in preventing the same, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Tuesday.'Some officials consider corruption their right and demand money for everything. Local self-governments shouldn't turn a blind eye towards corrupt and greedy officials,' he said, inaugurating the State-level academic meet of people's representatives who have completed a certificate course on decentralisation and local administration jointly conducted by Sree Narayana Guru Open University, Kerala Institute of Local Administration, and the Kerala University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology.
