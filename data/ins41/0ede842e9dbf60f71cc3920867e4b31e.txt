Over the past two years, at least 37 million people with federal student loans have glimpsed a reality they may never have imagined: A world without loan payments or mounting interest. 
 
It's a world that Vanji Unruh, a 59-year-old child welfare attorney from Exeter, California, could get used to. The roughly $26,000 in student loans she took out to go to college in the 1980s has haunted her ever since, ballooning into a balance of $132,174 because of a 9% interest rate.
 
Even more unbelievably, since 2007 (as far back as her loan servicer's records go) she has paid $93,594.
