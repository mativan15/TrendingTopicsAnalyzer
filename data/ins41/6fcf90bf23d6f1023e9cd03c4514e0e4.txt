Lyric Waiwiri-Smith is a lifestyle and entertainment reporter for Stuff. She is also an unapologetic superfan of singer Taylor Swift.

Those late nights with Taylor's music serving as the soundtrack to my most formative, fun and challenging moments are the ones that stick out the most through my 15 years of loving her.
