The Greater Chennai Corporation owns 136 commercial complexes across the city that house nearly 5,000 shops. However, the revenue potential of these complexes has not been realised because of poor sanitation, lack of cleanliness and inadequate security. High rent and the pandemic forced many shopkeepers to abandon their premises leaving large amount of arrears in rent. The Hindu explores the situation on the field. The Lily Pond Complex behind Ripon Building gives the illusion of a thriving business complex when in reality, many shops are shut and shopkeepers are struggling to sell their ware.
