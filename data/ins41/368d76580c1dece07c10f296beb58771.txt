Millions of people have suffered from polio, mainly in Asia and Africa, for centuries. But the virus has mutated plenty of times. The polio virus has been contained mainly by choking the endemic transmission of the disease. That has been made possible by orally administering the vaccine to children at a young age, and the immunisation is lifelong. The world made a promise to #EndPolio for good. No one should live in fear of this preventable disease.The Gates Foundation is proud to commit $1.2B toward helping health workers stop all forms of this virus and protect children forever.
