Hermes Ribeiro Martins, a 34-year-old Web3 entrepreneur living in the Brazilian port city of João Pessoa, first heard about cryptocurrency through Twitter. It was 2016, a year before Bitcoin hit $20,000 and exploded into the mainstream. Ribeiro began investing in the biggest cryptocurrencies. After Bitcoin crashed in 2018, he started to move into altcoins.   'I finally found my tribe,' he told Fortune.  Ribeiro immersed himself in the technology, creating a crypto-focused Discord server and founding an NFT-based music company.
