If anybody knows what happened to Tiffany Valiante and can help with some information about her death, it could lead to a reward of $40,000. The young girl's body was hit by an Atlanta-bound train after a bitter face-off with her parents about money. She had stormed out of the house, and later they identified her body in the morgue. The police, through the medical examiner, ruled it a suicide, but her mother mysteriously found her headband and shoes while on a walk two weeks later. The parents of Tiffany Valiante regret that they had agreed to close her suicide case and are now confident enough to increase the reward for any information about it.
