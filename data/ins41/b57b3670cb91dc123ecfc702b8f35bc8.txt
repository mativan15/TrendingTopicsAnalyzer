Shares of Electronics Mart India made a stellar debut on the bourses on Monday, but saw some profit-booking amid wild swings on Dalal Street. The shares of the company got listed at a premium of 53 per cent on National Stock Exchange (NSE) at Rs 90, over the issue price of Rs 59. On BSE, the scrip debuted at Rs 89.40 on BSE, a premium close to 52 per cent. Following the listing, the counter failed to register further upside as investors, who received the shares during IPO bidding, booked profits after a hefty listing pop.
