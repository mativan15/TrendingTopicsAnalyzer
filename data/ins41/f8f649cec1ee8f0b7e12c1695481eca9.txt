The days of the independent, single-location grocery store may be ending, John Zagara says.

The third-generation grocer who ran his family's Zagara's Marketplace in Cleveland Heights for 31 years announced last week that he is selling the store to Dave's Markets Inc., a family-run grocery store chain in Bedford, Ohio.

Dave's, which has 11 stores in Greater Cleveland and one in Akron, plans to permanently close its supermarket at 12438 Cedar Road in the Cedar Fairmount business district on Oct. 25 and move its operations to the Zagara's location nearby on Lee Road.
