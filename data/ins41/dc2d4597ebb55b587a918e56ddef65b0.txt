Labour would implement a "Nato test" to all major defence projects amid increasing foreign threats, the shadow defence secretary has said.
John Healey told The Telegraph that in his first 100 days in government he would set up a test under which the Ministry of Defence would report directly to him on major defence projects, to ensure they were 'on track to fulfil Nato obligations'. 
He would also be looking to see whether they 'contribute to Nato's real-world defences' and would look to review any funding gaps in major ongoing projects.
