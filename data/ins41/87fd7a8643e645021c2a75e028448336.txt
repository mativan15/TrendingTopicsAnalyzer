Robert Way We updated investors in our previous article on XPeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) to be cautious, as we gleaned a significant price top as the market led investors into XPEV's June highs. The market has since digested that momentum surge from its May lows with breathtaking ruthlessness, sending XPEV spiraling toward a record low in October 2022. As such, XPEV has underperformed its peers significantly since our previous article, as it fell more than 75% from our caution. While we had expected a steep fall, we didn't expect such a massacre.
