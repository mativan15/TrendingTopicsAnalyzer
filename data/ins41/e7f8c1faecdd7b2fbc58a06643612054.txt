ismagilov Monarch Casino & Resort (NASDAQ:MCRI) was the biggest gainer in the casino sector on Thursday afternoon with a 14.67% jump to $70.58. Shares of MCRI rose to their highest level since the earlier part of March on the heels of a strong earnings report. The casino stock also caught the attention of Stifel, which lifted its rating to Buy from Hold. "We argue MCRI is comparatively well positioned given economic tailwinds in both operating markets [Black Hawk and Reno], further VIP upside in Black Hawk, a higher income customer base, and a pristine balance sheet which should allow for opportunistic deployment of capital in a potential downturn (acquisitions; continued property reinvestment)," wrote analyst Jeffrey Stantial.
