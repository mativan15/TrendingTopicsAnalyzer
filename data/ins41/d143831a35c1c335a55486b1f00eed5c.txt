New, more infectious coronavirus mutations are spreading across Florida, and some who will seek new vaccinations to protect against the latest viral versions will have to start paying soon.

The federal government has said that by the end of the year it will run out of money to buy COVID-19 vaccines, meaning they will no longer be free to all recipients starting in January.

The latest shots from Moderna and Pfizer, federally approved in late August, are better built to fight offshoots of the virus' omicron variant.
