A startup has taken a major step forward in tackling the global fossil fuel energy crisis, by making a unique "motionless" rooftop wind generator that can deliver up to 50 percent more energy than solar panels could at the same price. Aeromine Technologies designed a rooftop wind capture technology that takes up just a tenth of the roof space of solar, and operates completely silently. This technology comes at a time when Europe is scrambling to end its reliance on Russian gas, as the war in Ukraine has sent energy bills spiralling in line with the costs of wholesale natural gas.
