San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners purchased the Pan Pacific Hotel in South Lake Union for $70 million in a deal recorded Wednesday.

The sale price includes $51.3 million for the building, located at 2125 Terry Ave., and $18.7 million for the hotel's furniture and operating systems.

The 153-room hotel was built in 2006 by Vulcan Inc., which developed the hotel as part of its 2200 Westlake project. The development also includes residential condominiums and retail spaces, but only the hotel changed hands in this sale.
