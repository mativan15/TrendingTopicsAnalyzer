The Wrap 'Halloween Ends' is here. And whether you think it's ultimately satisfying, it does provide a conclusive finale for the trilogy that started in 2018 with David Gordon Green's 'Halloween' and continued with the blood-soaked sequel, 2021's 'Halloween Kills.' Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, a part she first played in John Carpenter's groundbreaking 1978 original, has her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the unstoppable serial killer who has haunted her for all of these years.
