UConn hit four home runs to quiet a sellout crowd and stun top-seeded Maryland, 10-5, in the NCAA baseball regional Saturday night at College Park, Md.

The Huskies, now 2-0 in the regional. are one win away from reaching the Super Regional, a best-of-three series that serves as the doorstep to the College World Series. UConn last reached the Super Regional in 2011.

Matt Donlan, the catcher from Guilford, hit the biggest homer of UConn's four - a three-run homer in the bottom of the seventh — to extend the Huskies' lead to four.
