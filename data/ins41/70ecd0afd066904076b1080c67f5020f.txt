Bristol airport is experiencing "hours-long queues" at its departure gates as the airport braces for the busiest week of travel since 2019.
Approximately 300,000 customers are expected to fly in and out of Bristol over the half-term and Platinum Jubilee period, the airport said, with numbers expected to peak at over 30,000 per day.
Some travellers have reported arriving for their flights over five hours early, only to be greeted by vast, snaking queues outside the airport terminal, even at 5am.
One customer, who arrived at the airport as the sun rose this morning, took to social media to complain that it took over two hours to clear check-in and security, despite the early hour.
