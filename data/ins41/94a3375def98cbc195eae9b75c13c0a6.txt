May 29—After this year's Hunt County Fair set records, organizers of the event are making preparations for 2023.

The Fair's Jennifer Crumpton said she is already working full-time on the 2023 fair.

"We are really looking forward to planning next year's event," Crumpton said. "This year we are going to put more time into the fine details and want to make it even better."

The 2022 Hunt County Fair and Livestock Show, its 55th year, was held April 22 through May 1 and featured a full lineup of rides, food live music and of course the Livestock Sale of Champions

General Superintendent of Livestock Tommy Thompson sent out a letter May 20 addressed to all fair patrons, noting how when he took over the post 12 years ago, the livestock show was known to raise between $200,000 and $250,000 for the 4H and FFA students in Hunt County.
