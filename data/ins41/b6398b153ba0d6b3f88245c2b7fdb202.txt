AgenciesRepresentative ImageSteel prices in the domestic market have fallen by almost a tenth in the two weeks since the Centre levied export duty on the alloy, a trend underscored by the seasonal slowdown in demand. Prices of domestic benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel at the traders' end have slipped by about 8% or ₹5,500 to about ₹63,800 per tonne since May 18, according to SteelMint, a market intelligence agency. Top steelmakers have also quoted prices for June that are lower by ₹4,500-5,500 a tonne, said people with knowledge of the matter.
