A woman from the US has divided TikTok users after she revealed she bought her university-age daughter a flat in Glasgow because the market was 'affordable'.Janelle Copeland, from California, shared a video detailing her experience of trying to find a place for her daughter to live while studying at university in Scotland.Copeland said she and her husband, Eddie, spent three months trying to find a property their daughter could rent with friends, but the search was unsuccessful.They also found some options outside of Glasgow but didn't feel comfortable with any of these as they would require their daughter to walk up to an hour to university every day.
