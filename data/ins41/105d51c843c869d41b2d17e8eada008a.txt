Wary of the possibility of cross-voting during the polling for two Rajya Sabha seats, the Congress is likely to take Haryana MLAs to the party-ruled Chhattisgarh to protect them from poaching. The Congress summoned all its 31 Haryana legislators to Delhi for a meeting on Thursday and they are likely to be taken to Chhattisgarh, said party sources. The party legislators arrived at the residence of Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda in Delhi Thursday. However, Adampur legislator Kuldeep Bishnoi did not reach the national capital, the sources said.
