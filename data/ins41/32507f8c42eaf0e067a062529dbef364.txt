Devin and Jason McCourty hosted a fundraiser at Kings Dining and Entertainment Monday night.

Devin and Jason McCourty stood on the red carpet outside of King's Dining and Entertainment Monday night, playfully roasting each other on a variety of subjects from Jason no longer playing football to Devin's bowling ability.

But their purpose for hosting the McCourty Bowl, an annual fundraiser that benefits sickle cell disease research and Boston Medical Center, is serious business.

The disease hits home for the twins, who were inspired by their aunt's battle with the disease to raise money for a cure.
