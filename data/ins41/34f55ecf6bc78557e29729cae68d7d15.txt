Aaron Patrick's agent is not happy about the circumstances of his client's season-ending injury.
Patrick, a linebacker on the Denver Broncos, tore his ACL during Monday night's game against the Chargers. He was crashing out of bounds, and collided with a crew member on the sidelines. In seeking to avoid colliding with another, Patrick's foot planted on a rug on the sidelines and his leg contorted in the wrong direction. 
'I was very disturbed about the way the injury occurred with the carpet being on the sideline like that,' Patrick's agent, Lamont Smith, told Tom Pelissero of NFL Media.
