As India races to increase its share of renewable energy as part of its ambitious climate action, experts on Monday underscored the need for the entire renewable energy (RE) spectrum to ensure energy equity, ecological responsibility and livelihood protection of the vulnerable communities during the energy transition from fossil-fuel. It is part of the 'Vision and Principles' released by the Responsible Energy India (REI) that seeks a socially just, ecologically safe, and rights respecting renewable energy sector as the country aims to achieve 500 GW of installed RE capacity by 2030.
