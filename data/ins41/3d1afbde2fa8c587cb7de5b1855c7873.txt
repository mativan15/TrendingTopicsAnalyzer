The CBI on Friday questioned Lok Sabha member Karti Chidambaram for nearly eight hours on the second day in connection with alleged bribery of Rs 50 lakh in the issuing of visas for 263 Chinese workers in 2011 when his father P Chidambaram was the home minister, officials said. The Congress leader arrived at the CBI headquarters in the morning and during his questioning involving various aspects related to the case, he was confronted with documents, they said. Karti has termed the allegations against him a result of political vendetta and case as most bogus among the three FIRs he was booked in.
