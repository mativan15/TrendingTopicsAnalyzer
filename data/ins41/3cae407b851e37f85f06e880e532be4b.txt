LOS ANGELES — Many voters in heavily Democratic Los Angeles are seething over rising crime and homelessness and that could prompt the city to take a turn to the political right for the first time in decades. One of the leading candidates for mayor is Rick Caruso, a pro-business billionaire Republican-turned-Democrat who sits on the board of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and is promising to expand spending on police, not defund them. At another time, the high-end mall and resort developer would seem an unlikely choice to potentially lead the nation's second-most populous city, where democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was the runaway winner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
