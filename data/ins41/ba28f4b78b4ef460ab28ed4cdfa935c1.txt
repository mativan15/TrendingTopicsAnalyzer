Wind gusts marred the long-awaited return of the DanceAfrica Bazaar to Fort Greene, wreaking havoc on vendors who saw tents overturned and merchandise destroyed Saturday afternoon, witnesses said.
The wild weather had some vendors — who came as far as North Carolina — running for cover when the gusts rocked the event around 1:15 p.m.
'It was a tornado that came through here today. The wind spiraled everything out of control,' a shaken Kathy Cissokho, 69, of Baltimore, who sells sterling silver merchandise, told The Post.
