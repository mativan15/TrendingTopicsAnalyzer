The Tigers bounced back from their first loss in SEC play against Tennessee in a big way on Saturday.

Playing on the road against the Florida Gators in the Swamp, LSU survived a shootout thanks to an electric game from quarterback Jayden Daniels, who accounted for nearly 400 total yards and six touchdowns in a 45-35 win.

The road doesn't get any easier for the Tigers this week. They return to the comfortable confines of Death Valley, but they welcome a top-10 opponent into Baton Rouge in Ole Miss.
