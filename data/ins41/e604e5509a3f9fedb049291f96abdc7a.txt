We're less than a month away from the biggest Nintendo Switch release of the year. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the ninth generation of mainline entries in the massively popular RPG series, release on November 18 exclusively for Nintendo Switch. If you haven't preordered a copy yet, you can lock in your preorder for just $49 at Super Shop with promo code SBSPKMN.This is the only preorder discount we've seen so far, which is unsurprising considering preorder deals on Switch games aren't common, especially for games that are still more than a month away.
