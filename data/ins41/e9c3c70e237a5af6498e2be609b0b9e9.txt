Jesús Martinez, co-owner of Con Huevos, said having a family-run business can be an advantage in a restaurant industry dealing with inflation and widespread staffing shortages.

Despite pressures from increased labor and food costs, Martinez said the local, fast casual Mexican breakfast chain is in the process of expanding because of the stability he and his wife Izmene Peredo have maintained in all aspects of the business.

"Our recipes remain the same since since we started this business," Martinez said.
