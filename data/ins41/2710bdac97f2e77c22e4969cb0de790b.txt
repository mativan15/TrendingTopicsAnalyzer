NBC is eyeing former Cowboys coach Jason Garrett as a candidate to be Drew Brees' replacement as the game analyst on Notre Dame football and possibly on its prime time NFL pregame studio show, 'Football Night in America,' The Post has learned. 
Garrett, 56, is already working with NBC on its USFL coverage, where he has been teaming with Jac Collinsworth. Collinsworth could be Garrett's potential partner on the Fighting Irish, according to sources. 
NBC declined to comment. Garrett did not immediately return messages.
