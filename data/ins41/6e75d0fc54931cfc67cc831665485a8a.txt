17 Oct 2022, 11:24 AM ISTThe CBDC is a legal tender issued by a central bank. It would be your regular, sovereign-backed currency note, only in a digital format. Termed e-rupee, you will not need a bank account to spend or receive this money. Issued as tokens, the RBI's e-rupee will be on a par with regular cash. You can use it to make payments and also exchange it for physical notes from the bank. RBI has been exploring the idea of CBDCs since 2017. Already, 105 countries are actively engaged in developing or exploring the viability of this form of money for their economy.
