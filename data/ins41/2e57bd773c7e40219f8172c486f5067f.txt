Exclusive IBM Consulting on Tuesday issued a policy telling US employees located near IBM or client offices that they are expected to be in the office at least three days a week.
The directive has not gone over well.
Employees responding to the revised work rules on IBM's Fishbowl app, used for internal discussions, speculate the IT giant is, as one worker put it, "creating voluntary attrition so they don't have to RA." That's Resource Action, IBM's euphemism for a layoff. The Register has seen and reviewed copies of these Fishbowl threads.
