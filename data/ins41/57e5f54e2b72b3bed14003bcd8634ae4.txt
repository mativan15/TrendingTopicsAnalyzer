Doug Howgate, a longtime leader in fiscal and public policy in the commonwealth, has been named as the next president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.

The public policy research organization announced Howgate's election by its board of trustees on Thursday morning. Currently the executive vice president, Howgate will take over for President Eileen McAnneny on Jan. 1, 2023.

For the remainder of the year, McAnneny and Howgate will work together on a smooth transition, including planning for the next legislative cycle and gubernatorial administration as MTF eyes its 90th anniversary, the group said.
