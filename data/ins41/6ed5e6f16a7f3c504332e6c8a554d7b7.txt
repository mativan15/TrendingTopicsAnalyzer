ICYMI: Donald Trump called Kanye West great for MAGA before telling a TV host that he couldn't comment on the rapper's slight against his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which he made during an interview with Tucker Carlson, because he hadn't seen that portion of the conversation. 'He's been saying some really offensive things lately about your own son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and about Jewish people. Jewish Americans writ large. Could you react to that? Because is this the guy that you knew?' said Salem News's Larry O'Connor during a telephone call with the former president.
