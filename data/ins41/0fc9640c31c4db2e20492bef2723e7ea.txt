AgenciesThe spookiest season of Fortnite has started as the total moon rises, bringing with it some new (and returning) presents and potentially terrifying partnerships. One of the new features is Howler Claws, a potent Mythic item that lets you fight opponents. You should purchase this as soon as you can. The Ritual Emote can be used to summon the Howler Claws by heading to an Alteration Altar where you can find them. There may be an Alteration Altar in the Reality Tree POI, but more Altars may be scattered throughout the area, claims the Fortnitemares 2022 blog post.
