Conor McGregor is almost ready to make his return to action sometime this year after a nearly one-year rehab, and a former UFC champion weighed in on who he should face first.
Daniel Cormier recently made an appearance at ESPN MMA to talk about McGregor's return and made a case for why he should complete the trilogy with Nate Diaz.
'I know who he should fight, and I know who he probably will fight. Who he should fight is Nate Diaz… Both guys are not necessarily in the title picture right now. It's a fun fight.
