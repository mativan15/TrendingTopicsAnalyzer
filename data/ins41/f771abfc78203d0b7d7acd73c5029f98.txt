The Nintendo Switch doesn't have the power of a PS5 or Xbox Series X (or almost any gaming PC), but it can still run graphically intensive games like Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and Dying Light 2. How does this nearly 5-year-old hybrid handheld do it? The answer is something called Switch Cloud Gaming. Like Xbox Cloud Gaming, GeForce Now PS Plus and the soon-to-be-defunct Google Stadia, Switch Cloud Streaming allows you to play certain titles from the cloud, which means the games are played on a remote server somewhere in, you know, "the cloud," while the output streams directly to your screen.
