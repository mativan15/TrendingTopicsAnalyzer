Brian Duffy is best known as the CEO of Watches of Switzerland Group, the UK's leading watch retailer, but his career has spanned the globe.

Chatting to Donald Martin, host of the Go Radio Business Show , he explained: 'I grew up in Glasgow housing schemes, starting in Castlemilk; that was my upbringing. I became a chartered accountant, which led me into commerce and Playtex. I became their CFO at the relatively young age of 28, then European CFO, so that was us off to Paris.'

By the age of 33, Brian and his family had relocated to the US, where he became the company's worldwide chief financial officer.
