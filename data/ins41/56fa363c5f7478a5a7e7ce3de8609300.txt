There are many financial benefits to homeownership including accruing wealth that you can pass onto future generations, controlling your living costs, and the ability to build equity in your property over time. Equity is the value of your home minus any loan balances you have against the property.

This can be a helpful source of funds during retirement in later years—or if you're facing some other financial emergency.
