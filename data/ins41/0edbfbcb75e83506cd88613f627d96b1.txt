Truss on Monday said she was sorry for mistakes made by her government and accepted responsibility for "going too far and too fast" with her contentious "trickle-down economics" approach.
Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt ripped up almost all of the tax cuts Truss had promised, cut short her flagship energy policy and made clear there would be cuts in public spending to come.
The volte-face leaves Truss' economic vision in tatters, with five of her own Conservative lawmakers now openly calling for her to resign.
