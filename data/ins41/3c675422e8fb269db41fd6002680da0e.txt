PayPal has laid off workers in risk management and operations this week, according to Bloomberg. It's the latest in a series of layoffs within the company — and it also won't be the last. The publication says the payment processor also recently reduced its employee numbers in Chicago, Omaha, Nebraska and Chandler, Arizona. Further, it previously revealed that it was going to permanently lay off 80 people working in its headquarters in San Jose, California.
While the company approved plans to strategically reduce its workforce in 2020, these recent layoffs come after PayPal's growth showed signs of slowing down.
