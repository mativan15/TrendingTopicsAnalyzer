Schroders has given the first clues to how its liability driven investment (LDI) operations fared during the recent gilts market upheaval, reporting a £20.2 billion drop in assets in the division responsible.Assets under management at the fund manager's 'Solutions' division fell from £225.7 billion to £205.5 billion in the three months to September, Schroders said yesterday.LDI funds are at the centre of intense regulatory scrutiny after they were blamed for triggering a dangerously destabilising and self-feeding spiral of selling of long-dated government bonds.
