A massive data center in the West Valley city of Goodyear is continuing its growth as the second phase of construction gets underway, with the new capacity expected to be operational in the spring of 2024.

Vantage Data Centers said it is spending more than $1.5 billion on the 50-acre campus, which is located near Phoenix-Goodyear Airport. Once fully built out, the campus will provide 160 megawatts of IT capacity across three facilities and more than a million square feet.

The site is the first Southwest campus for Denver-based Vantage, which will also be the company's largest North American campus.
