Good morning, and welcome to the politics live blog. Joe Biden is set to announce the release of 15m barrels of gas from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve later today as the administration attempts to tamper down gas prices. The national average for gas prices stands at $3.85 a gallon today, according to AAA, slightly higher than the $3.34 a gallon that was seen this time last year. But it's still lower than this summer, when gas peaked at over $5 a gallon. The move is Biden's attempt to mitigate growing concerns over the economy as the midterms approach.
