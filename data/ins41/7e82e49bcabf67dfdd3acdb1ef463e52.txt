Jack Lockton started his insurance brokerage in 1966 above a laundromat on West 43rd Street in Kansas City.

Lockton Cos. grew into a pillar of the Kansas City community, now operating from a headquarters on West 47th Street overlooking the Country Club Plaza. Beyond that, it has grown into the world's 10th-largest insurance broker.

Revenue has grown by more than 7.4% each of the past 10 years — a feat that gets increasingly harder as the total grows. For the year ended April 30, revenue grew 27%, to $2.
