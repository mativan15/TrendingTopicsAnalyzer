The monthly U.S. jobs report is the Rodney Dangerfield of economic statistics. It gets little respect yet has a big and important audience.

In good times, employment data is derided as 'a lagging indicator,' as if because it captures what the job market was, it is to be dismissed by the declining stock market. In bad times, the job information either confirms the difficult times, or is rejected as obsolete.

The May jobs report is likely to be discounted even if it shows Americans continue to find work and American companies keep creating new positions.
