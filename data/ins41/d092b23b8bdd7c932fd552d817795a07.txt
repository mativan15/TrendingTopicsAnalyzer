Ari Emanuel is encouraging businesses that work with Kanye 'Ye' West to pull their involvement with him following the rapper's recent antisemitic remarks. In an op-ed for the Financial Times published online Wednesday, the Endeavor CEO wrote that West's business partners, including companies that profit off his music — such as Apple, Spotify, Adidas and his touring partners — should stop working with the star. Emanuel also said that the parent company of Parler, which on Monday announced West's planned acquisition of the right-wing social media platform, should refuse to sell it to him.
