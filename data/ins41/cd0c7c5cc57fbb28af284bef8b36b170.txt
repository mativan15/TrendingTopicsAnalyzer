Anna May Wong was the first Chinese American movie star in Hollywood. Born Wong Liu Tsong on January 3, 1905, her career spanned both silent and sound film, appearing in more than 60 movies, including television, stage, and radio. 
During the silent film era, she acted in The Toll of the Sea in 1922 at the age of just 14 and in The Thief of Bagdad in 1924 which thrust her into international stardom.
She was cast in stereotypical supporting roles in her early career and left Hollywood to further her talents in Europe starring in notable roles in Piccadilly; Chin Chin Chow; Daughter of the Dragon and Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express in 1932 with Marlene Dietrich.
