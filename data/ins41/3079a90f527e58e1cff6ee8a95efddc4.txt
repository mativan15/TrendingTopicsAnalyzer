Two geese in Riverside County have tested positive for a serious strain of avian influenza that has impacted millions of wild and domestic birds in the United States.

The two geese were impounded by Riverside County officers from an unincorporated area near Perris last week. Riverside County Chief Veterinarian Dr. Sara Strongin received confirmation of the Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI H5N1, on Tuesday. Officials said the risk posed to humans is low.

'Although we just have these two positive cases so far, the disease is considered widespread in the Inland Empire and further cases will likely emerge as testing continues,' Strongin said in a statement.
