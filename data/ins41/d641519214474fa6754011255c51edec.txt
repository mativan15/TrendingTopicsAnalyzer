Warning: This story contains language that may be disturbing for some readers Environmentalist David Suzuki ranted to federal government ministers, media and tourism industry workers at a news conference Friday afternoon in Vancouver. The event was held to announce federal funding for B.C.'s tourism sector, but Suzuki took the opportunity to speak out about what he calls the government's lack of action regarding climate change. 'All this bullshit about how you're trying to encourage the coming together to this beautiful land, what are we doing about this land? We're not doing the right things to ensure tourism into the future,' said Suzuki.
