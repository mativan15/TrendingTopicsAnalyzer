UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations chief on Monday demanded an immediate end to hostilities in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region and withdrawal of Eritrean forces fighting alongside the government, saying 'violence and destruction have reached alarming levels' and 'civilians are paying a horrific price.'
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that 'there is no military solution' to the nearly two-year conflict between Tigrayan forces and the federal government, warning that 'the situation in Ethiopia is spiraling out of control.
