It wasn't the way Stuart Skinner wanted to start his season, but he came in and did his job anyway. The Oilers backup goalie replaced Jack Campbell Saturday night with his team already down 4-1 against the Calgary Flames. Skinner then stopped all 31 shots he faced and was named the first star of the game. "I thought there was a maturity and a mental toughness to Stuart. He went right into the game and he made some big saves and he gave us a chance to win that game," head coach Jay Woodcroft said Monday.
