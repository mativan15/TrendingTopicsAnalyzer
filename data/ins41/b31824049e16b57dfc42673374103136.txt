A Terra whistle-blower has alleged that the epic crash that wiped off billions of dollars was the result of a massive fraud rather than a flawed algorithm. Terraform Labs CEO and founder Do Kwon and other big names in the industry have come under a shadow of doubt.
The stinging remarks on Twitter comes as the Terra community awaits the official launch of the new blockchain that ditches the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and creates LUNA 2.0.
A Twitter user who goes by the name FatManTerra dropped several nukes that seemingly supported what many Terra investors suspected all along, claiming that based on allegations by whistle-blowers, the Terra LUNA-UST meteoric crash was orchestrated by several hotshots and entities in the cryptocurrency industry.
