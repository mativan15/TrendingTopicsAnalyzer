Kanye West has started the process of buying social media app Parler, which is associated with far-right views and figures such as Donald Trump. 
The Grammy-winning rapper has faced mounting backlash in recent weeks over his controversial statements, such as denouncing the Black Lives Matter movement as a ‘scam', wearing a White Lives Matter shirt and comments deemed to be anti-semitic. 
Social media platforms have moved to restrict his accounts including Instagram, while Twitter has locked his page preventing him from sharing new tweets after violating rules.
