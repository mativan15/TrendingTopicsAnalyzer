Key Takeaways Tax lien investing allows you to purchase a tax lien certificate issued by the local government when a property owner has unpaid property taxes. A tax lien certificate includes unpaid taxes along with interest and fees. The investor purchases this debt and is repaid with an agreed-upon interest rate when the property owner wants to redeem the debt. Many REITs require investment minimums of thousands of dollars, and obtaining a home mortgage comes with a significant downpayment; tax lien certificates can be purchased for a few hundred dollars.
