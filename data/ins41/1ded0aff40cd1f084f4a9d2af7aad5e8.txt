Liz Truss was meeting with the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives Sir Graham Brady shortly before midday, Downing Street has said, as more Tory MPs called for the Prime Minister to quit.

Although the reason for the meeting - which Ms Truss requested - remains unclear, part of his role is to convey to the Prime Minister the views of backbench Tory MPs and comes as 14 MPs have publicly called for her to resign.

Ms Truss asked to see Sir Graham, rather than the other way around, according to a No10 source.
