Housing Development Finance Corp is seeking to hedge its fixed-rate borrowings in the interest rate derivatives markets, amid an uncertain interest rate trajectory, said people familiar with the matter. While it pays the fixed coupons to its own bondholders, it covers the same through such a mechanism, effectively paying overnight rates on an ongoing basis. The home financier is said to be entering into overnight indexed swap contracts, or swaps linked to the yield on government securities. These are interest rate derivatives instruments.
