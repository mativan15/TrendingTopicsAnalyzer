American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) shares climbed to their highest in 6 weeks on Thursday after the energy technologies firm posted Q4 results largely in-line with estimates. Q4 adj. EPS was -$0.17 vs. -$0.21 in the year-ago period. Revenue grew 33.8% Y/Y to $28.31M, helped by higher grid segment revenues driven by strong new energy power system sales. AMSC posted strong numbers despite the pandemic causing supply chain issues and impacting raw material prices. "Our team successfully positioned the company for a potential rebound in wind and improved margins for FY22," said Daniel McGahn, CEO, AMSC.
