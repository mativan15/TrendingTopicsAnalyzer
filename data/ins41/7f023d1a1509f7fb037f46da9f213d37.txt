Chip Somodevilla Investment Thesis Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) mission is 'to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together', and whilst the latter is somewhat debatable, the company has certainly changed the way we interact and connect forever. Meta's core business revolves around its family of four apps: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, which have a combined 2.88 billion daily active people - that is, ~36% of the world's population use at least one of these apps on a daily basis.
