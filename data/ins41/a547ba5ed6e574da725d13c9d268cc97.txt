You can forgive the Houston Astros if they're experiencing a bit of déjà vu ahead of Game 1 of the ALCS on Wednesday.

Houston will now host the New York Yankees to kick off the ALCS in three of the last six seasons, with the 2017 and 2019 ALCS featuring matchups between the American League powers. Houston won each series in dramatic fashion en route to a pair of World Series appearances, highlighted by José Altuve's walk-off dinger in Game 6 of the 2019 ALCS.

There's no guarantee of a repeat this year.
