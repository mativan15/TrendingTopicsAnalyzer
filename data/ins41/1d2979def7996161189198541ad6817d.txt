The development of new gene therapies designed to treat or cure a range of diseases is rising exponentially. Access remains an issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where disease burden is highest. Five clinical experts across LMICs explain what steps need to be taken to realize the potential of gene therapies globally. 

 Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can and should play a leading role in dictating the future of the world's most advanced healthcare technologies, according to the World Economic Forum's Accelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies: Case Studies from Low- and Middle-Income Countries white paper.
