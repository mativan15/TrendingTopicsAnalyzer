The Kashimira police on Tuesday traced the 39-year-old man who allegedly murdered his seven-year-old daughter with the help of his wife last Sunday. The police said while this was supposed to be a case of a suicide pact, the man could not kill himself even as his wife and child consumed poison.
The accused, Ryan Breco, is likely to be booked and arrested for murder, along with his wife Poonam (30), who is currently admitted in the hospital, said police. 'The couple decided to kill themselves and their daughter because they faced acute financial crisis,' said an officer.
