Just a few hours removed from a historic 18-inning win over the Seattle Mariners that clinched a record sixth straight trip to the American League Championship Series, the Houston Astros received some more good news.

The Astros have secured home-field advantage through the World Series. Of course, they will have to beat the winner of the Cleveland Guardians and New York Yankees in the ALCS first in order to get there.

This development came about as a result of the San Diego Padres upsetting the Los Angeles Dodgers three games to one in the National League Division Series.
