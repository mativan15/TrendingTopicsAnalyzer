Long before Anupamaa actor Rupali Ganguly's line ‘main ghumu firu nachu gau (I may travel, dance, sing)' became a hit trend on social media and was even enacted by several Bollywood celebrities like Vidya Balan, Salman Khan too had said something similar during an interview. The actor was questioned about choosing to perform at an event hosted by a political party. He had said that he performed to raise money and could do whatever he wanted to with his money.
