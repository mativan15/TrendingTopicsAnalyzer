We're more than half way through the 2022 college football schedule and as we enter the Week 8 slate of games on Saturday, we'll see some important division and conference races heat up this weekend.

Several top 25 ranked teams are idle, but we still have a half dozen head-to-head matchups between ranked schools on the same field.

That includes a pair of games coming out of the Big 12, one battle of contenders in the Pac-12, a surprise matchup to decide first place in the ACC Atlantic, and one long-time rivalry out of the SEC.
