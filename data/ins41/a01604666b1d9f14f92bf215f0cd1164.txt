Ready for a good, ol' fashioned Halloween, like the ones we used to know before a scary pandemic came along and sent beloved traditions into the shadows?

Our communities are ready. All throughout coastal Southern Maine – and a bit inland too – events are planned in the coming days to make for a spooky and memorable Halloween. Halloween is on a Monday this year, so most of these festivities are planned for the days leading up to Oct. 31.

This list is by no means definitive but offers plenty of fun and eerie opportunities.
