The Western sanctions against Russian oligarchs are no different than those against Osama bin Laden, one expert said, and he has seen the same sort of informal, secretive network of asset transfers develop among the oligarchs.The sanctions were imposed on oligarchs with close ties to Vladimir Putin in response to his invasion of Ukraine, in a bid to put pressure on the Russian president. Russian oligarchs — some of the world's wealthiest people — have had their assets frozen, from superyachts, artworks, and properties to private jets.
