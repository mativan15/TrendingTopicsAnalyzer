CAMDEN, N.J.–The Philadelphia 76ers will use the early portion of the 2022-23 season to figure out what works best for their rotation. Coach Doc Rivers did say that the rotation will be fluid as he works through everything he has on the roster.
They open the season on Tuesday against the Boston Celtics and Rivers will have to figure out how the rotation will play out on the floor. That means he will have to figure out the role of Shake Milton.
The fifth-year veteran out of SMU figures to be the team's backup ball-handler, but there is also De'Anthony Melton to handle the ball.
