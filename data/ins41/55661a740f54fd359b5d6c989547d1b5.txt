Jack Whitehall may have got off on the wrong foot with Jamie Redknapp's baby boy as the little one looked highly unimpressed with his dad's friend making for quite the hilarious photo. 
Former Liverpool player Jamie had company round over the weekend to spend the ultimate boys' afternoon watching the big game, presumably between his old team and Manchester City. 
He invited comedian Jack and actor Keith Ewell over to his family home for the match and 10-month-old Raphael got involved with the action too.
