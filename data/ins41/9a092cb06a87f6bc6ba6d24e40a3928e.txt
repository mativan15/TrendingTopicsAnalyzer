India's 5-percent broken white rice is at least $50 per tonne cheaper than that of Vietnam and $100 cheaper than Thailand.BANGKOK: A pact between Thailand and Vietnam to raise rice prices would be "impossible", a top Thai industry official said on Monday, in another sign of opposition to a government-proposed plan for a rice cartel amid a global food crisis. Thailand's government said on Friday it planned with Vietnam to create a pact between the world's second- and third-largest rice exporters to boost their bargaining power and help mitigate rising production costs.
