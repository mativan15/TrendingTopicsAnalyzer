Sid Sutton, the chief executive of Sale Sharks, has called for independent regulation of the Premiership to end a culture of 'self-interest' among club owners.
The competition's unwieldy decision-making process, with all stakeholder clubs often required to agree unanimously on an issue, has come under increased scrutiny since both Worcester Warriors and Wasps became engulfed in financial turmoil.
Worcester will take no further part in this season's Premiership and Wasps, also in administration, are currently suspended with extremely bleak prospects of playing again in 2022-23 given their players have been made redundant and are looking for new clubs.
