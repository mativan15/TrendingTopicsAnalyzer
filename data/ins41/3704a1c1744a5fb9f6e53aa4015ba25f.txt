A snake has caused panic in the business class section of a recent US flight. Local TV outlet News 12 New Jersey said some passengers were left 'shrieking' when the stowaway made its appearance as United Airlines Flight 2038 was taxiing at Newark Liberty International Airport. It turned out to be a harmless garter snake which seems to have slithered on board while the plane was on the tarmac earlier in Tampa, Florida. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed it had removed the snake and released it into the wild.
