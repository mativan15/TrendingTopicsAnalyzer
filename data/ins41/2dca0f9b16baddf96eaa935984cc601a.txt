LOS ANGELES — The Mets' next potential big thing will be awaiting when they return to Citi Field in 1 ½ weeks. 
Team officials and players are intrigued by a new high-tech pitching machine the organization has purchased from Canada that represents another leap into the technology market under owner Steve Cohen. 
According to hitting coach Eric Chavez, the new machine will replicate the delivery of any pitcher that is inputted. 
'[The machine] will be the pitcher, so if we draw up Clayton Kershaw we will be facing Kershaw, his windup and everything and his pitches,' Chavez said Friday before the Mets' 2-0 loss to the Dodgers.
