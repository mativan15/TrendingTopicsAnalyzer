The man who married a former Japanese princess has passed the New York bar exam, defying detractors back home who had criticised their romance.Kei Komuro's name is on the list of those who passed the July New York state bar exam, which was posted on Friday on The New York State Board of Law Examiners web site.Komuro's engagement to former Princess Mako, announced in 2017, prompted a widespread public outcry, mostly on social media and in the tabloids.One reason was a financial problem of Komuro's mother, although that's since been resolved.
