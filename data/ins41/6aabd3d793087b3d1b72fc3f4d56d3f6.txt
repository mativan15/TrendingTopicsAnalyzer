When Xi Jinping came to power a decade ago, China had just overtaken Japan to become the world's second largest economy. It has grown at a phenomenal pace since then. With an average annual growth rate of 6.7% since 2012, China has seen one of the fastest sustained expansions for a major economy in history. In 2021, its GDP hit nearly $18 trillion, constituting 18.4% of the global economy, according to the World Bank. China's rapid technological advances have also made it a strategic threat to the United States and its allies.
