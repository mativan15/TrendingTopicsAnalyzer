20 Oct 2022, 11:19 AM ISTThe recent repo rate hikes by the RBI have pushed up home loan rates from 6.7% in April to 8.1%. This will go up further after home loan companies factor in the 30 September hike. Borrowers who took long-term loans 2-3 years ago are saddled with tenures 5-6 years longer than their original terms. If rates don't come down, someone who took a 20-year home loan in 2019 at 6.7% would have to pay roughly 62 additional EMIs.Analysts expect things to get worse before they get better.
