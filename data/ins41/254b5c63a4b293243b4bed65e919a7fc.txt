Arsenal could stand a better chance than Manchester United of signing Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong, as Wolves say they remain "realistic" over their hopes of keeping Ruben Neves

Arsenal have had their hopes of hijacking Manchester United's move for Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong boosted after his past comments about his planned career path were uncovered.

Spanish giants Barca may have to cash in on the Dutch midfielder this summer amid ongoing speculation about their financial situation. New United manager Erik ten Hag is said to be interested in reuniting with his former Ajax ace, although De Jong's previous statement suggests the player himself would prefer to make the switch to Arsenal.
