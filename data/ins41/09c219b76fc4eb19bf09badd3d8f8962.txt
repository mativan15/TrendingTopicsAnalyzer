If a storm hits, each household should be self-sufficient for a minimum of three days. Now is the time to stock up, before stores get crowded and supplies run out. If you already have a hurricane kit, check it and remove anything with an expiration date before Nov. 30 of this year.

Supplies

CLEAN CONTAINERS for storing drinking water: You will need a gallon per person per day for drinking and sanitation. Have a two-week supply on hand for each person. Food-grade plastic containers that have screw caps, such as 2-liter soda bottles, are best.
