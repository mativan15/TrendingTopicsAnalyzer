Jets wide receiver Elijah Moore tweeted some frustration Sunday about his lack of opportunities, particularly in Week 6's win over the Packers. That may have just been a loud therapy session for him and now all is good in the world between him and his coach.

Head coach Robert Saleh told reporters Monday he spoke with Moore about the tweets and understands Moore just wants to contribute to the team.

'He's fine. He's a competitive young man,' Saleh said. 'He wants to contribute.'

Saleh also added that contributions don't always just come from production.
