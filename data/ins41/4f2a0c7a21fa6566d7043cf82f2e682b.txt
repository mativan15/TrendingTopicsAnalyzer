NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing debate over freebies, home minister Amit Shah said on Thursday that the Delhi government wanted the capital to be dependent on AAP.Speaking at the launch of the waste-to-energy plant in south Delhi's Tehkhand on Thursday, Shah said, "Kejriwal's party wants Delhi to be AAP-nirbhar while BJP wants the country to be aatmanirbhar." The minister said the AAP government had not provided funds to MCD.Union home minister Shah came down heavily on the Delhi government and charged it with "stepmotherly" treatment of the erstwhile three municipal corporations in Delhi by not releasing funds they were eligible for in AAP's seven years at the helm.
