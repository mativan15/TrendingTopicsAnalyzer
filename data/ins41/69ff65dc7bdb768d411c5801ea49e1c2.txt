da-kuk I think that ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment as we are likely to see the benefits of its relatively defensive business compared to other parts of software. As elaborated in my earlier article on ServiceNow that can be found here, the company has a core IT service management and operations business that is, in my view, a rather defensive category in software as the budgets for IT departments continue to grow. The other segments of the company serve as opportunity for cross-sell and upsell as ServiceNow looks to gain share in their employee workflow, customer workflow and creator workflow segments respectively.
