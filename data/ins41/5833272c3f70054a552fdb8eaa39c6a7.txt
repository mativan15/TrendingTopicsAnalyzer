(RTTNews) - Shares of Nokia Corp. (NOK) were losing around 6 percent in the morning trading in Finland after the Finnish critical networks and communications company Thursday maintained its fiscal 2022 outlook for net sales in constant currency, as well as comparable operating margin towards the mid-point of expected range. In its third quarter, comparable operating margin was weak mainly due to the decline in Nokia Technologies, while net profit and net sales increased. For fiscal 2022, on a reported basis, net sales are now expected to be 23.
