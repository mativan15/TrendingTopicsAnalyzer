Elon Musk may face a federal investigation in the US, after making officials 'uncomfortable' with his remarks about Ukraine, Bloomberg has claimed, citing anonymous sources in the government.Persons within the US government and intelligence community are 'weighing what tools, if any' are available to target the billionaire, the Friday report said. These discussions were described as being 'at an early stage.'One of the options, according to Bloomberg, is to subject Musk's business ventures to a review by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
