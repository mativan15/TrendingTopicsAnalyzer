Travelers looking to save a few bucks on flights this year should be aware of which day they're booking their tickets, according to new data from Expedia. You can save an average of 15% if you book an international flight on a Sunday versus Friday, the online travel group notes in its recently released 2023 Air Travel Hacks Report in partnership with the Airlines Reporting Corporation.  For domestic flights, those savings average about 5%. The two companies analyzed average round-trip ticket prices for flights originating in the United States during the first eight months of this year.
