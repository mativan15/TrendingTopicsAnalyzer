HOUSTON — Giancarlo Stanton is finally returning to the outfield for Game 1 of the ALCS.
The Yankees slugger will start in left field against the Astros at Minute Maid Park on Wednesday, his first start in the field since July 21 before he dealt with Achilles and foot injuries.
Moving Stanton out of the DH spot allows Matt Carpenter to get his first start of the postseason there against Astros ace Justin Verlander.
Isiah Kiner-Falefa also returned to shortstop after his defensive struggles led to him getting benched for the final two games of the ALDS in favor of Oswaldo Cabrera.
