Senator Cory Booker sounded a pessimistic note on the US government's ability and willingness to reform gun control laws in the country while appearing on a Sunday morning talk show.When pressed by NBC host Chuck Todd about some of the proposed solutions that have been floated in the days since a brutal mass shooting in Texas left 19 children and two teachers dead, the New Jersey senator acknowledged that none of these pieces of legislation, even if passed, would solve America's gun problem.'The red flag law or the expanded background check wouldn't have done anything,' Todd began.
