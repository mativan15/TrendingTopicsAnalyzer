After Liz Truss announced her resignation, a leadership election will be completed within the next week to replace the shortest-serving prime minister in British history.
George Canning previously held that record, serving 119 days in 1827 when he died. Truss accomplished only 45 days in office.
Given the divisions in the Conservative Party, there is no obvious candidate and any replacement would face a country likely heading into a recession.
Al Jazeera's Charlie Angela, reporting from Westminster, said events have moved much faster than anyone in the United Kingdom anticipated.
