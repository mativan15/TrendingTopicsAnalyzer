(Bloomberg) -- Daimler Truck Holding AG sees promising signs of moving past the prolonged chip shortage that has beset manufacturers globally, the head of the company's Mercedes truck brand said.  After months of factory outages due to the component shortfalls, the order backlog is keeping factories busy even as the global economy shows signs of sputtering, Karin Radstrom, who also leads the truckmaker's business in Europe and South America, said in an interview. The world's biggest truckmaker has so far also evaded disruption from coronavirus lockdowns in China, she said.
