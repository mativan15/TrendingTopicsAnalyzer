'I'm trying to get songs on country radio,' says Steve Earle. It's not what anyone would expect to hear from Earle these days, especially when we're supposed to be discussing Jerry Jeff, his new tribute album to Seventies Texas legend Jerry Jeff Walker.

But even if the idea of a mainstream country hit makes him chuckle, Earle is completely serious. Of the endless creative projects the 67-year-old singer-songwriter is juggling after the end of his nightly appearances in the off-Broadway play Coal Country — prepping for a tour with the Dukes, working on a novel, awaiting word on a TV pilot that's 'a science-fiction thing set in Marfa,' covering the Grateful Dead's 'Casey Jones,' and painting — nothing has Earle more excited than Tender Mercies, the 1983 film about a down-and-out country singer he's spent the past year and a half turning into a musical with playwright Daisy Foote.
