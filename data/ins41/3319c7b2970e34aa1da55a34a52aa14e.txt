Amazon just introduced a new tool to fight off bots and scalpers and give you a better chance to finally buy that PS5 or Xbox Series X you've been desperately clicking around for. The retailer is now letting shoppers request an invitation to purchase the highly in-demand PS5, with the Xbox Series X set to join the program in the next few days.
 

 In order to participate, simply visit Amazon's PS5 page and click the 'Request Invitation' button. When the retailer's next drop happens, you'll get an email invitation that will be valid for 72 hours.
