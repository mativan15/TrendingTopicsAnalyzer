According to the DWP, one of the most underclaimed benefits is Attendance Allowance with around 3.4 million pensioners predicted to be missing out on the extra cash boost each month. Attendance Allowance is paid to Britons who are of state pension age, which is 66 years, and who have a disability or condition that affects their everyday life. Medical conditions that could make someone eligible to qualify include things such as arthritis, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or mental health issues such as dementia.
