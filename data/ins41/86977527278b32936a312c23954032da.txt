Nearly a dozen people, including five Russian nationals and two oil brokers from Venezuela, were arrested and charged in a scheme to send American military technology to Russia, some of which has been allegedly found on battlefields in Ukraine, according to the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors, with help from the department's Task Force KleptoCapture, revealed two separate indictments yesterday. The task force was stood up earlier this year to enforce sanctions against the Russian elite.

'As I have said, our investigators and prosecutors will be relentless in their efforts to identify, locate, and bring to justice those whose illegal acts undermine the rule of law and enable the Russian regime to continue its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.
