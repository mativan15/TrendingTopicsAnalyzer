The Competition Commission has ordered a detailed probe against state-owned IREL for alleged abuse of its dominant position in supplying and pricing of beach sand ilmenite in the country. The order has been passed on a complaint filed by Tamil Nadu-based Beach Mineral Producers Association (informant) which alleged that the company was indulging in unfair pricing beach sand ilmenite, among other issues. To assess the matter, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) considered 'mining and supply of beach sand ilmenite in India' as the relevant market.
