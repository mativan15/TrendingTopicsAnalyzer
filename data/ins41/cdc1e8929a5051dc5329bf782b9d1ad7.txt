Ed Sheeran was one of the over 80 identified artists that fell prey to Adrian Kwiatkowski's 2019 hack.

Bad habits lead to...jail. Adrian Kwiatkowski is facing prison after absconding with unreleased music he reportedly hacked from singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and hip-hop artist Lil Uzi Vert following an investigation that began in 2019.



Ed Sheeran is a polarizing musician. Some love his songs, others believe he's a pop sellout chasing a check, and one man apparently just wanted to hack him. That man was Adrian Kwiatkowski, who authorities say hacked the 'Bad Habits' singer-songwriter along with rapper Lil Uzi Vert, getting away with some of their unreleased material.
