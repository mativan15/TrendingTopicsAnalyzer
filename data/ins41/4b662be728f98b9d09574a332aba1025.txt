Jun. 5—WILKES-BARRE — For Ryan Cerulli, owning a downtown business is a vehicle for bringing the community together.

Cerulli, 33, owns and operates Sword in the Stone Games, 117 S. Washington St. The business in itself was built from a passion for gaming, for art, for adventure and for all things deemed "epic".

And that's no exaggeration. You name it, Cerulli's got it.

Initially born from a Magic: The Gathering card collection, Sword in the Stone boasts other well-known trading card games like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon and Digimon, just to name a few.
