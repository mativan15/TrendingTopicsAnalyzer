Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said on Tuesday that it was 'not the right thing to do' to reintroduce the National Insurance hike scrapped by Liz Truss in her mini-Budget.Despite abandoning almost all of Ms Truss's tax cuts on Monday, Jeremy Hunt maintained the lower rate of National Insurance Contributions - costing the Treasury £12 billion a year.
