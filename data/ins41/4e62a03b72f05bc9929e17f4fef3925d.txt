Rosemount's boys' soccer team was counting on its five returning starters from the Class 3A state tournament runner-up group of a year ago. Irish coach Todd Farrington didn't take injuries into account.

"We were hit with a lot of significant injuries at the beginning of the season," Farrington said. "We were short five to seven starters the first seven games of the season. Our top player, Reid Wolf, is still out. We're hoping to get him back next week. Two other returning starters were out the first three weeks.
