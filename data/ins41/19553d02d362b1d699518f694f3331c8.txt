Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a two-day tour of Uttarakhand, offered prayers at the famous Kedarnath temple — one of the four holy Hindu pilgrimage sites located in the Garhwal Himalayan range in the state's Rudraprayag district. While performing puja at the temple, he was seen wearing a traditional white-coloured ‘chola dora' which was, reportedly, gifted to him by the Chamba women of Himachal Pradesh.
Featuring fine handwork and a ‘swastika' symbol embroidered on it, the ensemble was gifted to PM Modi during his recent visit to Himachal Pradesh.
