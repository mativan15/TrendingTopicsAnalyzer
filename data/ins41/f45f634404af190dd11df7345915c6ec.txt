The opening fixture could hardly have gone better for Shaun Wane's men as they demolished a talented Samoa team billed as pre-match favourites 60-6 at Newcastle's St James' Park. With further group games to come against France and minnows Greece, the win virtually assures England of a place in the knockout stages and, if they were able to finish top, they would most likely avoid another dangerous Pacific Island nation, Tonga, in the quarter-finals.
