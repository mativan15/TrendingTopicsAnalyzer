TRAVELByGRIFFIN BARRYI TOOK ship for Eire by way of England last March, the only route available, and in the only craft. Once she had gone on world cruises, lately had been a troopship, and now the hoofprints of a returning army were on her. Furniture sagged, paneling was notched; but on this eastward voyage the tourist trade put out an early tendril. A few of us were civilians, out to rediscover a cockeyed world. We paid $176.50 for a single eastward passage; no roundtrip ticket was available and a warning was given that Army priorities would block our way home until late in 1946.
