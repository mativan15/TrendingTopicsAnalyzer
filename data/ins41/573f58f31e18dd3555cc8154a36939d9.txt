Mat Hayward/Getty Images Entertainment It's been over two years since I last covered iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT) for Seeking Alpha. In August 2020, I liked enough of what I saw in the company's revenue trend, podcasting content growth, and balance sheet situation to take a speculative long. The stock was $9.44 at the time of publishing and ultimately eclipsed $28 within 12 months. I did sell the run in 2020 and didn't look back. Like countless other names, iHeart was almost certainly a beneficiary of central bank liquidity and the broad "stay at home" trade that benefited many of the media stocks like Roku (ROKU) and Spotify (SPOT).
