The CEO of Tesla said the EV maker's market cap could be more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.

Apple and Aramco are the world's top two companies by market capitalization.

The combined market cap of Aramco and Apple is six times that of Tesla, at today's stock price.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, said on Wednesday his electric vehicle company could become more valuable than the world's two largest companies — Apple and Saudi Aramco.
