New York (CNN Business)A week after taking off at the box office, "Top Gun: Maverick" is still flying high.The sequel to the 1986 blockbuster — which has Tom Cruise's Pete "Maverick" Mitchell teach a new set of recruits about the need for speed — made an estimated $86 million domestically in its second weekend, according to Paramount (PGRE).That's a drop of just 32% from the film's record setting opening last weekend. That type of a drop for a blockbuster is pretty remarkable since most are front loaded — making a lot of their money in the opening weekend.
