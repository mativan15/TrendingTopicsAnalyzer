The Austin area is expected to have the second-fastest growing economy in the U.S. in 2022, trailing only San Francisco.

Central Texas is projected to see economic growth of 4.3% this year, according to a new report from the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School. After San Francisco and Austin, Seattle, Raleigh and Dallas round out the top five in terms of what the report calls GDP growth but others call GMP growth — that is, gross domestic product or gross metropolitan product.
