Seattle-based online cannabis marketplace Leafly Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: LFLY) is reducing its headcount by 56 employees, or 21% of its total workforce.

The reduced headcount, announced Tuesday, will come through both layoffs and natural attrition. Leafly said in a regulatory filing the reduction would finish by the end of the year.

A company spokesperson didn't specify how many of the roles would be cut through layoffs versus attrition but said the company will have 206 employees remaining after the cuts.
