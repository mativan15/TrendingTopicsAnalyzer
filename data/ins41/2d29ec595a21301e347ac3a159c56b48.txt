It was supposed to be simple: Wellington City Council would put its cash-strapped housing unit into a different ownership model and new tenants would get a much-needed rental subsidy. It worked for Christchurch City Council, which established a community housing provider (CHP) to manage its housing in 2016, and since then has received the income-related rental subsidy (IRRS) for new tenants. It also worked for Auckland Council, which did the same in 2017. Except a recent Government policy change means $9.
