I was pretty sceptical when a friend said he was planning to open the first bookshop to grace Balham High Road for 20 years. It seemed a rash venture at a time when Amazon will send you the complete works of Trollope at a discount without you having to stir from your sofa. My doubts, however, were misplaced, for Backstory is throbbing.I suspect it is benefiting from a few subtle but important social changes. First, working from home means more Balhamites are out and about in the high street than before, and since Balham is a bit short of alternative entertainment they gravitate towards the bookshop.
