The Patriots have a few players that could be moved at the deadline, according to experts.

Kendrick Bourne hasn't continued his year one success into year two with New England the way many hoped.

Through the first five games of the season, the biggest storylines surrounding Bourne have been why he hasn't played more than he has. He played just two offensive snaps in the Patriots' season-opening loss to the Dolphins after he was reportedly sent home before a preseason game due to being late to a meeting.
