Warning: spoilers ahead for RuPaul's Drag Race UK season 4 episode 5.
On the latest episode of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, one queen made the shock decision to cut their time in the competition short by leaving the show of their own accord.
The fifth episode of season 4 saw the eight remaining contestants take part in the Mary Poppins-inspired Rusical, aptly named ‘Lairy Musical', complete with a bird-human hybrid and a character inspired by a cockroach.
Following the musical-inspired runway – which was also watched by guest judge Hannah Waddingham – RuPaul announced that Baby and Dakota Schiffer would be going up against each other in the lip sync for their lives in a bid to stay in the running for the crown.
