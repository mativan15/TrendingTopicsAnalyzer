French trade unions started a nationwide strike on Tuesday to demand higher salaries amid a cost of living crisis and high inflation.The strike is an extension of the weeks-long industrial action that has disrupted France's major refineries and put petrol stations' supply in disarray across the country.It also has the potential to be a major problem for Emmanuel Macron's government.The strike is mainly affecting the public sector but some Eurostar services between Paris and London have been cancelled.
