Agra : During his first posting as district social welfare officer in Muzaffarnagar, Rinkoo Singh Rahee, 40, was shot at by local goons in collusion with his own staff, for exposing a scam in the social welfare department. Yet he stood unwavering in his resolve to fight corruption. He felt empowering himself would help in continuing his fight against corruption, so he resolved to clear the civil services exam and finally did it in his sixteenth attempt. A resident of Dori Nagar in Aligarh, Rinkoo Rahee passed Class 12 from the Government Inter College in Aligarh, where his father ran an ‘aata chakki' till recently.
