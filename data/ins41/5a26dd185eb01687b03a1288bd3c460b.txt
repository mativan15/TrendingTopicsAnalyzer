BalkansCat Shares of Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) have been hard hit this year as hopes of a post-reopening bounce quickly faded as China persisted in its COVID-zero policy. EL is among the companies most exposed to activity in China and Europe, which has created many years of growth but is a significant headwind now. Consequently when its reports fiscal Q1 earnings on November 2nd, I see risk of a downside surprise as guidance appears optimistic. While shares are down, at an over 28x, EL is not yet a cheap stock.
