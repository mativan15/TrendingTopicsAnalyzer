Throughout 2022, Wall Street titans and top economists have relentlessly warned Americans that a recession is on the way. They fear that unless inflation goes down, allowing the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes or even pivot to rate cuts, the outlook for the U.S. economy and the stock market is bleak. The S&P 500 has already cratered more than 22% year to date, and any stock market rallies have quickly been labeled short-lived bear market traps by investment banks. But now, a new Bank of America survey shows that 87% of fund managers believe inflation has peaked, and 79% believe it will fall over the next 12 months, which could lead the way for a Fed pivot.
