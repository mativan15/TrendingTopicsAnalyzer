Several Jewish community leaders say they were blindsided by the Albanese government's decision to reverse recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, describing the handling of the issue as 'shoddy' and 'a gratuitous insult'.A Labor parliamentarian has also privately said the government 'mishandled' the sensitive issue and should not be 'making foreign policy on the fly' after Israel's foreign ministry summoned the Australian ambassador to demand an explanation.Jewish community representatives were surprised by a Guardian Australia report on Monday revealing the Morrison government-era decision was being reversed, and contacted the government seeking clarity.
