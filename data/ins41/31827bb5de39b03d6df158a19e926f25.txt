SINGAPORE — Singapore's deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat warned retail investors to 'steer clear' of cryptocurrencies following the recent Terra Luna crash which saw investors losing life savings.

That said, the crypto asset space, while highly risky, still had the potential to transform the future of finance, said Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, on Tuesday (31 March) at the opening of the Asia Tech x Singapore 2022 Summit.
