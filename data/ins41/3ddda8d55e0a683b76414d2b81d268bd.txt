The New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs are not slated to play during the 2022 regular season, and that's proven beneficial for quarterback Daniel Jones in an unexpected way.
Shortly after hiring Brian Daboll as their next head coach, the Giants went out and added Mike Kafka as their offensive coordinator. It was an opportunity the long-time Chiefs assistant couldn't pass up.
It was a loss for Patrick Mahomes, however. But rather than sulking, he's taken to helping Kafka adjust to his new role while also helping the Giants quarterbacks adjust to Kafka's offensive system.
