Jana Kramer said this week that ex-husband Mike Caussin cheated on her with more than 13 women during their nearly six-year marriage. "That has to be really painful," "Red Table Talk" co-host Jada Pinkett Smith empathized in a preview clip Tuesday of Wednesday's Facebook Watch show. "I know we're both in better situations," the country star told the co-hosts through tears, "But I think about this year, my kids won't wake up at my house Christmas Day. That one's gonna hurt." The couple, who share Jolie, 6, and Jace, 3, divorced last year after marrying in 2015.
