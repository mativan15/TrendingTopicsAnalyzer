(RTTNews) - Turkey's manufacturing activity contracted at a stable pace in May amid a slowdown in demand, survey results from S&P Global showed on Wednesday. The headline Istanbul Chamber of Industry Turkey manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index remained unchanged at 49.2 in May. Any reading below 50.0 indicates deterioration in the sector. Output and new orders eased in May for the sixth and eighth months, respectively. New export orders decreased to the greatest extent in two years. Staffing level increased for the twenty-four months in a row, albeit modestly.
