Summary of May 2022Stock Portfolio @ End of May22Since reaching its height in Feb22, my stock portfolio value has been gradually shrinking non-stop like a leaking pipe.May is the worst month to my portfolio so far this year with a loss of 4.2%. The main culprit is the 17% decline of Maybulk while most tech-related stocks also suffered in this month.Year-to-date loss stands at 9% but it's still better than year 2016 & 2018 which suffered loss of 14.7% and 13.5% respectively at this stage.There seems to be nothing special happening in May, just the old stories of inflation, US rate hike and Russia-Ukraine war.
