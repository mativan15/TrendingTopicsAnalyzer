It's time to pack your bags for a third season of Ultimate Girls Trip!

The Real Housewives are returning for an all-girls getaway, and this time, they're touching down in Thailand.

Peacock debuted a very generous sneak peek at BravoCon on Sunday during a panel featuring some of the Housewives on the trip: Real Housewives of New York City's Leah McSweeney, Real Housewives of Potomac's Gizelle Bryant and Candiace Dillard-Bassett; Real Housewives of Salt Lake City's Heather Gay and Whitney Rose, and Real Housewives of Miami's Alexia Echevarria and Marysol Patton.
