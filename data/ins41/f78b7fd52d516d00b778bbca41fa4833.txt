To the Editor:

Re ' Adapting to Disability Isn't a Crutch. It's the Future,' by David M. Perry (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 14):

John Fetterman is refreshingly real, but I wasn't that invested in his campaign before. I am now. It's not just about electing one man; it is about proving that vile ableist attacks don't work. If we do let them work, stigma in and outside politics will increase.

There are many Americans with disabilities and accommodations who see ourselves in John Fetterman's recovery and the bullying he receives.
