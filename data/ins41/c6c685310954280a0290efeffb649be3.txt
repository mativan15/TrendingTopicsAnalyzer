With Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor geared up for Congress presidential contest on Monday, the battle marks the prospect, albeit technically, of a non-Gandhi party chief since 1988. With the stamp of Gandhi-Vadra-led Congress establishment over Kharge's candidature, notwithstanding the family's projected neutrality, the curiosity is limited to whether Tharoor will lose as badly as some of the previous contestants or he will notch up decent votes.

The choreography of the selection/nomination of Kharge left none in doubt that the Gandhi-Vadra trio - that led Congress to its worst two Lok Sabha poll defeats, with the party regimes now limited to Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh - and their nominated colleagues/delegates are determined to maintain their hold on the party.
