The case against Johnny Depp may not be all that Amber Heard lost this week. Rumours are rife that the actress, who is best known for her role in the DC superhero film 'Aquaman', may just be cut out from the film's sequel that is slated to release next year. A report on The Direct claims that a 'reliable insider' has revealed that all of Heard's scenes as Mera will be deleted from 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' following a meeting between Warner Bros. bosses. 
The portal quotes a Twitter handle KC Walsh that alleges that Mera may die during childbirth at the start of the sequel, but its upcoming test screening will be telling.
