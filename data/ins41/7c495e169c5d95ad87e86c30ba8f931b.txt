Facebook says it is considering blocking Canadians' access to news sites on its platform, in response to a proposed federal law that would force it to compensate media outlets for carrying links to their articles.The tech giant upped the stakes in the battle over the online news bill, warning it may block Canadians from sharing or viewing news content out of frustration over the government's 'misguided' approach.Facebook issued its warning after it was not called to give evidence before a Commons committee considering Bill C-18 to voice its concerns and suggest changes, alongside Google.
