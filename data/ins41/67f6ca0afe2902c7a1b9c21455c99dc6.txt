After two years of being postponed, a local group is gearing up to raise money in support of local homeless families.

Family Promise of Greene County's Empty Bowl Dinner and Silent Auction is set to return this Thursday, Oct 20 at Hillside Chapel in Beavercreek. It will run from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.

For $25, those who attend can get a dinner including the choice soup, bread, homemade dessert and a beverage with a handmade bowl for each quest to take home. Children under the age of five eat for free.
