Downing Street has indicated the pension triple lock could be scrapped as the government tries to plug a multi-billion pound hole in its finances.

The prime minister is no longer standing by her commitment to increase state pensions in line with soaring inflation as new chancellor Jeremy Hunt overhauls her leadership.

On Monday, Hunt failed to guarantee he would maintain the triple lock and said decisions would be taken 'through the prism of what matters' to the most vulnerable.
