Nothing Ear (stick) design revealed days before launch. No ear-tips like ear(1), check colour.
 Nothing Ear (Stick) is only days away from an official launch but as is the norm, Nothing cannot hold on to secrets. We now already know what the Ear (Stick) looks like in its entirety, thanks to Nothing revealing the product in its entirety. The Ear (Stick) appears to be a simpler version of the Ear (1) earbuds from last year and the focus on this one remains entirely on its design. A clear look also reveals the design of the earbuds for the first time.
