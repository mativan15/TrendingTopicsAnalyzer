Ohio Republican Senate candidate JD Vance called out his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan, for following what he suggested is the liberal standard in accusing him of being a racist. During a debate Friday, Ryan accused Vance of supporting what the left calls "The Great Replacement Theory" – allegations that liberals seek to change the ethnic and racial makeup of the United States through unfettered immigration and insecure elections. Ryan had appeared to link Vance's politics with that of the Buffalo grocery store shooter who sought to target Black Americans.
