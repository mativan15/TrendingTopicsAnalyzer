Business travel is back. The benefits of being a business traveler are not. After two years of virtual meetings and remote work, 'companies are getting back to doing interviews in person, and even conferences and conventions are coming back in full force,' said Nina Herold, the general manager of TripActions, a travel management firm. Sales teams are hitting the road, and employees are starting to return to headquarters for team building, recognition events and orientation, she said. The industry isn't at pre-pandemic levels yet, and a recent study from Deloitte, a multinational accounting and consulting firm, predicts business travel overall won't fully return to 2019 levels for at least a couple more years.
