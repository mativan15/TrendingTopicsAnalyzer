(Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition parties are considering a plan to wind up the country's U.S.-backed interim government led by Juan Guaido, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing a senior figure in the opposition alliance.

Three of the four main parties in the Unitary Platform opposition alliance backed the move and had enough votes to push ahead with it, the FT said.

A spokesman for Guaido told the paper that there was no clear position among the opposition parties about the continuation of the interim government.
