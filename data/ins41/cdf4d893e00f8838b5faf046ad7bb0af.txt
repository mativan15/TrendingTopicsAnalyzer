JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Reuters) - Mining and commodity trading giant Glencore has helped to fund Zambia's Mopani Copper Mines as the company has been unable to pay its bills on time and the state has yet to find a new investor more than a year after it took over the complex.Glencore (GLEN.L), which sold Mopani to state mining investment firm ZCCM-IH (ZCCM.LZ), has since helped cover some of Mopani's running costs, including power bills and purchases of copper concentrate from third parties, two sources with direct knowledge said.
