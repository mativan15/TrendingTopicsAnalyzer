Republican Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker insisted Sunday he was not trying to claim he was a member of law enforcement when he showed off an honorary sheriff's badge during a debate with Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock — before missing a second showdown in the closely watched race.
The former football star was widely mocked and accused of exaggerating his credentials when he pulled out the Johnson County badge during Friday's debate with Warnock.
Walker admitted to NBC News in an interview that the badge was 'honorary,' but also 'legit' and grants him certain authorities in the jurisdiction.
