Luxury fashion brand Balenciaga says it has formally ended its business partnership with artist and fashion designer Kanye West after he made a series of disparaging comments about Jewish people and George Floyd. 'Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist' the company said about West, who now goes by the name Ye, to WWD on Friday morning. Ye has designed numerous products for Balenciaga over the years, and he has been a major part of many of the brand's fashion shows.
