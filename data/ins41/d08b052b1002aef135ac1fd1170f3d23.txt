Monica Schipper/Getty Images EntertainmentRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been one of the massive busts in Big Tech since the middle of 2021, with the company flipping from operating profits to losses this year. Slowing product sales and a weakening digital ad environment have hamstrung low levels of profitability (so far) in a company reaching for market share and scaling overall size. The stock quote has been crushed by 90%, falling from a peak of $476 in July 2021 to $48 last week. Basically, investors have given up on the growth story, and now believe Roku will find it difficult to ever be highly profitable as currently configured.
