The two back-to-back collapse of landmark structures this week due to incessant rains has brought to fore poor maintenance of heritage buildings in the city and the lurking threat to public safety. While a portion of the Maharani's Science College collapsed on Friday, a stretch of the Mysuru palace Fort had collapsed on Monday ostensibly due to incessant rains lashing the region. In the recent past Mysuru has witnessed the collapse of Devaraja Market, Lansdowne Building, Fire Brigade office at Saraswathipuram, Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion, Fort  to name a few while many are precarious poised.
