Sean Murphy, the defending American League Gold Glove catcher and one of few bright spots on a rebuilding A's team this season, is in the running for a repeat defensive award after MLB announced the finalists at each position Thursday.

Murphy is joined in the AL catchers' race by Cal Raleigh of the division-rival Seattle Mariners and Jose Trevino of the Yankees.

The A's catcher logged 1,004 innings over 116 games behind the plate, both up from last year's Glove-winning campaign.
