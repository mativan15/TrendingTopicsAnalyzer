George Clooney said he finds it 'scary' that Donald Trump could be elected president again in 2024, and claimed that he witnessed firsthand the former president's unsavory behavior around the time of his 'Apprentice' popularity.



'I didn't think people would vote [in 2016] for someone who was so deeply flawed,' Clooney told Chris Wallace on his HBO Max talk show. '[Trump] was the guy that came to the bars and asked me about which cocktail waitress was single, you know, that's who he was.'



When asked by Wallace if he was asked such questions by Trump in the '90s, Clooney said that it happened in the 2000s.
