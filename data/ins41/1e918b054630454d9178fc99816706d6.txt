Luckily for all budding beans who are waiting for their chance to download the game on Switch or Xbox – or perhaps PS4 owners among you that missed the chance to redeem it on PlayStation Plus when it first launched there – it will be arriving very soon, so if you're looking at the PSN Store, do not buy it. Give it just a bit longer and you'll soon be able to play it for free.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout launches on Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and goes free on PC and PlayStation on June 21.
The one catch, if you can call it that, is that the game will be delisted from Steam, and instead moved to the Epic Games Store.
