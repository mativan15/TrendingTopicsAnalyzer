Ryanair flights from Stansted could be seriously disrupted this summer due to a pay dispute.Unite the union said workers employed by baggage handler Blue Handling have rejected a 4% pay offer following a 10% pay cut in 2020 during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
Blue Handling employs around 750 workers and handles around 200 flights a day during the summer holiday season.Unite said that Ryanair and Blue Handling's parent company ABM are both doing well financially, making it "unbelievable and irresponsible" that Blue Handling is "still refusing to pay decent wages".
