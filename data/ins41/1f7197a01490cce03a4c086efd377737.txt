Shame on the NRA.And, shame on anyone within a three-block radius of their convention who wasn't holding a protest sign or shouting loud profanities at these harbingers of death who had the nerve to promote weapons of mass destruction in the same state where boys and girls and teachers were slaughtered by a gun this group worships like an idol god.Shame on them.And shame on the politicians who speak on their stages, and pocket their filthy, blood money, and shift the blame on the mental health crisis when they know damn well that no 18-year-old should be able to buy a gun without a background check when kids that young can't even rent a car or buy alcohol without a fake ID.
