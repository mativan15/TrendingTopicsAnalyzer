The Washington Post's editorial board has put forward a strategy for Britain to 'right itself after Truss', claiming the nation 'looks increasingly like an isolated Atlantic island state' instead of an international player. It argues the Tories should opt for a figure like Rishi Sunak as new leader, who it says would likely be a 'steadier hand' than Ms Truss or Boris Johnson.
