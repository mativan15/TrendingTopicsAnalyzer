According to a confidential report on the war - viewed by senior UK Government officials - Putin believes losing 30,350 troops so far is a 'price worth paying' to secure a small part of Ukraine. But the report, written by a top UK analyst on Russia and revealed by The Mirror, warns the tyrant's soldiers may not last the war of attrition. This comes as the Kremlin's troops push into the city of Severodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas which remains in Ukrainian hands.The battered city appears to be at risk of becoming another Mariupol, the port city levelled by constant Russian shelling, as the city's mayor told Associated Press Russian troops have entered, power and communications have been cut and 'the city has been completely ruined'.
