The European Union has just approved new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil sales, following the United States' Sept. 30 announcement of new economic sanctions. Both announcements are in response to Russia's annexation of four regions of Ukraine. The goal of sanctions against Russia is to cripple Russia's capacity to wage war and reduce Vladimir Putin's access to the materials and financing necessary to fight. However, because there are still countries willing to purchase Russia's petroleum products, sanctions are increasing Russia's revenue, not decreasing it.
