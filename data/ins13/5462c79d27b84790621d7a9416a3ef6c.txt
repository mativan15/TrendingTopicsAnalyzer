Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top expert on infectious diseases, said in a recent interview that he developed a "bad feeling" ahead of an April 2020 White House briefing where then-President Donald Trump floated the idea of potentially treating COVID-19 with disinfectants.While speaking with ABC News journalist Jonathan Karl, Fauci said that he was in the White House before the meeting was about to start, but decided not to join Trump on the podium, where he would have been seen by millions of Americans who were looking to the federal government to get answers about the pandemic during its earliest weeks.
