Charlotte Black Restaurant week kicked off this week — but there's still time for restaurants to participate.

The sixth annual event runs through Oct. 31. It aims to support Black-owned restaurants, food trucks and other ventures, says Cathay Dawkins, founder and executive director of Black Business Owners of Charlotte.

That nonprofit is behind Charlotte Black Restaurant Restaurant week.

Restaurants will offer specials of 25% to 50% off, driving sales while raising awareness about their operations, Dawkins says.
