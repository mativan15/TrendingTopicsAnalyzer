Doug Ford will be re-elected as premier of Ontario with a majority government, CTV News declares. Polls closed across the province at 9 p.m. on Thursday and shortly after CTV News declared the Progressive Conservative leader the winner of the 2022 election. CTV News has also declared the Ontario New Democratic Party, led by Andrea Horwath, as the Official Opposition. Both Ford and Horwath have been re-elected in their own ridings of Etobicoke North and Hamilton Centre. Meanwhile Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca has lost his seat in Vaughan-Woodridge.
