According to one economist, the Indian government should be looking at China's e-commerce model for inspiration rather than the American one. Arun Kumar, speaking at a book launch in Delhi, said that "India needs to follow the Chinese model of e-commerce. They were implemented in the context of their culture. It helped connect with the rural economy and small vendors. But we are following the US (American) model".

Kumar cited the example of Taobao, a Chinese online shopping platform headquartered in Hangzhou and owned by Alibaba.
