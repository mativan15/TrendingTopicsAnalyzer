PHILADELPHIA (AP) — As rookie Spencer Strider took the mound for the first time in almost a month, the Atlanta Braves mapped out a 'best-case scenario' for the young fireballer.This wasn't it.After mowing down the Phillies early in Game 3 of the NL Division Series on Friday, a leadoff walk in the third inning and a subsequent wild pickoff throw seemed to change everything for Strider.Pretty soon, he was back on bench, shaking his head in a shaking Citizens Bank Park after Rhys Hoskins hammered a three-run homer into the left-field seats.
