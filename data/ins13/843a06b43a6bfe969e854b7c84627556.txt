Actor Maanvi Gagroo shared that she never slotted her body type in a particular box until she joined the entertainment industry. The Four More Shots Please actor recently revealed that it was after she met casting directors that she started feeling ‘fat'.
In an interview with Navbharat Times, Maanvi recalled that before joining the industry, she 'never felt too fat'. It was the casting directors and agents who told her that and could not fit her into any category. 'They did not know what category to fit me in, they did not want to cast me as the lead because I am fat but they could not cast me as a fat girl too, because I was not too fat.
