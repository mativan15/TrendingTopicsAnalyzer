Button batteries – those small, coin-shaped batteries used in watches and children's sound books – are a well-known nuisance.

Not only are they an environmental headache as they're not rechargeable, but they're also highly dangerous as children can swallow them and suffer serious internal burns.

A French start-up is working to fix that by developing rechargeable microbatteries that could replace them and also be used for a range of other applications, such as connected devices and sensors for healthcare.
