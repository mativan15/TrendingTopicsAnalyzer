Russia's war in Ukraine is both a threat to democratic values and an opportunity for global leadership, said European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis. Speaking to students and faculty at Harvard Law School on Oct. 15, Dombrovskis outlined a sweeping strategy for response to what he called 'Russia's brutal and illegal invasion.' Dombrovskis is the European Commission's highest ranking official responsible for economy and trade. He is also the former prime minister of Latvia.
