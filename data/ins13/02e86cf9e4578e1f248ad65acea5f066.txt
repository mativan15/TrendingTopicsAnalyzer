NASA has warned that a hazardous asteroid is speeding towards Earth today. Is Earth in any danger?
 Although most asteroids are found in a ring between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter called the asteroid belt, some have made their way towards Earth in the past. Some of these space rocks have even caused a major impact and even triggered an extinction-level event. An asteroid was responsible for triggering the extinction of dinosaurs when it crashed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico more than 65 million years ago.
