Oct. 18—THOMASVILLE- There is nothing quite like high school football in the south. When it comes to supporting one's team, fans will stop at nothing to make sure they have the perfect look. If they can't find it locally, they are sure to order something ready-made off the Internet. However, for local Thomasville Bulldogs fans, they can just shop at the Dog Pen inside Thomasville High School for their game day apparel.

Operated by CTAE Director, Ginger Reeves, the store not only provides an opportunity for students to gain work-based learning experience, but all of the funds raised go back to the students, helping them attend conventions, fairs and National programs for scholarship money.
