Jeremy Hunt said he would do 'whatever necessary' to bring down national debt as the latest official figures showed government borrowing jumped in September and debt interest payments hit a record high.The chancellor said getting the public finances on a stable footing was essential, as government borrowing hit £20bn in September, £2.2bn more than last September, and £3bn more than economists expected.Higher borrowing pushed debt interest payments to £7.7bn last month, according to the Office for National Statistics, £2.
