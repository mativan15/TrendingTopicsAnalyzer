As reported, the private equity fund first invested in Kiko in 2018 through an 80 million euro capital increase. Financial terms of Percassi's buyback deal were not disclosed.

'This represents the trust and support the Percassi family has in our plans and the future of Kiko Milano,' said the brand's chief executive officer Simone Dominici, who was appointed to the role earlier this year.
