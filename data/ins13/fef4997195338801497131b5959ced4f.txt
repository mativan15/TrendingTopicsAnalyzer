The US Food and Drug and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday (October 12) announced a shortage of Adderall, medication used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
'There is not sufficient supply to continue to meet US market demand,' the FDA said in a statement.
Patients have been dealing with the scarcity since August, with pharmacies in the US finding it increasingly difficult to stock the drug.
The current shortage comes at a time when there has been a growing demand for Adderall, particularly since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
