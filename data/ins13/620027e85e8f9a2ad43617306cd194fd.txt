Taco Bell customers may find it difficult to find a Mexican Pizza as the chain is already running out of ingredients for the popular dish.Taco Bell brought back the Mexican Pizza on May 19, and on May 31 tweeted that it was facing shortages as the item was "7x" more popular than it expected."We'll need some time to replenish our supplies," the chain wrote, saying employees are "working as fast as we can" to make it available to customers again.Mexican pizza has long been a favorite among Taco Bell regulars, but it was one of more than a dozen items cut from the menu in 2020, alongside other beloved items like the seven-layer burrito and cheesy fiesta potatoes.
