The Biden administration officially launched its student debt relief application on Monday, ending months of anticipation from millions of American borrowers.

The debt forgiveness website, which was first released by the administration for beta testing on Friday, features what officials have argued is a relatively simple application process.

President Biden announced his plan for student loan debt relief in August forgiving $10,000 in student loan debt for those making under $125,000 annually and $20,000 for Pell grant recipients.
