Online fashion retailer Asos has reported a big loss as its customers spend less on fashion due to the rising cost of living.

The firm saw a loss of nearly £32m in the 12 months to August, compared with a profit of £177m last year.

The firm expects shoppers to cut back further this year as living costs soar.

Inflation returned to a 40-year high in September as BBC research showed people are feeling increasingly anxious about their finances.

Asos, which owns Topshop and Topman, said it was facing "an incredibly challenging economic environment" at the moment.
