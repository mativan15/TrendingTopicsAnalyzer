Mobile gambling will soon be available through the Chickasaw Nation.

The National Indian Gaming Commission just approved the nation to offer games through an app, along with in-person gambling.

However, you can only gamble on the app while on Chickasaw tribal land. Games will not include sports betting, but rather bingo-based games.

The app uses geo-location to make sure you are approved to play.

It took one year for the Chickasaw Nation and the National Indian Gaming Commission to clarify and declare rules for the app.
