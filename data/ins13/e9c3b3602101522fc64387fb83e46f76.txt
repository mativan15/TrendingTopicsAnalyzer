May 28—A Central Coast cannabis dispensary owner was sentenced to just under two years in federal prison Friday after previously pleading guilty to counts of bribery and tax evasion when he tried getting favorable treatment for his business, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.

Helios "Bobby" Dayspring, 36, of San Luis Obispo appeared before Judge Andre Birotte, Jr. in the U.S. District Court for the Central District, where he was sentenced to 22 months in prison after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to one count each of bribery and subscribing to a false income tax return, according to U.
