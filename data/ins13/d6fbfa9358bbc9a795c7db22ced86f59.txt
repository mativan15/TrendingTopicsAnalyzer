Mango, the Barcelona-based fashion retailer, has opened a store in Miami, Florida, taking another step forward in its goal to have 40 stores operating in the U.S. by 2024.

Mango, compared to other international fashion companies such as Zara and H&M, has been slow to penetrate the U.S. But now it believes that the U.S. could be one of its top five markets in the world, once 40 Mango stores are up and running in the States and with e-commerce sales.
