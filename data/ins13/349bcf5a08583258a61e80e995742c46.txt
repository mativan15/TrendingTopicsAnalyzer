Playwright and author of light prose, ROBERT FONTAINE lives in Springfield, Massachusetts.I live in a mad world where the buttons keep coming off my shirts, my shoelaces keep breaking, and my neckties unravel before my eyes. Perhaps you've had a taste of this sort of thing, too. Everything you buy has to be readjusted, reinforced, revitalized, and refinished, if not rejected and returned.Even the people they turn out these days are deficient or negligent, incompetent or lazy. I know a good carpenter who can't come this week.
