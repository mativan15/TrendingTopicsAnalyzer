Thesis

After Target Corporation (TGT) released its earnings report on 18 May 2022, the retail sector free-fell. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) could not prevail over the bloodbath as well. The stock plummeted almost 20% in just three trading days (18 May - 20 May). However, the stock almost returned to the level before the drop after its earnings release on 26 May. I will explain why this happened by discussing how TGT and DG are indeed similar but different.

In this article, I am not going to dig deep into the background or how excellent DG is, which I believe has been covered a lot in other articles.
