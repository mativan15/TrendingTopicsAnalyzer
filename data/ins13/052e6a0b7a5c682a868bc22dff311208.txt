Timothy Armoo founded Fanbytes in 2017

As a young, black entrepreneur with few industry contacts, Timothy Armoo, 27 has more than beaten the odds to raise investment, scale and then sell his start-up.

He grew up on a council estate in south London and puts some of his success down to a "lucky break" as a teenager.

"When I talk to my girlfriend about it," says Mr Armoo, "she goes, 'you know that you're not meant to be able do this?'"

Mr Armoo founded his social media advertising business, Fanbytes, in 2017, building it up to employ 65 people.
