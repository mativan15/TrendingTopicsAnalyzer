Australia's new Labor government has quietly rescinded the country's recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and has called for the final status of the city to be determined during peace negotiations. In a recent update on its website, first reported by The Guardian, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) removed two sentences describing the country's policy on the Israel-Palestinian issue that had previously been adopted by former Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government.
