A team will be sent by the central government to investigate complaints of people with regard to inflated billing after installation of smart meters, union power minister RK Singh said on Thursday. Darbhanga Town MLA Sanjay Saraogi urged the union energy minister to take stock of the situation as people were consistently complaining about irregularities in billing after installation of prepaid smart meters on their premises.
