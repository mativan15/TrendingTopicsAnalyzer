Miriam Margolyes broke the first rule of radio this morning (Saturday 15 October) as she said 'f*** you' live on the Today programme.

The actor was reacting to seeing the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in the BBC Radio 4 studio, when she swore.

'When I saw him there,' she told the hosts Justin Webb and Martha Kearney, as she was finishing her interview, 'I said, ‘You've got a hell of a job, best of luck.' And what I really want to say was, ‘F*** you, bastard.' But you cant say that.'

'Oh no no no you mustn't say that,' replied Webb.
