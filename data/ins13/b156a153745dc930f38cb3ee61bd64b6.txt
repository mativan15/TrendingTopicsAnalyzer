The Gujarat government has reduced value added tax (VAT) on compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) by 10 per cent, state education minister Jitu Vaghani said Monday, according to news agency ANI. The announcement comes weeks before prime minister Narendra Modi's home state votes for a new government; poll dates were expected Saturday but the Election Commission only confirmed dates for the Himachal Pradesh election.
