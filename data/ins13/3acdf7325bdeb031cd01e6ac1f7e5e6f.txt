Former Liverpool and England goalkeeper David James has given his verdict on the futures of Mo Salah and Sadio Mane at Anfield.

The pair have been two of Liverpool's most important players since Jurgen Klopp took charge of the club. And they have been in fantastic form yet again this season.

Salah's record stands at 31 goals and 16 assists from 50 matches so far. 23 of those goals came in the Premier League, meaning Salah shared the Golden Boot with Tottenham's Son Heung-min.
