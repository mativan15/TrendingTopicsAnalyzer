The recent housing market turbulence makes homeownership a pipedream for many Americans. Yesterday, it was sky high home prices. Today, it is increased mortgage interest rates. Landis, founded by Cyril Berdugo in 2018, is a real estate tech startup 'making homeownership accessible to more Americans.' The New York City-based startup raised a $40M Series B round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures), with participation from existing investors including Sequoia Capital, Jay's Roc Nation fund Arrive, the National Association of REALTORS's Second Century Ventures, Operator Partners, Signia Ventures, and Team Builder Ventures.
