The National Commission for Scheduled Castes has ordered a probe into alleged irregularities in disbursal of post matric scholarships for Scheduled Caste students in Punjab. The probe will be headed by a retired high court judge. "We have sought a list of retired judges to institute an independent probe into administrative lapses in disbursement of post-matric scholarships to SC students in Punjab," NCSC chairman Vijay Sampla said in New Delhi on Thursday.

According to NCSC estimates, about 200,000 Dalit college students in Punjab dropped out over the last two years as the state did not pay them scholarships.
