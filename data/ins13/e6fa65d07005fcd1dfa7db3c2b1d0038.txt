At the end of 2020, Bill Hackney retired from his role as SVP of merchandising with AutoZone, after 37 years with the company. Replacing him was Seong Ohm, the former group development officer for the Dairy Farm Group.

Now, however, Ohm is leaving — and Hackney, after less than two years in retirement, is returning.

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ohm will depart from the company on Oct. 31. She'll be paid her current base salary for 18 months, 'subject to the execution and non-revocation of a customary release of claims,' and is set to receive a bonus for FY 2022, when those bonuses are paid.
