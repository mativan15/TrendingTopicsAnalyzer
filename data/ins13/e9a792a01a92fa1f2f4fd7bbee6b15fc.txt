Published: 16:00 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 16:00 EDT, 17 October 2022 Two teams that appear to have realistic expectations to win the 2022-23 NBA championship will tip off the NBA season Tuesday night when the Philadelphia 76ers visit the Boston Celtics. The Celtics won last season's Eastern Conference championship before falling to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals. The 76ers were the No. 4 seed in the East and fell in the second round to the Miami Heat. In attempting to win the franchise's 18th championship, Boston features a new head coach (Joe Mazzulla) and a new sixth man (Malcolm Brogdon).
