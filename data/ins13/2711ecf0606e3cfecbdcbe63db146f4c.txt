Chris Fountain has shared the extent to which being fired from Coronation Street has affected his life.The actor, who played Tommy Duckworth in the ITV soap, was sacked by bosses after videos of him rapping about rape were discovered on YouTube. Fountain, who had previously starred in Hollyoaks, was 25 at the time, and has barely acted on screen since. He addressed the controversy on Mancs on the Mic podcast, revealing that he has 'been in some very dark, horrible places, to the point where I realised I needed to start changing the way that I was thinking – otherwise I might not have been here'.
