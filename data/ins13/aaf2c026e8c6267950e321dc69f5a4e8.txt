Indonesia will demolish and rebuild the football stadium where over 130 people, including at least 40 children, were killed in a stampede earlier this month, president Joko Widodo said on Tuesday.

'For Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, we will demolish and rebuild it according to Fifa standards,' said the president, popularly known as Jokowi.

Prior to the announcement, he met Gianni Infantino, the head of the football governing body. The meeting comes after Jakarta and Fifa agreed to form a joint task force as Indonesia readies to host the Under-20 World Cup next year.
