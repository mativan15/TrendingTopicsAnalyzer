AFPHotel occupancy is looking up again.Global CEO visits, large-scale conferences, corporate events and industry seminars are making a comeback, boosting occupancies at top city hotels, as normal flights to global money hubs resume after two consecutive seasons of restricted mobility. Top hospitality executives said they are seeing a definite uptick in such events after two years, although more could be done to tap the country's MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) potential. 
Vineet Mishra, cluster general manager for Accor and general manager of Pullman and Novotel hotels in Delhi's Aerocity, said it's not just company leaders, but delegates from different countries have also been arriving for different ministerial events in India.
