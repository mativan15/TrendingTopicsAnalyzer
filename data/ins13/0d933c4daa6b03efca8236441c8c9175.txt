'We talked about keeping our heads up and that we needed to play our game,' Medfield coach Mary Laughna said. 'We sorted some things out and talked about everything we needed to fix.'We came out strong at the beginning of the second half. I'm proud of how we played cohesively as a team and were able to take what we talked about and really dig in and execute what we needed to.'Kelly Blake (five goals, assist) and Alex Proefrock (three goals, two assists) keyed the attack, and in the back, Lauren Schofield and Lillie Cumming were stellar defensively.
