Did you know that over 70% of Southeast Asia's population are unbanked or underbanked? The former has no access to basic financial services, while the latter are underserved and face problems such as an inability to get credit cards, loans, or adequate insurance. These people make up over 70% of the regional population, and the countries that have the highest combined rates of unbanked and underbanked are Vietnam (79%), the Philippines (78%), and Indonesia (77%). They also happen to be the region's most populous nations.
