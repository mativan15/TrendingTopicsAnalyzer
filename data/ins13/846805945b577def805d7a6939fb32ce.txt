LONDON — Seeking to bring stability to jittery debt and stock markets — and to help Prime Minister Liz Truss survive — Britain's brand new finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, on Monday said that the government would not slash taxes but would instead see them rise, in a stunning reversal of trickle-down growth policy announced just three weeks ago.

'The most important objective for our country right now is stability,' said Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, Britain's title for finance minister.
