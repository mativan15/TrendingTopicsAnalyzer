Stock Depot/iStock via Getty Images Not only has the CEO of Verrica Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRCA) managed to lead the company into its third FDA rejection in three years over the exact same manufacturing issues, but - in my opinion - VRCA management doesn't seem to have even a basic understanding of FDA's manufacturing requirements or regulatory concepts. I do not believe VRCA will be able to get VP-102 approved under this leadership, no matter who the CMO is. To make the situation more egregious, VRCA has been issuing press releases trying to shift the blame for their own incompetence.
