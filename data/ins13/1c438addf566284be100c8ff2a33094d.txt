2022 hasn't exactly been an easy year for investors. Unlike the bear market of Q4 2018 or the pandemic-induced bear market of spring 2020, this bear market could be a long slog as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation, supply chains remain constrained, and geopolitical tensions are intensifying. Another worry for investors is valuations. The S&P 500 doubled between 2019 and the end of 2021 -- so it's still produced monster gains even if you factor in this year's sell-off.
One tried and true strategy for outlasting a bear market is to invest in stable businesses you can count on to make it through tough times and possibly even gain market share in the process.
