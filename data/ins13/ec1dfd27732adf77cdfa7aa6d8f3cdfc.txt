Oct. 14—Dressed in pink, blue and purple tutus, Ann and Rebecca Tolbert walked two miles in the Splatter Run for International Order of Rainbow for Girls 100th year Anniversary.

Their two-mile walk raised $1,275, which they donated to Claremore Public Schools during the regular school board meeting.

Claremore Superintendent Bryan Frazier said the money will be used for the STEM Club for Girls.

"It just seemed fitting because obviously, the rainbow group is about young ladies," he said.

Frazier said both groups focus on the empowerment of these girls and encouraging them in areas of business and networking.
