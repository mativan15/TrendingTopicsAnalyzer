Fast food outlet KFC has been dealing with a number of complaints on social media that their classic side dish is now tasting 'watery' and 'plastic'. The potato and gravy, a staple of any visit to KFC, is no longer up to scratch in some people's minds. Things have gone from finger-lickin' good to finger pointing, with feedback questioning a potential tweak in the recipe or if a new plastic container holding the dish to blame. 'Took back potato n gravy tonight because we went to dish it up and was the most HORRID thing we've tasted,' one person said on the KFC Facebook page.
