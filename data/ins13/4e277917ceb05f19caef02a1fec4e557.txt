When Keith Hamblett, a fruit and vegetable seller from Tyne and Wear, asked his bank for a government-backed loan in the autumn of 2020, the economy was still in trouble after lockdowns, and coronavirus cases were rising. The Covid bounce back loan scheme was a welcome relief for many smaller companies, and Hamblett received £28,000.But there was a problem: he had ceased trading, meaning he was not eligible for the support.
