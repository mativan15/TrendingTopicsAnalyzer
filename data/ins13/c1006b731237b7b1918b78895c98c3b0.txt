Martin Lewis has been brutally accused of lying as he shared an anecdote about his child on social media. The Money Saving Expert took to Twitter on Wednesday to recall a sweet conversation he had with his young daughter Sapphire, 9, about politics with his followers, but was forced to delete the post after being flooded with replies suggesting he had made up the exchange. Martin - who is currently taking a 'long break' from Good Morning Britain - described Twitter as 'really is a horrible place sometimes' as explained why he had deleted the post in a follow up tweet and asked his followers to consider why he would 'bother making something like that up'.
