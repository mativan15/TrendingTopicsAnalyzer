With 20 seconds left in overtime, Connor McMenamin scored his second goal of the game to give unbeaten Penn State a 3-2 victory over St. Thomas on Friday night in a nonconference men's hockey game at Pegula Ice Arena in State College, Pa.

The No. 18 Nittany Lions (6-0) took a 2-0 lead late in the second period on goals 19 seconds apart by McMenamin and Ben Copeland.

Ryan O'Neill scored the first goal for the Tommies (1-5) less than two minutes later at 18:03. Ethan Gauer's goal midway through the third tied it.
