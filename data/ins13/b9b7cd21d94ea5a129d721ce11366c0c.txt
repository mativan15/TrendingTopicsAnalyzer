A financial planner is an expert, usually a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® (CFP), who helps you create a financial plan to reach various goals."They'll really try to get to know the client they're working with, try to get to know their goals, both short- and long-term, as well as understanding their risk tolerance," says Maggie Gomez, CFP® professional and owner of Money with Maggie. "Then they will help to get their money invested in a way that gets them to their goals in the most efficient way."While you may think of a financial planner as someone who helps with your investments, their responsibilities go beyond looking at the stock market.
