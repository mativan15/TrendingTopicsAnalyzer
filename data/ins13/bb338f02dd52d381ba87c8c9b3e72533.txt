The Haryana government will open 40 urban health and wellness centres across Gurugram city to ease the pressure on government and private hospitals, deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said on Monday. Yadav said these centres would help residents get medical facilities, including pathological tests, near their residences. 'Each centre will have facilities to carry out 14 types of tests and offer 12 types of medical services to patients. Every centre would have a five-member team, including a doctor,' he said.
