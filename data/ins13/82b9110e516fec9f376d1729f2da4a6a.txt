Chinese dictator Xi Jinping called for China to create a world-class military as he declared supremacy over Hong Kong and set his sights on Taiwan on Sunday.

Xi made the comments during his opening address to the Chinese Community Party Congress in Beijing. Xi spoke before 2,300 CPP delegates who will later vote to grant him an unprecedented third term as China's president and general secretary of the CCP. The leader laid out ambitions for China, declaring a determination to beef up the country's military and take over Taiwan.
