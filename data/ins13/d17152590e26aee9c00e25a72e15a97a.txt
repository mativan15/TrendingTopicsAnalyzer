Win or go home for the winter: pressure on the Yankees

The New York Yankees jumped out to an early 3-0 lead against the Guardians in Game 4 and held on for a 4-2 victory. Now the series will shift back to the Bronx for a decisive Game 5.

Aaron Civale will start for the visitors, while the Yankees will counter with Jameson Taillon. Taillon came on in relief in Game 2 and suffered the loss after allowing two earned runs in the 10th inning.

We've seen plenty of upsets this postseason as I think the pressure lies squarely on the home team with New York as high as -160 favorites.
