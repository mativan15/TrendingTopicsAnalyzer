The first venture capital fund dedicated to backing Arizona startups with money almost exclusively from investors inside the state, said it has closed its first fund with a total of $110 million — $10 million more than it was shooting for.

The fund, called AZ-VC — which got its start under the name InvisionAZ — has already poured money into a pair of startups earlier this year and is expected to announce a couple more investments before the year is out, said Jack Selby, the fund's manager.
