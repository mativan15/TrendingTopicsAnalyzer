A US Army veteran, who faked his own death to avoid jail, was sentenced to 85 years on Thursday after being convicted of raping his 14-year-old stepdaughter.

Jacob Blair Scott, 45, was found guilty of repeated sexual attacks on the teenager, who testified that one assault ended in her falling pregnant.

Scott, a Purple Heart recipient from Moss Point, Mississippi, was originally accused of rape after the girl became pregnant in 2017.

However while out on bond in July 2018, Scott disappeared. Police later found a small boat with a handgun, suicide note, and 'small amount' of blood off the coast of Orange Beach, Alabama.
