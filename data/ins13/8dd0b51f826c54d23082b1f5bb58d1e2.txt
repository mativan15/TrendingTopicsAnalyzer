juliannafunk The S&P 500 Index (SPY) is down 25% year-to-date. 2022 is on track to becoming one of the worst years in stock market history. What is causing this painful stock market crash? It is not inflation, nor the Fed and nor the war in Ukraine. It is the massive bubble of 2021. On December, 4, 2021, I warned you about this bubble in the article, "The Epic 2021 Bubble Already Collapsed, We Just Entered Phase 2". I discussed that every massive bubble, including the one in 2000, collapses in three phases: Phase 1 - Hyped small caps collapse Phase 2 - Overvalued mid caps collapse Phase 3 - Overvalued large caps and indices collapse.
