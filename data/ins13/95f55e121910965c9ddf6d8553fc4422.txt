Stars such as world no 2 Daniil Medvedev will not be allowed to compete at Wimbledon this summer after tournament organisers took a hard-line stance in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The ATP and the WTA decided to strip Wimbledon of its ranking points for the upcoming tournament, in addition to the 2021 edition of the tournament.
