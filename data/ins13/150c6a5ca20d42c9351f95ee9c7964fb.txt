Published: 16:49 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 16:49 EDT, 21 October 2022 The Montreal Canadiens have gone unbeaten at home on the young season. Off to a strong start, the Dallas Stars present the next hurdle for them to clear. Looking to open with four straight home victories for the first time in six seasons, the Canadiens will try to keep the Stars' point streak from reaching five in a row on Saturday night. Montreal has been outscored 6-1 in losing its two road games with Detroit and Washington this season, but owns a 13-7 edge in goals while going 3-0-0 at home.
