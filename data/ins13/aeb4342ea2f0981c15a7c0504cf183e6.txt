On the evening of Oct. 19, Justin Tranter's Los Angeles neighbors were treated to a free concert — at least aurally. The prolific hit songwriter hosted their fourth annual in-person 'Beyond,' a Spirit Day concert and a fundraiser for GLAAD's efforts to support LGBTQ youth, in the backyard of their Hancock Park home. Tranter, who has served as a GLAAD board member for the last six years, helped raise $400,000 at the event. Present were special guest performer Billy Porter, whose solo album Tranter is executive producing and co-writing, as well as Imagine Dragons' Dan Reynolds and Ashlee Marie Preston.
