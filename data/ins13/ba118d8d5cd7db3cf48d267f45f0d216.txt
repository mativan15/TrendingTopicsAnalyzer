With the Congress and JD(S) turning down requests from each other to withdraw their candidates from the Rajya Sabha election fray, polling will take place on June 10 for the four seats. The BJP has fielded union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, actor-turned-politician Jaggesh and senior leader Lahar Singh Siroya, while senior leader Jairam Ramesh and KPCC general secretary Mansoor Ali Khan have filed papers as Congress candidates. The JD(S) has fielded real estate baron Kupendra Reddy.

Since MLAs are the voters, the BJP has the numbers to win two seats and the Congress one.
