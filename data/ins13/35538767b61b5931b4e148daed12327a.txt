The price tag for an aircraft engine made by Rolls-Royce (LSE: RR) can be hefty. Buying a stake in the company, by contrast, can require only pocket change. The Rolls-Royce share price is in pennies. It has fallen 46% over the past year.

But with the business showing signs of recovery, could this be the time to add to my existing holding?

Long-term investing

My answer to this is driven by my philosophy of long-term investing. While the Rolls-Royce share price has moved around a lot in the short-term, my focus is on what I think the company will be worth five or even 10 years from now – and whether today's share price offers me a bargain on that basis.
