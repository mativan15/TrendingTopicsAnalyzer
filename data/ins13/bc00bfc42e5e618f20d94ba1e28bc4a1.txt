With a proper support system, the number, scale, and sustainability of women's enterprises could increase significantly, creating up to 170 million jobs - which is more than 25 percent of the new jobs that need to be created in India until 2030. 
 In 2015, the Indian government launched the ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' initiative (Save our Daughters, Educate our Daughters) to address gender discrimination and empower girls and women. The initiative yielded many positive results, including an encouraging rise in the number of girls enrolled in schools and an improvement in the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB).
