By PA Media Published: 10:34 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 10:35 EDT, 19 October 2022 Doctors can carry out a caesarean section on a heavily pregnant woman with mental health difficulties without her approval if needed, a judge has ruled. Mrs Justice Morgan approved an application by hospital bosses responsible for the woman's care at a hearing in London's Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who might lack the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves are sorted. She was told the woman, who is in her 30s, has schizophrenia and cannot be legally identified in media reports of the case, currently has the mental capacity to make decisions for herself.
