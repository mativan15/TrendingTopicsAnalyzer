New UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to delay a penny cut in income tax to help plug a hole in public finances, the Times reported, citing unidentified sources.

Hunt is expected to announce that plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax next April will be pushed back by a year, the Times reported. The cut to 19% will now take effect at the time previously proposed by Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and will save 31 million taxpayers up to £360 a year, the newspaper said.
