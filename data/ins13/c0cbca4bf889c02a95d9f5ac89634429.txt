Dear Amy: Before we started dating, my husband and I had many conversations about what we wanted in a partner.
I told him I wanted a companion for traveling and spending quality time with. And we both firmly stated that we do not want to spend our time in bars.
My husband of 1½ years has now joined not one but two bands. He rehearses at least one night a week in a city one hour away from us (besides the countless hours at home).
He is scheduling 'gigs' on weekend nights at various bars and clubs.
