Ruth Marcus: Well, I think there is a shift. I'm not sure I would call it a wave.There's definitely been a change since the summer, when it looked like Democrats were talking, though I thought it was delusional then, and it certainly looks delusional now, about being able to keep the House. That is not going to happen. They have a very serious prospect of losing the Senate. The governor's races are up for grabs.But I think the question is, compared to what? And I would say, in some ways, though they are certainly looking less good than they did a month ago, it's almost surprising, given the external forces, that Democrats are doing as well as they are.
