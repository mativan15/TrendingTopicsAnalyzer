A state senator's nonprofit organization has been allocated $1.5 million. The booster club for an East Baton Rouge high school is getting $1.1 million. Catholic churches in St. Martin Parish will receive a combined $170,000, and a Shreveport group devoted to roses will get $100,000.

These are just a few of the $105.2 million in personal pet projects lawmakers inserted into the annual budget plan sent to Gov. John Bel Edwards at the end of last week.

The money isn't spread around the state evenly.
