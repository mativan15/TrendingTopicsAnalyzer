The first year of the Brent Venables era hasn't gone as well as Venables or anybody else would have expected. After three wins to open the season, the Sooners dropped their next three, the first three games in Big 12 play, and gave up 40+ points each week.
ESPN graded each head coach in their new locale at the midway point of the season. Though it's still early in his tenure, ESPN didn't look too favorably on Venables after giving the Oklahoma Football program a B+ for the hire at the time Venables was brought on board.
