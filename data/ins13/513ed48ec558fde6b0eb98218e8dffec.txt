May 27—Rep. Jane Garibay, D-Windsor, will face off against Windsor Town Councilman Lenworth Walker, a Republican, for the 60th House District seat after both were unanimously endorsed by their parties during conventions this month.

The district includes parts of Windsor and Windsor Locks.

Garibay said she was honored to be endorsed for what would be her third term representing the district.

If re-elected, she said she would continue her work as the co-chairwoman of the legislature's Aging Committee to "keep our seniors safe," as well as work on small business development, job creation, environmental issues, and obtaining funding for projects in her district.
