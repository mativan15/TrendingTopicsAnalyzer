Kanye West says he's buying Parler, the right-wing social media app that bills itself as an 'uncancelable free speech platform' and known for its lax moderation policies. The move comes a little more than a week after Instagram restricted West, who legally changed his name to Ye, on the platform and Twitter locked him out of his account. Both platforms took action after the artist spewed antisemitic comments.Parler parent company Parlement Technologies announced the news in a press release on Monday morning.
