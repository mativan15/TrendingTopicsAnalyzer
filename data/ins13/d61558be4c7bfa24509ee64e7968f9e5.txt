Gangtok, Sikkim – On a cool monsoon morning, as a layer of mist hung over the lush hills in Gangtok, a group of young students wearing bright yellow, orange and green jerseys kicked about on the football pitch of the Tashi Namgyal Academy (TNA).
For Simon Subba, who often guides young footballers, the sight of a kickabout triggered a flood of memories.
'It used to be just sand here when we played. Now there is a good astroturf,' Subba recalled.
Nestled in a leafy part of the burgeoning hill station, TNA is the most prominent school in Gangtok.
