Bank OZK Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK) stock has dropped 7.6% in Thursday after-hours trading after Q3 earnings missed the Wall Street estimate as it increased its provision for credit losses due to its loan growth. "The growth in both funded and unfunded loan balances during the quarter contributed to the higher provision for credit losses, which impacted net income," the company said. Its Real Estate Specialty Group's loan originations of $4.35B, marking its fourth straight quarter of record originations, increased from $3.
