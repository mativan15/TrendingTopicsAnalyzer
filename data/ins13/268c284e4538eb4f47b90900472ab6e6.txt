Oct. 15—The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics served search warrants at nearly a dozen marijuana farms across Oklahoma in the past two weeks, according to a press release, including one in Pontotoc County.

"(OBN) is investigating and dismantling criminal organizations operating within the state's medical marijuana program," the release read.

Agency Spokesman Mark Woodward said it is another phase in OBN's on-going focus to aggressively target criminals hiding within the state's medical marijuana program.
