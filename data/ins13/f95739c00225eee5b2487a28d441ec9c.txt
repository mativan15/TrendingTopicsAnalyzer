The state of Texas on Thursday filed a lawsuit against tech giant Google (GOOG) for allegedly illegally collecting the state's residents' biometric data without their consent.
The lawsuit alleges the company gathered a massive trove of biometric information from Texans, including voice records and facial data through its many services.
"Google's indiscriminate collection of the personal information of Texans, including very sensitive information like biometric identifiers, will not be tolerated," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement.
