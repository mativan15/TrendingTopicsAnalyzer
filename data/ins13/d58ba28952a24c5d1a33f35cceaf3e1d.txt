Coinbase, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, sent mass emails to alert some job candidates who had already accepted job offers that the company was withdrawing those offers.At least one recipient has slammed the missive as "unprofessional."Coinbase's Chief People Officer L.J. Brock said in a Thursday blog post that the company was rescinding some job offers and hitting pause on hiring, citing a need to "navigate this macro environment and emerge even stronger."Coinbase became the first crypto company to enter the Fortune 500 earlier this year with revenues of more than $7.
