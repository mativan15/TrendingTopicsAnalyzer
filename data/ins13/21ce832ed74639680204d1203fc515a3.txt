After a turbulent 44 days, Liz Truss has become the shortest serving Prime Minister in history after announcing her resignation.
But with all the chaos and confusion emerging from Westminster, what happens next and could there be a general election on the horizon?
Truss resigned as Prime Minister earlier today following a disastrous mini budget and the chaos erupted in the House of Commons last night.And just hours earlier, Home Secretary Suella Braverman quit her role. It was also reported the two ‘had a 90-minute shouting match'.
