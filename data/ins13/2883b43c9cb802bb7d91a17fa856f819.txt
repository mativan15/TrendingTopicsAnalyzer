Michael Hooper was a welcome sight at training on Wednesday but celebrations were cut short after news came through that Matt Philip had suffered a serious knee injury as the Wallabies prepare to fly out to Europe for the spring tour. Philip will miss the five-Test tour of Europe and will also be sidelined for next year's Super Rugby season with the Rebels as he races the clock to be fit for the 2023 World Cup. It's a big blow for the Aussies ahead of an important tour against some of the best nations in the world, but there is a silver lining with one of their most important players set to return to the fold.
