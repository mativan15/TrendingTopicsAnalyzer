AgenciesL&T brings in its significant capability in underwater systems to the project.A new range of submarine launched drones to meet Indian Navy requirements will be developed by defence sector giant Larsen & Toubro, with the company signing up a Bengaluru based start-up for a joint research and development effort. Submarine launched Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a relatively new concept with few nations around the world having the capability to operate such systems. They are also a complex design and development project given that the drone will need to navigate through water before taking to the air for flight.
