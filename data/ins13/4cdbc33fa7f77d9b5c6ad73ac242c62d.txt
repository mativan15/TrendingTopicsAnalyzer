OTTAWA - There was disagreement and confusion between levels of government on how to deal with the 'Freedom Convoy' protest before it began and while it unfolded, a public inquiry heard Monday. City manager Steve Kanellakos told an inquiry investigating the feds' use of emergency powers that police were in charge of the response to the convoy, and the city followed the force's lead throughout.Kanellakos said the city was only expecting protesters to stay for a short period of time when they arrived in late January, based on information it was getting from Ottawa police.
