By Kyle Morris Sportech PLC said Tuesday that business for the first five months of 2022 has been in line with the board's expectations and that Chief Executive Andrew Lindley will step down. The London-listed betting-technology company continues to experience a high rate of growth, but pari-mutuel wagering and food-and-beverage sales continue to be affected by the pandemic, with business remaining below 2019 levels, the company said. Mr. Lindley will continue to support the company in the coming months, Sportech said.
