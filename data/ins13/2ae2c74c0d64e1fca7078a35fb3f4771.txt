About the daters ...

Happiest when ...

Will: When I'm in [a] fun place with a large group of friends or people I like.

Shaw: I just love being with the people I love, with no worries to distract us. Unless we are at a sporting event, where me and my friends tend to get a bit nuts.

Your type ...

Will: Blond hair and blue eyes ... those features stand out to me; however, I really like well-spoken and well-rounded people who can keep my attention.

Shaw: 6-foot-2 and up. Lean, muscular but not bulky.
