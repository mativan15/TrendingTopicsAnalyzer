Counting starts today for a union election at an Amazon Albany, N.Y. (AMZN) warehouse. The election once again puts Amazon at odds with the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), at a high-stakes moment for both.

The ALU had a historic victory at a Staten Island, N.Y. warehouse, JFK8, about six months ago, and has since continued to try to organize the e-commerce giant's workers after Amazon failed in its efforts to overturn the JFK8 union victory. Those efforts included a vote at a second Staten Island warehouse, though the union failed to get a second victory in the borough.
