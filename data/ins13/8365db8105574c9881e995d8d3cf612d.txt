A local husband and wife are bringing a franchise concept to Wichita that targets office catering, corporate events and other get-togethers.

Graze Craze, which offers artfully designed charcuterie boards and boxes, recently opened at 21st Street and Ridge Road in northwest Wichita, with another location coming soon to Cambridge Market at 21st and Webb on the northeast side of the city.

Kip and Kristy Hawkins are the franchisees behind the two locations.

'Charcuterie boards have been a staple in our household for over a decade,' Kristy Hawkins said in a news release.
