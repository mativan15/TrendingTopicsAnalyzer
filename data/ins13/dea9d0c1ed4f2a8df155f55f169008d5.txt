May 31—Baxter senior Rory Heer was one of the Bolts' best football players for four seasons. He was electric with the ball in his hands.

But it almost never happened.

"He didn't play middle school football," Baxter football coach Rob Luther said. "I told Dad I saw a college football player in him in middle school. He was aggressive in other sports and physical and it just fits into what it takes."

It turns out, Luther knew what he was talking about. And Heer made his collegiate decision official recently.
