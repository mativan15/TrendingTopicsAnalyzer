Manchester United have entered the transfer race for one player that Wayne Rooney has already commended for his "enormous ability". The Red Devils have been linked with several players ahead of the summer transfer window as they look to revamp their squad. With so many planned departures, there needs to be some money spent. Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani and Jesse Lingard are out of contract at the end of the season and will need replacing while Marcus Rashford, Dean Henderson and Eric Bailly could all leave as well.
