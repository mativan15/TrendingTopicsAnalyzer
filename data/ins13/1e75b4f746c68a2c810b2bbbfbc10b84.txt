BEIJING, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- For a world that is navigating its way through the fogs of escalating geopolitical tensions, runaway inflation, a raging COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially ruinous recession, the monumental convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), a twice-in-a-decade political gathering that opened in Beijing on Sunday, is set to disperse these mists and light up the road ahead.The world has been keenly observing the week-long event - which is seen as the axis of the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era - gauging how the triumphant gathering will spearhead the world's second-largest economy in the coming five years and longer vision, with earnest entrepreneurs, economists and politicians hoping that the Party Congress will be able to channel stability and give a much-needed shot in the arm to a floundering global economy.
