ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd has fallen more than 20 per cent from its recent September 2021 highs putting the stock firmly in bear grip but a breakout from an Inverse Head & Shoulder pattern suggests upside. Investors who are looking to put money in beaten-down names can keep ICICI Prudential on their radar for a potential short-term target of Rs 610-640 in the next 2 weeks, suggest experts.

The life insurance company with a market capitalisation of over Rs 78,000 cr fell from after hitting a 52-week high of Rs 724.
