The province says a newly created committee will focus on reviewing Manitoba's current tax framework, with an eye to ways to make Manitoba's economic environment more competitive.Premier Heather Stefanson said Manitoba isn't as tax-friendly as it needs to be — a problem exacerbated by pandemic-related forces impacting the economy — and has fallen behind other provinces."As we slide back, that prevents us from growing our economy here because businesses are choosing to go elsewhere," Stefanson said at a news conference Wednesday.
