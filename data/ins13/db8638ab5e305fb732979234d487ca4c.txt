(Bloomberg) -- You can now buy a Matchbox Tesla Roadster that's built from 99% recycled materials and certified as carbon neutral. A new Barbie, meanwhile, is made of recycled plastic trash collected in Mexico before it can pollute the Pacific Ocean. And toddlers can install plant-based plastic solar panels on the Mega Bloks Build & Learn Eco House.These toys, sold by Mattel Inc., are part of a push by the $104 billion global toy industry to make its overwhelmingly plastic products more sustainable amid a plastic pollution crisis.
