Claiming that the BJP would seize to exist in Bengal if the TMC "opens its doors", the national general secretary of Bengal's ruling party, Abhishek Banerjee, asserted on Monday that "backstabbers and fence-sitters" would not be allowed to join the camp. Amid the perceived power struggle over the number two spot in the ruling party, Banerjee, who is also the nephew of TMC boss and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said it is the "cadres" who hold the second position. 
The Diamond Harbour MP also clarified the "old-timers who had for years toiled hard for the party are its real assets, and new entrants won't be preferred to them".
