Experts have warned that there is no real 'fat' for new ChancellorJeremy Hunt to cut as he seeks savings ahead of the fiscal plan.The new Chancellor, who stepped into the role after Kwasi Kwarteng was forced out on Friday after weeks of chaos following his mini-budget, has made little secret of the fact that taxes could rise and spending cuts may be called for to restore market confidence in the UK.But he steps into the role amid fresh warnings about a 'lost decade' for public services.A new report, published by the Institute for Government and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, warns that Mr Hunt could find very little to trim from budgets that will not have further detrimental impacts on public services.
