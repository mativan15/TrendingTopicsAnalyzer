24 hours after the results of the first round of elections were announced, psychologist Mário Felipe de Lima Carvalho was contacted by three patients from his private practice in Rio de Janeiro. They were black people, from the Northeast, two of them women, who reported xenophobic attacks at work and asked to anticipate their therapy sessions. Other cases followed. The following week, the psychologist, who coordinates the Voices and Colors listening project for LGBTQIA+ people at Uerj (Rio de Janeiro State University), had to organize an online meeting about political suffering to meet the demand.
