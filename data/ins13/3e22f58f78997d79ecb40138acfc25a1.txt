Time for a recap.

Boris Johnson has admitted that the government's latest cost of living package won't fully protect people from surging prices.

Speaking a day after Rishi Sunak unveiled £15bn of support, in response to the energy crisis, the PM said:

I'm not going to pretend that this is going to fix everything for everybody immediately. There are still going to be pressures. But it's a very, very substantial commitment by the government to getting us through what will be, I'm afraid, still a bumpy time with the increase in energy prices around the world.
