 The rupee depreciated by 10 paise to close at 77.60 (provisional) against the United States dollar on Thursday, even as oil prices eased and domestic equities settled on a positive note. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the rupee consolidated in a narrow range. It opened lower at 77.61 against the greenback and finally settled at 77.60, down 10 paise over its previous close. During the session, the rupee touched an intra-day low of 77.
