The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded grants totaling more than $290 million to Charlotte-based Albemarle Corp. (NYSE: ALB) and Belmont-based Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ: PLL) to help each develop lithium processing operations.

It's part of $2.8 billion in grants DOE announced this week to build and expand commercial-scale facilities in 12 states for extracting and processing lithium, graphite and other battery materials and manufacturing components. The federal funding comes from the $65 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed last year.
