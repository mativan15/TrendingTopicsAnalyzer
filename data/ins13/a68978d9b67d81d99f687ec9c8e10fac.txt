Texas A&M (3-3, 1-2 SEC) has finished their much-needed bye week during week 7 of the 2022 college football season and will begin preparations for their week 8 showdown against the South Carolina Gamecocks (4-2, 1-2 SEC) in Columbia, South Carolina.
According to Tipico Sportsbook, Texas A&M enters their matchup against the Gamecocks as a slight 3.5-point favorite, which comes as a surprise due to the fact that the Aggies lost to Alabama in week 6, while South Carolina upset a ranked Kentucky team on the road that same weekend, with the belief that momentum has finally swung the Gamecocks way this season.
