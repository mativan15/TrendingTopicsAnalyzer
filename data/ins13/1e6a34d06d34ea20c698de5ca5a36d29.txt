Parker ignored Martin Emerson, who was draped on him in coverage, and leaped, twisting backward in an impressive display of focus and body control to secure the acrobatic 29-yard catch before tumbling to the turf.'Just doing what I do, and you know, Zappe put the ball in the right spot and I just went up and attacked it,' Parker said Wednesday. 'I was able to stay in, and I'm just doing what I'm known for doing: getting the ball.'The fact that Emerson was on him, and Grant Delpit was closing in, didn't faze Parker.
