Eric Dier says the work of Tottenham's late fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone will "live on" in the squad for the rest of their careers as they pushed through the fatigue again in Saturday's 2-0 win over Everton.Spurs are in the midst of a gruelling run of 13 games in 43 days between last month's internationals and the break for the World Cup but Antonio Conte's side have responded impressively to defeat at rivals Arsenal, with wins over Brighton, Frankfurt and the Toffees.Venrtone, a renowned fitness specialist and key member of Conte's staff, died suddenly two days before the game at the Amex following a short illness, leaving the squad stunned.
