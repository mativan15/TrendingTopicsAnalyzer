Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan told Sky News: "I have no doubt that Mr Speaker will look into these issues and it is for him to make the final dissemination". But she added: "It is never acceptable for people to be manhandled or bullied into voting." Yesterday, it was claimed that Tory backbenchers had been bullied and physically "manhandled" during a vote on fracking.
