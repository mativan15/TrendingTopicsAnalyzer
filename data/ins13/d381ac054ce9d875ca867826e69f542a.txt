Bulgaria is home to 230 thousand cows and around 6.9 million humans, which means roughly every 30 people get a cow. The cow that's been living at The Sixth Hammer studios has been demanding a game since the co-creators first discovered what a cow actually is. Well, we are very pleased to announce that Moo Lander is out and available for Xbox One, now! Moo Lander is all about the milk! Embark on an epic quest to save your dying civilization – tame Mighty Cow bosses, uncover ancient secrets and fight hordes of enemies with a powerful milk arsenal.
