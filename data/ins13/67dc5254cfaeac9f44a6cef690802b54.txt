(Bloomberg) -- Nigeria's secret police must release separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu after a court dismissed terrorism charges brought by the government, his lawyer said.Kanu is 'being illegally held in solitary confinement' by the Department of State Services, his lawyer Mike Ozekhome wrote in letters to the director general of the security agency and Attorney General Abubakar Malami dated Oct. 17. He should be 'immediately and unconditionally' released in compliance with a court judgment issued last week, Kanu's lawyer said.
