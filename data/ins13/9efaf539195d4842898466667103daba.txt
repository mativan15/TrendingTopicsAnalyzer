One of the world's largest tech firm's long expected office move in town is, according to sources, inching closer to fruition.

That would be Apple Inc., which sources indicate has reached a final deal to take about 70,000 square feet in the Assembly, the new 110,000-square-foot office building developed by Wexford Science & Technology as part of the larger 355,000-square-foot life redevelopment of the former Ford Motor Co. complex in the Baum-Centre Corridor.

Apple media relations didn't immediately respond to a press inquiry.
