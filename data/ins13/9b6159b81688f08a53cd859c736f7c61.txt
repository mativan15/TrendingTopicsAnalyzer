Boldstart Ventures, a seed- and early-stage venture firm that markets itself as a "day one partner for developer first, crypto infrastructure and SaaS founders," has closed on two new funds roughly 14 months after announcing its last two funds.

The firm -- which began in New York with a $1 million proof-of-concept fund in 2010 -- has closed its sixth flagship fund with $192.2 million, it is announcing today; it also closed its third opportunity-style fund to back its breakaway companies with $175 million in capital commitments.
