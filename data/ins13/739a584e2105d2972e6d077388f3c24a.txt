Tesla's white collar staff face a stark choice: return to the office like their colleagues on the assembly line—or start cleaning out their desks.

In a leaked email from Elon Musk sent on Tuesday entitled 'Remote work is no longer acceptable', the polarizing centibillionaire said only in extreme cases where this was deemed impossible would he personally decide whether to reconsider his decree.

'Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla,' he wrote in an email shared by Tesla shareholder Sam Nissim.
