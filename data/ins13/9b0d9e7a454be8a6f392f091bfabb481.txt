On May 20, 2006, I graduated from the College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York with a master's degree in teaching and $62,000 in student-loan debt. Every month from January 2008 until the COVID payment pause in 2020, I mailed my lender a $325 check.As of May 20, 2022, my outstanding balance stood at $54,500.In other words, I parted with roughly $46,800 and lowered my balance by $7,500. You do the math.I've tried everything to move this unmovable debt. I consolidated. I changed lenders. I did my best to understand how daily insurance accrues.
