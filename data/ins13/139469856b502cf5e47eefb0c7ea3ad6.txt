More than three lakh patients received treatment at the mohalla clinics opened by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab in two months of the initiation of this initiative, said health minister, Chetan Singh Jauramajra. He said over 7,000 people are availing healthcare facilities every day in these 100 Aam Aadmi Clinics, especially for the out-patient department (OPD) patients who were not visiting government health facilities due to fear of standing in long queues.
