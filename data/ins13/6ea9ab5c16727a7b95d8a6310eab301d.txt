GREEN BAY, Wis. – The boos were as cold as the temperature on this mid-October afternoon inside Lambeau Field. They chased the Green Bay Packers offense off the field more than once, to the sideline where it could do no more damage, until fans did the unthinkable with 9 minutes left in the fourth quarter.

That's when the exodus from Lambeau Field's bleacher bowl began. The Packers were only two touchdowns behind, significant but not insurmountable in the Aaron Rodgers era. It didn't matter. These fans had seen enough.
