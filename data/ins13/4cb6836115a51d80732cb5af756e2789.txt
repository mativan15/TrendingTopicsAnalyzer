George Kambosos Jr will defend his undisputed lightweight titles against Devin Haney on his home turf tonight. The Australian star picked up the belts with a shock victory over Teofimo Lopez in his first title challenge last year. He was in talks with Vasyl Lomachenko but will now face the challenge of Haney in his first fight back in his native Australia since 2017. Haney will challenge for all the marbles for the first time in his career having defeated JoJo Diaz in his last fight to retain his WBC world title.
