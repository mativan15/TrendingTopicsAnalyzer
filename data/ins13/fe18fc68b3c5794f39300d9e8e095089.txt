Wisconsin-based furniture retailer Steinhafels plans a 97,000-square-foot store in Orland Park, aided by a sales tax sharing agreement of up to $2 million approved by the village Monday.

The company will remodel spaces at Orland Park Place shopping center formerly occupied by former Bed Bath & Beyond and clothing and housewares retailer SteinMart.

Steinhafels hopes to have the store open by early 2024 and expects to spend more than $8.6 million to renovate the space and make parking lot improvements, according to the company.
