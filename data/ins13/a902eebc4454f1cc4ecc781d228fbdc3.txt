Lithia Motors Inc. stock was down after the big Medford-based car dealership group reported lower earnings than expected before markets opened on Wednesday.

Year-over-year revenue for the company was up 18% to $7.3 billion, about in line with expectations, but at $11.08, earnings per share missed the S&P Capital IQ Consensus by $0.82.

Lithia (NYSE: LAD) was off 7.7% in late-morning (Pacific time) trading at $191.44. That's its lowest level since July 2020. The stock was then in the early stage in a yearlong run-up as tight supply and strong demand during the pandemic drove a spike in car-seller profitability.
