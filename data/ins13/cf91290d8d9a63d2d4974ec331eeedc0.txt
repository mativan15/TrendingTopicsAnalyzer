The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Novavax's Covid boosters for adults in the U.S., including for people who received Pfizer's or Moderna's shots as their primary series.

The authorization of Novavax's booster could significantly increase the role that its shot plays in U.S. vaccination efforts. Up until now, Novavax's vaccine was only authorized as a two-dose primary series, which limited its market because so many people were already immunized with Pfizer of Moderna.

The FDA decision to allow people who received two doses of Pfizer or Moderna to receive Novavax as their third shot means millions of more people can get the Maryland biotech company's vaccine.
