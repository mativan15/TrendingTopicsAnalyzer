Usman Musa had spent more than $1,300 on his 10-hectare rice farm in Nigeria's Kogi state, now submerged by the country's worst floods in a decade.

In a wooden canoe, the 38-year-old father of four paddled his way through the murky waters, passing by his and relatives' houses, the local hospital and school.

Only the roofs were visible.

Across Africa's most populous country, communities and crops of sorghum, maize, rice and vegetables are under water, with farmers and aid workers warning of a possible food crisis.
