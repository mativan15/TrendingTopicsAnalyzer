Making data more accessible and including technology for efficient care delivery can help in the digital transformation of India's healthcare industry, said former US Secretary of Veterans Affairs Dr David Shulkin. Shulkin, who was on a week-long visit to this country, said the cooperation between New Delhi and Washington is "really critical" given the technological resources that India brings to the table.

In an interview with PTI, Shulkin said the Indian government, like the United States, has now set in place policies that are going to be extremely helpful in furthering the digital transformation of the industry.
