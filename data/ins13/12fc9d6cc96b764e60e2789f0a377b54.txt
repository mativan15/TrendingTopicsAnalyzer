A day after the central government rejected the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2022 that ranked the country 107 among 121 nations, several opposition leaders criticised the response. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi - who has been holding public meetings constantly amid the grand old party's 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' - took a jibe at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in his comment.'India stands at 107th spot among 121 countries when it comes to hunger and malnutrition. Now the Prime Minister and his ministers would say - ‘The hunger in India is not growing, rather other nations are not hungry',' he tweeted in Hindi.
