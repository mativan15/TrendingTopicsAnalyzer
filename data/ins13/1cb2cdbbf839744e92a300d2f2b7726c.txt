Born in a hardscrabble town of about 800 in India's Himalayan foothills, Jay Chaudhry has found the United States to be exceedingly fertile ground for his entrepreneurial endeavors.
He has started six companies, SecureIT, Air2Web, CipherTrust, CoreHarbor, AirDefense and his latest venture, Zscaler, most of which were created to help customers deal with computer-related security threats. Focused on cloud security — protecting the growing numbers of companies that base their business on the Internet — Zscaler was hailed by research firm Gartner in April as one of several 'cool vendors' in that market.
