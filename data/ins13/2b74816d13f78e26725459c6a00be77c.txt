As Bayonetta 3's release looms, the series' original voice actor has revealed how little she was offered to be in the sequel.
When the first proper trailer for Bayonetta 3 dropped last year, fans instantly noticed that Bayonetta herself sounded slightly different. Combined with comments from Hellena Taylor, who had voiced the character for the first two games, it seemed as if somebody else had taken up the role.
It wasn't until earlier this month when Bayonetta 3's director, Yusuke Miyata, confirmed not only who the new voice actress was – industry veteran Jennifer Hale – but also why Taylor was replaced.
