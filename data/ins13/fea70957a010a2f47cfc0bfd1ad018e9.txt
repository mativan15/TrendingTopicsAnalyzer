Saturday, Oct. 22 is the day of the Venus Star Point, an astronomical event known for lighting up our hearts. For those who know that Venus is the planet that rules love and romance, that shouldn't come as a surprise.

But what is this mystical sounding event? Technically, it's an example of a 'cazimi:' an occurrence of when a planet connects with the sun at an exact degree. This is also called a conjunction. The term is derived from an Arabic word meaning 'in the heart of the sun.'

Astrologically, think of it like this: The sun is absorbing the 'energy' of the planet, and we're feeling it down on earth.
