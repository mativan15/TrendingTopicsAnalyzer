'ONE of the deceptions of an unproductive life is that today is not
important.' (John Mason) One of the reasons why many people waste their time is
the lack of goals in life.  If we don't have specific goals or dreams of
finishing college for example or working abroad or starting a business, etc.,
chances are we'll just be letting the days go by with no sense of direction. 
The only sense of direction it will have would be wherever the wind
blows.  We would then be at the mercy of what comes up during the
day.
