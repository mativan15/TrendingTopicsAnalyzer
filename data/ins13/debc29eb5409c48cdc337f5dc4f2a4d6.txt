COTA is offering all-summer, one-price passes for all students now through Sept. 15.

The Central Ohio Transit Authority has launched a discount summer pass program for students of all ages running now through Sept. 15.

The passes, which cost $62, allow holders unlimited access to fixed-route buses, on-demand COTA//Plus service, and COTA Mainstream paratransit services at a savings of more $150, the transit agency said in a release.

COTA officials say the pass will help "close the transit gap that often happens during summer when school isn't in session," allowing students of all ages (elementary, secondary, college, university, vocational, tech, trade, etc) unlimited access to public transit for summer jobs, internships, job shadowing, and fun activities.
