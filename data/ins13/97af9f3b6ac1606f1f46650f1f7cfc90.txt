McDonald's recently-released adult Happy Meal was designed to engender feelings of "nostalgia" among its older customers. Instead, it's kicked off a bidding war. The Cactus Plant Flea Market Box has already sold out at many McDonald's locations across the country, meaning that the only way for collectors to get their hands on the toys is through the secondary market. Opportunistic resellers are taking advantage of McDonald's limited-time collaboration with streetwear company Cactus Plant Flea Market to try to make a quick buck.
