EXCLUSIVE: Nineteen Republican-led states are launching an investigation into six large U.S. banks that will examine their involvement in the United Nations' "Net-Zero Banking Alliance," which they say is "killing" American companies. The states, led by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, oppose the UN's environmental, social, governance (ESG) policies that require banks in the alliance to set carbon dioxide emission reduction targets in their lending and investment portfolios, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
