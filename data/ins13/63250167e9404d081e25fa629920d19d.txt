Published: 12:44 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 12:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 The Stormont Assembly should be restored while negotiations continue to resolve issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol, Taoiseach Micheal Martin has said. Mr Martin was meeting local parties in Belfast as the deadline to restore Stormont and avoid fresh Assembly elections rapidly approaches. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the Irish Government now agreed with him that there is 'no quick fix' to the problems created by the protocol, while Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill said there had to be a way forward within the framework of the post-Brexit agreement.
