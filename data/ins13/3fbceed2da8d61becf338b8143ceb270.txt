The Biden administration is basking in credit for helping Israel and Lebanon settle a maritime border dispute that will allow the two countries, historically hostile to each other, to exploit natural gas reserves in the Mediterranean Sea. Both sides signed off on the final draft of the US-brokered deal last week, after President Joe Biden spoke on the phone with Lebanese President Michel Aoun and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid.It would be churlish to gainsay Biden's role in pulling off that rarest of things: an American foreign-policy win in the Middle East.
