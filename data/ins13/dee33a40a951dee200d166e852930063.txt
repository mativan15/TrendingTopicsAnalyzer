A "transformative" bike and pedestrian line that would extend across eastern Coachella Valley cities is on the verge of getting $36 million in state money, valley officials announced Friday.

The Arts and Music Line, being coordinated by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments, would run along Avenue 48 through La Quinta, Indio and Coachella.
