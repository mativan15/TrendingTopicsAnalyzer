Rebellion's latest sniper simulator has taken advantage of the quiet release schedules by going straight to the top of the UK sales charts.
For once a publisher has realised that it's best to release a new game when there's no other competition around and it's paid off for Rebellion, with Sniper Elite 5 earning the series' first number one.
It sold 64% less than Sniper Elite 4 in its first week but given that was in 2017, when digital purchases were less common, it's almost certainly done a lot better overall.
