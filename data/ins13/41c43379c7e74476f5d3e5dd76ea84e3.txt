Days away from the Ontario election, with health care a top issue, what are the three major parties' proposals for fixing Ontario's chronic long-term care problems? The governing Conservatives are planning to open 30,000 more beds and upgrade existing facilities.

The New Democrats would add long-term care spaces, help seniors live at home longer and upgrade the pay of the personal support workers who provide most of the physical care in nursing homes and home-care settings.
