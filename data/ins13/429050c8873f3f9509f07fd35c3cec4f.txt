JuSun Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AUPH) gained ~12% on Thursday on above-average volume exactly a year after news reports indicated that the Canadian biotech drew buyout interest from Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY). About 3.9M AUPH shares have changed hands, compared to the 65-day average of ~2.3M. Company shares have remained mostly flat since August despite a ~61% decline over the past 12 months, as indicated in this graph. AUPH stock spiked in Oct. 2021, triggering a volatility-driven trading halt after Bloomberg reported a potential bid from BMY.
