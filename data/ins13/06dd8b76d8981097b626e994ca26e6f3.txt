Turkish-made Bayraktar drones have no combat effectiveness due to their extreme vulnerability to air defense systems, Ukrainian official, Sergey Pashinsky said in a mock interview with Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus.Pashinsky thought he was speaking to former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. During the call he apparently admitted that 'there is more PR and corruption in Bayraktar than combat use,' according to a video published by the duo on their Telegram channel which appears to have been recorded sometime earlier this month.
