Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Monday ignited a political row with his warning to the state's ministers, telling them he would not hesitate to remove them if they continue to lower the dignity of Raj Bhavan. Khan's warning, delivered via Twitter by the Raj Bhavan spokesperson, prompted a sharp comeback from the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPM] that accused him of 'exceeding limits' and underlined that he could not really remove any minister without chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's consent.
