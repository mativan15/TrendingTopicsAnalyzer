N'DJAMENA (Reuters) -Anti-government protesters ransacked and torched the party headquarters of Chad's newly appointed Prime Minister Saleh Kebzabo on Thursday as security forces dispersed demonstrations calling for a quicker transition to democratic rule.

The vast, military-run Central African nation has been on edge since the sudden death in April 2021 of President Idriss Deby, who ruled with an iron fist for three decades. Deby was killed while visiting troops fighting rebels.

There has been resistance to a transitional military council headed by Deby's son, who took power after the president's death and pushed back elections to October 2024.
