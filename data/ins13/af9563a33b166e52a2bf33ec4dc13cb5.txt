The workforce shortage, innovation and keeping ahead of the curve with technology advancement in aerospace and defense were some of the hot topics discussed among key players in the Dayton defense community Thursday morning.

These discussions were held as part of the Dayton Business Journal's 2022 Aerospace & Defense Forum, in an effort to address issues and solutions in defense and the ever-growing presence of defense across the Dayton region.

Col. Christopher Meeker, commander of the 88th Air Base Wing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, kicked off the forum by outlining his three priorities for the year: dominate the dirty work, take community partnerships to a new level, and put the mission support on the front edge of technology.
