AgenciesFormer World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder bounced back on Saturday night with a vicious knockout victory over Robert Helenius. The bout took place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and turned out to be Wilder's first win after his multiple wars with the undisputed heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury. In the first round, Wilder landed a thunderous punch on Helenius in the first round, sending his opponent into oblivion. The victory served as a strong reminder that the former champ was still one of the scariest men ever to walk this side of heaven.
