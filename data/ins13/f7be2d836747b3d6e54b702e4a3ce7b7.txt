The Mobo Awards will be back in its home of London this year with the next ceremony confirmed for next month. 
Founder Kanya King is leading the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the awards show, which has seen some iconic moments over the past couple of decades thanks to the likes of Mel B, Destiny's Child and Tina Turner. 
This year's Mobos, in association with Lucozade, will be brought to the nation live from OVO Arena Wembley on November 30. 
The awards have been pivotal in supporting the growth of British black music on a global scale, championing homegrown talent, and setting the standard in rap, hip hop, R&B, soul, grime, drill, reggae and beyond.
