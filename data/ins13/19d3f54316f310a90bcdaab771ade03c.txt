Harry Max Markowitz, an American economist, and Nobel Laureate, said, "Diversification is the only free lunch" in investing.During the 1980s, investors noticed the Japanese stock market had been performing well for decades due to its rapid economic development.Countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, and Taiwan successfully adopted similar industrialization strategies and were coined as emerging markets.Investment portfolios in the US and Europe were exposed to the struggles of their domestic manufacturing industries as globalisation accelerated, triggering an asset allocation shift from developed markets to emerging market equities.
