(WBZ NewsRadio) — The group "Missing Dogs of Massachusetts" stepped in to help after one couple's beloved dog named Luna got lost when they were on a trip to Cambridge. Luna is a 2-year-old maltipoo with a tan face and white fur weighing about 6 pounds. In September, Rodrigo Romero and Tanya Gonzalez of New York were visiting friends in the Kendall Square area when their dog ran out the door. Luna escaped the house and ran in the direction of Broadway.
