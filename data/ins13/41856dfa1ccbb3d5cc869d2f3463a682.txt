Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the DDH1 Limited (ASX:DDH) share price is down 29% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 4.0%. DDH1 may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 18% in the last 90 days.
