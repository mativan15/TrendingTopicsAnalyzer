Diablo Immortal is the free-to-play mobile entry in the franchise coming out on Thursday across the globe except for the Netherlands and Belgium. The reason behind those countries not having access to the new game are the laws preventing the selling of loot boxes. A post on the Diablo Immortal subreddit from May 23 had a screenshot of a reply from a Blizzard Entertainment employee in Europe who confirmed players in Belgium and the Netherlands will not be able to install the game when it releases.
