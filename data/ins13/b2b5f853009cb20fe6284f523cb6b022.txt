Online fashion retailer Missguided has called in administrators after failing to secure a rescue bid.Administrators from Teneo were appointed on Monday after the company was issued with a winding-up petition by clothing suppliers who are owed millions of pounds.
Teneo's Gavin Maher said: "As we continue to see, the retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging."The joint administrators will now seek to conclude a sale of the business and assets, for which there continues to be a high level of interest from a number of strategic buyers.
