ROME (AP) — Italy's presumed next premier, Giorgia Meloni, and former Premier Silvio Berlusconi sought to put days of acrimony behind them Monday by meeting privately and presenting a united front as they seek to form Italy's first far-right-led government since World War II.

Officials from Meloni's Brothers of Italy and Berlusconi's Forza Italia parties issued a joint statement saying the meeting, held at Meloni's Rome headquarters, was carried out in a spirit of 'unity of intentions and maximum cordiality and collaboration.
