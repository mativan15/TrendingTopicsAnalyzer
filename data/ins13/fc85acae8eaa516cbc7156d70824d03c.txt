UK Some rare and beautiful types of orchid are being pushed closer to extinction due to a spate of thefts, and botanical experts want to get to the bottom of it.On May 24, the U.K.'s Sussex Wildlife Trust announced that it was "saddened and disappointed" to find that 10 burnt orchids—burnt orchid being the plant's name, not a reference to arson—had been stolen from the Mount Caburn National Nature Reserve in East Sussex.The trust shared a photo of what appeared to be a disturbed patch of ground where the orchid presumably used to be, in addition to an image of a burnt orchid for reference.
