Shares of Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.18% rallied 2.2% early Wednesday, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, +1.12% premarket gainers and to buck the broader market selloff, as a strong earnings report from fellow streaming video provider Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.73% likely provided a boost. Among other streaming video companies, shares of FuboTV Inc. FUBO, +1.73% gained 1.2%, Paramount Global PARA, +1.56% were little changed, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.23% eased 0.3% and Amazon.com Inc.
