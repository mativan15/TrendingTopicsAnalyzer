Liz Truss will be able to claim up to 115,000 pounds as her salary despite having the shortest tenure of any British prime minister in history, a report said. The outgoing prime minister can claim the money form the public duty costs allowance (PDCA) which was brought forth to assist former prime ministers still active in public life, Sky News reported.
