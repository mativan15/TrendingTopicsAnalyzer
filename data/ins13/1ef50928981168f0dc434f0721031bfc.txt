The Athletic has Philadelphia at No. 2 this week. 
It's kind of silly to talk playoff seeding after six weeks, but things are getting late early for the rest of the NFC in the race for the No. 1 seed. Aside from the Eagles, there are only three teams in the conference with a winning record, and Philadelphia has already beaten two of them (Dallas and Minnesota). 
After they rest up this week — well-timed considering the concussion suffered by star right tackle Lane Johnson — the Eagles' next three opponents are the Steelers, Texans and Commanders, all games in which they're likely to be favored by more than a touchdown.
