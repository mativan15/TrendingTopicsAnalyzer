Justin Sullivan Towards the end of July I concluded that I was not ringing the register yet on shares of Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The company was seeing the initial struggles with inflation and while development boosts sales, overall it is a negative for the business as it hurts margins and volume growth prospects.
