Rivian (RIVN) CEO and founder RJ Scaringe addressed the electric auto company's recent recalls head-on at TechCrunch Disrupt this week, saying that in the vehicle space: "There's going to unfortunately be recalls — they happen."

This month, Rivian recalled 13,000 vehicles amid concerns about loose fasteners that affect the driver's control when steering. That's almost all the vehicles that Rivian has ever delivered; the company started delivering vehicles last year, and has since passed 13,198 vehicles on to customers.
