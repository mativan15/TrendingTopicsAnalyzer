Variety - Film News A New York jury has sided with Kevin Spacey in a 40 million civil lawsuit, finding that the Oscar-winning actor did not molest Anthony Rapp when he was a teenager and is not liable for battery. After roughly 80 minutes of deliberations, jurors reached a unanimous decision that Rapp's lawyers had failed to prove that Spacey 'touched a sexual or intimate part' of Rapp.Rapp looked impassive as Judge Lewis Kaplan formally dismissed the case, and Spacey dropped his head briefly.
