The Blue Jays have dropped the interim label for John Schneider, naming him the manager of the team with a three-year deal.

Schneider, 42, was named the Jays' interim manager on July 13, leading the club to a 46-28 record after taking over for Charlie Montoyo. According to the team, the .622 winning percentage is the highest ever by a Toronto manager (minimum of 10 games) in his first season.

'I am honoured, excited, and deeply humbled to continue leading this extraordinary group of players, coaches, and staff,' Schneider said in a statement.
