By Charlie De Mar June 1, 2022 / 11:34 PM / CBS Chicago McHENRY, Ill. (CBS) -- A McHenry woman says she is out thousands of dollars, and the company she hired to work on her property hasn't even started the job. As CBS 2's Charlie De Mar reported Wednesday night, the woman, Pam Gough, also said she hasn't been able to get a straight answer from the company as to when the job will begin. She is so fed up at this point that all she wants is her money back. Gough's home sits along a branch of the Fox River in McHenry.
