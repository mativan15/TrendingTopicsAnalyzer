Two climate activists climbed the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge over the River Thames in London on Monday, October 17, closing part of one of the biggest commuter roads into the capital.

Footage from Just Stop Oil shows Morgan Trowland, a civil engineer and one of two people who climbed the bridge.

Trowland said he and another activist would stay on the bridge until the government issued a 'meaningful statement' to end new licensing consents for oil and gas extraction in the UK.

The protest marks day 17 of Just Stop Oil disruptions across the English capital.
