SPOILER ALERT: Do not read if you haven't watched the season finale of 'She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,' now streaming on Disney+. Throughout 'She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,' Jennifer Walters, aka She-Hulk (Tatiana Maslany), repeatedly breaks the fourth wall by not only directly addressing the camera, but acknowledging that she exists in a Marvel Studios superhero TV show. In the season finale — pointedly titled 'Whose Show Is This?' — Jennifer smashes out of the show entirely, jumping through the Disney+ portal to confront the writers of the show about why the finale is so needlessly convoluted with extraneous, nonsensical plot lines, including one about a cabal of toxic fanboys who troll Jennifer online about being a female superhero who doesn't deserve her powers.
