Two simulation labs will be coming to the Moncton Hospital to help health-care providers practise their skills on "smart mannequins."Friends of the Moncton Hospital Foundation is raising the $850,000 needed for the labs.The labs will be used for practising surgeries, routine procedures and even baby delivery. Greg King, the president and CEO of the foundation, said the mannequins will do everything a real patient would do. He said health-care teams will be able to hone their skills in a simulation before facing the same situation in real life.
