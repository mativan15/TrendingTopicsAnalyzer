Concerns have been raised by the Saskatchewan NDP's education critic after the Saskatchewan government said it did not recommend an anti-hate resource to the province's educators.
Matt Love, who serves as MLA for Saskatoon Eastview, says he was 'a little surprised' that the province's Ministry of Education and the Saskatchewan government were weighing in on what resources teachers should be using.'Teachers are professionally trained to do this. They know their students and they know the local context and where these resources can be used most effectively,' noted Love in an interview with Global News.
