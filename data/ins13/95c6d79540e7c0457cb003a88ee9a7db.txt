krblokhin/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Purpose & Introduction While Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) achieved record first-quarter revenue in Q1, tight margins and lack of focus will keep the stock from soaring to its full potential; I forecast the share price of $27 over an 18-month frame. Urban Outfitters was founded in 1970 and is based in Philadelphia, PA. The company is a global omnichannel specialty apparel retailer for men, women, and children, with multiple distinct brands. The company operates about 653 stores across North America and Europe and distributes products globally.
