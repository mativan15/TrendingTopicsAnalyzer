LEADER OF Opposition in the state Assembly Suvendu Adhikari on Monday urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to remove Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan as brand ambassador of West Bengal and offer the position to former BCCI president Sourav Ganguly. The remarks from the BJP leader came hours after Mamata Banerjee targeted the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the 'unceremonious' exit of Ganguly as its president. Banerjee also sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention in this regard so that Ganguly can contest for the chairmanship of International Cricket Council (ICC) as the Indian representative.
