Zydus Lifesciences on Monday said it has got tentative approval from the US health regulator to market its generic versions of Valbenazine capsules and Roflumilast tablets. Valbenazine capsules are indicated for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (uncontrolled movement of body parts such as face and tongue) while Roflumilast tablets are used for reducing risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in severely affected patients associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations. The tentative approval granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to the company's arm Zydus Worldwide DMCC to market Valbenazine capsules is for strengths 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg, Zydus Lifesciences said in a regulatory filing.
