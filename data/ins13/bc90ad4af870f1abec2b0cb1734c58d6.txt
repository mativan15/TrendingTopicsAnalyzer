Welcome back to How I Made It, Metro.co.uk's weekly career journey series.
This week we're speaking to Denise Myers, CEO of recruitment firm Evenfields, which aims to champion relatable professional role models and tackle employment discrimination.
The 55-year-old lives in Birmingham and she's founded more than one agency in over her long career, as well as holding CEO positions for eight years.
The journey hasn't been easy – she's met discrimination, which is why she's so passionate about helping others avoid that.
