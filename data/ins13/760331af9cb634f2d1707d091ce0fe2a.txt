Billy Ray Cyrus has done little to settle the rumours he's engaged to girlfriend Firerose after snapping her with a diamond ring. 
The Achy Breaky Heart singer was first said to have popped the question in September just weeks after Firerose confirmed their romance. 
In April, Billy's wife Tish, 55, filed for divorce from the musician, 61, after nearly 30 years of marriage. 
His romance with Firerose, a singer-songwriter who is believed to be in her mid-20s, was revealed in August. 
It seems the smitten couple may indeed be engaged after all as on Tuesday, Billy shared a series of photos of him and Firerose looking loved-up and the songstress sporting a noticeably large diamond ring on her left hand.
