Teachers and clergy could be prosecuted if they fail to report suspected child sex abuse, an inquiry set up by the government is expected to say this week.There were more than 85,000 child sex abuse crimes in 2021-22, according to figures released to the NSPCC under a freedom of information request.The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is to publish its final report on Thursday. Lawyers for a group of 120 child sex abuse victims, who gave evidence to the inquiry that began in 2015, say they expect it to back mandatory reporting: anyone working with children would have a duty to report suspected abuse.
