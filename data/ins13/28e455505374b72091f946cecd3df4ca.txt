The owner of a pre-paid funerals company that collapsed before the City regulator begins to oversee the industry is being investigated after paying millions of pounds to related companies, funding a gangster movie and leasing two Porsche sports cars.SHP Capital Holdings was the parent company of Safe Hands Plans, whose failure has left tens of thousands of customers with underfunded funeral plans. The scandal also has shone a light on a 'ticking time bomb' in the market on the eve of 'overdue' regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority, which begins in late July.
