PTIBKU Spokesperson & farmer leader Rakesh Tikait.The "black ink and the deadly attack" cannot suppress the voices of farmers and labourers, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait has said after ink was thrown on him in Bengaluru. Miscreants on Monday threw ink on Tikait during an event organised by a farmers' organisation at Gandhi Bhavan in the Karnataka capital following which three people were arrested. The organisers and the miscreants then attacked each other with plastic chairs. Tikait has held the local police responsible for the episode and alleged that attack on him was in connivance with the BJP-led state government.
