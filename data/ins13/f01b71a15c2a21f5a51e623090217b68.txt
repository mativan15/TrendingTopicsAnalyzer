The US president has branded Liz Truss's original economic plan as a "mistake" amid continued criticism of the prime minister's fiscal policies. Speaking to reporters from an ice cream parlour in Oregon, Joe Biden said he "wasn't the only one who thought it was a mistake" and called the poor outcome of the government's mini-budget "predictable".
Ms Truss's economic plan, which sent financial markets into chaos and caused a steep dive in the value of the pound, has been torn down by critics for not using forecasts by the Office of Budget Responsibility.
