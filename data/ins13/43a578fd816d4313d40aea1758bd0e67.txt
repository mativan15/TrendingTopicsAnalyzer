(Bloomberg) -- One of China's most promising chip designers has already navigated through the Biden administration's export restrictions and concluded it will be able to continue tapping Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to produce its advanced silicon.Biren Technology develops artificial intelligence chips and is considered a promising domestic contender to compete with graphics chips from Nvidia Corp., which has said it can no longer sell its most advanced AI products into China. The US measures were designed to limit China's development of technology that may be used in aid of its military, and appeared to rule out access to advanced fabrication, but Biren believes its AI chips produced by TSMC are not covered by the sanctions, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
