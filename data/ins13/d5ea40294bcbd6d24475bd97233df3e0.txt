Published: 02:43 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 02:43 EDT, 18 October 2022 Anthony Albanese has been accused of 'propping up' a fellow Labor premier by pouring money into a pet project where costs are spiralling out of control and no sound business case has been made.The Albanese government on Sunday announced it will spend $2.2billion on Victorian Labor premier Dan Andrews' Suburban Rail Loop despite the massive project being heavily criticised for not being properly costed or planned.Liberal MP Michael Sukkar, who represents the Melbourne seat of Deakin, said the Albanese government is doing a political favour which breaks their election promise to stop such 'rorts'.
