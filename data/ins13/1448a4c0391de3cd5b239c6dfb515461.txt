Researchers in China say they have developed a process to clone pigs entirely through the use of robots — a development that may help the world's largest pork consumer reduce its reliance on imported breeding pigs. In March, a surrogate mother gave birth to seven cloned piglets at the College of Artificial Intelligence at Nankai University in Tianjin. "Each step of the cloning process was automated, and no human operation was involved," Liu Yaowei, a member of the team that developed the system, said.
