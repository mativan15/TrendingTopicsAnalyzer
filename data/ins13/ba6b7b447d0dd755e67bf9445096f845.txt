TERRY GROSS, HOST: 
 This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, David Sedaris, is a famous humorist who got his start by reading his personal essays on the public radio show This American Life. He's had bestselling collections of his personal essays, and he's received The Thurber Prize for American Humor, the Jonathan Swift prize for satire and humor and the Terry Southern Prize for humor. Several of the essays in his new book take a pretty serious turn. Those essays are about his father, with whom Sedaris had a lifelong combative relationship.
