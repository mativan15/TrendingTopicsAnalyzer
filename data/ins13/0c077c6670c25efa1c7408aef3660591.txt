Indiewire 'Clerks III' (Lionsgate/14.99) is the only major new entry in a week dominated by lower-priced non-pvod films. And its trajectory here tells a tale of how things have changed since Kevin Smith broke out in 1994 with the original 'Clerks.'The new film was released October 14 for home viewing. That accounts for it missing out as No. 1 on Vudu, which ranks by revenue and includes four days before its release, as well as its absence on Google Play, which lags a few days behind other charts.
