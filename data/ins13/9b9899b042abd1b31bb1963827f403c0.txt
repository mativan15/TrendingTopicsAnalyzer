There is no one on the Giants' roster who would question Leonard Williams if the veteran defensive lineman were to speak up about something he did not like or appreciate about what was going down with the team.
Check that. There is one player who would feel a bit uncomfortable if at any time in the past three weeks Williams voiced his opinion for all to hear:
Leonard Williams.
Imagine that. One of the top performers on the roster, affectionately called Big Cat, admitted that being on the outside looking in, missing the past three games, made him wonder what his teammates would think if he offered a suggestion or some advice, given that he was not out there battling with them.
