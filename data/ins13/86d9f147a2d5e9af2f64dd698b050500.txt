Property transactions in Delhi are set to get costlier as the unified MCD has moved a proposal to increase the transfer fee by 1% on the purchase of properties priced above Rs 25 lakh. Since Delhi is mostly a resale market, brokers said this will impact the high-value transactions. "This move puts an additional burden on the property buyers. At a time when home loan interest rates have already started inching up and the Reserve Bank has indicated further increases in policy rates to tame the stubbornly high inflation, the decision to enhance transfer duty will jeopardise the much-needed recovery of the sector," said Amit Goyal, CEO, India Sotheby's International Realty.
