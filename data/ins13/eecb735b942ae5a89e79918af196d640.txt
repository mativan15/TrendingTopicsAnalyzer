Internet celebrity Joe Sugg took to his Instagram and conducted a Q&A with his followers. He has a whopping 6.3 million followers on Instagram. A fan asked if Australian professional dancer Dianne Buswell would welcome a dog, and he said they would love to have one soon. Sugg added that they don't exactly have time to look after a pet and are scared about what might happen if the dog lets go off the leash and jumps at a person who does not like dogs. Joe Sugg and Dianne Buswell have been together since "Strictly Come Dancing" in 2018.
