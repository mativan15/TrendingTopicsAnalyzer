Netflix (NFLX 6.31%) can't seem to catch a break lately. The stock price for the streaming leader has nosedived about 66% year to date and some of the price drop can be attributed to another underwhelming earnings report (this one released in April). From a top- and bottom-line standpoint, the company performed just fine. Total sales ended at $7.9 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates, and its $3.53 diluted earnings per share topped analyst estimates by more than 20%.
It was the streaming platform's updated subscriber count that rattled investors.
