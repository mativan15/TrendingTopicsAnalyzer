GoogleOutfitting your home with smart devices can get expensive quickly, but now you can grab some Google Nest devices for less. The Nest Learning Thermostat is $50 off at Wellbots when you use the code ENGDT50 at checkout, so you'll get it for $199. That's close to the device's record-low price and a decent discount on Google's most capable smart thermostat. You can also pick up the battery-powered Nest Doorbell for $130 using the same code to knock $50 off its usual price, or the wired version for $149 with the code ENGDT80 at checkout, which will discount it by $80.
