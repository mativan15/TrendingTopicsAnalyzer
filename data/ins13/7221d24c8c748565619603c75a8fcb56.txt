DragonImages/iStock via Getty Images Individual investors' allocations to equities fell to their lowest level since late 2020 last month. The May AAII Asset Allocation Survey also shows cash levels rising to their highest level in nearly a year. Stock and stock fund allocations declined 2.7 percentage points to 67.1%. This was the smallest exposure to equities since November 2020 (63.2%). However, the decrease was not small enough to keep equity allocations from staying above their historical average of 61.
