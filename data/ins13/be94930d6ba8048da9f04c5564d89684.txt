One of the first things Thomas Kurian did when he took over as Google Cloud CEO in 2019 was set a lofty goal to triple the unit's dedicated sales staff. Kurian has long made sales a cornerstone of his strategy for Google Cloud as it battles for market share with leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. To accelerate that push, he soon revamped Google Cloud's compensation plan by reducing the sales team's base salary and giving aggressive bonus incentives for exceeding their quotas.The pay arrangement made Google Cloud's sales teams function more like those at Microsoft, SAP, or Oracle, at the last of which Kurian spent decades as a key executive.
