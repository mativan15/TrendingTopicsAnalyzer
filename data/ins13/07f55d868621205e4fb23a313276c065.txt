JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAtlas Copco AB ((OTCPK:ATLKY)(OTCPK:ATLKF)(OTCPK:ATLCY)) is one of our favorite industrial companies, even if it almost always looks expensive. It is not as well-known as some of its competitors, such as Ingersoll Rand (IR) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW). In part due to the fact that it is based out of Sweden. In any case, this is a remarkable company that investors should get to know better and be ready to invest when there are pull-backs. Another reason we very much like Atlas Copco is that it is a company that tries to embed sustainability in everything it does; from financial sustainability to environmental and innovation sustainability.
