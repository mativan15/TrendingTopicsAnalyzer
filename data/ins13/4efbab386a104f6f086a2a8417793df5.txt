AgenciesPic courtesy: TwitterThe sequel to F2: Fun and Frustration is Fun and Frustration. This is more of a sequence than a continuation of F2: Joy and Disappointment. Anil Ravipudi, who also wrote and directed the film, takes the United States of America on a new adventure with some of the characters from the first season, but this time in a one of a kind tale. It's a movie that makes no apologies for inquiring for that you put your head down and snort out loud. In modern-day Telugu films, the fourth wall is frequently shattered and encompasses a lot to strive to do.
