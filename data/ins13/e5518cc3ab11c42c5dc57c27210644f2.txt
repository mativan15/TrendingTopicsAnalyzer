WWE superstar Bobby Lashley is a ridiculous physical specimen – but it turns out he had some drastic ideas to overhaul his character.
The former United States Champion – who is on a collision course with Brock Lesnar after the Beast Incarnate's shock return on Raw last week – has revealed he once pitched to gain up to '70 pounds' after a heavy loss in the ring, only to be saved and pulled out of his slump.
Explaining his pitch to Vince McMahon, he told the then-WWE boss: ‘If I get beat one time, I want to go into this severe depression and put on like 40, 50, 60, or 70 pounds and just be fat and be a completely different character.
