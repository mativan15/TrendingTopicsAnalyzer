RUGBY PLAYERS are more known for being covered in blood and sweat than tears. But on October 17th, when Wasps, a 155-year-old club from the English Midlands, went into administration, players were 'bawling their eyes out', according to the administrator who gave them the news. It was the second club from the Premiership, England's top league, to go under in less than two weeks. Worcester Warriors, also from the Midlands, had suffered a similar fate. The league has been left in disarray, scrambling to salvage the season while players look for new clubs.
