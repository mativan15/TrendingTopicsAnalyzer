Venezuela is expected to start shipping oil to Europe as soon as next month, sources told Reuters, as the continent continues to cut out Russian energy.Five people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Italian oil company Eni and Spain's Repsol could start importing Venezuelan crude as early as next month, resuming supplies halted after the US imposed sanctions in 2019.The sources said the amount of oil was likely to be small and wouldn't affect global oil prices, which are hovering near 14-year highs.
