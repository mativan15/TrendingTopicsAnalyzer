The state of Gujarat announced on Monday that the government would be providing two free LPG cylinders to every household in the western state. Announcing the decision, Gujarat Education Minister Jitu Vaghani said the government was keeping the 18 lakh housewives in the state in mind and was looking to save them some expense. 
The announcement comes close on the heels of the state government's decision to cut 10% VAT on CNG and PNG. Both these measures come a short time before the Election Commission is set to announce dates for the Gujarat Assembly elections.
