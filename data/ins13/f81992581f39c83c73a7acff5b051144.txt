Confidence among small British business owners has fallen to its lowest level since the depths of the coronavirus pandemic as they are squeezed by rising costs and falling revenues, according to the Federation of Small Businesses.Their outlook has become increasingly pessimistic over the past three months over concerns that the economy was headed for a recession.The regular survey of members found that overall net confidence reached -35.9 in the three months to the end of September, down 11.2 points on to the previous quarter.
