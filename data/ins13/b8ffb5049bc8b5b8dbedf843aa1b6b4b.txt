The almost 10-year old secular bull market remains intact despite this year's 25% decline in the S&P 500, Bank of America said in a note on Monday.The bank highlighted that the S&P 500 just passed a very important test after it bounced off of its 200-week moving average. That's a level that has proven to be a "stress test level" for prior cyclical bear markets that occurred during longer-term bull market runs."The five prior cyclical bear markets of 20% or more during secular bull markets ending in October 1957, June 1962, August 1982, December 1987 and March 2020 saw the S&P 500 test, undercut or spend some time below its rising 200-week moving average," BofA's Stephen Suttmeier said.
