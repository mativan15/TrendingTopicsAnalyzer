Justin SullivanThe third-quarter earnings sheet of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is due on October 26, 2022 and the social media company is likely going to update investors about the slowdown in the digital advertising business. Meta Platforms' shares also just made a new 1-year low which indicates that investors continue to see headwinds in the digital advertising market and fear TikTok as a formidable challenger. I believe that Meta Platforms' shares represent deep value here and that, given the low valuation based off of earnings, it will be almost impossible to not make any money on an investment in the social media company in the long run! Meta Platforms: Low Q3'22 EPS expectations Expectations for Meta Platforms are very, very low heading into the Q3'22 earnings report period and I believe it will work to the benefit of investors that may want to take a chance on the social media company.
