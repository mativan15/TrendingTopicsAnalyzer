Northwest Indiana audiences should get ready to have their funny bones tickled when Tracy Morgan comes to town.

The former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star will bring his 'No Disrespect' comedy tour on Nov 4 to the Hard Rock Casino Northern Indiana's Hard Rock Live venue in Gary. Doors open at 7 p.m.

Morgan was recently honored with the New York Friars Club's Entertainment Icon Award at its spring gala. Morgan is only the ninth recipient of the prestigious award and the first Black recipient.
