Shares of SurveyMonkey parent Momentive Global Inc. jumped by as much as 18% in early trading on Wednesday after a report that it is considering a sale.

The San Mateo company is working with a financial advisor after getting takeover interest, according to Bloomberg. No final decision has been made and Momentive could decide to remain independent, the report said.

The news comes after the company said in a regulatory filing last week that it planned to cut its workforce by about 11%. The company has about 1,600 employees globally and besides its San Mateo headquarters at Bay Meadows, it also has offices in San Francisco, New York, Seattle as well as in Canada, Europe and Australia.
