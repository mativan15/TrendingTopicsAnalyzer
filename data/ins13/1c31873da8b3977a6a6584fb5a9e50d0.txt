Jerry Tillery, the 2019 first-round pick, struggled to live up to his draft billing and was being written off.
While he flashed as a pass-rusher, Tillery was a liability as a run defender. Tillery failed to push the pocket and take on double teams, which turned into gaping holes, as evident from the league's worst run defenses last season.

That led to head coach Brandon Staley bringing the proper personnel to the defensive line room to aid the run game, signing Sebastian Joseph-Day, Austin Johnson and Morgan Fox, and drafting Otito Ogbonnia.
