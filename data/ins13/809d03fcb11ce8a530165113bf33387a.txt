Around Parliament knots of MPs are gathering to discuss her future and work out whether one of her rivals can replace her.The only factor keeping her in place is the absence of a way to replace her, as Simon Hoare, a critic and chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, told the BBC on Tuesday.
This is why I think Truss will limp on for weeks or even months, as a 'zombie Prime Minister', in office but not in power.Things might get easier. Time is on her side. She does not have to call a general election for more than two years, which as we know is a very long time in modern politics.
