(Bloomberg) -- China's financial capital reported its fewest Covid-19 cases in three months as residents celebrated an end to mandatory home isolation for most of the city, while some companies continued factory restrictions out of caution. Shanghai saw 15 new infections on Tuesday, the lowest caseload since March 2 and a dramatic drop from the peak of more than 27,000 a day in April. While most of the city's 25 million residents were released from one of the world's most restrictive pandemic lockdowns after two months, about 10% still aren't allowed to move about the city.
