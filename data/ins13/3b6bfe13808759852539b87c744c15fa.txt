Dear Amy: Overall, things are great between my partner 'Beth' and me.

Beth is a teacher and I'm a security engineer. Basically, I work as a computer hacker that stops computer hackers.

Every day after work, I'll listen and weigh in while Beth tells me about troubles at the school, her kids, learning about different teaching methods and policies, curriculum, theories – and everything in between.

Unfortunately, when it comes to me sharing things about my work, she will say, 'I don't like/understand technology' and remove herself from the conversation.
