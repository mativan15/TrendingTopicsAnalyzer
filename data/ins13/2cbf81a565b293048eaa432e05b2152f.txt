HOUSTON — The Bronx Bombers didn't live up to their name, and that includes the newly christened Bronxville Bomber, Harrison Bader himself. For the first time in 24 postseason games, the Yankees didn't hit a home run, which is a likely recipe for defeat in Houston's house of horrors.
They don't love Minute Maid Park under normal conditions — and they missed their main weapon in Game 2 of the ALCS. Their mojo is in their muscles.
The Yankees without a home run are Christmas without Santa Claus.
Like the Patriots without Tom Brady.
