U2 frontman Bono has urged the UK to start leading the world again after claiming the Government has been overtaken by "free market fundamentalists".

The Irish singer praised successive UK governments for helping tackle world debt, fighting HIV/Aids and ending global poverty - particularly during the years of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.
