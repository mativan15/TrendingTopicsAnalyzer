Turkey's central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate for the third time in a row and by a bigger magnitude than forecast, signalling it's close to ending a series of cuts that have pushed an ultra-loose monetary policy to new extremes.Led by governor Sahap Kavcioglu, the Monetary Policy Committee reduced its one-week repo rate to 10.5% from 12% on Thursday, despite annual inflation rocketing past 83%. The MPC said it will consider 'taking a similar step at the following meeting and ending the rate-cut cycle,' according to a statement accompanying its decision.
