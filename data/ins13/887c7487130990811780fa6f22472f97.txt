Last week's Indonesian Game Developer Exchange 2022 played host to the annual Indonesia Game Awards, where local games were recognised and celebrated for their innovation and unique attributes. The big winner of the event was none other than Kitaria Fables, the RPG-life simulator hybrid by Indonesian studio Twin Hearts. The game brought home three awards: Best Gameplay, Best PC/Console Game, and Game of the Year. As an anthropomorphic cat, players are armed with swords, bows and spellbooks, fighting against the rising darkness threatening the world.
