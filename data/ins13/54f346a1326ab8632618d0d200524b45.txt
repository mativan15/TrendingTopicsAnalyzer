Trans activists have hounded Nadhim Zahawi off a Russell Group campus, accusing him of 'inciting hatred' by defining women as 'adult human females'.
The Education Secretary was met with dozens of student protesters chanting 'Zahawi is a transphobe' and 'Tory scum' while visiting the University of Warwick on Friday. 
The Cabinet minister had to be ushered away from campus by security guards in dramatic scenes, as he was pursued by activists brandishing trans flags and placards. 
The furore began when Warwick University's Conservative Association invited him to the campus - one of Britain's 24 top-flight institutions - to speak to students.
