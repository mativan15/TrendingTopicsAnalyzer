A suggestion that Edmonton delay renewal work in as many as 18 neighbourhoods to cover a $10-million shortfall on other building maintenance will not be supported by the mayor. City administrators were asked to come up with options to find more maintenance money and delaying some renewal projects for at least four years was one presented at city hall on Monday. "This is a program that we should not touch. This is a program we will continue to invest in and undertake those repairs in the neighbourhoods and continue on the schedule as it is," Amarjeet Sohi told reporters.
