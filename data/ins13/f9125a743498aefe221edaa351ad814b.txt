European stock markets started the week higher as Britain's prime minister Liz Truss' premiership hangs by a thread as new chancellor Jeremy Hunt attempts to restore faith in the government's fiscal plans.

In London, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) led the way, up 0.3% after the opening bell, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) and the DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.2% on Monday.

Trouble has been brewing following an extraordinary week in British politics as Truss continues to fight to hold on to the top job.
