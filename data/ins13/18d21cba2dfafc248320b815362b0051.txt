Harry Maguire has opened up on his concern for his family after he received a bomb threat to his home in April.Police investigated the allegations and conducted a sweep of the house, as Maguire's family moved out for a few days and the Manchester United captain was taken out of the team.Speaking ahead of England's upcoming Nations League fixtures, the centre-back insisted he is willing to take cricitism for his performances but that a line is crossed when that extends to impacting his family.'Obviously I'm in a position where I'm going to be criticised, Manchester United paid a large sum of money for me, it is one of the most loved clubs in the world and also one of the most hated in the world as well,' Maguire said.
