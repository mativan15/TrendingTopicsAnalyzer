My husband and I are in our early 40s, and we recently met with an attorney to begin estate planning. We now have assets worth $850,000 that we would like to go to our nieces, nephews and charitable organizations upon our death. We have no children. When we recently met with an estate-planning attorney, she gave us several options.  The option she recommended is to establish a trust, which would allow us to avoid probate court. Is probate court really that bad? After all, we will be deceased! I ask because the cost difference of establishing a trust is $3,000 versus $500 for creating a will.
