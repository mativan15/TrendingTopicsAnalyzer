(Note: Peyto and associated companies are Canadian producers that report in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated). Peyto (OTCPK:PEYUF) (PEY:TSX) is the most conservative of the Don Gray controlled companies. As a result, the recovery has been pretty much routine. But Don Gray also controls some companies that would be considered riskier. In this environment, those companies may appeal to risk takers.
