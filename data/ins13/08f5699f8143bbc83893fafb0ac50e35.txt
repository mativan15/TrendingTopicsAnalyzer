Netflix 's third-quarter results and upcoming initiatives signal that the streaming giant's revenue troubles are largely behind it, JPMorgan said. Analyst Doug Anmuth upgraded the streamer stock to overweight from neutral, saying in a note to clients Wednesday that Netflix's foray into advertising should pay off over time. "Coming out of 3Q earnings, we have increased conviction in NFLX's ability to accelerate revenue growth with the help of advertising and monetization of account sharing, expand operating margins, and increase FCF," he wrote.
