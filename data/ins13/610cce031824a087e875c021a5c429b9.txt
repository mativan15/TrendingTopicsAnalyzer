The big shareholder groups in Bankwell Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:BWFG) have power over the company. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

With a market capitalization of US$267m, Bankwell Financial Group is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors.
