With crunchy, juicy, new-crop apples finally here to relieve their long-stored counterparts from last year, apple season is in full swing. There are approximately 7,500 varieties of apples currently grown in the world, and 2,500 in the United States alone. You'll find only four or five kinds in most supermarkets, but your local farmers' market will often stock dozens.

Even now, new cultivars are being bred at research orchards all over the world. For The Times, Elizabeth Landau visited one in Nova Scotia, where she talked to scientists who are studying the genetics of apple diversity.
