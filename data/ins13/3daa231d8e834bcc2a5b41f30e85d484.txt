The by-election scheduled for November 3 became necessary after sitting Congress legislator Komatireddy Raj Gopal Reddy quit the party and joined the BJP in August. The party is hoping that mobilisation for the yatra will aid its efforts to retain the seat. The Bharat Jodo yatris will enter Telangana on October 23, just 10 days before the bypoll. But, sources in the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) said several state leaders were unhappy about being pulled out of the Munugode bypoll battlefront to join Rahul Gandhi as he traverses through the state for at least a week.
