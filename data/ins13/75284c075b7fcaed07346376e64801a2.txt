Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter, who will be seen in the upcoming film Phone Bhoot, spilled some beans about the movie and Katrina Kaif in an mockumentary interview by Excel Movies. The interview is entertaining throughout, with Siddhant making fun of Ishaan for not knowing how to act in a comedy film and Ishaan remaining silent when asked if he received more money for the film.

Siddhant and Ishaan concurred on camera that it is best to read the script before responding or saying yes to a movie.
