Regina city council voted unanimously to move forward with an application to both the federal and provincial government to use the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP) to replace the aging Lawson Aquatic Centre. City administration said the province requested submissions by the city for how it plans to use the remaining $128 million allocated to them. ICIP funding is supposed to go towards green initiatives, city parks and transit upgrades. Regina resident Carl Cheland said the city needs to focus on its 'Transit Master Plan.
