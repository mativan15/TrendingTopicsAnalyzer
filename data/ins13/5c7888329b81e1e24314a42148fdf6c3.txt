WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's chairman pledged on Friday to reform the bank after a "horrible" 2021 in which it lost billions of dollars.

"We had last year a horrible year. We had the biggest loss in the 166 years of the company," Axel Lehmann said. "We are fully aware that we need to change and we will change, clearly."

Lehmann took over in January at the Swiss bank, which has been hit by a corporate spying scandal, investment fund closures, heavy losses and a string of lawsuits.
