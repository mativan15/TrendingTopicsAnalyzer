Fidelity Digital Assets was founded in 2018 to enable institutional investors to store and trade Bitcoin — its parent company announced in April that it will add Bitcoin to its 401(k) offerings.

The firm is now looking to hire 110 engineers and blockchain developers, along with 100 customer service executives, to build the infrastructure to support cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin, the firm's president Tom Jessop told The Wall Street Journal.
