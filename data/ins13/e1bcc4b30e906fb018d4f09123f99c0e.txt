D﻿undee United goalkeeper Carljohan Eriksson is determined to get revenge against St Mirren on Saturday after the Paisley side ruined his debut earlier this season. S﻿tephen Robinson's side put three by the Finn on his Tannadice debut in August.'We will definitely be happy to get some revenge from one of the worst performances of the season at Tannadice,' he said.'We definitely want to get that corrected. But it's going to be tough, they have started the season brilliantly.'A﻿fter a tricky start to life between the sticks in tangerine, Eriksson has gained belief from recent showings.
