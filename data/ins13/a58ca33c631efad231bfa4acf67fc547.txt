A GoFundMe has raised $2.4 million for four children who were left without parents after the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers. 
Irma Garcia, who taught at Robb Elementary school for 23 years, died on Tuesday while she was protecting her children from the shooter. 
Shortly after the tragedy, her husband of almost 25 years, Joe Garcia, died from a heart attack, likely caused by the stress from the incident. 
The deaths leave their children: Cristian, 23; Jose, 19; Lyliana, 15; and Alysandra, 12, without parents.
