The lawsuit is not the only allegation of financial issues Horn has taken on lately. Last week, SFGATE reported on other money woes the restaurateur has faced, including unpaid invoices and bouncing paychecks. Horn addressed some of the concerns raised in the story in a Facebook post published earlier this week.

In Kim's complaint, which was filed in September 2021 and recently reviewed by SFGATE, the former business partner alleges that after meeting Horn in April 2019, he became an indispensable part of Horn's then-burgeoning business plans, assisting "with public relations and bringing in investors.
