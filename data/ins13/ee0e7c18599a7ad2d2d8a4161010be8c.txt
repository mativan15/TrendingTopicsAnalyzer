Europe's largest technology company also said it did not expect a large impact from U.S. sanctions on China. CEO Peter Wennink said customers were focusing on plans to expand their long-term capacity, rather than the current economic slowdown and weakness in end-markets such as those for smartphones, personal computers or memory chips.
