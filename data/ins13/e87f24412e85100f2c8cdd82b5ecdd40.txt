Social media platforms Facebook and TikTok failed at enforcing their policies despite each being hit with ads containing 'blatant' misinformation about the 2022 midterm elections, a new report found.

The report, which stems from an investigation by watchdog Global Witness and New York University's Cybersecurity for Democracy (C4D) team, describes researchers' efforts to post 20 ads with misinformation to Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.

The ads were in both English and Spanish language and targeted multiple battleground states in the midterms such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia.
