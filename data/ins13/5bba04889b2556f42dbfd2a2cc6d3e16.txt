In a nutshell, artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer system that exhibits self-learning behavior or cognition. Cognitive computing systems are computers that use techniques such as machine learning to automatically determine how best to execute tasks without being explicitly programmed using rules.For example, let's say you have data showing that people who bought your product were going to buy something new with about a 30% chance of higher profit margin. You also have an algorithm that determines what percent of your sales staff should be responsible for finding new customers in this specific area.
