Sarah JacobsBy Sarah JacobsOct 17, 2022Check your lottery tickets, especially if you were recently in Ft Myers. There were two jackpot-winning tickets sold for Friday's Mega Millions drawing for $494 million; one in California, and one in Florida. The Florida ticket was sold at a 7-eleven store in Ft Myers, which means someone in the Sunshine State is a new millionaire! It actually makes me really happy to think that someone in Ft Myers won that money. With everything the community there has been through, winning the lottery would be an incredible blessing for some person who (maybe) lost their home in the hurricane.
