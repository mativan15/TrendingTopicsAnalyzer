OTTAWA — The intelligence chief of the Ontario Provincial Police told a federal inquiry Wednesday that he saw no 'credible' information of a national security threat or extremist violence during the self-styled 'Freedom Convoy' protests.

The statement appears to contradict assertions from the federal government, which cited the threat of political violence as part of its justification for invoking the Emergencies Act to deal with the demonstrations last winter.

Supt. Pat Morris, the head of the OPP's Provincial Operations Intelligence Bureau, told an inquiry probing the use of the Emergencies Act that his unit turned up no direct evidence of a threat of extremist violence after weeks of analysis and information-gathering on the protest participants.
