A chess player accused of cheating is taking legal action against leading figures in the game who he claims 'destroyed his life' simply because he beat the reigning world champion.
Rising star Hans Niemann, 19, has filed a lawsuit against grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, 31, and others claiming he was being unfairly targeted for having the 'audacity' to defeat the 'so called King of Chess'.
In a claim launched in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, the American said he 'wanted to set the record straight'.
