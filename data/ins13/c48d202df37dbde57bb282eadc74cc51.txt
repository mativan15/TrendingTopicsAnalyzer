About 30 people gathered in a lecture hall at Valparaiso High School Thursday night to get advice from two voting rights advocacy groups on how to have a voice in the city's redistricting efforts. While only 0.10% of Valparaiso's total population, the whole point of their presence is representation — and transparency.

The League of Women Voters of Porter County and Common Cause Indiana co-hosted the event which walked attendees through the redistricting process and gave a tutorial on how to submit their own redistricting maps for consideration by the Valparaiso City Council.
