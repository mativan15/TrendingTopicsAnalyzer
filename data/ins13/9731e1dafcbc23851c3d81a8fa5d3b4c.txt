By Australian Associated Press Published: 02:25 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 02:25 EDT, 19 October 2022 More iron ore railcars destined for West Australian mines will be manufactured in the state over the next four years, in a move experts have called an "industry first". Mining giant BHP has committed to building 140 "flat-pack" iron ore railcars locally, in conjunction with engineering firm UGL and QRRS, and with financial support from the state government. BHP typically orders "several hundred" rail cars from overseas manufacturers each year but a pilot program has seen five built in Australia so far, with another 15 due by February 2023.
