Klay Thompson bristled at the suggestion he could retire after next season.
'There was a report out there: I have no intention of retiring in 2024,' Thompson said. 'So if you write some dumb s–t like that, just be held accountable, because that's crazy. Just because I didn't play 5-on-5 doesn't mean I'm gonna retire. That's absurd. That's all I'm gonna say.'
Connor Letourneau, a sports reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, theorized in an interview with KNBR that Thompson could retire after his deal expires in 2024.
