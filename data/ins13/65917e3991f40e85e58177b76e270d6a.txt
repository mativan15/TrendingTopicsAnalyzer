Britain's cinemas are to introduce digital ID 'cards' for children as proof of age to prevent them seeing sex and violence in adult films.
The UK Cinema Association, which represents 90 per cent of outlets, will from Monday accept a digital ID app which confirms the age of a child to box office staff based on a previously uploaded official document such as a passport.
The technology, developed by digital ID provider Yoti, will help cinemas fulfil their legal obligations to bar children from adult films and is part of a wider move towards digital IDs for children where there are restrictions on age-related products.
