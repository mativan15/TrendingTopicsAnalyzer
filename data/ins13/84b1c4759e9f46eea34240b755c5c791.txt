Q I am currently in Madeira and have just received an email from easyJet saying my flight back to London Gatwick next Wednesday 1 June has been cancelled. The only flight available is on Monday, so I lose two days of my holiday. Am I due compensation?James CA The latest batch of easyJet cancellations – 24 flights to and from Gatwick every day between today and Monday, 6 June – has me seriously concerned. The principle is sound enough. Britain's biggest budget airline has been making very short-notice cancellations all week.
