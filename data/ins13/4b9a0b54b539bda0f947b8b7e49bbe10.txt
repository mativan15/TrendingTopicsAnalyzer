In remarks that will be seen as a clear criticism of Ms Truss, she wrote: 'The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes.
'Pretending we haven't made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can't see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics.
'I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign.'
The comments will be taken as a very thinly veiled reference to Ms Truss staying on after sacking Kwasi Kwarteng over the mini-Budget fallout.
