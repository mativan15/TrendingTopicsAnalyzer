A new public-service campaign custom made for investing during these meme-filled times is sparking outrage from some on social media who say it pokes fun at the very people it's meant to educate. The pushback is less about the spot, which features a satirical TV game show called 'Investomania,' than it is about who's behind it: the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Videos posted on the SEC's YouTube account, which feature two contestants choosing where to put their money from options including 'crypto to the moon,' 'meme stocks' and 'stocks on margin,' mark a fresh attempt by Wall Street's main regulator to encourage people to research before investing.
