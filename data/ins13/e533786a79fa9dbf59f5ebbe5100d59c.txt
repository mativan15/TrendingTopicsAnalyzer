Rob Rinder has become the latest star to scrutinise David Beckham over his involvement with the Qatar World Cup, claiming it is choosing ‘money over morals'. 
Former England footballer Beckham was announced as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on November 20. 
However, human rights groups have condemned the Middle Eastern nation over their laws against the LGBTQ+ community, while others have highlighted the treatment of women and local workers. 
Last year, an investigation that revealed over 6,500 workers had died while working on preparation for the World Cup.
