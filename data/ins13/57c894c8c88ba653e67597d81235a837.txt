WASHINGTON — Whenever his aides are pressed about President Joe Biden's political future, they'll often point to one person as the true decider: his wife of 45 years, Jill Biden.She is, after all, her husband's foremost defender. She guards his interests and dignity, and expects his staff to do no less. Her input is essential in some of the weightiest political and personnel decisions the 46th president confronts. Outside of the president himself, Jill Biden is the single most important voice in a decision that will reverberate through the Democratic Party, the Biden family and the country for years to come: whether her husband seeks a second term in 2024.
