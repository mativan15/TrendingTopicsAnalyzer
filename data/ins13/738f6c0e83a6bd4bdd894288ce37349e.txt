hapabapa Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is aggressively expanding its e-commerce business and focusing on technology to expand margins. In my opinion, Walmart is poised to become Amazon's (AMZN) biggest competitor. Would Walmart thus merit also an Amazon-like valuation? Yes, I think so. As of October 2022, WMT trades at an EV/Sales of x0.7 and EV/EBIT of x17.7, as compared to x2.3 and x78 for AMZN respectively. These multiples will eventually converge. Amazon's valuation will likely go much lower, as the growth story fades, and Walmart's will go slightly higher, as e-commerce expansion and efficiency gains are priced in.
