The Texas Rangers hired Bruce Bochy to be the 20th full-time manager in franchise history Friday, signing him to a three-year contract. 
Bochy has previously managed the San Diego Padres from 1995-2007 and the San Francisco Giants from 2008-2019, most notably winning three World Series with the Giants in 2010, 2012, and 2014. 
Bochy is the only manager in MLB history to win 900 games with two different teams and has over 2,000 total wins. 
'On behalf of the entire organization, I want to welcome Bruce and Kim Bochy to the Texas Rangers,' said Rangers Executive Vice President & General Manager Chris Young.
