The government lifted the ban on fracking in England last month

Labour has called on Tory MPs to "put country over party" and back its push for a vote on banning fracking.

The party wants to use a vote in Parliament on Wednesday to force the introduction of a draft law to ban the extraction of shale gas.

Last month, the UK government ended the fracking ban in England as part of its plan to limit rising energy costs.

Now Labour says it wants to give MPs a chance to overturn the decision, which broke a 2019 Tory manifesto promise.
