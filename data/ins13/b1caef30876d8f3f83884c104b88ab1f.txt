The National Stock Exchange might exclude from the Nifty index in the next few weeks as the HDFC and merger may be completed a few months earlier than expected, according to analysts. The housing finance company with a 5.5% weight in the Nifty could see an outflow of around $1.3-1.5 billion from the passive funds once it's excluded from the benchmark, they said. and are among the top contenders to replace HDFC, said analysts. 'As HDFC is a part of all the Nifty indices, the stock could see major selling coming from passive trackers of the Nifty 50 Index,' said Abhilash Pagaria, head of brokerage Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, in a client note.
