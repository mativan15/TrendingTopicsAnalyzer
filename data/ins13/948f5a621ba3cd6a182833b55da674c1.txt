Jim Redmond, who created one of the most memorable moments in Olympic history during a 400-meter men's race at the 1992 Games when he leaped onto the track to help his injured son, Derek, make his way across the finish line, died on Oct. 2 in Northampton, Britain. He was 81.

Derek Redmond announced the death on Instagram but did not provide a cause.

A champion sprinter from England, Derek Redmond was widely favored to win a medal at the 1992 Games in Barcelona.

He had been a member of the 1991 English men's relay team, which overcame steep odds to take the gold at the world championships.
