Bob Farrell is a Wall Street legend who spent his 45-year career working at Merill Lynch after being taught by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia University. Considered a pioneer of technical analysis, Farrell outlined 10 stock market investing rules in a 1998 note towards the end of his career. It went unnoticed amid the dot-com bubble, but slowly built recognition as much of the rules he outlined rang true as the stock market declined from 2001 to 2003.More than two decades later, Farrell's 10 stock market rules are resonating again as investors navigate a period of high inflation, rising interest rates, and heightened economic uncertainty.
