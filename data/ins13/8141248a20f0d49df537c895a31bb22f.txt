MEXICO CITY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Mexico's America Movil will sell the cellular towers it kept in the Dominican Republic and Peru after spinning off its tower business, the firm's Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia said on Wednesday during a call to discuss third-quarter results.

The Mexican telecommunications giant completed the spin-off of its cellular tower business in August.

"It still depends on site management and what they decide, but we think we are going to sell (the towers) in Dominican Republic and also Peru," Garcia said, adding that it would likely happen at the beginning of next year.
