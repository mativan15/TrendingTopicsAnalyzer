Susan Morgan moved with her family 20 years ago to a 5-acre home in Wittmann, a small rural community that sits just outside of Surprise but is part of the city's plans for future growth to the northwest.

Over two decades, Morgan said she worked hard to build-out a livestock ranch at her home, which serves as a sanctuary and adoption facility for miniature donkeys.

"It's my life's work," she said.

But as more people move to Arizona and growth continues to move outward in the Valley, Morgan, as well as other residents, are concerned that new proposals for master-planned communities and increased density could negatively affect the longtime rural homes, cattle ranches and existing water resources.
