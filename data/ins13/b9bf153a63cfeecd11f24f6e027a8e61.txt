In early October 2017, The New York Times published an explosive story detailing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment of young female actors following a whistle-blowing call from Rose McGowan. 
No one knew it, but society was on the cusp of a seismic reckoning.
Then, on October 15, 2017, the US actress Alyssa Milano posted a tweet calling on her followers to reply ‘me too' if they had been sexually harassed or assaulted.
Within 24 hours she had garnered 12million responses across social media: #MeToo had gone viral.
