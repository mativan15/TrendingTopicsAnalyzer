New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley could have easily run the ball into the endzone late in the fourth quarter, giving him an extra few yards and an additional touchdown.
Instead, knowing he could seal the game by going down, Barkley did just that at the 2-yard line. It was a high IQ play.

'Our coaches do a really good job not only in that situation but throughout the week. We practice all those situations. The run before that, I feel like if I really wanted to, I could have went this way and kind of scored but I was focused on protecting the ball,' Barkley told reporters.
