European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently called cryptocurrencies 'based on nothing' and said she is concerned about people 'who have no understanding of the risks, who will lose it all and who will be terribly disappointed, which is why I believe that that should be regulated.'
This comes at a time when the crypto market tumbled by more than 50 per cent and investors lost billions of dollars in a matter of few hours. The world governments are trying to grapple with crypto, either by imposing restrictions or by making it a legal tender like El Salvador.
