Twitter simplified its privacy policy earlier this month, encouraging us to read it by turning parts into a video game. Yes, a game - it's called the Twitter Data Dash.In it, you use keyboard arrows to take a dog named Data to the park while dodging cat ads and battling trolls, meanwhile learning about Twitter's new 4,500-word privacy policy. OK, who are we kidding: No one has time for that. I applaud Twitter for putting effort into being more understandable. The same goes for Facebook, which last week rewrote its infamous privacy policy to a secondary-school reading level - but also tripled its length to 12,000 words.
