AgenciesThe Muslim side has argued that the plea is not maintainable as the Places of Worship Act 1991 prohibits conversion of any place of worship and mandates the maintenance of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.A letter has been written on behalf of the Anjuman Intrageniya Committee to the Varanasi district court demanding that the report of the commission should not be made public in the Gyanvapi mosque survey matter. The letter also referred to applications in the court for the certified copy of the commission's order.
