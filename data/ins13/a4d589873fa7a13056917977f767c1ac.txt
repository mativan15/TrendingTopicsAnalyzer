Snoop Dogg is scrapping all international dates from his 2022 calendar, blaming 'unforeseen scheduling conflicts'.

As previously reported, the rap star had postponed his forthcoming tour of Australia, what was to be his first visit there since 2014. Those shows are 'looking likely' to be rescheduled to February 2023, say the promoters for that planned outing, TEG MJR.
