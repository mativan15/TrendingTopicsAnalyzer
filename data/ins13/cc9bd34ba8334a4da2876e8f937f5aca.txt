Amber Heard intends to appeal against the verdict in the high-profile defamation case won by Johnny Depp, her lawyer said. Elaine Bredehoft told NBC's Today show on Thursday that "there's no way jurors couldn't have been influenced" by the social media circus surrounding the trial. The intense media coverage of the trial turned the courtroom into a 'zoo,' she added. "It's like the Roman Colosseum, you know?" Ms Bredehoft said. "How they viewed this whole case. I was against cameras in the courtroom and I went on record with that and argued against it because of the sensitive nature of this.
