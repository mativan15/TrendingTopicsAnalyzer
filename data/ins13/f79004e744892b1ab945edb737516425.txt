Jun. 4—Patricia T. Russell Park in Keene will close Monday for long-planned renovations that are expected to last through late fall, the city's parks and recreation director said.

A temporary construction fence will go up Monday to protect the public during construction, which Parks, Recreation and Facilities Director Andy Bohannon said is estimated to last until mid-November "as long as we don't have any major hurdles.
