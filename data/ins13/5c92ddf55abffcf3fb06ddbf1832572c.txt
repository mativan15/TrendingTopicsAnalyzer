Chandigarh/Ludhiana : Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on Tuesday asked chief minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Dr Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor, terming his appointment 'totally illegal'. A renowned biotechnologist, Gosal was appointed as the PAU V-C two months ago. Though his predecessor BS Dhillon had retired on June 30, 2021, the government did not appoint a regular V-C till until two months ago. The governor, who is the chancellor of the PAU, said the government had appointed Gosal without following the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms and approval of the chancellor.
