Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) on Monday said the expanded area for international transfer passengers will be operational soon at terminal 3. DIAL is the operator of the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in the national capital, and it is also the largest in the country. The need for expansion of the International-to-International (I-to-I) transfer area arose to accommodate the increasing number of international transfer passengers at terminal 3, according to a release. The newly extended I-to-I transfer area spans approximately 3,000 square metres, which is double in size of the previous I-to-I transfer area.
