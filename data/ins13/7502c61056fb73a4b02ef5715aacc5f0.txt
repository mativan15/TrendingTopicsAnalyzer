Speeding up the regulatory process for critical mineral mines in the North is a goal of the federal government, according to Canada's natural resources minister."Critical minerals are essential for us to be able to successfully execute an energy transition," said Jonathan Wilkinson. If Canada doesn't mine more critical minerals, he said, it can't make batteries for electric vehicles needed to reduce emissions from transportation.Rare earths, for example, are a critical mineral said to be crucial in technology like computers, LED displays, wind turbines and electric vehicles.
