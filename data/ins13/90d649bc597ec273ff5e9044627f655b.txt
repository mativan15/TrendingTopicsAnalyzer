'Matike a, matike a, mata ki luga ua liu ki tua.' Get up, look up, don't look back. That's the message Niuean singer and songwriter Eunique Ikiua, also known as Heiressofthegame, has for her fellow Niuean youth across Aotearoa. Deploying the school motto of none other than Niue High School, Ikiua has recorded her first professional song and accompanying music video, and included a verse in her native Vagahau Niue (Niue language). The song, Blessed, was meant to be her first professional track all in English, actually.
