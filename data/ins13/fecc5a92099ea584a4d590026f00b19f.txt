The NSW government will seek damages from the state's main rail union in the courts if it pushes ahead with plans to shut down Opal card readers at Sydney train stations during evening peak periods indefinitely.

Transport Minister David Elliott warned that the industrial action could cost the government tens of millions of dollars and that it would seek to retrieve the lost fare revenue from the NSW Rail, Tram and Bus Union in the Federal Court.

'That could be very expensive for the union,' he said on Tuesday.
