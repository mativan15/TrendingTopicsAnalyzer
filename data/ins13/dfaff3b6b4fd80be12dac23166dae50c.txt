Speaking to reporters the day after her disqualification from the NDP leadership race, Anjali Appadurai said she planned to stick with the party despite not being allowed to complete her campaign — a decision she called unfair."This conversation we've started here is so much bigger than me, so much bigger than the B.C. NDP," said Appadurai. "It's about what we compromise for power ... what we compromise for winning the next election."Standing outside the provincial legislature in Victoria Thursday afternoon, Appadurai said there was "an assumption of illegitimacy" toward her campaign from the outset.
