The Kerala government has given a written assurance of meeting the demands of social activist Daya Bai, who is on a hunger strike seeking justice for Endosulfan victims of Kasaragod district.
This comes a day after State ministers R Bindhu and Veena George visited Daya Bai at the general hospital here and requested her to end the fast, while promising to meet 90 percent of the demands put forth.
However, the 81-year-old activist has decided to continue her strike here, saying some of her demands were not fulfilled.
