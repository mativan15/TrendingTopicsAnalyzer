We've seen a boom in the last several years around tech built for front-line, service, manual, and other workforces typically paid on an hourly wage. In one of the latest developments, Hourly.io -- which has built an app that tracks working hours, generates payroll, and then calculates and assigns workers compensation insurance to individuals based on that -- has closed in on $27 million in funding.

Hourly.io is based out of the U.S. -- Palo Alto to be exact -- but it has strong Israeli roots in the form of co-founders Israel transplants Tom Sagi and Shay Litvak, and that is following through also in the VCs backing it.
