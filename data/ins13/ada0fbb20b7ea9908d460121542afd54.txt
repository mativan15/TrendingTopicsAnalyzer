Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) is scheduled to report its Q3 2022 results on Wednesday, October 26. We expect BMS to report revenue and earnings slightly above the consensus estimates, led by continued market share gains for Eliquis, Opdivo, and Reblozyl, partly offset by forex headwinds and an expected decline in Revlimid sales, which now face biosimilar competition.
