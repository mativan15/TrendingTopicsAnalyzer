Addressing a rally at the Ramlila Maidan on Sunday to kick-start the BJP's campaign for the upcoming Delhi Municipal Corporation elections, BJP national president J.P. Nadda said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) came to power promising a clean government but has become 'synonymous with scams'.
He asked party workers to go door to door and inform the people of Delhi about the 'development' that the Narendra Modi government has brought about across the country, and the 'corruption' of the AAP government.
