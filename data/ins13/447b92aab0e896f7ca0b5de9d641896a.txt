Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson has been sacked 16 times through five games, which represents the sixth-highest total among QBs this season.

Those sacks have killed drives and worn on Wilson's body — he's now battling through a partially torn lat entering Week 6.

Some of the sacks have been Wilson's fault after he held the ball too long, but there have also been numerous cases where protection broke down on the line.

'It's my job to protect him, and it's my job to keep him clean,' Broncos guard Dalton Risner said last week.
