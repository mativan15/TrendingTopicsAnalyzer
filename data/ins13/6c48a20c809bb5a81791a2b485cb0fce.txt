Erika Jayne Girardi has claimed that she was joking when she suggested that Dorit Kemsley and her husband, Paul ‘PK' Kemsley, would split.
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star stirred up all kinds of drama at BravoCon this weekend when she gave her opinions on who would be the next Bravo couple going to ‘splitsville'.
She left the audience – and her fellow colleagues – shocked when she strutted up to the front of the stage and simply mentioned her RHOBH castmate's name, before calmly returning to the sofa.
