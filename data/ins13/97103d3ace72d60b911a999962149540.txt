Generac (NYSE:GNRC) was downgraded by more analysts after the maker of backup generators warned that its earnings had shrunk amid a drop in revenue. The warning on Wednesday triggered a 25% drop in its stock price, the biggest decline in data going back 12 years. Analysts at Roth Capital cut their investment rating on Generac by two steps to a Sell from a Buy, while Keybanc lowered the stock to a Sector Weight from Overweight. Generac is among the manufacturers of building products that are being negatively affected by weakness in the housing market as the Federal Reserve raises the cost to borrow.
