A woman whose father and daughter were murdered in Thailand, leading to fears for her safety, has been denied refugee status in New Zealand. The woman, who can be identified only as AO, was first declined refugee status by an Immigration New Zealand officer. She then appealed to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. The Tribunal's recently released decision said the woman's father, an 'influential person in the village', was murdered on the instructions of a district leader when she was a child.
