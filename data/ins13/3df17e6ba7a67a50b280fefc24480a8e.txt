China on Wednesday put a hold on a proposal by India and the US at the United Nations to blacklist Pakistan-based militant Hafiz Talah Saeed, the son of Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, in the second such move within two days. Hafiz Talha Saeed is a senior leader of the LeT and is the head of the cleric wing of the terrorist organisation. Earlier, China had put on hold a proposal to list Pakistan-based LeT leader Shahid Mahmood as a global terrorist. Incidentally, it coincided with the visit of the UN Secretary General to India and the Financial Action Task Force plenary meeting in Paris.
