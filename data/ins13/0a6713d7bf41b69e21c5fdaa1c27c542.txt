By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields slid on Tuesday, tracking moves in UK and European bonds, as recent moves by the British government to stabilize its bond market have eased a bit of market anxiety that has led to some short-covering. U.S. benchmark 10-year yields fell for the first time in four days. They were last down nearly 1.2 basis points (bps), at 4%. The 10-year gilt yield also fell about four bps to 3.935% , after earlier rising after the Bank of England said it had not decided to delay the start of its "quantitative tightening" sales of gilts again.
