Oct. 15—LIGONIER — Five Medals is returning to Michiana for another year of large-scale historical reenactment Oct. 22-23

Five Medals at The Trace is a living history experience, spanning the middle 1600s up through the War of 1812. It relives the lives of the pioneers entering the area and their Native counterparts following Treaty of Greenville, which was designed to end the Northwest Indian War. Among those present for the signing was a chief of the Elkhart River Band of Potawatomi named Wonongaseah, who is the namesake for the weekend-long historical reenactment,

Wonongaseah, roughly translated as "Five Coins" or "Five Medals" signed at least six treaties of either peace or land cession during his lifetime.
