After breaking into the team in Scotland the 18-year-old has been mooted with a move down south, but King has been told to remain at Ibrox and ignore rumours to English sides.The teenager was thrown into the Rangers team that travelled to Anfield to take on Liverpool in the Champions League as his side were defeated 2-0 by Jurgen Klopp's outfit, and his impressive performances have seen him linked with a move to United, Newcastle and Leeds with his contract up in 2024.
