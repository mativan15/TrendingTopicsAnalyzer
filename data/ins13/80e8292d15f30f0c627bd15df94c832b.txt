Taylor Swift describes lawmakers as narcissists who hide their true intentions behind good deeds, in the first single from her new album, 'Midnights.'

The 32-year-old singing star released her highly-anticipated new music on Friday.

In 'Anti-Hero,' the first single off the album, Swift included a political dig in a pair of lines.

'Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguised as altruism,' Swift sings in the tune. 'Like some kind of congressman,' Swift says in the next line of the song.

In a music video for 'Anti-Hero' released Friday, written and directed by Swift, the Grammy Award winner is seen solemnly sticking a political pin on her chest with a message reading, 'Vote for me for everything' on it.
