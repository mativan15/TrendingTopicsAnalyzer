So, another one bites the dust. Well, two in, fact, in 24 hours – first, Home Secretary Suella Braverman last night, and now Prime Minister Liz Truss herself, who just announced her resignation this lunchtime in yet another extraordinary plot twist to the Westminster chaos. And breathe. Who'll go on to replace Truss as leader will be decided in the next week (has Rishi Sunak got lucky with a second chance?) but on the home secretary side, the country has already got itself a replacement: Grant Shapps, a former transport secretary, who is now less than 24 hours into his new gig.
