The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a special sitting Saturday to hear Maharashtra's plea against the Bombay High Court order acquitting former Delhi University Professor G N Saibaba in a case relating to his alleged Maoist links. A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice Bela M Trivedi is likely to hear the matter at 11 am. On Friday, the top court had refused to stay the Bombay High Court order. Following the High Court acquitting Saibaba, the Maharashtra government swiftly moved the apex court seeking a stay on the order which was declined.
