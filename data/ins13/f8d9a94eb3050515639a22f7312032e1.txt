The ongoing strike of fishermen against an upcoming Vizhinjam trans-shipment terminal being developed by Adani group intensified on Monday after protestors blocked key roads in Thiruvananthapuram and brought normal life to a halt.Several areas of the city witnessed long traffic jams as protesters staged their agitations at secretariat, airport road and Chackai. The protesters staged the blockade even as district collector Geromic George issued an order against it.The Latin Catholic church, which is spearheading the agitation against the port project, said the road blockades were staged as the government was ignoring the protests that began two months ago and was using all opportunities to scuttle it.
