BBC Breakfast star Naga Munchetty recalled being told she was ‘useless' during the early stages of her journalism career.
The 47-year-old newsreader has been part of the broadcaster for over a decade, and has been a staple on the morning programme alongside the likes of Charlie Stayt and Sally Nugent.
However, Munchetty experienced hardship during the start of her career to the point where she would go home ‘in tears.'
‘I had copy thrown at me when I first started in newspapers,' she said.
‘I was told I was b****y useless.
