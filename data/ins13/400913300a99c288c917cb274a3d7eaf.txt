Minneapolis has agreed to pay $600,000 to journalist Linda Tirado.

Tirado lost her left eye after police shot rubber bullets at her during a Black Lives Matter protest.

The settlement also acknowledges changes to police training in the wake of the 2020 incident.

For two years, Linda Tirado has had to relive the day that Minneapolis police opened fire on her while she covered a Black Lives Matter protest in the city, blinding her in one eye with a "less-lethal," but nonetheless life-changing, round of ammunition.
