Nordic streamer Viaplay and Amazon's ad-supported service Freevee have scored online rights to the Australian crime drama Troppo from German group Leonine Studios. Viaplay picked up SVOD rights to the series, based on Candice Fox's best-selling Crimson Lake novels, for the Nordics, the Netherlands, Poland and the Baltic region. Amazon Freevee scored AVOD rights for Germany and the U.K. In Troppo, Thomas Jane plays Ted Conkaffey, a down-and-out ex-cop living in tropical Far North Queensland, Australia, who is recruited by Amanda Pharell (Nicole Chamoun), an eccentric small town private investigator, to investigate the murder of a brilliant tech pioneer.
