The Indianapolis Colts picked on cornerback Shaquill Griffin all day Sunday. In the Colts' 34-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, Indianapolis quarterback Matt Ryan threw Griffin's way often and consistently found success.
Griffin, 27, picked up two pass interference penalties on the day and allowed nine receptions for 131 yards. One of those receptions was the 32-yard touchdown hauled in by Alec Pierce that put the Colts on top with 17 seconds left.

'I'm hurt because I feel like I let my team down,' Griffin told reporters after the game, including Brent Martineau of Action Sports Jax.
