The Congress party on Tuesday accused the central government of granting premature release to the convicts in the Bilkis Bano case for political motives saying "this stain on the legacy of this dispensation will never wash off". "It is repugnant, reprehensible and revolting that an elected government chose to release these convicts in such a cavalier manner. The grant of premature release to the convicts in the Bilkis Bano case is a stain on this government's legacy that will never wash off," Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.
