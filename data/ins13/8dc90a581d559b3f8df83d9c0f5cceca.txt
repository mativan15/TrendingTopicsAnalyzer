After two weeks of London games, the NFL's Sunday slate returns its more familiar schedule albeit with the addition of bye weeks for the first time this season. The Bills, Eagles, Rams and Vikings each have the week off, meaning two fewer games on Sunday.

In the early window, markets without a local game on FOX will see the New York Jets visit the Green Bay Packers, while on CBS markets without a local game in the window will see the Baltimore Ravens visit the New York Giants.

There are just three games in the late window and CBS air the marquee Bills at Chiefs matchup from coast-to-coast.
