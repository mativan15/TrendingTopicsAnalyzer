Catalytic converter thieves are back in Branch County.

Sheriff John Pollack warned that "a large number of vehicle catalytic converter thefts" took place locally in May.

"They're even actually breaking into barns and businesses, going in and taking them out of the vehicles right inside the business," Pollack told the Matteson Township Board. "So if you've got any trucks, you leave it out in the field, you want to make sure you get them someplace where they can be safe. Because you will come up with a missing catalytic converter.
