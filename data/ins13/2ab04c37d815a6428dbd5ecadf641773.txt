Sir Keir Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have inevitably sought to make political hay out of the market turmoil of recent weeks and the Government's abandonment of its original growth strategy. Buoyed by polls which show that, if a general election were held today, the Conservatives would be heading for a 1997-style defeat, they sense an opportunity for Labour to supplant the Tories as the party most trusted by the voters with the economy.
But what are their plans for that economy? Fresh from berating the Government for its lack of fiscal discipline in pursuing uncosted tax cuts, Ms Reeves yesterday attacked Jeremy Hunt, the new Chancellor, for the opposite crime: pursuing 'austerity season two'.
