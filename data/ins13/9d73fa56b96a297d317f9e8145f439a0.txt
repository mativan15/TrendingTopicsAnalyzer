A survivor of one of Australia's most tragic asylum-seeker voyages has spoken about the incident at a trial into one of the men accused of facilitating the plot.

Maythem Kamil Radhi, an Iraqi man, has pleaded not guilty to helping asylum seekers travel to Australia before their boat sank on its way to Christmas Island in October 2001, leaving some passengers dead.

The court heard from a witness, Fawzi Salem Ukili Al Majed, who was on board the vessel before it sank off the coast of Indonesian island Sumatra.
