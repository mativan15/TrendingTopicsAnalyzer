British Prime Minister Liz Truss is fighting to hold on to her job after her interior minister resigned and Conservative legislators openly quarrelled in parliament over a vote on fracking for shale gas.
The departure of Suella Braverman on Wednesday — over a 'technical' breach of government rules — means Truss has now lost two of her most senior ministers in less than a week, both replaced by politicians who had not backed her for the leadership.
Braverman said she resigned after breaching rules by sending an official document from her personal email account.
