Steve Bannon, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump, should go to prison for six months and pay a $200,000 fine after a jury found him guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena, according to a government sentencing memorandum.

Bannon's refusal to cooperate with the House Jan. 6 committee 'has exacerbated the assault on the Capitol,' the government said in a harshly worded document filed in federal court in Washington on Monday.
