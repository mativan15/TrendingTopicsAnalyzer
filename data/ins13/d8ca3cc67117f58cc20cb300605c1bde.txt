We're entering one of the most painful bye weeks of the season for fantasy purposes, with the Bills, Rams, Vikings and Eagles all out of the mix. In all likelihood, no one in your league is gonna feel particularly good about their starting receivers in Week 7. Six of the season-to-date top-20 fantasy WRs will be resting. We're also staring at some of the ugliest waiver wire names in recent memory to be completely honest, so this is no easy week. Below you'll find a collection of approved pickups, all of them available in at least 50 percent of Yahoo leagues.
