Brij Agrawal, an entrepreneur and University of Houston alumnus, and his wife, Sunita, gifted $1 million to fund manufacturing lab equipment at the UH College of Technology building in Sugar Land.

UH will rename the building's ground-floor auditorium the Brij and Sunita Agrawal Auditorium in recognition of the gift, the university announced Oct. 18.

The total impact of the gift could grow to $3.5 million thanks to matching gifts from The George Foundation, a nonprofit that invests in Fort Bend County, and the Texas Research Incentive Program, a program that matches gifts from private sources.
