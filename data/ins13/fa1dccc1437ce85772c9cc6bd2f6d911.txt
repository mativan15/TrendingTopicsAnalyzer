 Young people are increasingly favouring mobile payment apps over traditional payment methods, according to research from card issuing platform Marqeta.The company surveyed 4,000 consumers across three continents, including 1,000 UK respondent, and found  the majority (61%) feel confident enough with contactless payments to leave their wallet at home and just take their phone, a figure that rises to over three quarters for UK Gen Z respondents.Almost all (96%) UK consumers surveyed have used contactless in the last year, according to Marqeta's research.
