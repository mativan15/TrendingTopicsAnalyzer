Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has reportedly promised Frenkie de Jong that he will build a midfield around him at Old Trafford. The Barcelona star has not exactly jumped at the chance to sign for the Red Devils, despite their well-publicised interest, and a lack of Champions League football could continue to make life difficult. If Barca are to cash in on anyone this summer, De Jong looks like the most likely candidate. His stock may have fallen slightly after failing to progress in the way many thought he would at the Camp Nou, but the 25-year-old is still an immensely talented midfielder with a desirable skill set and a £59million price-tag.
