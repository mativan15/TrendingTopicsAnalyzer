The TMC government in West Bengal on Friday drew widespread condemnation from political parties and intellectuals following the midnight crackdown on Teachers' Eligibility Test (TET)-qualified candidates in Salt Lake area by Bidhannagar police and subsequent enforcement of section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
Late last night, a huge contingent of police removed nearly 500 TET-qualified (2014) candidates — staging a sit-in since Monday afternoon seeking job appointment letters — from the street outside the office of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education (WBBPE) as the protesters did not lift their protest despite repeated requests.
