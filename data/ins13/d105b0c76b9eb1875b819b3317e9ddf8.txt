The winner of the 2021 Boston Marathon, Kenyan Diana Kipyokei, was suspended by governing body World Athletics' Athletics Integrity Unit Friday after testing positive for a banned substance.

Ms. Kipyokei is alleged to have taken triamcinolone acetonide, a performance enhancing drug, before the 2021 Boston Marathon. She is also alleged to have tampered with the investigation by providing false information.

The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the Boston Marathon, said that 'Kipyokei's result in the 2021 Boston Marathon will be disqualified, pending the completion of relevant athlete appeals processes.
