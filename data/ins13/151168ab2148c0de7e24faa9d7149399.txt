I hope you can help. I am totally disgusted with something that happened at my 15-year-old son's sports club recently and I don't know what to do about it. The team held a party at one of my son's teammate's houses to celebrate the end of the season and there was a stripper there. So, in a room full of teenage boys, a grown woman took off all her clothes and also danced naked on the laps of the team captain and the player who had scored highest that season – my boy! Obviously, I'm not naive and realise that as a straight male he likes looking at naked women.
