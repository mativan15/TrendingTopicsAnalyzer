The U.K. government has introduced new legal measures that would regulate crypto ads and ban unauthorized crypto providers from offering services.

Amendments introduced by minister Andrew Griffith to his own bill on Friday have been welcomed by an industry that had called for existing proposals to extend beyond stablecoins, which are payments-focused cryptoassets that seek to maintain value with respect to fiat currencies.

The measures amend existing laws to "clarify that the powers relating to financial promotion and regulated activities can be relied on to regulate cryptoassets and activities relating to cryptoassets," said an explanatory note tabled by Griffith and published Friday, as an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill.
