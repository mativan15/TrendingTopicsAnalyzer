Universal Credit is the primary benefit administered by the Government department to those who are on low income or are out of work. However, those who are in receipt of benefit payments which are being discontinued will instead be moved onto Universal Credit. These payments are referred to as legacy benefits and will no longer exist in the very near future.As part of existing legislation, the DWP is committed to moving all recipients of legacy benefits onto Universal Credit.During the pandemic, the move to transition legacy benefit claimants onto the payment was stopped to process the multiple claims for Universal Credit during the lockdown.
