Vastness is a defining feature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
It has more than 96 million members, and the party's official list of heroes and martyrs counts two million names of those remembered for their storied lives and heroic deaths.
In the expansiveness of the CCP's political structure, just a tiny few have completed the long march to the party's upper echelons.
And among those who have reached the pinnacles of the party's hierarchy, just four names have been anointed as the party's 'core' leaders: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and the most recent addition, President Xi Jinping.
