1:26 PM ETMADISON, Ill. -- Chase Briscoe finally has a pole to go with his first NASCAR Cup Series victory earlier this season.The second-year driver for Stewart-Haas Racing drove through a bobble at the end of the backstretch and turned a lap of 138.274 mph on Saturday, giving himself the best starting spot for the first time in his 51st career start."The first round I felt like I under-drove extremely bad. The second round I felt like I over-drove," said Briscoe, who won in March at Phoenix -- a track that shares many of the same characteristics with World Wide Technology Raceway.
