Aidan moved out of home a couple of years ago before relocating to Melbourne's CBD 'in between lockdowns' and is renting an apartment with his partner Isabella.'I've always liked Melbourne and rent was cheap at the time, so the move really appealed to us,' he says.However, he admits it was initially a major financial setback.'We were living fairly rough for a while until we could afford some basics. We had to take it easy for a couple of months, while our finances caught up,' he says.Aidan earns $70,000 a year, including superannuation.
