'Good Morning America' opened its broadcast Thursday with some of its top correspondents far from the show's studio in New York's Times Square. The ABC morning program is hoping to put similar distance between itself and one of its main competitors.
As 'GMA' launched, viewers were told the show was coming to them live 'from Times Square, Kyiv, Ukraine, and London.' The references were to Robin Roberts, who had just completed an interview with Olena Zelenska, Ukraine's First Lady, and to Amy Robach and T.
