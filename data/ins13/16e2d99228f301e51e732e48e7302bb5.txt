Sixteen is a recurring number in the race for Center District Porter County Commissioner. Democratic candidate Julie Giorgi has served for 16 years on the Union Township School Board of Trustees, while Republican candidate Barb Regnitz was a financial adviser and certified financial planner for 16 years in Schaumburg, Illinois.

Both positions involve the managing of serious amounts of money, experience the candidates say would serve them well in the role of county commissioner when Republican Jeff Good leaves the post in December after two terms.
