After 67 years of ownership by the same family, Kloc's Grove in West Seneca has been sold.

Diana Harfouche acquired the 16.3-acre event venue at 1245 Seneca Creek Road, paying $2.5 million through her Harbro Properties LLC in a deal that closed Oct. 14.

Plans call for continuing operations with a few improvements, but Harfouche said she's keeping the name and branding, as well as the staff and all of the features that have helped the indoor/outdoor event space thrive for six decades.

'The goal is to just to maintain and keep up the quality reputation and really safeguard the legacy,' she said.
