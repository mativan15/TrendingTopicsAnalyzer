A father-of-two caught with more than a kilogram of cannabis has been spared jail after it emerged he only supplied it to cancer patients and the seriously ill.
Hundreds of Andrew Baines' customers flooded the court with letters explaining how he helped relieve their pain, only making enough money to cover his costs.
The 46-year-old was spared a 15-year sentence after prosecutors decided to pursue him on the lightest possible charge, for which the judge gave him the lowest possible sentence of a six-month community order.
