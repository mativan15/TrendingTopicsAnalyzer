An orca rammed and lifted a yacht up with its mouth in the latest attack to occur off the coast of Portugal.Experienced sailors Paul and Norma Russell had been sailing from Cascais to Sines, coastal Portuguese towns, when the orca approached and began terrorizing the boat on October 5.Since 2020, there have been hundreds of interactions between orcas and boats off the coasts of Spain and Portugal. The encounters have ranged from orcas simply approaching boats to actively interfering with them. It is not clear whether the same orcas have participated in the attacks or why they are doing it.
