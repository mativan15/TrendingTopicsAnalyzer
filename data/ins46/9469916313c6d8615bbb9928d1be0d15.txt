A new University of Pittsburgh study is casting doubt that many corporate sustainability efforts are having the effect that is being sought.

Initial results of the study, to be released later Thursday by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Sustainable Business, indicate that it's not the sustainability efforts themselves, but instead the way they are being rolled out. Most managers whose companies have sustainability initiatives think they still have a ways to go before they go deep into the company.
