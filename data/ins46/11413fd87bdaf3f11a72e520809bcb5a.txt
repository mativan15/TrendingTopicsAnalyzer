Kanye West has hit out at Mark Zuckerberg and said he "thinks he is the government", as the rapper discussed his and Donald Trump's social media ban. Kanye was temporarily banned from Instagram and Twitter earlier this month following a violation of the social media platforms' policies. The 45-year-old had shared anti-Semitic comments on the sites, which were later removed. Former US President Donald Trump has been banned from Twitter "indefinitely" and suspended from Facebook and Instagram until at least January 2023, when the suspension will be revisited.
