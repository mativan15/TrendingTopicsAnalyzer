Propping up the bar in last-chance saloon, Liz Truss's only hope of surviving today's PMQs is to drink her Chancellor's new economic Kool-Aid.
While it might sound laughable for her to now wade in behind Jeremy Hunt's complete evisceration of her mini-Budget, her only option is to wholeheartedly embrace the u-turn - or admit defeat.
As Philip Collins, chief speechwriter to Tony Blair, told LBC this morning, she can only survive the House of Commons grilling 'if she goes out and us assertively putting the case for the budget Jeremy Hunt has just put forward'.
