Flea markets have been around for decades, but for several youth who take part in programs hosted by The Warehouse, it's a new opportunity for them to test run their entrepreneurial skills. The Warehouse in Lindsay is hosting such an event on Thursday (June 9) as part of its week-long celebration of youth that wraps up with the third annual BGC Kawarthas Youth Awards on Friday (June 10). The spring market is curated by the Keystone Youth Council, a group comprised of local high school students supported by The Warehouse staff to develop initiatives that support other youth and the community.
