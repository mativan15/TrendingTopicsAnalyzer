Gurugram: Members of All Haryana Petroleum Dealers Association (AHPDA) on Saturday said that they will observe a 'No Purchase Day' — will not buy oil from companies — on Tuesday (May 31) to protest against the central government and oil companies for failing to increase their commission in the last five years, despite an increase in fuel prices. The AHPDA members also urged the vehicle owners to stock petrol and diesel adequately within Monday (May 30), so that they would not suffer due to their protest.
