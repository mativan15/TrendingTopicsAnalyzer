Lawson Geddes's family has run his central Queensland cattle property near Shoalwater Bay for more than 140 years.He loves the rural lifestyle, far away from populated areas."We take care of ourselves and always have," he said. "We like it that way."Given the relative isolation of his 10,000-hectare property, Mr Geddes said he's had little to do with the local council in Livingstone Shire, north of Rockhampton.So, he was shocked when he opened his half-yearly rates notice to a bill for $41,605."It had jumped about $16,000, about 24 per cent," he said.
