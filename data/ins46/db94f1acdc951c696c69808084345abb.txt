The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down almost 25% from its peak, as macroeconomic uncertainty has caused investors to reevaluate their exposure to risky assets. Not surprisingly, many individual growth stocks have fallen much further. For instance, Global-e Online (GLBE -3.63%) and Etsy (ETSY -0.22%) are down about 77% and 73%, respectively.
