Like millions of Americans, I found myself out of work during the pandemic. At first, I was laid off from my waitressing job. Then I began working for myself as an online fitness coach, but running the business required 10-hour workdays and I was only making $1,000 to $2,000 a month.So in July 2021, I decided to pivot.
