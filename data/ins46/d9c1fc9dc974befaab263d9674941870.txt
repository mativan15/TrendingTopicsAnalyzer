The mayor-elect of Auckland Wayne Brown has written to Watercare demanding it not put in any work on the government's proposed water management policy dubbed Three Waters. Three Waters was a feature of Brown's election campaign leading up to the October local election, where he pledged to 'stop it'. The national water policy is still in the works, and the government hopes to finsh it by July 2024. Former mayor Phil Goff and the last Auckland Council were opposed to the Three Waters structure, arguing that the supercity doesn't fare as well as other cities in the reforms.
