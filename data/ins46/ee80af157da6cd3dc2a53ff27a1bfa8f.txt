Who should Labour fear? The glib answer, and the official party response, is that Labour and Keir Starmer have nothing to fear from any of those likely to run for leader of the Conservative Party – to be specific, Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt. While it is understandable given the current circumstances, this approach may be complacent, and in his recent public remarks, Starmer has targeted Johnson for criticism. With Labour on polling leads of 30 points plus (at least in recent days), it certainly seems unlikely that the Conservatives can rapidly re-establish the kind of lead they enjoyed until about the spring of last year, which delivered for them the remarkable general election victory in December 2019, their best in decades.
