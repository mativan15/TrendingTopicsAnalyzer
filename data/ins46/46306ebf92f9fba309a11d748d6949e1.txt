Joe Scarnici/Getty Images Entertainment Investment Thesis Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) has a strong business model that fuels the company's impressive growth. The business is progressively diversifying into new categories. There are some risks with its licensed products and its free cash flow. But overall, I believe that shares are undervalued at the current price. Strong Performance As The Economy Slows Funko is still reporting strong results, even as the broader economy pulls back. The business grew its top line by 34% year over year in Q2.
