Tom Brady and a talented but struggling offense have not performed at a consistently high level, particularly in the red zone. A normally reliable defense hasn´t played well, either, during a stretch in which the Bucs have lost three of four games. "It´s a game of earning it, and it´s a game of playing well, and we´re just not doing a good job of that," Brady said after Sunday´s 20-18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who stopped a four-game skid despite playing without several key players on defense.
