By Andrea Lucia May 31, 2022 / 7:05 PM / CBS DFW DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) - The city of Dallas Wednesday will propose a solution in the long simmering fight over vacation rentals. They're a source of revenue for some homeowners, but many neighbors want them out of residential areas.  "There's loud noise or there's code violations such as trash or litter or there's even worse, gunshots," said Tom Forsyth, a homeowner with the Dallas Neighborhood Coalition, who has taken complaints of parties and traffic short term rentals can attract.
