Oct 18 (Reuters) - Royal Antwerp midfielder Radja Nainggolan has been suspended indefinitely for general behaviour that reflected badly on the Belgian Pro League team, the club said in a statement on Monday.

The former Inter Milan and AS Roma player was arrested last week for being behind the wheel when his driver's licence had expired and was seen smoking an e-cigarette on the bench ahead of Sunday's 3-0 loss at Standard Liege, Belgian media reported.

"Clear agreements have also been made about what our club does and does not expect from the player," Antwerp said.
