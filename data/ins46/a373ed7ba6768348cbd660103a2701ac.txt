Tottenham will again be missing Dejan Kulusevski against Everton today.Spurs have been without Kulusevski for their past four games since he suffered a hamstring injury while playing for Sweden during the recent international break.Antonio Conte had hoped Kulusevski would be back against Everton after the forward returned to training but he suffered a minor setback in training on Thursday.Speaking on Friday, Conte said Kulusevski had been sent for another scan and that he was not prepared to take a 'stupid risk' by playing him.
