Michael Vi/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) was added as a new best idea short at Hedgeye as the firm argues that the list of buyers for the company has "dramatically diminished" in recent months. Zendesk shareholder "drama" over the past year created a "temporary bid" under the ZEN shares, though the list of possible bidders at $15 billion - $20 billion has "dramatically diminished" recently and the probability of a deal above $130/share has been reduced, a price that was rejected by ZEN earlier this year, according to Hedgeye analyst Ami Joseph.
