(Bloomberg) -- Airbus SE is targeting the US with its smallest A220 business jet in a bid to make up for Russian sales lost after the invasion of Ukraine.The European planemaker will put extra resources into promoting the A220 when the corporate version, or ACJ, enters service in the first half of next year, betting that the aircraft is better placed to gain a foothold in the world's largest market for business jets than its bigger models.'In the past, without the ACJ220, our products were not so well-fitting to the needs of the US market,' Benoit Defforge, who heads Airbus Corporate Jets, said in an interview Monday.
