A Conservative MP's son fighting with Ukrainian soldiers helped save a fellow Briton who was injured by a landmine during an intense firefight filmed on a helmet-mounted camera.
Ben Grant can be heard screaming: 'We've got to move now or we're gonna die!' as he and comrades dragged former Grenadier Guardsman Dean Arthur to safety in woodland north of Kharkiv.
In the dramatic footage, obtained by The Telegraph, Mr Grant and his unit treat Mr Arthur's leg with a tourniquet and dressing before telling him: 'You've got to try and walk or we're going to die, mate.
