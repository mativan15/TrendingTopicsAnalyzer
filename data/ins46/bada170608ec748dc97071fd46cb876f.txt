By Dean Seal Shares of Wayfair Inc. rose 15% to $32.60 at the start of the week after hitting a 52-week low last Friday. The home-decor online retailer's stock fell to $28.11 last week, its lowest level since it and other stocks dropped sharply during the early stages of the pandemic in March 2020. The Boston-based company's shares are down more than 82% this year. Wayfair swung to a loss in the first quarter as the lifting of pandemic restrictions drove more consumers to physical stores for their home furnishings.
