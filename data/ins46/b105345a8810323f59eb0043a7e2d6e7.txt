The below is an advanced review out of Beyond Fest. Sick does not yet have a release date.It's no shock that a slasher co-written by Kevin Williamson goes as hard as Sick does. Williamson and Katelyn Crabb infect Williamson's Scream blueprint with "COVID-19 Horror," instigating terror while under quarantine orders. Sick is breakneck, effortlessly vicious, and leaves you gasping for air — but that's all before the whiplash of its COVID-19 Horror twist. Director John Hyams is punctual and proficient when riffing on Scream's Casey Becker opening death or hyping intensity during pulse-pounding chase sequences.
