Tens of thousands of protesters marched in Paris adding to growing defiance and anger about inflation, three weeks into a refinery strike that caused fuel shortages across France.
The demonstration against the rising cost of living on Sunday was called by the left-wing political opposition and led by the head of the France Unbowed party, Jean-Luc Melenchon.
It was a show of anger against the bite of rising prices and to crank up the pressure on the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
Organisers called it a 'march against the high cost of living and climate inaction'.
