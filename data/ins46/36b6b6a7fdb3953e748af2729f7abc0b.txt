George Cummins, BBC SportMikel Arteta wants to win Arsenal's Europa League group and winning at home tomorrow night against PSV would give them a very good chance of doing so.Arsenal are two points clear of PSV with three games to play. A win tomorrow would put them within touching distance of winning Group A.Financially, it is good for the club. The winners of the group pick up roughly £870,000. Crucially for the Arsenal manager winning the group means Arsenal would jump straight into the last-16 of the competition.
