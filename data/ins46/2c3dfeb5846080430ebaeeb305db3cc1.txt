Oddly, a faint whiff of the 1996 election that pitted Benjamin Netanyahu against Shimon Peres is wafting through the current election campaign.

Why odd?

Because one would think that the fifth election in three-and-a-half years would resemble the ones that came before, not one from 26 years ago. And, indeed, this election does bear a striking resemblance to the four previous ones in this cycle that began in April 2019. Same candidates; same 'Bibi is a threat to democracy' vs 'Bibi is the country's savior' campaign theme; same stalemate in the polls.
