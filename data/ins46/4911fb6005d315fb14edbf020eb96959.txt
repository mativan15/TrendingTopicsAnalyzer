Hybe Entertainment, the management company behind K-Pop sensation BTS, says it has prepared for the band's military service hiatus and that it is no longer a one-act operation. It promises: a multi-label strategy; a wider artist roster that will be boosted by four new ‘teams; further international expansion; and accelerated use of technology, following in-house developments and acquisitions. Hybe and label Bighit Music said Monday that the BTS band members 'are moving forward with plans to fulfil their [compulsory] military service' with the oldest Jin likely to enter the army first after launching his solo single this month.
