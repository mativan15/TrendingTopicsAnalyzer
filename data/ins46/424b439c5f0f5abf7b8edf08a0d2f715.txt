Increasing automation has led banks, like other businesses, to reconsider their need for physical offices, a trend that could have a significant impact on small business owners and the community at large.

The Milwaukee region, the state of Wisconsin and the nation as a whole have seen a decline in the presence of bank offices since branching activity peaked in 2009. Wisconsin had more than 2,000 full-service bank branches as of the end of June this year, according to data published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
