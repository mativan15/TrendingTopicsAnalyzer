The rate of Consumer Price Index inflation rose to 10.1% in September from 9.9% in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said.
The vast increase is in part due to increases in the cost of food, which saw its largest annual rise in more than 40 years.
Inflation now stands at a similar high seen earlier this summer.
The Government has promised more support for those who will be hit hardest by rising costs, while Labour has lamented that ‘it is clear that the damage has been done'.
ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: ‘The rise was driven by further increases across food, which saw its largest annual rise in over 40 years, while hotel prices also increased after falling this time last year.
