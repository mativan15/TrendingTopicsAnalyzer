One of the the biggest challenges for a student entrepreneur when building a company is capital – it costs money to develop a prototype, pay for professional services such as legal support and then market a product or services to customers.  Enter the Desjardins Startup Prize. 'This award will mean the University of Toronto's best and brightest innovators will be able to secure funding for their startup without giving up any equity in their business,' said Jon French, director, U of T Entrepreneurship (UTE).
