Liz Truss has just resigned as Prime Minister, leaving the UK's political landscape uncertain once again. Some have questioned whether or not the former Tory leader can come back amid the chaos.
Boris Johnson resigned as PM on July 7, 2022, kicking off a leadership race in the process.
Ms Truss managed to beat Rishi Sunak to the finishing line, though her tenure ultimately lasted just 44 days, as she confirmed her departure from office on October 20.
Now a new leadership bid is on, with rumours intensifying that Mr Johnson could be taking the top spot again.
