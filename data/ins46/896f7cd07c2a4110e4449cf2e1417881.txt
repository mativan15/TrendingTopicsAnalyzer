British Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned just 45 days into her premiership, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in the nation's history.
 
Truss' resignation came one day after the Conservative Party leader vowed she was "a fighter and not a quitter," and amid an increasing chorus of voices calling on her to step down.
 
Truss, 47, was selected to replace former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who agreed to step down as the British prime minister in July. Johnson, who was elected prime minister in July 2019, had a tenure mired with scandal.
