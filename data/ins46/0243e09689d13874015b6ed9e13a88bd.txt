TEMPLEGATE goes hunting for winners on Wednesday ahead of a massive weekend of racing.
He is trying to build the bank ahead of the Derby Festival - and don't forget to back a horse by clicking their odds below.

ALBEGONE (8.10 Ripon, nap)
He has gone close twice since winning at Ayr. He was unlucky not to score here latest after being boxed in before finishing well. He can make amends from the same handicap mark. COME ON JOHN (5.35 Ripon, nb)
He gets on well with Ben Curtis who steered him to victory at Thirsk two runs ago.
