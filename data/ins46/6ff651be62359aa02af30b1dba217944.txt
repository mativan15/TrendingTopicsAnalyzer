NY's attorney general, Letitia James, sued the Trump Organization back on September 21.

Reps for Donald Trump and Eric Trump finally got served, the AG said Thursday.

Service took three weeks — and a judge's order — with the AG accusing Trump of 'gamesmanship.'

Donald Trump has lost the first legal skirmish in his battle against New York's attorney general, Letitia James, and her $250 million fraud case against him: After three weeks and a court order, he's been officially served with the 220-page lawsuit.
