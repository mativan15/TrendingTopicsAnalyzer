Restaurants will not be able to force diners to pay a service charge, according to new rules being framed by the ministry of consumer affairs, but eateries aren't conceding yet. They have asserted there's nothing illegal about it, hinting at a protracted legal battle.Restaurants and hotels can 'raise prices but cannot levy service charges without the customer's explicit consent', commerce and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal said on Friday.On Thursday, the government held a discussion on the issue with restaurant associations, following which consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said the government was looking at a legal framework to prevent restaurants from levying service charges, which he called an 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act.
