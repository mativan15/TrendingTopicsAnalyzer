da-kuk/E+ via Getty Images The stock market selloff in 2022 has taken a heavy toll on the PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund (NYSE:PDI). As a result of this selloff, PDI now trades at a negligible premium to the fund's net asset value, potentially signaling to investors that the fund has become oversold. A current investment in the fund's shares yields 11.8%. In addition, the fund provides broad diversity in terms of nations and industries while retaining an investing and fixed income focus in the United States.
