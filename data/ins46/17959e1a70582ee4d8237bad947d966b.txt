The Arizona Attorney General's office wants the FBI and the IRS to investigate the group behind conservative activist Dinesh D'souza's election conspiracy theory movie "2000 Mules."The film, which was released in May, makes bogus claims that hundreds of Americans across the country conspired to stuff ballot boxes in favor of President Joe Biden, allegedly based on phone data. But Truth the Vote, the group behind the film, has repeatedly refused to turn over any of its supposed evidence to law enforcement, the attorney general's office said in a letter according to the Arizona Republic.
