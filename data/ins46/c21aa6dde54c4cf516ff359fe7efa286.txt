Mumemories/iStock via Getty Images Dover (NYSE:DOV) wobbles between gains and losses in Thursday's trading after reporting better than expected Q3 adjusted earnings, but the company lowered its full-year earnings and revenue outlook as it prepares to cut production to adjust to reduced demand. Q3 net income edged higher to $286M, or $2.00/share, from $264M, or $1.81/share, in the year-earlier quarter, helped by solid levels of order backlogs and demand across its portfolio. Dover (DOV) said it now sees FY 2022 adjusted earnings of $8.
