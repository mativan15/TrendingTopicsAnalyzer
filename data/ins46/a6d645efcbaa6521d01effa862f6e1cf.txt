A Rhode Island farmhouse that is infamous for inspiring director James Wan's 2013 supernatural horror film The Conjuring has sold for $1.525 million, far higher than its $1.2 million asking price. The Colonial-era home sold for 27% over the original price.  Although the Rhode Island home was not the home featured in the film franchise, it was the actual home where the Perron family was plagued with paranormal activity in the 1970s. The film depicts the account of a Roman Catholic family haunted by supernatural activity in their new Rhode Island dream home.
