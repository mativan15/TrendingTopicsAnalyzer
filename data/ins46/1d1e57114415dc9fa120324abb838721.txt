An independent review of Australia's response to Covid-19 has found that 'significant mistakes were made', leaving vulnerable communities to bear the brunt of the pandemic.

The 97-page-review was funded by the Paul Ramsay Foundation, John and Myriam Wylie Foundation and Andrew Forrest's Minderoo Foundation.

'Governments and public servants were making decisions in a fog of uncertainty,' the panel said.
