A senior Conservative MP has said it is 'very difficult' to say whether Liz Truss should continue as Prime Minister.Alicia Kearns, who recently became the chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, also said the Government's problems are linked to policy and not just communication, warning 'dogmatism scares people'.The critical remarks come as another senior Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, said he wants an 'apology and a fundamental reset'.Mr Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, declined to deny that MPs are considering installing a new leader.
