Today we examine Jared Kushner's book sales and investments from Andreessen Horowitz, which usually injects cash into technology startups but has recently put money into the political process. One of Donald Trump's political committees spent $158,000 on books just weeks after Jared Kushner released his memoir.
 'Breaking History' hit shelves on Aug. 23. Two weeks later, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which raises money for two Trump PACs, paid retailer Books-A-Million $131,000 for 'collateral:books,' according to a campaign filing made Saturday with the Federal Election Commission.
