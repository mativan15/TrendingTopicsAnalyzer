A group of volunteers are now looking for funding to clear the damp and pay the bills so that the church, which is in Haroldston West, can be turned into an arts and history exhibition centre. If they fail, the building could fall to ruin or be bought by developers and turned into a home.
The group's next meeting is on June 11. In the meantime, they are seeking help to keep the lights on.
Shirley Norman, who runs the Boathouse Gallery in Little Haven, mooted the idea of musicians playing in the church.
