Crypto winter is coming - or perhaps it is already here - as the last month has shown the industry has been frostbitten.Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, but the wild price swings were made worse in the wake of the TerraUSD and Luna meltdown, which is estimated to have wiped half a trillion dollars (around €500 billion) off the sector's market capitalisation.The Bitcoin billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said in a blog post on Thursday that the industry is already in a 'contraction phase' known as 'crypto winter,' which has been 'further compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil'.
