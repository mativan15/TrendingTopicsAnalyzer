Oct. 20—Pennsylvania casinos saw an increase in revenues last month, state regulators said, a jump from the gradual decrease felt across the industry since the record-breaking month of March.

In all, casinos generated $448.4 million in September, according to a report from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. That's one of the highest revenue totals recorded since March, when a record $462.7 million was generated, and April, when the industry saw $461.6 million.

Since those record-breaking totals, revenues largely have been on the decline.
