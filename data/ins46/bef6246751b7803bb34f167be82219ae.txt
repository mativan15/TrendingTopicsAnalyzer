It is official. The six-game suspension for Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins is over. He was reinstated to the active roster after missing six games to start the year after he tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance.
He will play in the Cardinals' Thursday night matchup at home against the New Orleans Saints.

The Cardinals had to make a corresponding move on the roster to accommodate his return. That move was releasing kicker Matt Ammendola.
