David Ryder/Getty Images News Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) new 30K-square foot store at a mall in Glendale, California is attracting attention as something different from the retail giant. The first Amazon Style store features 40 fitting rooms equipped with touchscreens to help shoppers with their apparel decisions. Amazon designed the store with tech features, including machine-learning algorithms designed to generate real-time recommendations for each customer as they shop. Amazon (AMZN) has not made a decision yet if the concept store will be rolled out to other locations.
