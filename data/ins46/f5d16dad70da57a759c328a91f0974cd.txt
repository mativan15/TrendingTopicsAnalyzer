They've only picked up one win in their four EY Hockey League games so far, but Pegasus remain unbeaten in the new campaign, a record that should be put to the test this weekend when they host top-four sides Catholic Institute and Loreto at Queens on Saturday and Sunday.The pick of the weekend's fixtures, though, might prove to be the meeting of Old Alexandra and UCD, both sides also unbeaten thus far, sharing top spot in the table with 11 points apiece. That game will be streamed live on Hockey Ireland's YouTube channel.
