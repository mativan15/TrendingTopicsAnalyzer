Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Thesis I first published my bull thesis on Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) back in July 2021. The thesis at that time was that at its price levels then, it represented a wide moat business for sale at a discounted price. The discount was a sizable ~15% at that time (when its stock price was $76.6). I then reiterated its bull thesis two more times since then. The stock has indeed posted both strong fundamentals and also strong price appreciations since I first wrote about it.
