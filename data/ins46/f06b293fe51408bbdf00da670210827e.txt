Wood pellet producer Enviva' s environmental attributes are being misunderstood – and that's unfairly harming its share value, Raymond James said. Analyst Pavel Molchanov upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform while keeping its price target at $80, a 52.9% upside over last close. But he said the upgrade has nothing to do with any changes in the company's financial outlook and instead is due to what he sees as a deep misunderstanding of the company's product. The company makes wood pellets that can be burned for energy instead of coal.
