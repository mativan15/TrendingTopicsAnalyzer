Mr Biden's attempt to drive Democrats to the ballot box came as polls showed Republicans leading, and the economy increasingly dominating as the most important issue for voters.
A New York Times-Siena College poll on Monday gave Republicans a lead of 49 per cent to 45 per cent over Democrats. In the same poll last month Democrats led by one point.
It also found 44 per cent of voters believed the economy was the main issue, up from 36 per cent in July.
Undecided female voters have moved sharply to the Republicans in the last month, as inflation and petrol prices rose.
