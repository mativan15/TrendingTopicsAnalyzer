HONG KONG - AUGUST 19: An elderly man sleeps in front of a bank on August 19, 2014 in Hong Kong, Hong Kong. A government-commissioned study headed by University of Hong Kong academic Nelson Chow Wing-sun proposed to fund HK $3,000 a month pension for every Hongkonger over 65, rich or poor, without a means test. The pension should be funded partly by contributions ranging from 1 to 2.5 per cent of employees' salaries, paid by employers and workers. One in three old people in Hong Kong lives below estimated poverty line some of them struggling to make a living collecting cardboard boxes and plastic bottles on the street.
