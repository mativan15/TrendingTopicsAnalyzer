Love Island winners Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Davide Sanclimenti looked as loved up as ever as they enjoyed a date night out in Manchester.
The stars have been going strong since they won the 2022 series of the ITV dating show, this week stepping out for the National Television Awards.
Taking some time for themselves amid their busy schedules, they headed to San Carlo restaurant in Manchester for a romantic meal out.
Ekin, 28, looked stunning, rocking a casual look with a beige coat over the top, with boyfriend Davide, 27, coordinating and very much matching her vibe.
