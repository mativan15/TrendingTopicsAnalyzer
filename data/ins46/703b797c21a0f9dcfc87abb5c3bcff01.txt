A couple tried extorting the head coach of Georgia Tech's men's basketball by making fake sexual assault claims against him, prosecutors say. Then, they are accused of demanding large sums of money in exchange for taking back the claims.

Ronald Bell, 56, and his girlfriend, Jennifer Pendley, 50, both of Arizona, also got a Georgia Tech security guard involved in the scheme, convincing him to claim he witnessed coach Josh Pastner assault Pendley, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia.
