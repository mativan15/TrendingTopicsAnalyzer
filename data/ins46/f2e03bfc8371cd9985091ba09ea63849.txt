New Delhi: Restaurants will not be able to force diners to pay a service charge, according to new rules being framed by the consumer affairs ministry but eateries aren't conceding yet. They have asserted there's nothing illegal about it, hinting at a protracted legal battle. Union commerce and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said restaurants and hotels can 'raise prices but cannot levy service charges without the customer's explicit consent'. On June 3, the government held a discussion on the issue with restaurant associations, following which consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said the government was looking at a legal framework to prevent restaurants from levying service charge on diners, which he called an 'unfair trade practice' under the Consumer Protection Act.
