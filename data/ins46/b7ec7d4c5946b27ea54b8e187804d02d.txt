A Colorado couple moving to the Tampa Bay area did a careful search for the perfect spot to build a new waterfront home. As boaters, they wanted a place with a view but sheltered from the direct pounding of waves. They finally found it — on the southwest tip of San Miguel Point in Tampa's Sunset Park Isles.

Now the couple is moving again, and the house, built just four years ago, is on the market for $11.7 million. It has the kind of amenities expected at that price: a pool, a putting green, an outdoor kitchen, a Zen garden and, of course, a stunning view of Tampa Bay.
