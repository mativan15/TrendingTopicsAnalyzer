Sharkyjones/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shell (NYSE:SHEL) received U.K. government approval Wednesday to develop the North Sea Jackdaw gas development, which has the potential to supply 6.5% of the country's natural gas production. British Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng said the Jackdaw gas field received final regulatory approval, pledging the U.K. must "source more of the gas we need from British waters to protect energy security." Shell (SHEL) resubmitted an environmental statement for Jackdaw's development in March after it was initially rejected on environmental grounds last October.
