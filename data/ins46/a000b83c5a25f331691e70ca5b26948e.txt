Deere & Company (DE 3.80%) and Procter & Gamble (PG 1.53%) have both beaten the S&P 500 over the last five years. But they've done so for different reasons. 
P&G is famous for paying dividends and buying back a ton of stock. In fact, P&G is a Dividend King that has paid and raised its dividend for 66 consecutive years. Deere doesn't have the same track record. Even after the stock fell 28% in one month, it still only yields 1.2%. And Deere hasn't bought back nearly as much stock as P&G. However, Deere has proven that by retaining earnings and reinvesting in its business, it can produce outsized returns for its shareholders.
