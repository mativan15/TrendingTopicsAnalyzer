BTC has dropped nearly 2% this week and failed to test psychological resistance at $20,000. As the US CPI data released this week, a sharp selloff to $18,300 levels ensured that, but the asset recovered over the next day. BTC continues to consolidate in the range of $18,500-$19,500, which has been held as support for months now. The total crypto market cap is now near $900 billion. The market will likely be range bound till November 2, the day the US Fed announces another interest rate hike. Occasional rallies to the upside can occur, however.
