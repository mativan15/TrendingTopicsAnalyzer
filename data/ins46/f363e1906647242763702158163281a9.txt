SIR – Yesterday I received a letter from the NHS dated October 13, cancelling an appointment on July 26 that I had actually attended.
Words (almost) fail me.
Robin GoodfellowHersham, Surrey SIR – I'm 60, and among my friends of a similar age I count eight who have spent their working lives in the NHS.
Overwhelmingly, they love their jobs but agree that the health service is no longer fit for purpose and requires a radical overhaul. Tinkering, with a bit of extra funding here and there, won't be enough: it needs a complete review of how best to provide care, in many cases for conditions (and with treatments) undreamt of when the NHS it was founded.
