The average price for gas in Ontario on Friday is 202.9 per litre, up from Thursday's average of 200.2, and up from last month's average of 184.4 and last year's average of 127.7 per litre, according to the CAA.Ontario drivers continue to see eye-watering prices at the pumps as record-breaking gas prices in Canada have led to an increase in consumer goods and food prices, and impacted the way people live their lives. High prices compounded with a jump in Canada's inflation rate, which hit 6.7 per cent in March, the steepest increase in more than 30 years, have hurt consumer sentiment, say analysts.
