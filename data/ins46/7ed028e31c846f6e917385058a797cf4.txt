An 'inept and unsophisticated' murderer who was caught because he wrapped the victim's body in plastic that had his name on it, has been sentenced to life in prison.Todd Nathan Kiernan, 30, was assisted by his friend Gervaise Widdowson in the attack on Dinh Lam Nguyen, 51, who was repeatedly stabbed with a knife at Kiernan's Mahogany Creek home, east of Perth, in January last year.They used cable ties on the body, then wrapped it in plastic and put it in a wheelie bin that was dumped — with a tree branch and a bag of cement to weigh it down — in a dam at the John Forrest National Park.
