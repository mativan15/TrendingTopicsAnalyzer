A Washington state woman who was allegedly buried alive in the woods this week by her estranged husband managed to escape to safety from the shallow grave, authorities said.

A Thurston County Sheriff's deputy located a frantic woman hiding behind the shed in a home's front yard shortly before 1 a.m. on Monday, according to a declaration of probable cause filed Wednesday in the county's superior court.

'My husband is trying to kill me,' the woman screamed, according to the court document.

'She had duct tape still wrapped around her neck, lower face and ankles,' the filing said.
