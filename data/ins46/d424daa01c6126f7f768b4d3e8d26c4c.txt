May 27, 2022 Arizona State University has a long-standing reputation in natural and artificial photosynthesis research, thanks in part to Ana and Tom Moore, who have been important members of the School of Molecular Sciences (formerly known as the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry) since late 1976. The pair were also founding members of one of the earliest centers at ASU, the Center for the Study of Early Events in Photosynthesis. This year marks 45 years of service to ASU for both.Prior to beginning their careers, the young couple met in a physical chemistry course at Texas Tech University.
