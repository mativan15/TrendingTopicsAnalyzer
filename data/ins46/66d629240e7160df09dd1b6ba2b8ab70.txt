By Reuters Published: 14:59 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 14:59 EDT, 20 October 2022 Carolina Panthers quarterback Baker Mayfield returned to practice Thursday for the first time since sustaining a high-ankle sprain in Week 5. Mayfield did not participate in practice Wednesday, the same day that the Panthers designated quarterback Sam Darnold to return from injured reserve. Mayfield sat out the Panthers' 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday. Third-string quarterback PJ Walker sustained a neck injury in that contest.
