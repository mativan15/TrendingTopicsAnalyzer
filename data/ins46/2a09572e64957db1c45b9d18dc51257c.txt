SINGAPORE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Thursday to their lowest since April 2020 as risk appetite among investors faded after inflation data across the globe re-ignited fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell as much as 1.8% to 436.14, before cutting some losses. The index was last down 0.79% at 440.82.

European stock futures indicated stocks were set to decline, with Eurostoxx 50 futures down 0.
