A drop in March quarter profit and headwinds for the steel sector have prompted analysts to downgrade . The company on Friday reported a 20.23% drop in consolidated net profit for the quarter to ₹3,343 crore. Shares of JSW Steel ended down 1.8% at ₹538.65 on Monday. Nomura has downgraded JSW Steel to reduce from neutral and lowered the target price to ₹500 from ₹667, saying that profitability could remain under pressure in the near term as export duties stall price increases at a time of rising cost inflation.
