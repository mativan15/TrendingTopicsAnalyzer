SAN JOSE — A downtown San Jose office tower now under construction that may become an eye-catching addition to the city's skyline is due to be completed sometime in the second half of 2023.
200 Park, an office highrise that has sprouted at 200 Park Ave. in one of the key areas that could help spur a revival of downtown San Jose, is scheduled to be finished slightly more than a year from now.
