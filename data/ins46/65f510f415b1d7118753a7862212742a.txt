Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has revealed that former Arsenal teammate Alexandre Lacazette was shocked after hearing about his summer transfer to Chelsea. Aubameyang, 33, made a surprise move to Stamford Bridge in September - just seven months after leaving the Gunners for Barcelona. The Gabon international was keen to return to the Premier League because he believed he had unfinished business in England. Speaking to BBC Sport, Aubameyang revealed what Lacazette said to him following his move to Chelsea.
