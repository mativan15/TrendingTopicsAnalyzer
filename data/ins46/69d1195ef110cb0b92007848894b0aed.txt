The City of Surrey will have a new mayor for the next four years. The CTV News Decision Desk has declared that Brenda Locke will win the race for the city's top job. With more than 90 per cent of the city's polls reporting, she was leading by roughly 1,600 votes over her nearest challenger, incumbent Mayor Doug McCallum. Former Liberal MLA and MP Gordie Hogg was third, while NDP MLA and former MP Jinny Sims, and Liberal MP Sukh Dhaliwal – two big-name candidates who entered the race against McCallum – were in fourth and fifth place, respectively.
