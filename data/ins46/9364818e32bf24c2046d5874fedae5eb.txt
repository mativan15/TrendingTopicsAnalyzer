Coal emissions have risen less than expected given the surge in natural gas prices Ina FASSBENDER AFP/File Paris (AFP) – Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion are expected to grow just one percent this year despite concerns over the impact of the energy crisis, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, amid bumper growth for renewable energy. The IEA predicted that the CO2 emitted for energy by burning oil, gas and coal would stand at 33.8 billion tonnes in 2022, more than 300 million tonnes more than in 2021.
