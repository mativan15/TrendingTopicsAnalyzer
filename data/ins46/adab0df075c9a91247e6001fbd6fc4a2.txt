The Congress is witnessing fresh rumblings of dissent in Rajasthan ever since it hosted a three-day Chintan Shivir (brainstorming camp) in Udaipur from May 13-15. Though there is no imminent danger to the Ashok Gehlot-led government, the open dissent poses a challenge to the party at a crucial time when Rajya Sabha elections for four seats in the state are round the corner. The latest salvo was fired by Gehlot loyalist Ashok Chandna, who holds portfolios of sports and youth affairs, skill development, employment, entrepreneurship and disaster management in the Rajasthan government.
