The nonprofit says this is the first-ever 'Black Family Reunion,' an event to highlight and uplift Black culture in Charlotte and promote healthy well-being.

'Seeing our kids dancing, having people speak, the DV march, the marching band come out. I think it will be a catalyst for other positive events in our community,' said Shamaiye Haynes.

The group is already planning another event for next year with a focus on youth and the future.
