After being denied the opportunity to be the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) president for a second term, former India captain Sourav Ganguly has thrown his hat in the ring for the Cricket Association of Bengal polls. In a text message to The Indian Express, Ganguly confirmed that he would be contesting for the post of CAB president. CAB polls are scheduled to be held on October 31.
Ganguly wanted to continue as BCCI president but was offered the post of Indian Premier League chairman, which he declined.
