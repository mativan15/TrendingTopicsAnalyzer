Janice Buckingham logged onto her plant-based restaurant's Instagram account on May 22 to write a post about its impending closure."I love this place. I love the team. I love the food. I love the customers and all of you. I appreciate every. single. thing anyone has done to support the dream," wrote Buckingham, owner and head chef at Daydream in Calgary's Bridgeland neighbourhood."We are facing closure within a month without at least a 30 per cent increase in revenue. I'm afraid we haven't reached enough people in enough time to get established and stable.
