A Republican state congressman in Florida raised eyebrows when he shared a quote from fascist Spanish dictator Francisco Franco on Twitter.On Thursday, Anthony Sabatini – a member of the Florida House of Representatives – shared a quote to his Twitter page from Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until 1975.'I answer only to God and to History,' Mr Sabatini wrote, quoting the dictator, who seized power after winning the Spanish Civil War.Some said they found it shocking that an elected representative would quote one of the 20th century's most notorious figures.
