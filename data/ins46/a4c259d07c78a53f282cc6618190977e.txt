ITZY have announced details of their first original English-language single, 'Boys Like You,' which will arrive later this week.

The track will be shared as a 'pre-release' track for an upcoming record that has yet to be announced. It will be released on Friday (October 21) at 1pm KST (12am EST).

A post confirming the single on ITZY's social media accounts was decorated with Halloween-themed illustrations, including menacing pumpkin faces and claw-like handprints infringing on an image of a cake.
