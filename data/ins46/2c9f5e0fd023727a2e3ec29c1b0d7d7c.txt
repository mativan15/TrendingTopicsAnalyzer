It goes without saying, but let's say it anyway.

The Kent State football team will face a must-win situation on Saturday, when arch-rival Akron rolls into Dix Stadium to compete for the coveted Wagon Wheel trophy. Kickoff is set for noon.

After starting the season 2-5 overall and 1-2 in conference play, the Golden Flashes must defeat the Zips (1-6, 0-3) to keep their dreams of repeating as Mid-American Conference East Division champions alive. They must win to maintain realistic hopes of ultimately earning a bowl bid, and to increase their school-record home winning streak to 12 games.
