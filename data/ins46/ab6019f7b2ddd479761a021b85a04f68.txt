Recently, PayPal released an update to its terms of service that said it would fine people using its service for spreading disinformation. It faced an immediate free speech backlash on social media. Former PayPal President David Marcus tweeted this policy was against everything the company believed. He seemed to think it was 'insanity' for payment companies to refuse service 'if you say something they disagree with.' Elon Musk tweeted his agreement. The company quickly reversed itself, saying the release was a mistake.
