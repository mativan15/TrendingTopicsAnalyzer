A digitized US dollar could someday operate alongside stablecoins, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard told lawmakers on Thursday, after the cryptocurrency market was roiled earlier this month when privately issued stablecoins lost their pegs to the dollar. "In some future circumstances, CBDC could coexist with and be complementary to stablecoins and commercial bank money by providing a safe central bank liability in the digital financial ecosystem, much like cash currently coexists with commercial bank money," Brainard said in prepared remarks for testimony on Capitol Hill.
