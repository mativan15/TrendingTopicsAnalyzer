Sacramento Kings rookie Keegan Murray has been cleared from the league's health and safety protocol, but he will not play in the season opener on Wednesday versus the Portland Trail Blazers, according to James Ham of ESPN 1320.
Murray missed the final two games of the preseason due to what the Kings called a non-COVID illness. He was placed into the health and safety protocol on Friday and was unable to participate with the team in practice.
Kings head coach Mike Brown said this week he would want Murray to participate in at least one practice before returning to game action.
