Liz Truss's new chancellor Jeremy Hunt will set out billions of pounds of savings to stabilise the public finances in an emergency statement on Monday.Following his statement later this morning around 11am, the chancellor will address the Commons on Monday at 3.30pm ahead of the publication of his full medium term fiscal plan on 31 October.The move will be seen as an attempt to reassure the financial markets and furious Tory MPs after weeks of turmoil in the wake of former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's £43bn mini-budget tax giveaway.
