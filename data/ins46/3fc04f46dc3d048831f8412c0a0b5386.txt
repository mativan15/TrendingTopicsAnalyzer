Erich Sacco/iStock via Getty Images While the stock has taken a hit so far this year, StoneCo (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:STNE) reported a strong start to the year with revenue and profitability both coming in ahead of expectations. Despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment, especially in Brazil, the company demonstrated their ability to navigate a challenging market. Both of the company's operating segments reported very encouraging results that showed underlying growth trends remain strong. Brazil is still behind in terms of the digitization of the payment and banking ecosystem, a tailwind that could play out very well for STNE over the coming years.
