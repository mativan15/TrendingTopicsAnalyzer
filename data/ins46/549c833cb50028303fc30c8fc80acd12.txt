When I was a little boy, I used to cycle around my neighborhood -on a hill- as a hobby. I often came across a silent elderly woman sitting on a chair outside her own front door. One time, I came across her, but on foot, she talked to me for the first time, and asked me 'where is your, umm, your donkey?' !Photo by Danie Franco on UnsplashI noticed that she was, in a few seconds, looking for what is my 'donkey' called, which was nothing else than my bike! Although this happened in the late 80s, some old people were not that familiar with technical progress in that mountainous region.
