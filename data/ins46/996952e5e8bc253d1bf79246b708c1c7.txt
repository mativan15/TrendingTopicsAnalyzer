Tesla used a public relations firm to monitor employees' social media activity at a time when some were attempting unionize, according to a CNBC report. The EV maker hired New York-based MWW PR to monitor employees 'in a Facebook group and more broadly on social media' in 2017 and 2018, according to CNBC, citing invoices and unspecified documents.

The report, which has not been independently verified by The Washington Post, said MWW paid particular attention to discussions alleging unfair labor practices at Tesla and those related to a sexual harassment lawsuit.
