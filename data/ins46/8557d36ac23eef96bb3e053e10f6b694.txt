With a double-murder trial and other court dates looming for disbarred attorney Richard 'Alex' Murdaugh, CNN and HBO Max have announced upcoming news and documentary specials on the notorious accused killer.

A member of the fourth generation of a once-powerful South Carolina Lowcountry legal family that controlled the civil and criminal sides of the 14th Judicial Circuit for more than a century, Murdaugh was indicted July 14 on two murder charges. He is set to stand trial on Jan. 23.

He is accused of shooting his wife, Maggie, and son Paul at their Colleton County home on the night of June 7, 2021.
