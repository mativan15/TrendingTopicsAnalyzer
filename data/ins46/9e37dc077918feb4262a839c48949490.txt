I enjoy collecting old records. I'm a hipster, I'm vintage, I'm different—say what you will, but I love vinyl. There was, however, a certain missing quality in my curated music set-up until recently. Frankly, it's sort of lame to have all the coolest records you could find at the flea market or vintage store and not have a decent sound system to play them on.
