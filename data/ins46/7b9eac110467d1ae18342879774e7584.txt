It was like a scene from 'The Sopranos.'
New Jersey mobster Manny 'Guitarbarr' Rodriguez cornered a man who owed him money in a Newark restaurant in 1995, aiming to deliver a message on the consequences of not paying up.
The 'ultra violent' enforcer, nightclub owner and loan shark at the New Jersey ports ordered a pal to hold the arms of gym owner Gilberto Rubio. Then Rodriguez ripped a gold chain from the man's neck and stabbed him once in the chest, according to police sources and investigative records.
