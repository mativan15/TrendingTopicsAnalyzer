Wall Street Published by Reuters By Sinéad Carew and Anisha Sircar (Reuters) – Wall Street's three major indexes closed lower on Tuesday, following a rally last week, as volatile oil markets kept soaring inflation in focus and investors reacted to hawkish comments from a Federal Reserve official. After outperforming earlier in the session, the S&P's energy sector lost ground after a report that some producers were exploring the idea of suspending Russia's participation in the OPEC+ production deal.
