SamsungThe South Korean tech giant Naver is partnering with Samsung to deploy 40 robots in Naver's new second headquarters. The robots will roam around three floors of the new building, showcasing what businesses can do with cloud computing and private 5G networks -- all the while, they'll be serving coffee and delivering packages to Naver's employees. "NAVER's new headquarters serves as a test bed to explore technologies of the future, where 5G network and cloud play a central role," Sangyoung Han, Executive Director at Naver Cloud Strategy and Planning at Naver Cloud, said in a statement.
