WARNING - CONFRONTING DETAILS: They may be old, rusted and illegal, but steel-jaw traps are continuing to maim pets and wildlife across South Australia.

Having conducted 30 rescues since 2018, RSPCA SA has issued an urgent plea for owners of the devices to relinquish them.

Its chief inspector Andrea Lewis said animals caught in the 'awful devices' are often in such 'poor condition' that amputation of the trapped limb or euthanasia are the only options.

An echidna was caught in a steel-jaw trap in October.
