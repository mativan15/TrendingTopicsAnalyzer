According to Lipper Financial, 30% of the Nasdaq is down 70% or more. While the market is rallying strongly in the past week or so, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley both think the market won't bottom until -25% or -29%. And that's assuming we don't get a recession in the next year or two. If we do, Bank of America's head of quantitative analysis thinks the S&P 500 will probably bottom at -34%, near the historical average for recessionary bear markets.
