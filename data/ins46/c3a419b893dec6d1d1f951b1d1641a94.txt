Great Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd, a pioneer in the field of coal bed methane in India, plans to invest about USD 2 billion (Rs 15,000 crore) in exploration of shale gas at its Raniganj South block in West Bengal, its MD & CEO Prashant Modi said. "We want to recreate in shale what we did for CBM," he said. "We pioneered exploration, production, and development of CBM in India." CBM (Coal Bed Methane) is gas trapped below coal seams. GEECL signed the first CBM contract in India for the Raniganj South block on May 31, 2001.
