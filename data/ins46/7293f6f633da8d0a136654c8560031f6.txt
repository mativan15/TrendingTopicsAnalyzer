A Lexington man has been sentenced to five years in federal prison for sex trafficking, according to the Department of Justice.

Michael Allen Comberger, 57, was sentenced Thursday by U.S. District Judge Gregory VanTatenhove after he pleaded guilty to transporting someone across state lines to engage in prostitution, according to the DOJ.

Comberger admitted to running an interstate prostitution business, Fantasys Escort Service, out of Lexington, according to his plea agreement. Comberger used a website to showcase female escorts in different locations in the United States, the DOJ said.
