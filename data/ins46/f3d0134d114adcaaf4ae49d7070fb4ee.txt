A fourth Conservative MP Tory MP has called for Liz Truss to resign, heaping pressure on the Prime Minister just minutes after her new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt ripped up her tax cutting plan in a bid to reassure financial markets.

Angela Richardson, Tory MP for Guildford, joined Crispin Blunt, Jamie Wallis and Andrew Bridgen in saying the PM should go, adding that while party rules meant she was technically protected from a leadership challenge, they could be changed to force her out.

It follows the emergency statement from Mr Hunt who said: 'We will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago that have not started parliamentary legislation,' he said.
