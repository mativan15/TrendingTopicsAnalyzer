By Will Feuer Shares of Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. and other cryptocurrency mining stocks fell after New York lawmakers approved a two-year moratorium on reactivating fossil-fuel power plants for off-the-grid cryptocurrency mining. Greenidge Generation, which operates two crypto mining facilities, one of which is in Dresden, N.Y., said in a statement that the bill, if signed into law, wouldn't affect the company's operations. "The bill language plainly states, and the bill's original sponsor has confirmed, that the legislation will not apply to Greenidge's operations," the company said, explaining that its operations would be grandfathered in.
