ReutersJapan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is greeted by Member of the Australian House of Representatives Patrick Gorman as he arrives in Perth to commence a three day visit to Australia, on October 21, 2022. Australia and Japan agreed to share sensitive intelligence and deepen defence cooperation Saturday, signing a security pact to counter China's military rise. Prime ministers Fumio Kishida and Anthony Albanese inked the accord in the Western Australian city of Perth, revamping a dusty 15-year-old accord drafted when terrorism and weapons proliferation were the overriding concerns.
