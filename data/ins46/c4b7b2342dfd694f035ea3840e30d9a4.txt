A Canadian parliamentary trade delegation arrived in Taiwan this week and briefly met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who thanked the group for making the journey for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The visit, led by MP Judy Sgro, chair of the standing committee on international trade, has so far gone without a hitch. But it happened after months of speculation that it would spur retaliation by Beijing against Canada.

Fiery rhetoric from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa and comments from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledging possible 'consequences' have baffled Taiwanese officials, the Star has learned.
