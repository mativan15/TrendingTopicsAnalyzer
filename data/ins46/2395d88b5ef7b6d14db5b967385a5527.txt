'When the markets were at its peak, people were willing to wait for profits till 2028. So they were making a longer term call on new age tech companies saying that if we discount forward the 2028 earnings, and then apply a multiple to it, they were okay but as markets get more choppy and slightly more valuation conscious, probably the wait for 2028 will not happen. They will expect the companies to make money earlier,' says KVS Manian, Whole Time Director & Member of Group Management Council, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
