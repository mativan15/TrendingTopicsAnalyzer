A film about a sinister clown is shocking audiences.
 
Reports have surfaced over recent weeks that scenes in Terrifier 2 — a newly released horror film that serves as a sequel to its 2016 predecessor, Terrifier — are causing people to pass out and vomit.
 
"The guy behind me passed out cold n crashed into my chair, another guy left because he didn't feel good, I overheard him say and walking out theatre door I heard a guy puking hard & loud in the bathroom," one Twitter user wrote of the film on Oct.
