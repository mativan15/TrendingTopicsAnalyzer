As Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee festivities continue, a reissue of Sex Pistols‘ infamous anarchist anthem 'God Save The Queen' hit the top of the charts in the U.K. on Saturday.
The song was reissued on Friday and almost immediately launched into the No. 1 spot — 45 years to the day after it was infamously denied the top slot. The hit was originally released by the band in 1977, meant to overlap with the Queen's Silver Jubilee that year.
However, the song earned a total ban on radio airplay from the BBC — what would normally be a kiss of death for a single, but a fitting endorsement for the Pistols and their anti-establishment rant.
