syahrir maulana/iStock via Getty Images Markets are cyclical, and stocks move higher or lower for one reason. Bullish price action occurs when buyers are more aggressive than sellers, and bearish patterns develop when selling dominates buying. Greed and fear are impulses that impact behavior. A bullish trend tends to be slow and steady as greed can be a more time-consuming impulse. As a market price moves higher, it tends to have a magnetic impact on participants. With each tick to the upside, the greed impulse gets stronger as the fear of missing out on profits is an increasingly powerful force.
