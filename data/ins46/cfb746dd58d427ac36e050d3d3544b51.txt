In his debut feature film, Christopher Kahunahana intertwines modern Hawaiian culture with the historical generational ills of native people living in a post-colonial economy.'We want to change the conversation that people have surrounding Hawaii. The tourist industry has marketed, spent billions and billions of dollars exploiting and marketing Hawaii as a paradise for people to come… [Native Hawaiians] are supposed to host and entertain guests,' Kahunahana told ABC News.'It has displaced Hawaiians, so without Hawaiians, what is Hawaii but just beautiful beaches and sunsets?' he added.
