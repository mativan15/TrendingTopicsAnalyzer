Seth Green is the latest former co-star of Bill Murray to accuse the Lost in Translation actor of inappropriate behaviour.
The Austin Power star claims that he had an upsetting encounter with the 72-year-old during a recording of Saturday Night Live when he was aged nine.
The incident, in which Green claims Murray called him ‘trash' and dangled him over a bin, left the 48-year-old in tears feeling ‘horrified', he told the Good Mythical Morning Youtube channel.
Talking to hosts Link Neal and Rhett James McLaughlin, Green explained he was filming a SNL for a segment about what kids think about the Christmas holiday.
