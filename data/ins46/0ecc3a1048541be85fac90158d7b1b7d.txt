Sahil Barua, chief executive officer of logistics startup Delhivery Ltd., minces no words about the process of going public in what's shaping up to be an historic meltdown in the technology industry.
'It was nerve-wracking,' said the 37-year-old, who is also a co-founder.
The IPO last week came only after months of discussions with potential investors and investment bankers, Barua said in a video chat this week. Executives paid multiple visits to would-be backers to explain the business models and numbers at the company, which is based in Gurgaon in the suburbs of New Delhi.
