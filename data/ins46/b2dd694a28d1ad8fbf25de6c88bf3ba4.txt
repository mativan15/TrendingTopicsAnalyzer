Over the next five years, the Charlotte Hornets and city government plan to overhaul the NBA franchise's arena, open a new training center as part of a larger transit project, and transform the surrounding neighborhood.

The ambitious agenda emerged after a couple of years of discussions and negotiations, leading to Charlotte City Council's approval in June of a $275 million package. That includes $215 million worth of upgrades at Spectrum Center and a separate, $60 million practice facility for the Hornets.
