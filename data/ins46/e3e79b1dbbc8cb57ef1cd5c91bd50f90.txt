Some of the biggest obstacles for investigators going after Russian assets amid the country's now three-month-long invasion of Ukraine are the legal mechanisms for preserving anonymity that are built into the U.S. tax and financial code.

The most powerful of these rules is the designation known as beneficial ownership, which allows asset owners to remain unregistered on legal documents as long as they name a third party to act on their behalf.

That means beneficial ownership laws can allow billions of dollars' worth of illicit property to remain invisible to financial investigators.
