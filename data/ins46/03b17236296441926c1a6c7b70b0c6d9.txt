Oct. 16—Reading Theater Project will stage "Present, Future, Past," three one-act plays chosen to reflect the story of Reading and Berks County but set in different times, starting Nov. 4 and running for two weekends at George Baer Chapel, 39 S. Sixth St.

The featured plays are "Buy To Rent" by Félix Alfonso Peña, "Everybody Hates This Place" by Adam Richter and "Grave Concerns" by Susan E. Sneeringer. "Buy To Rent" and "Grave Concerns" were produced by RTP in 2005, while "Everybody Hates This Place" is a newer play.
