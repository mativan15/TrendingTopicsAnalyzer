If you've been waiting for this year's Memorial Day sales to enjoy a discount when buying a new laptop, you probably expected that there will be a wide range of options across the popular retailers. For those who need help in finalizing their choice, you might want to stick to HP laptop deals, as the brand's devices offer immense value for money, more so with the holiday's price cuts. For example, the HP Spectre x360 convertible laptop is available for $1,050 from HP, down $470 from its original price of $1,520 for Memorial Day.
