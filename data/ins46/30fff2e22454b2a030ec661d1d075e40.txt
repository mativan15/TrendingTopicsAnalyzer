Looking for ways to get your house smelling super fresh?
Well, lifestyle influencer and author Chantel Mila, aka Mama Mila, has shared not one, not two but three very easy hacks on social media that she says will make your home smell fantastic. 
For the mum's first tip, you need a heatproof bowl, coffee grounds or beans, and a tea light. 
Place the coffee in the bowl and nestle the tea light in there. 
Chantel explained in her post that the candle's warmth releases the smell of the coffee so that it fills your house.
