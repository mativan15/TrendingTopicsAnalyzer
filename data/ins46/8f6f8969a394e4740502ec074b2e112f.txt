The Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council's ruling TIPRA Motha party demonstrated in parts of the state on Wednesday accusing the BJP-IPFT government of deliberately delaying elections to the village committees under the council.
The elections should have been held nearly a year and a half back but were delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
