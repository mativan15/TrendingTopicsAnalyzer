Walmart says it's opening four new distribution centers that will create four-thousand jobs in the U.S. The company said Thursday that the new centers in Joliet, Illinois; McCordsville, Indiana; Lancaster, Texas and Greencastle, Pennsylvania will open within the next two years, and will provide next-day and two-day deliveries to three-fourths of the U.S. New employees at the centers will make anywhere from 16- to 28-dollars-an-hour. The fulfillment centers will be high tech that will save workers from walking miles a day to get packaging and then walk back to the items needing to be packed.
