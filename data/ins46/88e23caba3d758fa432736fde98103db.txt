Notre Dame's run game has been inconsistency and puzzling from a schematic standpoint, which needs to change

There is no question what Notre Dame wants its identity to be on offense in 2022, even if the Fighting Irish have struggled to carry that out for much of the season. Notre Dame wants to be a team that can run the football, and according to head coach Marcus Freeman, to run on teams even when they know it is coming.

Through six games the results have been wildly erratic, and the Irish ground attack lacks diversity in the manner it attacks teams and it has lacked consistency from a success standpoint.
