Ohio Democratic Senate nominee Tim Ryan earned the endorsement of Cleveland's The Plain Dealer on Sunday in his race against the Trump-backed Republican nominee J.D. Vance.

'There is not much question as to what the state would get from either of the two candidates – Ryan, as a congressman, having voted with Democrats virtually all of the time and Vance having signed on to Donald Trump's Big Lie and extremist approach to politics after being highly critical of the former president during the 2016 campaign and afterward,' the editorial board wrote.
