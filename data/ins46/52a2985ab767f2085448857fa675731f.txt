Aaron Donald has been the best defensive player in the NFL for most of his career. He's accomplished everything a player could possibly hope to in eight years: winning Defensive Player of the Year three times, being named an All-Pro seven years in a row, winning a Super Bowl and leading the league in sacks once.

Those accomplishments are exactly why he'd be fine with retiring after 'only' eight seasons and still in the prime of his career. After winning Super Bowl LVI, Donald checked that last box on his resume and is already a future first-ballot Hall of Famer.
