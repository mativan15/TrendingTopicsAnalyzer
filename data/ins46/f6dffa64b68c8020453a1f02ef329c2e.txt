The Punjab government on Monday told the Punjab and Haryana High court that it would reframe the proposed scheme of home delivery of ‘atta' (wheat flour) by bringing certain changes in it to bring it in sync with the provisions of National Food Security Act, 2013, and Punjab Targeted Public Distribution System (Licensing and Control) Order, 2016.
An affidavit in this regard was filed by Additional Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, TK Goyal before a bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli.
