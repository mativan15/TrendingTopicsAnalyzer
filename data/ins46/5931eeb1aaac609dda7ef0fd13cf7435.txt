WITH ELECTION day just three weeks away, millions of Americans are going to the polls to cast early votes in this year's midterms. Results will not become clear until November 8th (or a few weeks later, if recounts or run-offs in competitive seats decide control of Congress). In the meantime, what do the fundraising numbers published by the Federal Election Commission on October 17th—which covers all donations made in the campaign before October 1st—reveal about each party's chances? With their wallets, American donors seem to be expressing a preference for Democratic Senate candidates over Republican ones.
