Ontario will expand the so-called strong mayor powers to other large municipalities in a year, Premier Doug Ford said Monday.  The province recently passed legislation that gives mayors of Toronto and Ottawa veto power over bylaws that conflict with provincial priorities, such as building housing. Those powers are set to take effect shortly after next week's municipal elections. "We're using Ottawa and Toronto as a test area, per se, and then we're going to move forward a year after that and give it to other regions, other large municipalities, so that when you get elected as mayor, it means something," Ford said Monday, giving a timeline for expanding the powers to other cities for the first time.
