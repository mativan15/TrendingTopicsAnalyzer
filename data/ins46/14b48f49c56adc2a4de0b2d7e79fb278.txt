The NSE Nifty 50 index closed 1.89% higher at 16,661.40, while the S&P BSE Sensex ended up 1.9% at 55,925.74. Both the indexes added more than 1% on Friday. The market also benefited from an uptick in the global mood after news that Shanghai will cancel many conditions for businesses to resume work from Wednesday, easing a city-wide lockdown that began two months ago.
