Accusing the Union government of misusing federal agencies and constitutional institutions, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said on Saturday that he was perhaps the only person in the country who, after being accused of holding an office of profit, was pleading to every possible forum to make public his alleged crime.In his first detailed interaction with the media since he was caught in a series of controversies, including allegations of corruption, earlier this year, Soren said it was the responsibility of the concerned authorities that anyone guilty of illegality should not be holding a constitutional post.
