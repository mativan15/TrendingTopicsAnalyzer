Week 7 is one of the most boring lineups of NFL action in recent memory.
There's one matchup between two teams with winning records and they're the Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans — two teams that had 0.5 wins between them two weeks into the 2022 season. Thursday night featured two 2-4 teams. Monday night brings the Chicago Bears front and center for their third national broadcast in six weeks.
In terms of Sundays, this may be as good as you're gonna get to head outside, roll out to a pumpkin patch, visit some family, or generally anything else that takes you away from the television.
