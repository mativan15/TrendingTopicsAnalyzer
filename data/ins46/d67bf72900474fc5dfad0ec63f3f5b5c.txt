Georgia-based Aflac (NYSE: AFL) awarded a $200,000 CareGrant to Texas Southern University on Oct. 12 to help advance research related to health equity in underserved communities.

Thus far, this is the largest gift under Aflac's $1 million CareGrant program, which started in 2021 and aims to help individuals and communities currently suffering from or highly exposed to medical debt. Previously, the program limited grants to $100,000, Virgil Miller, incoming president of Aflac U.S., told the Houston Business Journal.
