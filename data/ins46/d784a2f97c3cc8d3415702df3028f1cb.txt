A series of thefts in Wilmette over a year ago uncovered a nationwide fencing ring leading to the recovery of approximately $7.5 million in merchandise, police said.

On Oct. 11, the Wilmette Police Department announced the arrest of eight individuals following a yearlong investigation into what authorities described as a 'sophisticated criminal enterprise.'

Wilmette Police Commander Michael Robinson traced the roots of the investigation to a series of thefts in the village starting in September 2021 as the arresting officer sensed there were unusual circumstances

'He realized there was some significant amount of property that was above the typical small time retail theft and it was indicative of the merchandise being sold at other locations,' Robinson said.
