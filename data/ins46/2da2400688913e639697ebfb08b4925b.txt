CIRQUE DU SOLEIL: ALEGRIA Jamsil Sports Complex, Big Top Arena Oct. 20 – Jan. 1, 2023: Cirque Du Soleil's all-time classic Alegria has been reimagined for a new generation. Titled 'In A New Light Alegria,' the Canadian live entertainment group said it's a new interpretation of the original concept, adding more bold creative alterations and more powerful acrobats to newly designed sets. The show was created in 2019 to mark the anniversary of Alegria's first performance and will be making a stop to premiere in Seoul next month.
