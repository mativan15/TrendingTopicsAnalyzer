WASHINGTON: Trinidad and Tobago, Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas and among the world's three top exporters of ammonia, is exploring ways to boost shipments of gas and petrochemical products to help ease global shortages, Energy Minister Stuart Young said on Wednesday.Trinidad has three liquefaction trains in service and 11 ammonia plants with a total production capacity of 5.2 million metric tonnes per year.The Caribbean nation could boost LNG exports to its gas-thirsty neighbors in the Caribbean and South America for power generation once the restructuring of its flagship Atlantic LNG project is completed, Young told a virtual conference organized by the Atlantic CouncilAtlantic LNG's first liquefaction train was suspended in late 2020 due to insufficient gas supply.
