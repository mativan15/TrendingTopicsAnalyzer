When close to half the companies in the United States have price-to-earnings ratios (or "P/E's") below 15x, you may consider Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGM) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 40.8x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

Allegro MicroSystems certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E.
