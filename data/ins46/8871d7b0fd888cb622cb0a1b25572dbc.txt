TVLine.com Dr. Ethan Choi wasn't expecting to run into his ex-fiancée in the Ed on this Wednesday's Chicago Med (NBC, 8/7c), making for an awkward moment in TVLine's exclusive sneak peek.In the above scene, April (former series regular Yaya DaCosta) apologizes to Ethan for the 'sneak attack' that just took place in a patient's treatment room. She was worried it would be awkward, and boy is it as the two try to navigate this unexpected face-to-face. But a lot has changed since the pair broke up and April left the hospital.
