By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:36 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 01:36 EDT, 21 October 2022 Star Perth Glory striker Bruno Fornaroli could be a shock omission for Sunday's clash with Central Coast as coach Ruben Zadkovich searches for a winning combination. Glory's new-look squad have started the A-League Men campaign with losses to Western Sydney and Newcastle Jets, with the results ramping up the pressure on last season's wooden spooners. Fornaroli is one of the competition's greatest strikers with 82 goals in 142 appearances, and he earned his Socceroos debut earlier this year.
