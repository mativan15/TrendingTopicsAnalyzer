Oct. 21—EMMA — For the second year in a row, Westview will meet Park Tudor in a Class 1A boys soccer semistate game at Kokomo High School, with the winner earning the right to play in the state championship game the following weekend in Indianapolis.

The semistate contest between the Warriors and Panthers begins at 1 p.m. Saturday.

Last season, the underdog Warriors upset the No. 1-ranked Panthers, 2-1, behind a goal from then-sophomore Carson Brown with a little over two minutes remaining in the second overtime.
