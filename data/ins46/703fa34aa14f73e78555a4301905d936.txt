Wachiwit Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares surged nearly 13% on Wednesday after the streaming media company reported third-quarter results that topped expectations and said subscriber growth would continue in the fourth-quarter, suggesting its trouble growing its subscriber base is over, for now. Wells Fargo analyst analyst Steven Cahall, who has an equal weight rating and a $300 price target on Netflix (NFLX), noted that the "dark days are over" with the worst appearing to be behind the company. "Netflix was un-ownable when net adds turned negative, and while there will always be ebbs and flows in the slate, it's now tough to see sub loss in future years even if churn remains elevated vs history (and management did note higher churn still)," Cahall wrote in a note to clients.
