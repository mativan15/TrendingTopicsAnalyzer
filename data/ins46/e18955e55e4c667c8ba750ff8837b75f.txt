We still have a few days left of Mercury retrograde, and today will be especially disorganized. It'll be helpful to hold off on decision-making, if possible, as there's a high probability that our thoughts or the information we're getting won't be clear or completely accurate. Getting curious and asking the right questions or doing the necessary legwork to fact-check news or details will help us stay on track. If a misunderstanding arises, it might be helpful to seek out the assistance of a neutral third party or wait for things to cool off a bit before addressing the issue.
