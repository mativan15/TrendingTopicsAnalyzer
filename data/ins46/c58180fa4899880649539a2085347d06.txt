STOCKHOLM — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday warned that the Ukraine war is diverting attention away from climate change, while at the same time showcasing the world's "suicidal" dependence on fossil fuels. Speaking ahead of an environmental conference in Stockholm, Guterres said the scale of the conflict has "inevitably" shifted the focus from other issues, including efforts to halt the global temperature rise. "The sense of urgency in the debate on climate has of course suffered with the war in Ukraine," Guterres told reporters at the Swedish prime minister's official residence.
