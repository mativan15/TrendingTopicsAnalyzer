WE already knew rail union chief Mick Lynch was prepared to trample all over fare-paying train customers in his interminable series of strikes.

Refusing to change the date, Lynch shrugged off responsibility for veterans' disappointment, and even called for the Government — ie taxpayers — to cover the charity's expected £1million losses.
