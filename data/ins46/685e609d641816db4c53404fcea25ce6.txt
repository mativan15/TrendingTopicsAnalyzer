Shares of S&P Global Inc. SPGI, -3.09% sank 8.2% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the debt rating and analytics company said it was suspending its full-year financial guidance, citing "extraordinarily weak" market conditions. The company said macroeconomic conditions deteriorated since it provided 2022 estimates a month ago, when it cut its adjusted earnings-per-share estimate to $13.00 to $13.25 from $13.30 to $13.50. The company said it expects to reintroduce financial guidance when it reports second-quarter results, which is currently projected to be in late-July.
