Target CEO Brian Cornell says the retailer's data predicts shoppers will spend solidly during the all-important holiday season despite "unusual" economic times in the U.S."We continue to see a healthy guest shopping in our stores and shopping online," Cornell said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit on Monday. "We'll see how they react throughout the holiday season, but when we talk to them they continue to say they want to celebrate the holidays."Shares of the discount retailer rose 3% after Cornell's upbeat commentary.
