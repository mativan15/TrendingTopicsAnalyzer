The streaming leader added 2.41 million customers in the third quarter, exceeding internal forecasts as well as expectations on Wall Street. Netflix grew in all regions of the world and said on Tuesday it expects to sign up another 4.5 million globally this period. While Netflix isn't growing as it was a couple years ago, the world's most popular TV network is back on a positive trajectory after erasing customer losses in the first half of the year. That's good news for investors in Netflix and its peers who suffered steep stock-market losses when the company reported slowing growth earlier in the year.
