One bite of saskatoon tart or slice of saged bannock with jam can transport customers of Pei Pei Chei Ow – a new Edmonton take-out spot specializing in Indigenous cuisine – to Attawapiskat First Nation in northern Ontario. "Blueberry picking, goose hunting, moose hunting," recalls Scott Iserhoff, Pei Pei Chei Ow's founder and chef. "My earliest memories of food are nine, 10, sitting around the fire with my kookom and moshom, smoking geese, eating bannock, drinking tea." Those memories are the inspiration behind the new eatery in Whiskeyjack Art House, as well as the catering business that preceded it.
