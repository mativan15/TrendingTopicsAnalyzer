The big shareholder groups in Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (NYSE:UTI) have power over the company. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Universal Technical Institute is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$304m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
