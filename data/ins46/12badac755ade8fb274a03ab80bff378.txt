It's not water under the bridge for the feds.

The EPA is investigating the state of Mississippi over the water disaster in its capital Jackson.

Residents of the city, which is 80% Black, had to boil water from July until September. They went completely without running water for several days in late August after floods overwhelmed Jackson's water treatment system.

Mississippi's Republican governor, Tate Reeves, and Jackson's Democratic mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, have blamed each other for the disaster.
