I agree totally will Clover Moore's lament ('Barangaroo's phallic forest a monument to rapacity', October 20). However, I recollect James Packer's 'unsolicited proposal' was at first only for a casino. But to make the casino financially viable (Crown claimed) it was necessary to add a hotel and later add apartments on top. The NSW government, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, signed for 75 storeys. Now, when viewed from much of the harbour, the Sydney Opera House has the unfortunate, yet appropriate, backdrop of a raised finger.
