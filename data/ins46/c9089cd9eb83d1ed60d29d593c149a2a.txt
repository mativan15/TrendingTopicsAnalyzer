Consumers will find cheaper hearing aids at big pharmacies, Walmart and other retailers Monday as a bipartisan effort to sell the devices over-the-counter takes effect, the White House said.

Walgreens will sell pairs for $799, a bargain compared to models that specialists recommend and cost $2,000-$8,000, the administration said in a fact sheet.

Walmart will offer hearing aids in more than 1,000 of its vision centers in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, and nearly 500 Sam's Club locations for $199 to $999 per pair.
