When travelling abroad, Netflix is a very handy companion to keep you entertained on days when you just want to stay in your hotel room and relax. But some movies or shows may be inaccessible in your current location. This is because Netflix does not offer the same content globally and may vary depending on the area.If you suddenly cannot access your favorite shows, it means Netflix has made it unavailable in your current location.To get more access, you should use a virtual private network (VPN), which allows you to enjoy watching your favorite shows and movies anywhere in the world.
