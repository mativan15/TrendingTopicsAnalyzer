Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the new terminal building and expansion of the Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Airport in Gwalior city, took aim at the Congress party, saying its previous government in Madhya Pradesh had stopped all pro-poor schemes.
'Madhya Pradesh had once experienced Congress rule, which stopped all pro-poor schemes. Now, the elections are near. Don't repeat the same mistake. Believe in (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji and vote for the BJP,' Shah said after laying the foundation stone for the Rs 446-crore expansion of the airport and launching a Rs 4,300-crore project under the Jal Jeevan Mission.
