A﻿listair Magowan, BBC SportSteven Gerrard was full of praise for his Aston Villa side, who tore into Chelsea in the first half of their defeat at Villa Park, and said they need to "play more with a little fear."With better finishing, it could and should have been a different story. But Gerrard says that after a performance like that and during the draw against Manchester City, he is not concerned about his side's lowly position."We want the Man City performance and today's hour consistently that's where we're trying to get to," he said.
