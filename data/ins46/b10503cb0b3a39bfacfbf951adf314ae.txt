Economists estimate that 325K jobs were added in May, down from the 428K increase in April. The unemployment rate is expected to improve slightly to 3.5% from 3.6% in April. "We've enjoyed 12 consecutive months of payroll growth north of 400,000, but that streak is close to an end," said Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride.
