The image that for me best sums up the utter incompetence of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine is a photograph of an abandoned Russian armoured vehicle taken early in the conflict with the caption 'destroyed by Ukrainian forces'. At first glance, the vehicle appears to be structurally intact, with no explosive debris in its immediate vicinity. Closer inspection, however, revealed why it no longer had any further contribution to make. Beneath the glossy veneer of its painted exterior, the tell-tale signs of rusty tracks and oil leaking from the engine vent confirmed the fact that the Russians weren't prepared or battle-fit for this fight.
