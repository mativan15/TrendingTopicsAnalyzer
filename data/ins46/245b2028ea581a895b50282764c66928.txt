In what must be one of Cameron Diaz's last great films, before she slipped into the shadows and out of the acting business around 2014, she shines in every way she knows how – she's funny, she's hot and she's really, really good at being a Bad Teacher. The premise of the film is in the name, with Diaz playing Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher who couldn't care less about her students because she's about to marry rich and be set for life – until she gets dumped. The dumping leads her into a smoking, drinking, depressive spiral, until she discovers the cash prize incentive for the class who scores the highest in the upcoming state exam, propelling Elizabeth to be the best bad teacher she's ever been.
