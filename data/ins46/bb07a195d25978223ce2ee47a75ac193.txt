By Michael Susin Microsaic Systems PLC said Monday that its pretax loss for 2021 widened on higher costs, but it is confident in its 2022 revenue expectations. The U.K. technology company said that pretax loss was 3.4 million pounds ($4.3 million) compared with a loss of GBP2.6 million for the same period a year earlier. The company said the higher costs were due to increased staff levels after redundancies in 2020 and the restoration of salaries to prepandemic levels. However, revenue rose to GBP906,876 from GBP198.
