Canadian tech companies are calling on the new premier of Alberta to intervene after a regulatory group took legal action over job titles such as "software engineer."More than 30 signatories of a letter sent to Danielle Smith on Friday say the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) "has taken the aggressive position that software engineers must be regulated, and subject to onerous, restrictive, and unnecessary certification requirements."The signatories, which include executives from Helcim, Aimso and Neo Financial, see "software engineer" as a standard job title for anyone building technical programs and argue APEGA shouldn't be treating it as a role in need of certification and regulation like professional engineers.
