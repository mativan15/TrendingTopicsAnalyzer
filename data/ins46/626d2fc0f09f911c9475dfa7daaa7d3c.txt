Los Angeles (CNS) - The Los Angeles Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to send a letter to President Joe Biden in support of protesters in Iran advocating for women's rights and greater social, civil and political freedoms. Proposed in a motion by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Sheila Kuehl, and unanimously approved by the board, the letter will commend the Biden administration for sanctioning Iran's morality police and security and government officials, and express L.A. County's opposition to the Iranian government's efforts to restrict its citizens' internet access.
