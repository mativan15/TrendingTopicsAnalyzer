Barack Obama has bashed the Democrats' midterm campaign as having some 'buzzkills'. The former President has backed Joe Biden and his party ahead of the November elections, but has taken some of the party's messaging to task as making Americans feel like they 'are walking on eggshells'.Speaking on the Pod Save America podcast, Mr Obama said some within the Democrat party need to tone down their rhetoric.Pod Save America is hosted by former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor.
