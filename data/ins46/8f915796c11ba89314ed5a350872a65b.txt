Oct. 20—LAURINBURG — The Scotland men's soccer team (3-13, 0-12 SAC) played their third game in as many days Thursday night, as they hosted the Richmond Raiders (5-14-1, 4-8 SAC) and celebrated senior night. Despite only being down by a goal in the second half, the Scots would ultimately fall 5-1.

Before the game, seniors Dylan Tucker, Charles Gross, David Reyes, Scotty Boone, and Cole Hamilton were honored on the field with their family members and received gift bags. Scots head coach Orrick McDougald shared a story about his senior class from before the start of the season, and how he knew right away, he had a special group of guys.
