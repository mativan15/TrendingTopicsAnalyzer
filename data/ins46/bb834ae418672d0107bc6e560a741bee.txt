Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) stock jumped 4.4% in Monday premarket trading after the trust bank posted better-than-expected Q3 earnings as it benefited from higher interest rates even as its assets under custody and management declined on falling markets. "Our performance benefitted from higher interest rates and continued strength in client volumes and balances across our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments," said President and CEO Robin Vince. Its Wealth Management and Investment units were hurt by declining global markets, especially in Investment Management.
