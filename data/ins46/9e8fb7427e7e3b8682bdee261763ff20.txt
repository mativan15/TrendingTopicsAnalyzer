When Julia*, 37, and her husband of over 10 years began facing financial pressure, cracks started showing in their marriage.
The pressure proved to be something of a breaking point for Julia – and she took a shocking decision.
‘I wouldn't usually call myself an impulsive person,' she tells Metro.co.uk. 
‘I'm normally very restrained, but I'd reached a point where I sort of just flipped and told myself: 'I'm going to do it'.'
The ‘it' in question was joining a dating site for married people and beginning an affair with another man.
