SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 27, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced that it recently became aware of an unsolicited 'mini-tender' offer by Tutanota LLC to purchase up to 215,000 shares of NVIDIA common stock, representing significantly less than 1% of NVIDIA's outstanding common stock. The offer price of $210 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of NVIDIA's common stock exceeding $210 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless Tutanota waives this condition, NVIDIA stockholders who tender their shares in the offer will receive a below-market price.
