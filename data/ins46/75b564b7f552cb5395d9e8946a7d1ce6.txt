Shire became home to thousands of people fleeing fighting elsewhere

Tigrayan forces have admitted that Ethiopian troops have taken control of the strategic city of Shire in Tigray.

The news comes as diplomats grow increasingly worried about the civilian impact of the 23-month civil war.

With an airport, and being a staging post to the regional capital, the loss of Shire is a significant blow.

This is the latest escalation in the conflict with the Ethiopian government, whose troops are being bolstered by Eritrean allies.
