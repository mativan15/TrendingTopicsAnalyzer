More than 83 percent of U.S. waterways recently sampled in a nationwide survey were contaminated by cancer-linked 'forever chemicals,' a new analysis has revealed. Out of 114 rivers and creeks assessed across the country, 95 showed detectable levels of these toxic compounds, according to the analysis, conducted by the Waterkeeper Alliance. Nearly all these waterways were contaminated by at least one type of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — of which there are thousands — while multiple PFAS compounds were present in most of the samples, the study determined.
