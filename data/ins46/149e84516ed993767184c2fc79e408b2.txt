The UK's most popular dating show ever is back with a bang this summer as it returns to screens with a glossy brand new line-up of Insta-ready singletons. Past series of Love Island have served up all sorts of drama, from shock break ups to dramatic exits - not to mention the abundance of participants who have been catapulted to a life of fame and insane wealth. Icons such as Molly Mae and Wes Nelson prove how the hit reality romance show really can end up boosting islanders' fortunes. With the hit ITV2 show confirmed to return on June 6, masses of brands and social media agents are already lining up to offer stars endorsement deals and modelling contracts.
