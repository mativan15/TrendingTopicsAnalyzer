The pandemic has taken a toll on all Americans' mental health, but now, a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 1 in 3 high school teens dealt with poor mental health during the pandemic, and 1 in 5 reported considering suicide.

"Our study examined how recent adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are contributing to poor mental health and suicidal behaviors among adolescents," said Dr. Kayla Anderson, senior study author and expert with National Center for Injury and Prevention Control.
