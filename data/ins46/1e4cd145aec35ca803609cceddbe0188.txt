Kris Jenner is planning ahead when it comes to the end of her life.

On Thursday's episode of The Kardashians, Kris, 66, finally underwent hip replacement surgery after experiencing "excruciating hip pain" for months. Though the procedure went well, it prompted Kris and her daughters to revisit her final arrangement plans — and those of the rest of the family.

"Kim [Kardashian] asked the doctor to save her my bones so she could make jewelry out of it," Kris revealed on a phone call with daughter Kylie Jenner as she recovered in bed beside her other daughter, Khloé Kardashian.
