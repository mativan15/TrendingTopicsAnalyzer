Wayfair's (W 11.29%) share price has tumbled 83% in a little over a year. After soaring to an all-time high of $369 in Jan. 2021 on the back of accelerating growth during the pandemic, the stock currently sits at about $64. 
Wall Street is worried about the company's deteriorating growth in recent months. In the first quarter, it reported a revenue decline of 14% year over year. But I wouldn't want to bet against the long-term growth of e-commerce, especially for the leading online home goods brand.
