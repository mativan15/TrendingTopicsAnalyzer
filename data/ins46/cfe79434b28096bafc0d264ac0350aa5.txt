Even as the state government announced regularisation of 3,542 contractual sweepers and sewermen working in the municipal corporation (MC), uncertainty prevails over regularisation of around 1,000 employees (out of 3,542 employees) who have crossed the upper age limit of 42 years. 



Employees' union Municipal Employees Sangharsh Committee submitted a memorandum with state local bodies minister Inderbir Singh Nijjar in Chandigarh on Wednesday seeking relaxation in the upper age limit a day after he handed over handed appointment letters to 140 employees.
