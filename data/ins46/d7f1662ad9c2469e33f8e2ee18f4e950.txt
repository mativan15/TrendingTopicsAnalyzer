Whoopi Goldberg has hit out at Meghan Markle for claiming she felt 'objectified' while working as a briefcase girl on 'Deal or No Deal.'
The former royal, 41, made the assertion in an episode of her 'Archetypes' podcast on Tuesday, saying she was 'forced to be all looks and little substance' during her 34-episode stint on the game show back in the mid-200s. 
But Goldberg, 66, did not feel sorry for the star during a segment on Wednesday's episode of 'The View,' where she bluntly stated: 'That's TV, baby… what did you think you were going to do? You know that's what the show was.
