AFPA 26-year-old has been named as climate minister by newly elected prime minister Ulf Kristersson in Sweden. Romina Pourmokhtari was until now the head of the Liberal People's Party's youth wing and was not known to have climate as her political profile, AFP reported.

She thus became the youngest person to lead a ministry in Sweden. The previous record was 27 years. Ulf Kristersson leads a right-wing coalition that is backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats. The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats pledged to support the government in exchange for policy commitments, especially on immigration and crime.
