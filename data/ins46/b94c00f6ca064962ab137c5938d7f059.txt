Rodriguez has raised $3,184 for his campaign to date — $3,000 of which came in the form of a transfer from state GOP Chair Nick Langworthy's congressional committee.

He has spent a total of $10.86 so far, state records show.

DiNapoli has spent 201,733 times as much money as his opponent: about $2.2 million this election cycle. And he could plausibly double that, as he had about $2 million left in the bank earlier this month. DiNapoli, a former Long Island assemblymember, was appointed comptroller in 2007 by the state Legislature to succeed Alan Hevesi, who resigned in scandal, and was subsequently elected in 2010, 2014 and 2018 — making him the fourth longest-tenured top executive branch official in state history.
