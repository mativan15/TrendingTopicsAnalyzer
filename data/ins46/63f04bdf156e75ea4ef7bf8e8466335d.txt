If you've got a big Elvis-themed wedding coming up . . . which is totally NOT cheesy in any way . . . you might need a backup plan. Because wedding venues in Vegas are now BANNED from doing them, apparently.  (???) A bunch of chapels in Vegas got cease-and-desist letters last month from the licensing company that handles Elvis Presley's estate. And if they do any more Elvis weddings, they could face legal action.  (A few venues haven't gotten letters yet, but it's not clear why.) A lot of small chapels in Vegas rely on those weddings to make money.
