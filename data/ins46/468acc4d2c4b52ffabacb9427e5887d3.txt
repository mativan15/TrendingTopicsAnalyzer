Britain's Prime Minister Liz Truss is insisting on her devotion to 'sound' economics as she heads into crisis talks with her new finance minister, and a tense week of plotting by Conservative critics.
With even US President Joe Biden joining in attacks on her economic agenda, Truss wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper: 'We cannot pave the way to a low-tax, high-growth economy without maintaining the confidence of the markets in our commitment to sound money.'
That confidence was jeopardised on September 23 when former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Truss unveiled a right-wing programme, inspired by 1980s US President Ronald Reagan, of 45 billion pounds ($50bn) in tax cuts financed exclusively by higher debt.
