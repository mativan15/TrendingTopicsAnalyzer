Japan's exports rose for the 19th month in a row in September, driven by strong demand for autos and mineral fuels, Ministry of Finance data showed Thursday. Exports rose 28.9% in September from a year earlier, which was stronger than the 27.1% increase expected by economists surveyed by FactSet. Exports had expanded 22.1% in August. Exports to the U.S. led the growth, increasing by 45.2%, mainly due to the robust demand for autos, as well as construction and mining machinery. EU-bound shipments were also strong, increasing by 33.
