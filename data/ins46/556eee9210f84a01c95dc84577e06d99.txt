How much cities and towns across northeastern Ontario collect in taxes is once again a top issue in this municipal election campaign.But now inflation is making the financial picture even grimmer for municipalities and prompting some to call for big changes."Most people are saying it's becoming unaffordable," said Chuck Durrant, one of four candidates running to be the next mayor of Temiskaming Shores. "They're afraid to make improvements to their homes or to their businesses, just because when they do that, it ultimately raises their tax bill," he said.
