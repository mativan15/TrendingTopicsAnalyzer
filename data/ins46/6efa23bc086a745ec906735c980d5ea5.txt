Sundry Photography Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) shares rose on Thursday after the semiconductor capital equipment company reported first-quarter results that topped expectations and issued strong guidance, prompting investment firm Cowen to call the figures "impressive." Cowen analyst Krish Sankar noted the results were strong despite the recently announced China export controls, which will impact the company's December quarter. The analyst also noted that Lam Research (LRCX) expects wafer fab equipment to decline 20% year-over-year, making the results all the more impressive, given the headwinds it is facing.
