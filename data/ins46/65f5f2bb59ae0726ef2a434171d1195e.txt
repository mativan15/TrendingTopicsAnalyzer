English football club Doncaster Rovers will start their search by interviewing managerial candidates today. Reports suggest that the club made a shortlist with three names, but other applications are also being looked at and welcomed. Let's see everything we know about it. David Artell, ex-boss of Crewe Alexandra, and Grahan Coughlan, former Mansfield Town and Bristol Rovers chief, are a couple of names that look like prospective candidates. Sources suggest Danny Schofield from Doncaster, who was Huddersfield Town's incharge at the beginning of the season, also fits the profile of the manager Rovers are looking for.
