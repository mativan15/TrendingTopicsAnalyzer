BOSTON (AP) — A Massachusetts plumber who overcharged his customers and failed to pay nearly $1.5 million in taxes has been sentenced to a year in prison, federal prosecutors said.

Jared Derrico, 35, of Boxford, was also sentenced this week to three years of probation, and ordered to forfeit $315,000 and pay $1.45 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in Boston.

He may also have to repay some of his customers an amount that has yet to be determined.
