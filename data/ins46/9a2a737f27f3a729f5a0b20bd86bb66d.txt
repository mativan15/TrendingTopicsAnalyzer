A new entertainment concept could be coming to Oxmoor Center.

Plans were submitted in August to Louisville Metro Planning and Design for Sandbox VR, a virtual reality gaming company. According to its website, the entertainment venue offers an immersive VR experience for groups of up to six where players can see and interact with each other within the game.

The filing shows the Sandbox VR will be taking up a 5,344-square-foot space in the mall. It also says the buildout is estimated to cost approximately $135,000.
