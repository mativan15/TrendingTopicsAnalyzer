The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) forex intervention through forward dollar sales instead of an on-spot basis may undermine its effort to boost the rupee, analysts said. Since last week, the central bank has been intervening in the over-the-counter forward market that lifted the rupee from record lows of 82.6825 to the dollar. The central bank has been selling dollars in spot and conducting buy/sell swaps to shift the delivery of dollars to a future date. A buy/sell swap involves an agreement to buy dollars at the spot date and to sell dollars at a future predetermined rate.
