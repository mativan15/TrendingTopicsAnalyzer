As Toa Samoa look to restore some pride and get their much vaunted Rugby League World Cup campaign back on track against Greece, Cook Islands are in buoyant mood after a first up win over Wales.The Welsh looked odds on to score the winning try from an intercept in the final moments, but the Kukis got out of jail, and coach Tony Iro says he felt his side deserved their victory.The team had no warm up games prior to the World Cup, so against that background Iro says the players put together a great performance, but he recognises they'll have to go to another level to defeat the Kumuls on Tuesday night, UK time.
