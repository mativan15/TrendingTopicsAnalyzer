Indiewire Jessica Chastain recently won an Oscar for portraying real-life hero Tammy Faye, but taking on a true 'angel' caught up in a serial killer drama was a whole other story.Chastain plays nurse Amy Loughren, who helped take down killer colleague Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), who is believed to have murdered as many as 400 patients over the course of his 16-year career in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Netflix film 'The Good Nurse' is helmed by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Tobias Lindholm ('The Investigation') and premieres in theaters October 19 and on Netflix October 26.
