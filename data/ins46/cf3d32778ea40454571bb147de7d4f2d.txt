A cat stealing teddy bears from a toy shop has been labeled the "true definition of a cat burglar," after a passerby who witnessed the unusual robbery shared the video evidence on social media, leaving the internet in hysterics.The viral clip, shared on TikTok by Chezcone, shows the cat, which appears to be a calico, walking up to a toy store, grabbing one of the monkey-shaped teddy bears, and then running away as if it knew what it had done, while the shop owner briefly tried to go after it.Chezcone explained in his video that the cat had just stolen another one from the same shop a few minutes prior, but it turned out that that wasn't its first catch, in fact, it had at least three others, probably taken from the same shop.
