The government has directed the State-owned Coal India Limited (CIL) to be prepared to import 12 million tonnes (MT) of coal for power utilities for the next 13 months. The State power generation companies (gencos) and independent power producers have sought time till Saturday afternoon to figure out the quantity of coal they require and the import orders would be placed by Coal India very soon, a source said. It would be the first time since 2015 that the maharatna firm imports the dry fuel.
