The Congress on Monday hit out at the BJP government over issues relating to price rise and unemployment, asking ruling party chief JP Nadda why he did not address concerns of people during his media interaction on completion of eight years of the Narendra Modi government. Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil highlighted how inflation was touching over 15 per cent and unemployment had touched an all-time high even as the economy was on the downturn and people's incomes falling. The BJP president was busy singing paeans to the Modi government, which "failed on all fronts", he said.
