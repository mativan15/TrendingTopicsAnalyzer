A new guide will help famers build their own wetlands and improve a farm's environmental footprint by removing nitrogen, sediment and phosphorous runoff, scientists say. Dr Chris Tanner, aquatic pollution scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) said the new Wetland Practitioner Guide was designed for those designing wetlands, like environmental consultants but also provided evidence for farmers and councils on the effectiveness of wetlands in removing contaminants.
