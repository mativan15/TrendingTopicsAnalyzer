Howard Stern has become the latest star to condemn Kanye West after the rapper made allegedly anti-semitic comments, going as far as to compare him to dictator Adolf Hitler. 
West, 45, has sparked continuous outrage in recent weeks after wearing a White Lives Matter shirt alongside right-wing political pundit Candace Owens before branding Black Lives Matter as a ‘scam'. 
The Gold Digger rapper was then locked out of Twitter and had his Instagram posts restricted after allegedly sharing anti-semitic sentiments on both platforms.
