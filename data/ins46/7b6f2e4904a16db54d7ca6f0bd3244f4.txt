The 2026 FIFA World Cup games in Kansas City could inspire the redevelopment of a a dilapidated former hotel near Truman Sports Complex.

Since acquiring the vacant Adam's Mark Hotel & Conference Center in December 2020, Community Builders of Kansas City has brainstormed possible new directions. CEO Emmet Pierson Jr. has expressed uncertainty about whether the nearly 50-year-old property should remain a hotel. Its previous owner closed the 369-room venue March 2020, at the pandemic's onset, and it has not reopened.
