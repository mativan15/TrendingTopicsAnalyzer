Tracking the global market trends, benchmark equity indices opened lower on Monday, dragged by the IT and financial stocks. S&P BSE Sensex was down 165 points in early trade while Nifty 50 was above the 17,150 level. 'Rallies triggered by market positioning will be temporary because there won't be any follow-on fundamental support for the rally. This trend played out in the US market last Friday with sharp cuts in major indices,' Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.
