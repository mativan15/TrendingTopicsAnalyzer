ReutersU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin believed that President Joe Biden had not announced a change to America's policy on military assistance to Taiwan. (Reuters)China "firmly" opposes the launch of the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, the commerce ministry said on Thursday, adding that the Chinese government opposed any form of official contact between Taiwan and other countries.
