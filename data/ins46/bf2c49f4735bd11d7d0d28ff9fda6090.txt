Activision hosted a Call of Duty tournament this weekend, and the top competitive player was noticeably absent from the lineup. In a now-deleted tweet, Doug 'Censor' Martin revealed that the publisher had banned him for competing in Fortune's Keep, citing that he had 'harassed [Nadia Amine].' The ruling likely refers to a recent incident where Martin streamed a fake marriage proposal to her.
