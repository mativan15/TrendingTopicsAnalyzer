After the vigilance bureau failed to make a case for recovery, a Mohali court on Wednesday sent BJP leader Sunder Sham Arora, who was a Punjab minister under the Congress regime, to judicial custody. Punjab vigilance bureau had arrested Arora red-handed from Zirakpur on Saturday and recovered ₹50 lakh which he allegedly brought to hand over to Manmohan Kumar, assistant inspector general, VB, flying squad, Punjab, to settle the ongoing cases against him. While seeking extended custody of Arora, the vigilance said that the car recovered from him was registered in the name of a realtor, Deepak Garg.
