As we all know by now, Liz Truss couldn't outlast a lettuce – and it turns out her stint in Number 10 failed to hit another milestone.
Back in 2003, Love Actually was released with Hugh Grant starring as David, a British Prime Minister who finds himself falling for household staff Natalie (Martine McCutcheon) in Richard Curtis' all-time Christmas classic.
Principal photography got underway on September 2, 2002, and wrapped 13 weeks later, just under a year before it hit the big screen.
That means from the moments the cameras started rolling to the final shout of ‘cut', Hugh Grant was technically playing the Prime Minister for the duration of the shoot.
