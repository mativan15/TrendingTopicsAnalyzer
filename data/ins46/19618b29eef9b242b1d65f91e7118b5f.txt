Surrey, B.C. - Surrey's new mayor-elect is already hitting the ground running, working to make her promise to stop the municipal police transition a reality. Brenda Locke wants to keep the RCMP, but the Surrey Police Board says that's not a feasible option. Speaking on CTV Morning Live Monday, Locke says she's already talked to city staff who she claims are prepared to pull back from the SPS. 'I have now asked them to let the Surrey Police Service know that they are to spend no more. No more money and to cease all expenditures moving forward,' said Locke.
