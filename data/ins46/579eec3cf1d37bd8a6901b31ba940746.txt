The unofficial start to summer in the U.S. kicks off on Monday and there are plenty of sales on tech gear to get you ready for the season. We've already covered some of them and today we've got another. Tech accessories maker Hyper has a Memorial Day sale right now where you can get 20 percent off select items at checkout with the code MEMO20. There are a number of devices on sale, but we wanted to specifically call out the HyperJuice GaN 100 watt USB-C Charger for $80 (after applying the discount code).
