This little-known California-based biopharmaceutical stock can see its shares rally nearly 80% in the near term, according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Paul Choi initiated coverage of Gossamer Bio with a buy rating and a $22 price target, calling attention to upcoming results from the company's second phase trial of its seralutinib drug as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension , a type of high blood pressure that can be life-threatening. "Should the TORREY data prove to be positive as we expect, we would anticipate increased strategic interest in GOSS given the attractive market opportunity within [pulmonary arterial hypertension] and the opportunity to leverage the asset," Choi said.
