What does woodworking have in common with marketing?

Well, nothing. That's what drew Gordon Cortez to it in the first place. Crafting hard maple into table tops and benches was a different beast from his past life in corporate marketing for IBM Watson Media.

In 2018, Cortez bought Lamon Luther, a commercial millwork company in Villa Rica, Georgia, from its founder. The company builds custom furniture for offices, restaurants and venues, and prioritizes employing men and women transitioning out of hardships like imprisonment, homelessness and addiction.
