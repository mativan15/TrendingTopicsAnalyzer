This is a different kind of column, in several ways.
It's not just from me. It's from the families of 19 fourth-graders murdered in Uvalde, Texas. And it's from the parents and grandparents of every little boy and girl in America.

Especially to Republican senators, who have consistently voted against any sensible gun safety legislation. And to Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who has repeatedly invoked the filibuster to prevent such legislation from even being debated on the Senate floor.
