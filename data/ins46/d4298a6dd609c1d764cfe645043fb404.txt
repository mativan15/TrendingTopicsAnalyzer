Practices that have already bought flu stock will be reimbursed for what is used during June.LoadingThe Commonwealth government already provided free flu vaccine for those considered to be at higher risk of severe illness from the flu, people aged under five years or over 65, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with serious health conditions and pregnant women.'We strongly urge everyone over six months of age to get a flu shot as soon as possible to protect themselves and their loved ones, as the virus is easily spread and potentially deadly,' Dr Chant said.
