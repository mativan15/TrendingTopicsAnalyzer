The operator of a Homestead martial arts academy that ripped off taxpayers by billing for 'ghost' students was spared prison after shelling out $225,000 in restitution and fines.

Kelly Regalado, who managed the United Martial Arts Academy, pleaded guilty on Friday and was sentenced to 10 years of probation. The school, which had largely been funded by public grants, was also dissolved. Regalado, while she's on probation, is also barred from working for any organization that receives public money.
