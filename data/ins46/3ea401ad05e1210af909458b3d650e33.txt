In what is being seen as a clarion call for civic elections in the Capital, BJP's national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, along with other senior party leaders, will address a mega rally at the Ramlila Maidan here on Sunday. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, following a stocktaking exercise for the ‘Panch Parameswar' conference, said on Saturday that this was the first time a party event was expected to witness the participation of nearly one lakh BJP workers in the Capital.
