Tuesday, 31 May 2022 Highly detailed digital maps covering 6,800km of the NSW coastline are now available to the public with the NSW Government launching the Seabed NSW 3D map viewer today. Minister for Local Government Wendy Tuckerman said the high-tech, high-resolution images allow anyone to examine and visualise the sea floor in detail previously not possible. 'NSW Coastal Councils rely on highly detailed and accurate data to produce their Coastal Management Plan's (CMP's), and this advanced imaging provides cutting-edge information to support the science-based assessment,' Mrs Tuckerman said.
