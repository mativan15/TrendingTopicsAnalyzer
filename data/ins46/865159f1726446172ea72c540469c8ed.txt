Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter for $44 billion cleared a regulatory step with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Twitter said Friday.

The waiting period under the HSR Act, or the Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act, for the bid expired late Thursday night. The HSR Act requires parties to report large mergers and acquisitions to the FTC and the Department of Justice's antitrust division to review.

Musk's deal to take over the social media platform is still subject to remaining customary closing conditions, including approval by Twitter stockholders and receipt of remaining applicable regulatory approvals, Twitter said.
