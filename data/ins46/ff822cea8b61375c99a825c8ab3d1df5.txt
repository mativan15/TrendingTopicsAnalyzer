Tomato prices are surging in India, putting politicians on notice as vegetables have an unusual history of toppling governments in the country. Tomatoes, potatoes and onions form the holy of Indian cooking, where they're often mixed with spices to form the base for curries, such as chicken tikka masala. The average retail price of tomatoes in India has jumped 70% from a month ago and 168% from a year earlier to 53.75 rupees (69 cents) a kilogram as of Tuesday, according to data compiled by the food ministry.
