Michael Bloomberg warned that the public school system is failing and parents are "voting with their feet" in an op-ed published on Thursday. The op-ed titled, "A Wake Up Call for Public Education," described the public education system as "failing" and noted that K-12 public school enrollment is rapidly declining across the country. "A recent national analysis contained a deeply disturbing finding that has generated little public discussion when it should be causing an outcry: Nearly 1.3 million students have left public schools since the pandemic began," Bloomberg wrote.
