STORY: Goldman Sachs on Tuesday unveiled a plan to reorganize its business, its biggest overhaul since 2020, as the Wall Street giant reported a 44% slump in third-quarter profit.

The reshuffle comes as the investment bank seeks to boost its income from fee-based businesses at a time when rising interest rates have dented valuations and deal-making.

CEO David Solomon said the bank will combine its four main businesses into three, placing its money-losing consumer unit Marcus under its wealth business.
