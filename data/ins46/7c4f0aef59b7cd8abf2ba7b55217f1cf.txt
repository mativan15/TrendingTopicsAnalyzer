Preparations were in full swing in Nagaland for the famed Hornbill festival, which will be held with much grandeur this time after two years of subdued celebrations, an official said on Tuesday.
The festival will be held from December 1 to 10 at Naga Heritage Village, Kisama, around 12 km from the state capital Kohima, said advisor for Tourism and Art & Culture H Khehovi Yepthomi.
Yepthomi chaired a coordination meeting with the tribal hohos on Monday on the preparations for the festival, the annual tourism promotional event of the state government that brings together the Naga tribes.
