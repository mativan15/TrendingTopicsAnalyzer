Today, the Carolina Panthers will be facing one of the sport's very best pass catchers in Los Angeles Rams star Cooper Kupp. Unfortunately, however, they'll be doing so without the help of two of their very best defenders.

Week 6's inactives are officially out, and so are cornerback Jaycee Horn and Frankie Luvu. Horn, who did not participate in practice all week leading up to the matchup, was ruled out by the team yesterday due to an injury to his ribs.

As for Luvu, this'll be his second straight absence.
