If you want to know who really controls Bunzl plc (LON:BNZL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.

Bunzl has a market capitalization of UK£9.6b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company.
