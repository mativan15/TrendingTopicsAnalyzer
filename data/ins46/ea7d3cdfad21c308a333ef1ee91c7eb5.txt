A California Democratic House candidate is facing renewed criticism over his prior support for an educational program funded that teaches American K-12 students about Chinese language and culture, but which has links to propaganda efforts of the Chinese Communist Party.

During his tenure on the Hacienda La Puente school board, Jay Chen, a Democrat who is now seeking to represent California's 45th Congressional District, offered support for the Confucius Classroom program and voted in favor of allowing it in the school district.
