Slash Film "Unforgiven" is a Western that speaks not only to the greater state of the genre at the time it was released, but sums up Clint Eastwood's career and the films that would come to define him. How "Unforgiven" manages to be such a provocative and engaging Western with hardly any action shows Eastwood's capability as both an actor and director. The story centers mainly on the forgotten gunslingers of the past who come together for a low-stakes bounty, deconstructing the myth of the legendary gunfighters of the past and the myth of the Western genre itself.
