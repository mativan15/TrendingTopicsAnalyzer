Jordan Poole and the Golden State Warriors are finalizing a four-year, $140 million extension, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said Saturday.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract has not been signed. ESPN first reported the agreement.

Poole is entering his fourth season with the Warriors and has seen his numbers improve each season. The shooting guard out of Michigan averaged 8.5 points on 33% shooting as a rookie, then averaged 12.
