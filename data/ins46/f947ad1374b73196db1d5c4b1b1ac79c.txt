DEAR HARRIETTE: My ex-boyfriend is mad because I did not invite him to my son's graduation.
Harriette Cole 
They were close during the four years that we were together, but we broke up two years ago. I am seeing someone else who will be coming to the graduation.
My ex says that I should reconsider because the event is about my son, not me. The two of them have maintained a relationship even after we broke up.
I always thought that was nice, especially considering that my son's dad is not around, but I don't know how to handle having my current boyfriend and my ex together at my son's graduation.
