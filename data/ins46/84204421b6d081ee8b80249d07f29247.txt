"If we have LVMH, we're good." This short phrase, uttered by an expert on the Paris 2024 Games, sums up the mindset among private and public players in the Olympic and Paralympic event (July 26 to August 11, then August 28 to September 8). To complete its sponsorship budget – €1.115 billion or about 30% of its total budget – the Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (COJOP) has no choice but to find a new top-tier partner; in other words, they must be ready to pay more than €100 million.
