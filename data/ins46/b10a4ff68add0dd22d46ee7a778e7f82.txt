The Watcher is the latest Netflix thriller making waves as it's currently leading the number one spot on the streaming platform.
The gripping seven-parter centres on married couple Dean (Bobby Cannavale) and Nora Brannock (Naomi Watts) who, after moving into their dream home, receive threatening letters from a terrifying stalker known as The Watcher.
Purchased by a couple in 2014 for a cool $1.4million (£1.2million), scary letters from ‘The Watcher' forced them to put the house on the market again in 2017, with the new owner also opening a letter from the stalker, whose identity still remains a mystery.
