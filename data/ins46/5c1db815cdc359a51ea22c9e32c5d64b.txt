Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Aptos Labs, a team that's bringing Facebook's star-crossed Diem blockchain to life, told CoinDesk that PayPal Ventures was one of the investors in a $200 million funding round confirmed in March. The investment was PayPal Ventures' first in a base layer project.

'We believe in the work that the Aptos Labs team is doing to build a safe and scalable layer 1 blockchain,' PayPal Ventures investment partner Amman Bhasin said in a statement.
