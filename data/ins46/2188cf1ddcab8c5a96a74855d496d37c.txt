The biggest game at Neyland Stadium in six years will be played Saturday in Knoxville, Tenn. It has the potential to be Tennessee's most important in more than two decades.
For the first time since 1989, No. 3 Alabama and No. 6 Tennessee will meet as undefeated teams. The long-dormant Volunteers, sporting their highest ranking in 17 years, are a trendy pick to upset, or at least cover against, the long-dominant Crimson Tide. Alabama has not announced whether quarterback Bryce Young, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, will return after he missed the Crimson Tide's close call last week against Texas A&M.
