Ginger GMay 27, 2022Sweet Pascal looking for a new homeHow could you say No to a face like that:) lolMeet Pascal, my ‘Pet of the Week' this week! Pascal is a 6 year old, neutered Tabby who has gone through tough times, heartbreak & loss lately as he was surrendered, along with two dogs, from a home, after his owner passed away:( He is a sweet boy, who would like to have snuggles, and naps on a couch. Perhaps some toys, and a nice window too! Cats are always so easy if you let them just coexist with you & give them the love that they deserve.
