Oct 17 (Reuters) - Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which filed for bankruptcy in July, is being probed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission on whether it misled investors, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

The regulators are probing whether the Singapore-based fund over-stated the strength of its balance sheet and did not register with agencies, according to the report which cited two people familiar with the matter.
