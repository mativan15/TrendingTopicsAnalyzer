Rep. David Valadao is running against Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas in California's 22nd Congressional District.

The 22nd District is located in the Central Valley and includes Hanford, where Valadao was born and raised.

Should Valadao win, he would join the ranks of the very few incumbents who voted to impeach Trump to still emerge victorious.
