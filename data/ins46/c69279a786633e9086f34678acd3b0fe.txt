How tough of a boss is Wall Street's top cop, Gary Gensler? So tough that more and more people are walking out on him.  Fox Business has learned from internal SEC sources that more than a dozen staff attorneys in the agency's Division of Enforcement have bolted since Gensler's appointment last year. Latest to hit the exit are three senior officials with nearly 50 years collective tenure at the agency: Kristina Littman, head of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit who spent nearly 12 years at the SEC; Jennifer Leete, associate director in the Division of Enforcement who was with agency for 23 years; and Adam Aderton, co-chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit, a 14-year SEC veteran.
