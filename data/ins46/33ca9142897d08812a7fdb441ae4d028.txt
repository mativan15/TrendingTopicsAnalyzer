But I recently sold my Cardinal Health position, and I am actually not so bullish about the stock anymore. The stock might still be undervalued, but I don't consider Cardinal Health being a great long-term investment anymore. And it is not that the business changed in any major way in the last few weeks - it is rather that my investment philosophy might be changing a bit.
