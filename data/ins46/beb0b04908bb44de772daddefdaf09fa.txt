Oct. 19—RUSHVILLE — The Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute recently donated a plaster bust of Hoosier statesman Wendell Willkie to the city of Rushville, where it is now on display at City Hall.

"We are eternally grateful to the Swope Art Museum for their donation of this bust," Rushville Mayor Mike Pavey said. "This bust will stand in the City Council chambers and look over the proceedings of our great city."

The life-sized bust had been at the Swope since 1948 and was done by Edmondo Quattrocchi, a talented sculptor of the first half of the 20th Century.
