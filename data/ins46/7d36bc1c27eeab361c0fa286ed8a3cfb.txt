The Financial Services Union (FSU) has called on employers to introduce workplace policies on the menopause amid concerns that women are not being supported as they experience symptoms at work and that some may leave their jobs as a result.The trade union, which represents employees in the financial services, fintech and tech sectors, has marked World Menopause Day by launching a workplace guide — You Don't Just Go Through the Menopause at Home — as part of its campaign for employers to better address the issue.
