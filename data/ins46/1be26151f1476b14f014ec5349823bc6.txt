More than 1,100 men were captured during the Bay of Pigs invasion. After failing to raise the ransom amount demanded by Fidel Castro as reparations, the prisoners were released in exchange for $53,000,000 worth of food and medicine. Between December 1962 and July 1965, the survivors were returned to the United States.

The Bay of Pigs invasion was an abortive invasion of Cuba in April 1961 by some 1,500 Cuban exiles opposed to Fidel Castro . The invasion was financed and directed by the U.S. government.
