ORLANDO, Fla., Oct 21 (Reuters) - The shortage of parts from chips to windshields that has held back plane production will run into at least 2023 - and manufacturers are spending more to tackle the problem, aerospace executives said.Manufacturers are ordering material as far as two years in advance – a break with just-in-time models used previously to restrain costs – and dispatching specialized staff to keep production lines running, executives said at the world's largest business jet show in Orlando, which ended on Thursday.
