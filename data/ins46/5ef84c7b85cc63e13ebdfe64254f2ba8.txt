What does it mean to live in the Piedmont?

Should it matter if you feel a connection to your region's ecological identity when you're brainstorming a project with your office colleagues?

David Seiter says, yes, it matters.

Seiter's Brooklyn firm Future Green Studio has designed roof gardens and public plazas for Manhattan buildings that have landed corporate tenants including Meta Platforms Inc. (Nasdaq: META) and Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG).

In Atlanta, Future Green is responsible for the landscape design of a new $1 billion project, along the Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail that will serve as the new headquarters for email and marketing giant Mailchimp.
