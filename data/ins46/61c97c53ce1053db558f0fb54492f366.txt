The Delhi High Court has permitted Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez, against whom a lookout notice was issued by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with an alleged money laundering case, to travel abroad for IIFA awards subject to certain conditions. Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain, while dealing with the investigating agency's challenge to the trial court's nod to her to travel to Abu Dhabi, UAE from May 31 to June 6, directed the film star to submit a fixed deposit receipt (FDR) of Rs 1 crore and give an undertaking that in case she does not return, it shall be forfeited along with a surety of Rs 1 crore.
