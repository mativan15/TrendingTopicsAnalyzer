New U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is to delay a cut in personal income tax, the flagship announcement in the September mini-budget which roiled financial markets. The move is meant to help plug a black hole in the public finances that is now seen to be as much as £72 billion.

In the latest in a series of government U-turns, the new chancellor is expected to announce that plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax next April will be pushed back by a year, the London Times reported Saturday.
