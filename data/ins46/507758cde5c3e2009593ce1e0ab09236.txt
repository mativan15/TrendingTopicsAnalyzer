SAN DIEGO -- The last time Bryce Harper had played a game at Petco Park, the two-time National League MVP thought his season was over. On June 25, he was hit by a 97.2 mph Blake Snell fastball, which fractured Harper's left thumb.
Though Harper missed two months, his season didn't end that night. Instead, the moment rallied the Phillies' clubhouse. They had lost their best player, but they wanted to stay within striking distance of a spot in the postseason, knowing Harper's eventual return to the lineup would help them be a threat in October.
