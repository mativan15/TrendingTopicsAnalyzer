MOSCOW, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The rouble strengthened past 61 to the dollar on Friday to a two-week high, supported by a favourable month-end tax period as geopolitics continued to hold sway over Russian markets.

By 1221 GMT, the rouble was 0.8% stronger against the dollar at 60.92, its strongest point since Oct. 7.

It had gained 1.8% to trade at 59.
