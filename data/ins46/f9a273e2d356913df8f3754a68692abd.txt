Tyson Fury has donated the £10,000 he won from his wager with Frank Warren on the Anthony Joshua fight to a good cause. Fury bet Warren £10,000 that the AJ fight would not happen after discussions began for a December 3 date last month.Of course, negotiations fell apart at the eleventh hour and Warren coughed up the ten grand. 'I honestly believed it was gonna happen, I got to the stage where I thought we were going to get this over the line,' Warren told talkSPORT."Then Tyson kept saying to me, 'they're not gonna do this,' because all I'm doing is going to him every day and telling him how the negotiations are going.
