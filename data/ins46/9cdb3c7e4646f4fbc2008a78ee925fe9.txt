 Neptune Wellness Solutions (NASDAQ:NEPT) on Monday said it would divest its cannabis assets for C$5.15M in a bid to become a pure play consumer packaged goods company.
The assets includes a cannabis plant in Sherbrooke, Québec and the Mood Ring and PanHash brands, NEPT said in a statement.
The cannabis assets will be sold to PurCann Pharma, a unit of Quebec based Groupe SiliCycle.
NEPT said it intends to use the proceeds from the divestiture for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
