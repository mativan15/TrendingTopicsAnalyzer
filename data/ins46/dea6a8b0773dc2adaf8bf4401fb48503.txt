Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, agreed to buy Parler, a conservative social media app, after other platforms suspended him over antisemitic posts. "In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves," Ye said in a release. Parler is one of several right-wing-friendly social media platforms to emerge in the Donald Trump era. Kanye West, the superstar rapper who has made several inflammatory and antisemitic comments in recent weeks, has agreed in principle to buy conservative social media platform Parler, the app's parent company said in a statement Monday.
