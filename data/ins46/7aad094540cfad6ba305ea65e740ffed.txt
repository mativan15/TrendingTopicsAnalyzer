The pound rallied and UK bonds surged amid expectations that more of Prime Minister Liz Truss's package of unfunded tax cuts may be reversed. US stock futures were higher with investors preparing for a number of key earnings reports.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to make a statement later on Monday on measures to support fiscal sustainability, a UK official said. It's the start of what may be a particularly torrid week for UK assets, with the beleaguered Truss battling to rescue her premiership after the Bank of England ended its emergency bond-buying program on Friday.
