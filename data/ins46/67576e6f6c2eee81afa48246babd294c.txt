The Ransomware Hunting Team. By Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 368 pages; $30 and £23.99On July 16th 2019 Teiranni Kidd, heavily pregnant, was admitted to hospital in Alabama. Unbeknown to her, the hospital had been hit with a ransomware attack—a malicious program had scrambled its computers, and the attackers were demanding money to restore them.

In a subsequent lawsuit Ms Kidd alleges that, because of this, nobody noticed her daughter's birth was going badly.
