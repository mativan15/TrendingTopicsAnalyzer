Amid rising rates, the Gujarat government on Monday announced that the state is cutting value-added tax (VAT) on CNG and PNG by 10 percent. The tax cut was announced by Gujarat Minister Jitu Vaghani, taking prices for both fuels down by Rs 5- Rs 7 per kg. 
Consumers purchasing compressed natural gas (CNG) will see prices drop by Rs 6 or Rs 7, while piped natural gas (PNG) will see a Rs 5 to Rs 6 drop. Current prices in the western state range between Rs 80 and Rs 84 per kg. The state government's move comes barely weeks ahead of a likely election commission announcement of poll dates for Gujarat.
