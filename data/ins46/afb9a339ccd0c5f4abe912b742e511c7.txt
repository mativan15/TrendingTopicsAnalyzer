Andrew Cuomo isn't begging for forgiveness.
Fourteen months after resigning from office in a sexual harassment scandal, the former New York governor is elbowing his way back into the public eye, launching a podcast and a political action committee in what could be the first steps toward a comeback bid for political office.
But he isn't following the usual playbook for misbehaving politicians seeking redemption. Cuomo is unrelenting in his view that he was the victim of a political hit job, and he isn't concerned that stance might cost him listeners on his new show, which has its debut episode Thursday.
