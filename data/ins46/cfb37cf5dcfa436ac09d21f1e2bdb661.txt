◾ Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Gujarat today to inaugurate the KD Parvadiya Multispecialty Hospital in Atkot village of Rajkot district. After the inauguration, the PM, while addressing a public meeting, said that during the eight-year-long reign of the NDA government, he has not done anything nor has allowed anyone even inadvertently to do acts that would shame citizens of the country. He also said that during his eight years as prime minister, he made honest efforts to create an India dreamt of by Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
