BJP State president Somu Veerraju said the Communist Party of India (CPI), which was dreaming about voting the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government out of power in 2024, should introspect why it was fading into oblivion. 'The CPI would do well to discuss how to become relevant again, at its ongoing national conclave in Vijayawada,' he suggested. Speaking to media persons in Vijayawada on October 15, Mr. Veerraju said CPI leader D. Raja's call to his party cadres to strive for the BJP's defeat showed his immaturity.
