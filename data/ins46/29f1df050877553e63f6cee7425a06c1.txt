Jun. 3—Middletown Divison of Police Chief David Birk said patrols are increasing and detectives are serving search warrants and making arrests in an attempt to stop this week's spike in violence.

"We have extra officers out. We are re-assigning detectives and the OSP is assisting us working 10-hour days," Birk said. "We are really going to saturate the area (during late night and early morning shifts)," Birk said.

Two drive-by shooting incidents happened Tuesday night in the 400 block of Curtis Street.
