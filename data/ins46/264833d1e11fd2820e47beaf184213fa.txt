Charles Southall III, executive pastor of First Emanuel Baptist Church in Central City and Baton Rouge, entered the guilty plea in New Orleans' federal court. He faces up to ten years in federal prison. An FBI investigation determined that the longtime pastor illegally diverted nearly $900,000 in donations, congregants' tithes, and proceeds from church-owned real estate for his personal use.
