Prime minister Narendra Modi on Friday said "angry parivaarvadis" from across the country were "uniting against him" but he had no "personal resentment" against any political party but only wanted the country to have a "strong opposition" and a strong democracy for which parties would have to cure themselves of the "disease of parivaarvad". Modi was speaking at a public function in Paraunkh, President Ram Nath Kovind's ancestral village in Kanpur Dehat, where he is on a visit along with the President.
