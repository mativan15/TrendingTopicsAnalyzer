India's top multiplex operatoron Monday reported a bigger-than-expected second quarter loss, as lacklustre Bollywood and Hollywood movie performances drew fewer crowds, hitting ticket prices.PVR's consolidated net loss for the quarter ended September narrowed to Rs 71.23 crore ($8.64 million) from Rs 153 crore in the pandemic-hit period a year ago, but was bigger than analysts' expectations for a loss of Rs 9.92 crore, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Admissions and average ticket price during the quarter were impacted by the weak performance of Bollywood and Hollywood movies, PVR said in an exchange filing.
