The crypto market is covered in red again. This week the price of bitcoin price fell 2.4% and ethereum's price is down 5.0%. Cardano ADA fell 9.8%, XRP XRP lost 6.14%, and solana slumped 12.4%. Meanwhile, the price of BNB BNB rose 7.4%. The waters are still murky after the mid-month roiling of the crypto markets. Since the big dip, most cryptos have been crab walking sideways as investors wait for the murk to clear to see where the market might be headed this summer.
