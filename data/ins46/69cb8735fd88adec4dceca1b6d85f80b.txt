James Bouknight appeared to have a Glock handgun and a bag of Doritos in his lap as he was asleep in his vehicle when he was arrested for DWI.
TMZ obtained a photo showing the Hornets shooting guard in his Mercedes-Benz AMG GT, passed out, with those items on his lap. 
Bouknight, 22, was arrested for DWI early Sunday morning in Mecklenburg County, N.C. His vehicle was stopped at the time and blocking the access to a parking garage.
Witnesses told the outlet that security tried to wake Bouknight up by 'repeatedly pounding' on his window, but were unsuccessful.
