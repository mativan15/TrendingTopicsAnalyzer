US sanctions on Alexey Mordashov have put the steel magnate's empire in peril, underlining how the war in Ukraine is upending the businesses of some of Russia's wealthiest billionaires.The move against 56-year-old Mordashov and his family on Thursday comes after the EU imposed sanctions against the tycoon and his steelmaker Severstal in early March. By threatening to choke off remaining export routes, the US sanctions deal another blow to the fourth-richest Russian, who 16 years ago was close to becoming Arcelor's biggest shareholder before being outbid by Lakshmi Mittal.
