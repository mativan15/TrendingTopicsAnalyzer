Ariela Weinberg from 90 Day Fiancé has several jobs that help her to make money in 2022, while she enjoys her "happily ever after" with Biniyam Shibre and baby Aviel in America. Ariela is currently 31-years-old, while Biniyam is 32-years-old, and they made their reality TV debuts on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 2. A pregnant Ariela had moved to Ethiopia to live with Biniyam, and after they got engaged, she flew back home to New Jersey, bringing her partner along on a K-1 visa. Ariela, who's close friends with her ex-husband, was slammed for being a hypocrite when she wondered if Biniyam was cheating on her.
