LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Californian woman has been charged with obtaining more than $145,000 in fraudulent unemployment benefits, some of that money under the names of notorious killers Scott Peterson and Cary Stayner, state prosecutors said on Wednesday.

Brandy Iglesias was employed at a private company contracted with San Quentin State Prison, where both men are incarcerated, and may have accessed their personal information through her job, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.

"Don't let the infamous names distract you from who this crime really hurt - the most vulnerable in our society," Bonta said in a written statement.
