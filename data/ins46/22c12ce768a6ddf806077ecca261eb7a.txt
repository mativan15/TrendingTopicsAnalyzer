We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse Peninsula Energy Limited's (ASX:PEN) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. Peninsula Energy Limited, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the exploration, development, and mining of uranium deposits in the United States. The company's loss has recently broadened since it announced a US$1.4m loss in the full financial year, compared to the latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$3.2m, moving it further away from breakeven.
