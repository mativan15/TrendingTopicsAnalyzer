On September 27, as the pound collapsed and the markets delivered their damning verdict on Liz Truss's now-abandoned mini-budget, a close ally of Rishi Sunak sent a screengrab of a quote they had given to a journalist several weeks earlier, when it was clear Truss would beat Sunak to Downing Street.'There is no free money,' the quote said. 'And in pretty short order he is going to be proved right.' The accompanying message did not say 'I told you so'. It didn't need to.This weekend, Sunak and his allies are doing their best not to appear jubilant after Truss sacked her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and abandoned the unfunded tax cuts on which she based her victory over Sunak in the Conservative leadership contest.
