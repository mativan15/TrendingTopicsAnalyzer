A 78-year-old pensioner has decided to return to working 40 hours a week to keep up with the cost of living crisis. 
Maurice Taylor, from Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, retired from a career in sales and project management in 2012.
But, like many other people in the UK, Maurice became worried about his expenses going up amid energy supply problems and skyrocketing inflation. 
So he decided to apply for a job to ‘future-proof his existence', he told the BBC.
He ended up securing a role as a customer service advisor at a call centre for Addison Lee – a private hire cab and courier company.
