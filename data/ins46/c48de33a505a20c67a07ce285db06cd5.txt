LAS VEGAS — Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is the most vulnerable Senate Democrat in this year's elections for many reasons, but a big one is the absence of Harry Reid.

Reid dominated Nevada's political scene for decades before bequeathing his seat to Ms. Cortez Masto in 2016 when the state defied an otherwise GOP-friendly year that President Trump elected. Reid died last year, and Ms. Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected to the Senate, now finds herself struggling to replicate Reid's political machine.
