CHICAGO, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Numerator, a data and tech company serving the market research space, has released findings from a May 2022 survey of infant formula buyers to identify their concerns and shopping impacts related to the national formula shortage. Overall, monthly sales of baby food are up 58% vs. YA as consumers supplement formula usage and accelerate the transition to solid foods. Despite safety concerns and fears of rising prices, formula shoppers indicate they are still twice as comfortable purchasing formula directly from an online brand than purchasing formula made in Europe.
