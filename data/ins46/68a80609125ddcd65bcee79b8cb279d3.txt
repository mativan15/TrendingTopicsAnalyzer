A slate of parks projects in Minnesota cities will split nearly $9 million in federal grants intended to expand recreation opportunities in underserved communities. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith announced last week that St. Paul's planned North End Community Center, Rochester's Soldiers Memorial Field Park and Minneapolis' Willard Park will receive $8.7 million through the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program. "By expanding green spaces and creating new outdoor recreational opportunities, this funding will help ensure that all Minnesotans, regardless of ZIP code, can enjoy the benefits of the outdoors," Klobuchar said in a statement.
