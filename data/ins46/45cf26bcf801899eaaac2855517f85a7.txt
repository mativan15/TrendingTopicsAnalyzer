Comedian D.L. Hughley appeared on Cuomo Wednesday, where he weighed in on anti-Semitic comments rapper Kanye West has repeatedly made in recent days. Just 48 hours earlier, Ye appeared on the show and refused to listen when Chris Cuomo pushed back against the rapper's 'Jewish underground media mafia' remarks.

'I think that ultimately, the only place you can hear the kind of rhetoric that Kanye espoused is in the farthest reaches of the blogosphere. If you sound like a white supremacist, ,you pretty much are one,' Hughley said.
