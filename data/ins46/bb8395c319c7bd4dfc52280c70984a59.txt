The Gunners have enjoyed a sensational start to the 2022-23 season, winning 12 of their first 13 games in all competitions to climb to the top of the Premier League table and take control of their Europa League group.
Arsenal secured a narrow 1-0 win over Leeds United on Sunday and find themselves four points ahead of Man City after the reigning champions saw their unbeaten record ended by Liverpool later in the day.
