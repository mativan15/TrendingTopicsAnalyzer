The latest discovery of a highly unusual neutron star by astronomers has questioned our idea about them. A team of astronomers led by a scientist from the University of Sydney has shown the unusual emission of radio-signal from a neutron star. Moreover, the neutron star is extremely slow in completing its rotation – one rotation in every 76 seconds. The object also gives off seven different types of radio pulses. Since such slower rotation of the object is unusual to other known neutron stars, it can be expected to help unlock the mystery of fast radio bursts (FRBs).
