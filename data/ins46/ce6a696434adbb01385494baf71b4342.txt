TNNThe Voice UK host, Emma Willis, during the latest episode of her show Emma Willis: Delivering Babies, struggled to hold back tears as she reminisced about her miscarriage. While discussing miscarriages, a producer asked Emma if she could understand what it must be like to be in that situation. At first, Emma hesitantly said: 'No I can't, I can't, I can't imagine."
She went on to claim that she didn't know how to respond to it since she could imagine as it has also happened to her. She had a miscarriage when she was around seven weeks pregnant in 2007.
