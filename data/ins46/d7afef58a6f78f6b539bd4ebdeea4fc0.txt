LIVE – Updated at 02:54 Victorian wildlife rescuers expect to find hundreds, if not thousands, of drowned animals when it is safe for them to go out to flood-ravaged areas, AAP reports. Wildlife Victoria has fielded more than 3100 calls from people in the past six days, with animals found distressed, injured, and orphaned because of the floods. Most calls have been about magpies, ringtail possums, eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas and wombats. Many noted injured or orphaned young, including waterlogged possum joeys found alone on the ground and fledgling birds from nests.
