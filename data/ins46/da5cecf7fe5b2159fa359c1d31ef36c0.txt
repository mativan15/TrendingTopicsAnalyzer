Costco is running its Memorial Day sale online this weekend (opens in new tab), ahead of the unofficial kickoff to summer on Monday. But what about in store: will Costco be open on Memorial Day? Costco warehouses aren't always open during holidays in the US, and Memorial Day is one of the biggest holidays of the year for Americans. The retailer is best known for its huge warehouse-style stores full of all kinds of everyday products, and given how paper plates and Memorial Day barbeques are all but synonymous with the holiday, Costco might sound like a great place to stock up ahead of Monday - espcially given that it's current Memorial Day sale.
