The NFL basically admits that business interests supersede getting it right.

Appearing on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, NFL executive V.P. of officiating Troy Vincent was questioned about last week's controversial roughing the passer penalties. Said Vincent, 'We support those calls.'

Vincent explained that the league supports the calls because the rule gives the referees the latitude to call roughing if they think they see it.
