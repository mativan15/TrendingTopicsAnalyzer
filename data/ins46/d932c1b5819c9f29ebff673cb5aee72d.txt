Coming out in support of the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) and its vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah, who has been in the BJP's line of fire of late, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday said 'Shah was appointed by the cabinet which comes under the jurisdiction of the elected government of Delhi, and the L-G cannot interfere in it'.
The CM's comments come on the heels of the show cause notice by the Government's planning department to Shah for alleged 'misuse of public office'. The notice was issued following a complaint from BJP MP Parvesh Singh Verma who alleged that Shah, while working as the DDC vice-chairperson, 'acted as an official spokesperson of the AAP for political gains, which is in violation of established procedures'.
