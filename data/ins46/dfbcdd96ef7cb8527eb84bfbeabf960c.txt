A middle school music teacher in Tucson was charged with making a terroristic threat after state investigators said he sent an email targeting Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers and a Trump merchandise store in Show Low.

The Arizona Department of Public Safety arrested 58-year-old Donald Glenn Brown, who teaches orchestra at Pistor Middle School in Tucson, on Sept. 7 following an investigation of the incident.

Though Brown lives in Tucson, authorities believe the email was sent from his mother's residence in Pinedale, about 15 miles from the eastern Arizona town of Show Low.
