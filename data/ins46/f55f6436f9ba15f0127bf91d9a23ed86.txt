If house prices crash owners who cannot keep up with their mortgage could face repossession. Others could fall into negative equity. This is a growing worry, with experts predicting the market will fall to 2013 levels as mortgage rates soar.Negative equity happens when house prices fall and a property is worth less than the remaining value of the mortgage taken out to buy it.Someone who buys a £300,000 property with a 90 percent loan-to-value (LTV) mortgage of £270,000 starts off with £30,000 of positive equity.
