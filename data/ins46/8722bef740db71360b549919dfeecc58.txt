Raas Chhatrasagar is a luxurious, 16-tent resort that sits in the middle of an artificially created forest spread across 1,500 acres near Jodhpur in Rajasthan. It is home to over 250 species of birds and is a destination for glampers. 'Travellers are increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their travel and are associating with brands that are mindful of it,' says Nikhilendra Singh, founder of Raas Hotels, who is now busy welcoming tourists from Canada and England to his property. For the guest who feels guilty about soaking in a bathtub and wasting too much water, there is salve for the eco-sensitive soul.
