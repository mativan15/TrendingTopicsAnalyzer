geneva — 
For their first trip to a celebrated robotics contest for high school students from scores of countries, a team of Ukrainian teens had a problem. 
With shipments of goods to Ukraine uncertain, and Ukrainian customs officers careful about incoming merchandise, the group only received a base kit of gadgetry on the day they were set to leave for the event in Geneva. 
That set off a mad scramble to assemble their robot for the latest edition of the 'First Global' contest, a three-day affair that opened Friday, in-person for the first time since the pandemic.
