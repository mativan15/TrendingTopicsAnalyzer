Tracey Crouch, a former minister, simply wrote "Ditto", as did Angela Richardson, the MP for Guildford who has already demanded Ms Truss's resignation.
But by Wednesday evening, the Government's position appeared to have changed. As the debate on fracking drew to a close, Graham Stuart, the climate minister, told the Commons that it was, in fact, "not a confidence vote".
Asked by Tory MPs whether they will lose the whip if they abstain, he said that is a "matter for party managers".
By the time division bells started ringing - signalling that it was time for MPs to vote - Tory backbenchers remained completely in the dark as to whether they would lose the whip for voting against the Government or not.
