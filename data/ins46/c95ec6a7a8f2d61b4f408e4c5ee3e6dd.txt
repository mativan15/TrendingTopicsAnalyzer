YELLOWKNIFE - The Northwest Territories and federal governments have announced $4.6 million in funding between 2022 and 2024 to enhance wages for early childhood educators in the territory.

Licensed early learning and child-care programs will receive more than $12,700 per full-time equivalent in the first year and $16,250 in the second.

The territory says the recruitment and retention incentive is available to about 300 educators.

The N.W.T. government signed a $51-million, five-year child-care agreement with the federal government in December.
