A building that served as the primary government building in Maple Grove for more than 30 years was damaged in a fire Tuesday night.

Flames broke out at the city's former Village Hall at about 9 p.m. and were extinguished about an hour later, the city's Fire Department said.

The wood building in Lakeview Knolls Park on Fernbrook Lane sustained heavy fire and smoke damage, the department said.

The historic building was the third town hall built in what grew into the large northwest metro suburb.
