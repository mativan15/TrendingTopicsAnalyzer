Home secretary Suella Braverman has dramatically left Liz Truss' government, according to reports.It is understood that Ms Braverman departed this afternoon and will be replaced in cabinet by former transport secretary Grant Shapps.The bombshell news comes just five weeks after the standard-carrier for the Conservative right was appointed to the highly-sensitive Home Office post on Ms Truss's arrival in 10 Downing Street.Speculation was raging in Westminster over further disarray within the Truss administration, after the PM suddenly cancelled a planned visit to Hertfordshire for what No 10 would describe only as reasons of 'government business'.
