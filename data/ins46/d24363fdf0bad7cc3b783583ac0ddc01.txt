Embodied carbon—the greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions associated with construction—is by nature irreversible once an asset is built. Embodied carbon includes the CO 2 emitted from extraction and manufacturing processes to create construction materials and the transport of materials and equipment to a project site, as well as all the emissions associated with the actual construction operations required for the installation of the materials.

These emissions during construction are a major contributor to lifetime emissions for capital projects (Exhibit 1).
