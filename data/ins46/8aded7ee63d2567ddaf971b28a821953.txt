 In what has been described as the most massive investigation of organised crime in American history, the New York City authorities yesterday flung a vast dragnet which will bring in over 700 members of the underworld for questioning by courts of justice in cases involving all forms of racketeering. Starting at dawn, a huge force of special policemen, 1,200 strong, converged on hundreds of people associated with various crime syndicates and served them with subpoenas which require them to appear before Grand Juries for questioning in criminal activities ranging from assault, robbery and extortion, to trafficking in narcotics, gambling and prostitution.
