Evangelos Marinakis, the Nottingham Forest owner, has revealed that Steve Cooper is in line for a new contract and pledged that he will provide 'ammunition' for a summer spending spree.
Marinakis is ready to back Cooper with significant transfer funds following the club's return to the Premier League after an absence of 23 years.
Cooper has proved a revelation since his appointment as head coach in September, inheriting a team bottom of the Championship to lead them back into the top division, and plans are in place to extend the Welshman's deal.
