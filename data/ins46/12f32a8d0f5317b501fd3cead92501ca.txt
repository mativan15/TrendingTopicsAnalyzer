A federal investigation found a restaurant in Goldsboro owes its employees a whole bunch of money.

Jay's Kitchen, owned by Jay's Restaurant Group, was ordered to pay more than $150,000 in back wages by the U.S. Department of Labor, which determined the restaurant had violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. The restaurant was denying workers their full wages by keeping portions of their earned tips, according to a statement by the department.

The investigation also uncovered that Jay's Kitchen violated federal child labor laws by allowing three 15-year-olds to work more than 3 hours on a school day, more than 18 hours in a school week and past 7 p.
