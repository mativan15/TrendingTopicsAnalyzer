But some of us may prefer to play these games on PC, which led to the creation of mobile phone emulators like Bluestacks. Kairosoft is a simulator game developer from Japan, and they have released quite a number of mobile games such as Burger Bistro Story, Dungeon Village 2, and Hot Springs Story 2. Their games were only available on Android and iOS, but in May, Kairosoft published some of their titles on Steam.
