Independent Utah Senate hopeful Evan McMullin knocked his Republican opponent, Sen. Mike Lee, during a debate on Monday after Lee held up a pocket Constitution.

'This document written by the hands of wise men raised up by God to that very purpose — I followed it, I studied it and I defended it to a T,' Lee said as he held up the pocket Constitution. 'For you to suggest otherwise looks right in the face of truth and in the face of the Constitution. How dare you, sir.'

'Look, Senator Lee has been doing this thing with his pocket Constitution for the last several years,' McMullin responded.
