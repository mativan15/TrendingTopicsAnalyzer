OPINION: Cape Verde Stock Exchange (BVC) was created in 1998 in a broader context of policy reforms promoting private initiative in Cape Verde. The privatization of public companies required a market for the sale and distribution of shares and subsequent trading of these securities. Many state-owned companies in the financial, telecommunication, pharmaceutical, construction, electricity and water, tobacco, fuel and other sectors were subsequently privatized through the market mechanism. The advantages of African market integration following the signing of AfCFTA have already been identified by stock exchanges in the region, with the creation in 2013 of WACMIC, (West African Capital Market Integration Council), with the ultimate goal of having a single capital market for ECOWAS and then at the African level.
