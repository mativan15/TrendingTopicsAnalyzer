As an investor, mistakes are inevitable. But really bad investments should be rare. So consider, for a moment, the misfortune of OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (TSE:OGI) investors who have held the stock for three years as it declined a whopping 74%. That might cause some serious doubts about the merits of the initial decision to buy the stock, to put it mildly. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 56% lower in that time. Even worse, it's down 9.6% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.
