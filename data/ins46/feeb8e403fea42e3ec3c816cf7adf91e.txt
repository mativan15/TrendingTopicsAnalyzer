Sean Gallup Article Thesis Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has seen its shares rebound from the recent lows. Its business growth outlook is far from bad, although Shopify will not continue to deliver the outsized growth seen during the pandemic. As a long-duration asset, Shopify will likely be volatile going forward, as market expectations about inflation and interest rates continue to move up and down. Overall, I do not believe that Shopify is a buy at current valuations. What Happened? Shopify Inc. has been a pretty bad performer in 2022 overall.
