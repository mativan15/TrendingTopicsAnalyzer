Taiwanese fabless chipmaker MediaTek expects the global semiconductor supply situation to improve by the end of the year, its top India executive said, despite the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict further adding to the shortage. MediaTek competes with the likes of the US-based Qualcomm, Intel and Broadcom. "We had an impact. We were not able to fulfil 100% demand of our customers, but we have managed it quite well. It's the reason why we could see an increase in the company's revenue," Anku Jain, managing director, MediaTek India, told ET.
