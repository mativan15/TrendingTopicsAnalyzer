KANYE West is buying conservative Twitter rival Parler to create an "uncancelable" social media app.
The controversial hip hop star – who now goes by the name Ye – says he's taking a stance against "censorship from Big Tech".
West wrote: "In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial, we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves."
It comes just days after the Kim Kardashian ex was kicked off Twitter for posting a shocking anti-Semitic tirade.
Parler launched back in 2018 as a microblogging app built around the idea of free speech, hoping to welcome users banned from other platforms.
