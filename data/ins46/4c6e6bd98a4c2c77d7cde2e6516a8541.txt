Schlumberger Ltd.'s (NYSE: SLB) net profit jumped 16% year over year during the third quarter as drilling activity picked up internationally and in North America.

Growth in third-quarter revenue was led by increases in well construction, which rose by 36% year over year to $3.08 billion, the oil field services giant reported Oct. 21. Revenue from Schlumberger's production systems segment also jumped 28% year over year to $2.15 billion during Q3.

Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said increased international and offshore activity complemented an already robust level of activity in North America.
