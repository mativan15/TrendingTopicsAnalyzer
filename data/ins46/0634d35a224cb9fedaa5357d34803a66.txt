HelloFresh, a Berlin-based company once considered to be the largest meal kit provider in the nation, has announced plans to shut down its huge Bay Area production facility at the end of the year and will subsequently lay off more than 600 employees.

A letter to the California Employment Development Department, dated Oct. 10, relayed the company's decision to permanently close the plant on Dec. 11, which will result in the termination of 611 employees, including production associates, managers, and maintenance personnel, according to reports from the San Francisco Business Times and MarketWatch.
