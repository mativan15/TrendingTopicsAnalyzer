Prospective homebuyers vie to buy apartments constructed by the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA). They consider such apartments or layouts free from legal issues. However, hundreds of homebuyers, including specially abled citizens, are now repenting for trusting the BDA and spending their hard-earned money to buy flats at a residential apartment complex near Gunjur in Mahadevapura. According to the residents, the construction began in 2012 after the then Chief Minister DV Sadananda Gowda laid the foundation stone of the apartment complex.
