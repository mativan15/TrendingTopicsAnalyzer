Kiriko in Overwatch 2Blizzard Entertainment
After a two-week lockout following the Overwatch 2 launch so that players could get used to her, Kiriko is now available in Competitive Play. The support hero has the potential to have a big impact on ranked games. She's lethal in the right hands and her Kitsune Rush Ultimate is absolutely devastating — as long as your team is coordinated enough. I'm looking forward to seeing what grandmaster players and Overwatch League pros can do with her in ranked play.
