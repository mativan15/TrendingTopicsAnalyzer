The Hollywood Commission has launched a new search for enduring trouble spots within the entertainment industry, targeting misconduct and offensive behavior. Two years ago, the organization that was created to root out 'discrimination, harassment, bullying, and abuse' launched a survey of 9,630 entertainment workers that found widespread doubt about whether powerful individuals would be held accountable for wrongdoing. It also found that only about one in four people who experienced gender harassment or sexual coercion actually reported it, fearing nothing would be done or that they would face career retaliation.
