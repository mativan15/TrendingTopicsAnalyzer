AgenciesThe initial investment will be made by the promoters using internal resources. PMI Electro Mobility, a leading manufacturer of electric buses in India, is looking at launching a range of small electric commercial vehicles to cater to the burgeoning demand from e-commerce firms for last-mile delivery vehicles. The company, which has a joint venture with China's Beiqi Foton, said there is massive potential to electrify the small and medium commercial vehicle segment given the government's drive to transition urban delivery fleets to e-mobility.
