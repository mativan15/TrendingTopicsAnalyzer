European venture capital firm Satgana has closed the first tranche of its 30 million euros (around $29 million) climate tech fund.Founded in 2020, the Luxembourg-based investor will write checks of up to 500,000 euros to 40 pre-seed and seed-stage startups across Europe and Africa. Satgana means "a good company" in Sanskrit. It is set up in a way that prioritizes ESG and shares returns with every employee, according to general partner Romain Diaz, and plans to help build companies that way too. For example, Satgana has taken inspiration from the "Slicing Pie" equity framework to ensure every member of 25-strong team is fairly compensated for the time and effort they contribute to the fund.
