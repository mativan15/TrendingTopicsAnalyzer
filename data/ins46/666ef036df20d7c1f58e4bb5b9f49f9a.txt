Consensus EPS estimate is $0.25 (-71.9% Y/Y) and consensus revenue estimate is $4.86B (-20.1% Y/Y). Over the last 2 years, FCX has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and revenue estimates 38% of the time.

The mining giant's results are expected to be hit by lower copper prices, dragged by concerns over rising interest rates, a strong dollar and a weaker global economy.
