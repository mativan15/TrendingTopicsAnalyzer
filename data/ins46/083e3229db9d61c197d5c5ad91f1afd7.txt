Many Ukrainians, including a mum and her four-year-old child, have been subjected to unthinkable tortore and sexual abuse, a UN report has said.
The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine heard how Russian soldiers gan- raped the 22-year-old mum in her home in the Kyiv region during the early stages of the invasion back in March.
They then allegedly sexually abused her husband, before making the traumatised couple to have sex in front of them.
One of the soldiers is accused of forcing their four-year-old daughter to perform oral sex on him – which is legally considered to be rape.
