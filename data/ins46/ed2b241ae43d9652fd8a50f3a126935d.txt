Dame Deborah James is "so chuffed" that her recent collaborations will raise more than £1million towards her BowelBabe Fund. The BBC podcaster, 40, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016 and has been keeping her followers updated as she nears the end of her life. Deborah - known as 'Bowel Babe' - has been a high-profile advocate around cancer awareness for a number of years, including through the podcast You, Me and the Big C. She has been receiving hospice care at her parents' home in Woking but that hasn't stopped the mother-of-two from working on a number of projects to help continue raising money for her charity.
