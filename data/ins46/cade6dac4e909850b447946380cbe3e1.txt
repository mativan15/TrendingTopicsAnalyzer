PORTLAND, Ore. -- President Joe Biden strode into the telephone bank at a crowded union hall and eagerly began making calls and eating doughnuts — one frosted, one glazed — as he tries every page in the political playbook to deliver votes for Democrats."What a governor does matters,' Biden said in a pep talk to volunteers who were making Friday night calls for gubernatorial hopeful Tina Kotek and other candidates. 'It matters! It matters, it matters, it matters!'Before leaving Portland on Saturday, the president planned to attend a reception for Kotek and give a speech about his administration's efforts to bring down costs for Americans.
