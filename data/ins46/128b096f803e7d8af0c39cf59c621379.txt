Unlike the stereotypical student, Xaviera Black was disciplined with her money. By the time she graduated from university after four years she had saved £10,000 — a third of her student finance.Three times a year Black would immediately transfer her student loan payments into her savings account — £11,000 in her first year at Camberwell College of Arts, then £7,100 a year once she had moved home with her parents in Brentford, west London, from where she continued her studies.She would dip into her loan only after using the cash she earned working as a nanny and at a pub for about £9 an hour.
