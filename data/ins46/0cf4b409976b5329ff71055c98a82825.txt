When Curtis Lavarello walks through the vendor hall at the huge school safety conference his organization sponsors this July, he will stop and marvel at just how useless some of the technology being marketed to schools is.It won't help prevent a shooting, he said, and could even hurt. He cited a $400,000 system that fills hallways with smoke in hopes of stopping a shooter, noting that this same smoke would also obstruct law enforcement trying to intervene and children trying to escape. "You're going to see bizarre things you would never want to see in your child's school," said Lavarello, executive director of the School Safety Advocacy Council.
