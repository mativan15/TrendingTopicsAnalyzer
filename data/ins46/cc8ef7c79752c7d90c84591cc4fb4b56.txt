Cryptocurrencies are emerging as a major threat across the globe, secretary general of Interpol (International Criminal Police Organisation), Jurgen Stock, said. Asia delegate Praveen Sinha said law enforcement agencies in India need new standard operating procedures (SOPs) after the launch of 5G technology. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the 90th Interpol General Assembly which is likely to see participation of delegates and ministers from 195 member countries.

Speaking at a news conference, the Interpol chief said authorities across the globe have witnessed a sharp rise of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, which pose a major threat.
