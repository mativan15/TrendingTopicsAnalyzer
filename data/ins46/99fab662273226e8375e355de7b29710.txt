Entertainment One owner Hasbro has stumbled with its third quarter earnings as the toy maker drives towards becoming a digital gaming powerhouse. Hasbro saw net earnings fall 49 percent to $129.2 million, against a year-earlier $253.2 million, and the adjusted earnings per share line came in at $1.42, compared to $1.96 in the same period of fiscal 2021. That fell short of a $1.52 expected per-share earnings estimate from Refinitiv. Hasbro matched Wall Street projections for overall third quarter revenues at $1.
