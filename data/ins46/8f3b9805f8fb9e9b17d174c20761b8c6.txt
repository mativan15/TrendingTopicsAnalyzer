Liverpool forward Sadio Mane was sent flying to the ground as the Reds trained for their Champions League final against Real Madrid. The Senegal star will hope to start in Paris after scoring against the Spanish champions in the 2018 final as Liverpool fell to a 3-1 defeat. Mane has been the subject of interest from Bayern Munich, but has remained an important part of Jurgen Klopp's team this season. Klopp's side failed in their bid to get one over on Real Madrid last season, losing in the quarter-finals before Los Blancos were downed by Chelsea in the semis.
