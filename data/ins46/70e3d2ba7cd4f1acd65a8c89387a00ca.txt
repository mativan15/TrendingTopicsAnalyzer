American Airlines will pioneer a new type of travel experience.
 
"First class will not exist on the 777 or, for that matter, at American Airlines," said American Airlines chief commercial officer Vasu Raja during an investor call on Thursday. Raja explained that the reason for the change is that "customers aren't buying it."
 
He added, "The quality of the business-class seat has improved so much, and frankly by removing it, we could provide more business-class seats, which is what our customers most want or are most willing to pay for.
