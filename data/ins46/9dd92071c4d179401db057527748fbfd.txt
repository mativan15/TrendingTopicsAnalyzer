Former Louisiana Congressman John Cooksey, who served in the U.S. Air Force, earned a master's in business administration and treated thousands of patients as an eye surgeon, has died. He was 80.

Cooksey, a Republican, served as the 5th District Congressman with Monroe and Alexandria as the population hubs from 1997-2003.

He limited himself to three terms in the House before making a run for the U.S. Senate, a race Democratic U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu won.

Fifth District Congressman's Julia Letlow's late husband Luke Letlow worked for Cooksey as his driver while Letlow attended Louisiana Tech University.
