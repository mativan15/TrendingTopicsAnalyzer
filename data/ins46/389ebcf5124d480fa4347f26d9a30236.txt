It was the 75th anniversary of the Cannes Film Festival this year and certainly the fest itself thought that alone was cause for celebration, and they did exactly that, but they were not the only ones with reason to party. As the pandemic cancelled the 2020 fest, and downsized the 2021 fest, there was definitely a feeling that it was time to party again in Cannes, just like it was 2019 all over again. And that certainly was the vibe when amFAR returned to form Thursday night, making money to benefit the continuing fight against AIDS, even if it seems that the cause has been overshadowed by Covid in recent times.
