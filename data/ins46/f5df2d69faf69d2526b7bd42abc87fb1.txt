Just Stop Oil launched another day of demonstrations across London, bringing Knightsbridge to a standstill as activists sat in the middle of the road with banners advertising their organisation. Commuters have been growing increasingly frustrated with the protesters, with footage emerging of drivers taking direct action to remove them and end the disruption. Video from central London showed one driver in a suit hitting out at the sitting activists as he proceeded to removed their banners and then proceeded to drag one of the activists to the pavement.
