Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien took a swipe at prime minister Narendra Modi Sunday over a Reserve Bank of India report that said fake ₹2000 currency notes had increased by 54 per cent between 2020/21 and 2021/22. The report said fake ₹500 notes had increased by 102 per cent in the same period. Derek O'Brien ripped into claims made by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party when it announced demonetisation - that it would eliminate fake currency."Namaskar Mr PM Narendra Modi... DEMONETIZATION? Remember? And how (Bengal chief minister and Trinamool boss) Mamata Banerjee swiftly took you on? How you promised the nation Demo would WIPE OUT ALL COUNTERFEIT CURRENCY.
