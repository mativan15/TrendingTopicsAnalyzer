CappuchinoBy CappuchinoOct 18, 2022Did Tasha K move to Africa to avoid paying Cardi B all of that money? Tasha denied those rumors, but she did spend some time there with her family. Of course Cardi won her defamation case and is now owed $4 million. The blogger, Tasha K, has said she doesn't have that to pay at all. Well, who paid for the Africa trip? What's crazy is that Tasha posted a video giving away a little over $1000 and admitted she is in debt but she felt someone else can use that $1000.
