Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook who leaked documents to The Wall Street Journal and lawmakers in 2021, was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by Iowa City West High School principal Mitch Gross during a commencement ceremony Sunday.

"It's our responsibility to figure out what to do with social media and how to ensure it helps the public access and digest information," Haugen told the graduates at her alma mater.

Haugen worked for Facebook for nearly two years on the civic integrity team, charged with combating election interference and misinformation.
