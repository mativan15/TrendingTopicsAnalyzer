A federal judge on Friday tossed out former President Donald Trump's lawsuit seeking to stop the New York attorney general's probe of his business dealings.

Trump alleged in the suit that New York Attorney General Tish James violated his constitutional rights by launching an investigation into the Trump Organization 'in bad faith and without a legally sufficient basis.' James in the probe is exploring whether alleges the Trump Organization misstated the values of assets in financial statements — a claim that emerged out of Congressional testimony from a former Trump lawyer.
