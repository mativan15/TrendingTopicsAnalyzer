THE UK is to send long-range missiles to Ukraine in defiance of Vladimir Putin's chilling warning that Russia will strike new targets if the West supplies such weapons.
A number of M270 multiple-launch rocket systems - which can hit targets up to 50 miles away - will be shipped after Russian troops blasted the outskirts of Kyiv for the first time since April.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the launchers, which have a longer range than any missile tech in use in the war, will help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.
