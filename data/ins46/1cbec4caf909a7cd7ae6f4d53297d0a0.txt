putilich Introduction Properties and REITS are known to be good inflation hedges. Corporate Office Properties Trust (NYSE:OFC) is a specialized office REIT catering to the US Defense sector. Over the years, the business has sold non-core assets to reorient its portfolio more toward the US defense sector. Now, as it is expanding its portfolio within its niche, it is poised to reap the benefits from a higher defense spending environment. Management has prudently locked in fixed low-rate interest for at least 4 more years resulting in a balance sheet largely immune from continued interest rate hikes.
