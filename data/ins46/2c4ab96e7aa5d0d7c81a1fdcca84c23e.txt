GlaxoSmithKline is buying Boston-based biotech Affinivax in a transaction worth up to $3.3 billion (€3.1 billion), bolstering its vaccine business with new technology.The UK drug maker, which is one of the world's largest vaccine developers, expects to pay $2.1 billion up front and 'milestone' payments of up to $1.2 billion, if Affinivax's new vaccine for bacterial pneumococcal infections succeeds in trials.The deal is the largest since a three-part transaction with Swiss drug maker Novartis in 2014 — when GSK sold its oncology business, bought Novartis's vaccine business and the companies merged their consumer health units into a joint venture.
