Shanna Moakler has officially auctioned off her engagement ring from ex-husband Travis Barker.

The sparkler once owned by the Celebrity Big Brother alum — a 4-carat, round-cut solitaire ring with a diamond encrusted band — sold for $96,500 after a total of 17 bids through jewelry re-sale company Worthy.

Moakler, who was married to the Blink-182 drummer from 2004 to 2008 (and with whom she shares son Landon, 18, and daughter Alabama, 16), initially listed the ring for auction last Friday, at which time the leading bid was over $64,000.
