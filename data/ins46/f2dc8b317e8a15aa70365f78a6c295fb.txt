Helen Skelton has gone back to her roots and is living with her parents in Cumbria after her split from husband Richie Myler. 
The TV presenter, who is currently competing on Strictly Come Dancing, uprooted her life and moved back home following the breakdown of her eight-year marriage to the rugby star in April. 
Richie, 32, and Helen, 39, share three children; Ernie, seven, Louis, five, and Elsie, nine months, while it was recently revealed that her former husband is expecting another baby with girlfriend Stephanie Thirkill.
