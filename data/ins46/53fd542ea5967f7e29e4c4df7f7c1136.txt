Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's governing coalition may not be able to endure if it cannot pass a bill that would extend emergency regulations for Judea and Samaria, Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar (New Hope) warned in an interview with KAN on Tuesday morning.

The bill, which has been passed annually for 55 years, was postponed by a week, because Ra'am (United Arab List), Meretz and opposition MKs said they would vote against it. If the regulations are not extended by the end of June, the civil administration will expire and civilians caught speeding over the Green Line would have to be tried by military courts.
