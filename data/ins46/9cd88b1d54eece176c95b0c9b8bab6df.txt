The Houston Rockets and Toyota Center announced a series of arena and game experience enhancements in advance of their regular-season home opener versus Memphis on Friday night.

In a continuation of the team's partnership with Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson and his premium wine and spirits company, Sire Spirits, Toyota Center is launching the Sire Spirits Social Club. Located on the lower suite level on the south side of the arena, the club offers fans a great view of the court with a fine dining experience in a high-end, club-like setting with premium cocktail service.
