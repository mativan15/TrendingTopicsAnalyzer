The powerhouse capital of South Korea is a city of contrasts. Here, centuries-old Buddhist temples stand alongside the shimmering skyscrapers of global tech companies. Traditional palaces and museums also share space with billboards that show K-pop stars strutting their stuff. Despite the dichotomy, there seems to be harmony in the capital's different attractions. Many visitors also remark that food and transportation around the city is cheaper than its counterparts in nearby East Asian countries.
