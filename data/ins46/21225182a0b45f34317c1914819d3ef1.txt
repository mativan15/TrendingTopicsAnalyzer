SANTIAGO, Chile — The Brazilian Army has written up requirements for its next eight-wheel drive armored reconnaissance vehicle, following approval for the service to buy up to 221 of the platforms — each armed with a 105mm gun — according to sources and an Army document seen by Defense News.

The VBC Cav-MSR procurement effort replaces another program known as VBR-MR.

The Army's General Staff is now awaiting approval to publish the rules and schedule for industry bids. Companies that have already expressed interest include Italy's Iveco-Oto Melara Consortium, which is offering the Centauro II; General Dynamics European Land Systems, with the LAV 700 8x8 LAV derivative; and the China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (otherwise known as NORINCO), with its ST1.
