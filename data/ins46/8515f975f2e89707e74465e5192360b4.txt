TOKYO/HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - Japanese buyout firms Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) and Polaris Capital Group are each considering participating in bids for Toshiba Corp (6502.T), two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.Toshiba, which has been bedevilled by accounting and governance crises since 2015, set up a special committee last month to explore strategic options, including potential deals to go private, after shareholders voted down a management-backed restructuring plan.Both funds, far smaller than some global private equity firms, would need to team up with others, the sources said.
