Microsoft is cutting jobs but will continue to hire in "key growth areas," a company spokesperson confirmed to CNET on Tuesday. The move comes as consumer demand for tablets and PCs cools, and as tech companies brace for a broader global economic downturn. Though Microsoft did not confirm the number of jobs it cut, the layoffs affected nearly 1,000 of its approximately 221,000 employees across the organization, including in the Xbox gaming division, according to multiple reports. Citing a need for structural adjustments after an evaluation of its business priorities, Microsoft is the latest tech firm to cut staff in the face of slowing growth.
