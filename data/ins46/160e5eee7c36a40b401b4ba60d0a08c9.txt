The grave of much-loved local character Walter 'Snowy' Farr is located in the graveyard of St. Andrews Church, the grounds of which he lovingly tended for more than 30 years.
Walter Reginald Farr was born in 1919. He came by the nickname 'Snowy' because even as a child he had white hair. He worked as a street sweeper for many years and also cared for the grounds at the church. Snowy also raised tens of thousands for charity with his traveling menagerie of animals in Cambridge Market Square. Typically dressed in a bright red tunic and black boots, with his long white beard, would have crowds of people gather to watch him performing in the middle of Cambridge.
