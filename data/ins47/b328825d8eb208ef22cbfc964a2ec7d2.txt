Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and state BJP president Sukanta Majumdar on Thursday said that Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government would not last till December as it was looking too 'feeble' and the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections would be held together in 2024.
'The state government is looking very weak and it's visible. This government will not last till December, and the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections will be held together in 2024. Keep watching,' said Adhikari at a BJP organisational meeting with leaders of seven Morchas of the party at Eastern Culture Center (EZCC) in Bidhannagar.
