The Miami Heat will again be without guard Victor Oladipo and center Omer Yurtseven.

Oladipo (left knee tendinosis) and Yurtseven (left ankle impingement) have been ruled out for the Heat's Eastern Conference finals rematch against the Boston Celtics on Friday at FTX Arena (7:30 p.m., Bally Sports Sun and ESPN). They both also missed the Heat's season-opening loss to the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, with the team labeling Oladipo and Yurtseven as day-to-day.

No other Heat player is on the injury report for Friday's game against the Celtics.
