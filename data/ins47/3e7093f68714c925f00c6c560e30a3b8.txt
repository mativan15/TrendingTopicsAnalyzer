I've been happily avoiding the Nothing Phone (1) hype so far - nothing that's been officially announced sparks joy, and I'm very wary of products for which the main selling point is the charisma of the influential figure behind it (see also: everything Musk has ever touched).But a recent leak has lit a small spark in me for this upcoming debut Android phone. Apparently, the phone will launch at a mid-range price - €500 to be exact (which converts to around $540, £430, AU$750).That's less than I had expected the Nothing Phone to debut for, as the pomp and ceremony that's already been held for the phone led me to believe it'd be a premium handset to rival the Samsung Galaxy S22 or iPhone 14.
