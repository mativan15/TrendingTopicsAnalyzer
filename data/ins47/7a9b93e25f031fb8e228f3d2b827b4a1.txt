The monkeypox cases reported could be the peak of the iceberg, the World Health Organisation‘s director of pandemic and epidemic diseases has warned.

Cases of monkeypox in the UK have now topped more than 100 as there are a total of 106 infections reported, according to the latest government data available.

Now the WHO said nearly 200 cases of monkeypox have been reported in more than 20 countries not usually known to have outbreaks of the disease.
