Alan Moore, co-creator of Watchmen along with Dave Gibbons, doesn't spare any words he has for his former creative home at DC and Warner Bros. His groundbreaking comic series essentially reinvented superhero comes in the mid-1980s and has become one of the most important pieces of comic book history ever.Watchmen, originally released as a 12-part maxi-series, now one of the best-selling graphic novels ever, was adapted in 2009 by Zack Snyder, who even then caught wind of Moore's displeasure with the adaption.
