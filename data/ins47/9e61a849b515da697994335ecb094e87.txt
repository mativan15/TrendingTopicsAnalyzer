Google has been fined $161.9 million by the Competition Commission of India "for abusing its dominant position in multiple markets" by favoring its own suite of apps within Android, the regulator said in a press release Thursday. The Competition Commission says Google's business model is reliant on getting as many people to use its products and services as possible -- the data gathered from people who use Search, Chrome and other Google services can be used to court advertisers. In addition, Google enters into agreements with device manufacturers to preinstall Google apps and services, giving it a "competitive edge," according to the Competition Commission.
