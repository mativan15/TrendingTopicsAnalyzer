MEMPHIS – Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09) and Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-18) today led a letter to the Public Interest Declassification Board seeking release of the remaining 14,000 documents associated with the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. They note that the public is skeptical about the official version of events and that the documents' release would help restore confidence through transparency. The most recent deadline for compliance with the document-release requirements of the 1992 JFK Assassination Records Collection Act was 2021.
