There are two kinds of artists. Those who carve a niche for themselves in the art world through aesthetic experimentations and formal vigour and live in and engage with an 'art world' that transcends time and space. And then there are others whose art—its form and themes, practice and expression, aesthetics and politics—is a relentless engagement with the space and time they live in. They are rooted in their land and breathe history.If in the former case, the artists' engagement is more with themselves and their art, in the latter case, it is more about the world and life around.
