A cyclist armed with a gun stormed into a Post Office branch in an attempt to rob it.
Emergency services swarmed the Park Lane business in Netherton, Liverpool yesterday afternoon, after reports the man demanded cash from the till.
When staff refused, it was reported he fired the gun into the air. Witnesses said it looked like a starting pistol.
No injuries have been reported and no money was taken before the suspect fled the scene on a pedal bike.
But the attempted robbery has left the local community shocked as it is the second in the area this week.
