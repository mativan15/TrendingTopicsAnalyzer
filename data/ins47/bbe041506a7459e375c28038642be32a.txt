After seeing a dramatic decrease in playing time following the coaching staff change at Florida, sophomore offensive lineman Josh Braun is planning on transferring from the university, according to a report from Swamp247's Graham Hall.

Braun won't enter the portal until Dec. 5 due to the NCAA's transfer regulations, but his time with the Gators has come to an end. The decision is hardly surprising considering the way Braun's playing time has trended this year. After being on the field for 639 snaps as a sophomore, Braun has been a part of Billy Napier's offense for just 24 plays through seven games.
