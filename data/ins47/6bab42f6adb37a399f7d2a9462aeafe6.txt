Morsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty Images Shares of SPS Commerce (NASDAQ:SPSC) have seen a modest correction in line with the wider market in recent times. Late in 2020 I labelled SPS as an under the radar growth play, one trading at a full price. Fast forwarding one and a half years in time, shares are trading at similar levels as they did late in 2020, despite continuation of growth albeit that valuations continue to be nosebleed high. Former Take SPS Commerce is a long-term secular growth play, having a mission to connect retail trading partners to join the network.
