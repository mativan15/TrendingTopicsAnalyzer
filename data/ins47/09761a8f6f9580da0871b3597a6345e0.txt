England's emphatic performance in their opening World Cup game wasn't a surprise says rival head coach Kristian Woolf.

Shaun Wane's side claimed a dominant 60-6 victory over Samoa at St James' Park in the opening fixture of the tournament.

The host nation went into the clash as underdogs but proved the bookmakers wrong with a 10-try performance in Newcastle.

Woolf, who will depart for Australia following the World Cup to link up with the Dolphins in 2023, insisted he wasn't surprised by England's performance having worked in Super League for the last three years.
