Netflix (NFLX) is showing signs of a comeback, at least according to one bullish analyst.

"I think it's back to growth," Santosh Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners head of research, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). "It's doing everything from a position of strength now because the big concern was: Are they rushing into this ad tier model from a position of weakness? Is their whole business model not working?"

The company's third-quarter earnings report showed a beat on both the top and bottom lines in addition to 2.
