The theme from Mel Gibson's Braveheart filled the air as the man accused of helping spawn Rio's paramilitary mafia movement was lowered into the soils of a graveyard called the Garden of Longing. Fireworks exploded overhead.

'My brother was a noble man with a magnificent heart,' said the dead man's sibling, Natalino Guimarães, as he and hundreds of mourners prepared to say their last goodbye.

'He was truly a Braveheart. I'm a Braveheart. All these people here are Bravehearts,' Guimarães declared, motioning to the crowd outside the cemetery's VIP chapel, many sporting caps or T-shirts emblazoned with the nickname.
