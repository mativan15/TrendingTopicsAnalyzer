As Fiji moves ever closer towards a national election, opposition political parties have said restrictive electoral laws are hobbling their campaign efforts. Fiji Unity Party's Savenaca Narube said new amendements to the country's electoral laws, which were supported by the governing Fiji First party, have eroded democracy during the campaign."If you take a step back and look at the climate it's an oppressive one, the most oppressive climate ever in our history," Mr Narube said."Laws have been changed not to make elections freer and fairer, but to oppress the opposition and that's the tragic part of this.
