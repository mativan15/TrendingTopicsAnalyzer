was a cold March night in 2013 in the city of Ylöjärvi in Finland. I was a college student with no money for rent, food, bills, or anything really. I was waiting for the clock to turn midnight when the monthly student welfare would be paid to my bank account. When the day officially changed, I withdrew a couple hundred euros from an ATM. But it wasn't for bills or food. That money was earmarked for gassing up the car and driving to another city in the middle of the night to buy a used graphics card.
