A sense of urgency is building inside Facebook. It's trying to get WhatsApp making real money as the company deals with falling growth and continued criticism for Mark Zuckerberg's risky bet on "the metaverse."Facebook, which last year rebranded as Meta, acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $22 billion.

It remains the company's most expensive acquisition, but it has yet to directly recoup the investment.
