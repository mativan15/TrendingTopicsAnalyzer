The number of insolvencies in the hotel sector is likely to rise substantially next year as soaring energy and operating costs eat into profit margins. Small hoteliers, or those who run establishments with fewer than 50 rooms, are especially vulnerable.Aiden Murphy, a corporate recovery expert with the accountancy firm Crowe Ireland, expects 30 to 40 hotels to become insolvent in 2023. Higher operating costs, falling profits, mounting liabilities and the withdrawal of government support measures introduced during the Covid era leave smaller businesses without protection and unable to pay down debt.
