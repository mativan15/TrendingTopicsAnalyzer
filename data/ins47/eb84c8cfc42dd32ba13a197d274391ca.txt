The life of renowned Kiwi drum and bass player, and DJ Jay Monds, aka Bulletproof, who died following a brain haemorrhage on September 29, 2022, is being celebrated with a large graffiti wall being painted by artists Otis Frizzell and Johnny 4Higher in Ponsonby this weekend. 'Jay's Wall' is being painted in a alleyway besides Bhana Brothers grocery in Ponsonby Road. Frizzell says the 'bombing' was 4Higher's idea and it seemed a great way to pay tribute to a good friend. The pair are working off a drawing Frizzell did for Monds' album Dub me Crazy.
