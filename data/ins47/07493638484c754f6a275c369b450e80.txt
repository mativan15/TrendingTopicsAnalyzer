The 4-year-old North Florida Green Chamber of Commerce, based in Jacksonville, has named chemist and microbiologist Jessica Tittl as its new executive director.

Tittl has a background in new technology development and in 2019 founded Biome Future, a nature-inspired technology company. She is also working on her doctorate at the University of Florida, studying coral reef microbiomes and the role of business in driving conservation efforts and policy.

"Her impressive professional and educational background, along with her knowledge and passion for sustainability in the corporate environment, make her an excellent addition to our team," board chairwoman Dolly Penland said.
