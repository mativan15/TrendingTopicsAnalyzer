A 'Wheel of Fortune' contestant unfortunately missed out on the grand prize after losing 'one of the easiest final puzzles ever.'
The player — who goes by the name Ashwin — was also seemingly scoffed at by game show host Pat Sajak on Tuesday's episode over his wrong guesses.
The Georgia-based professor had made it all the way to the game's bonus round and opted to select the 'Person' category.
Seven letters were missing from the answer and a certain special reward. 
Ashwin needed to answer the full two-word phrase correctly in order to win in under 10 seconds.
