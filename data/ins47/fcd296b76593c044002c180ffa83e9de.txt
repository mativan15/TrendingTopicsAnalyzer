As cryptocurrency prices continue to plummet, some companies are ready to take advantage of the fall. Two top firms, Ripple and FTX, informed CNBC that they're searching for acquisitions — and hoping that the buyouts spur growth in the industry overall. In an interview last week, Brett Harrison, president of cryptocurrency exchange FTX U.S., revealed the company is in "a very good spot in terms of our capital and cash" and plans to scope out possible merger and acquisition opportunities. Harrison also said the firm will seek companies that can help it gain additional users or regulatory licenses.
