Ben Simmons smiled and chuckled about the way he had been acting all day. Wednesday was the first time in 16 months that he had played in a meaningful basketball game, and he seemed positively effervescent.

'I think I was just too excited, honestly,' he said Wednesday night at Barclays Center. 'It was just great to be out there.'

The outing did not go especially well. Simmons scored only 4 points and fouled out, perhaps a function of his enthusiasm, and his team lost by 130-108 to the New Orleans Pelicans.
