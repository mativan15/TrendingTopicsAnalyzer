The Los Angeles Rams are off this week for their bye, but that won't stop them from making roster moves. On Tuesday, the Rams made four of them.

The Rams signed veteran offensive tackle Ty Nsekhe off the Colts' practice squad to the active roster and in order to make room for him, they released edge rusher Takk McKinley, who was signed last month.

Additionally, they placed both Grant Haley and Joe Noteboom on injured reserve. Haley will miss at least four games with an ACL sprain, while Noteboom is out for the year after tearing his Achilles.
