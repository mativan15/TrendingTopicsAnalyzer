It's hard to imagine a Pokémon card featuring a popular character, Charizard, that was once purchased for a few dollars, fetched $180,000 in an auction in 2021.

Even more outstanding is a comic book purchased for 10 cents in 1938, which then sold for $3.21 million on eBay in 2014. The Superman comic book was one of only 100 that still exist today, making it rare and collectable.
