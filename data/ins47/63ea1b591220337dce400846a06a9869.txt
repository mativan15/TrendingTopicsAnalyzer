Hong Kong has decided it wants to become a technology hub again, and has unveiled plans to "trawl" the world for talent to make it happen.
The Special Administrative Region's plan was outlined yesterday in a speech by John Lee, who was elected chief executive of Hong Kong in May.
Lee was the only candidate, but had the blessing of Beijing. That carries enormous weight in Hong Kong politics since China moved in the late 2010s to reduce autonomy and outlaw opposition parties. Those actions were seen as contrary to the agreement Beijing struck before the 1997 handover of the territory from Britain: to allow a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.
