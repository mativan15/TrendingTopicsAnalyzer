Olemedia/E+ via Getty Images Much of the growth and prosperity enjoyed by Western nations over the last 60+ years can be attributed to the gains in productivity. These productivity gains have been driven in large part by advances in computing and processing power. These advances in computing and processing power in turn have been propelled throughout the decades by the ability to place ever increasing numbers of transistors on wafers to create increasingly more powerful microchips. Back in 1965, former Fairchild Semiconductor engineer and Intel (INTC) cofounder Gordon Moore, predicted that the processing power of microchips would double about every year.
