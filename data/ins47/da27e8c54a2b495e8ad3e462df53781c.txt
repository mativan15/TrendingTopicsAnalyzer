VAI Resort, which will be the largest resort in the state when construction is done, plans to host about 100 concerts a year at its $40 million 'entertainment epicenter,' the company announced as it revealed new renderings of the $1 billion project, which is under construction in Glendale.

Construction on the project is expected to be done in late 2023. The development is south of State Farm Stadium between Loop 101 and 95th Avenue.
