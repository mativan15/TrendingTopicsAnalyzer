Records released Monday by the House Oversight Committee reveal how the Trump Organization charged the Secret Service well above the normal government rate to stay at company hotels while protecting former President Donald Trump and his family, multiple outlets have reported.

The records are at odds with claims made by Eric Trump, the former president's son and head of the company while his father was in office, who said the Trump Organization often provided the Secret Service with "at cost" or even free hotel rooms, per The Washington Post.
