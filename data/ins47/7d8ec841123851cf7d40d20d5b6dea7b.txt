May 27—We've received an infusion of new faces and new energy in The Day newsroom over the past few weeks and — woohoo — are we grateful for the help.

Allow me to introduce our summer interns: Dan Passapera, Sarah Sylvester and Julia Walker. Maybe you'll see them working in the community or exchange phone calls, video chats or emails with them as they hone their journalism skills.

Passapera, of Cheshire, is entering his senior year at Quinnipiac. He'll likely have a camera in his hands if you cross paths.
