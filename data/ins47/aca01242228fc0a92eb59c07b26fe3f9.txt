Kym Marsh has admitted it's been tricky for her juggling two jobs while doing Strictly Come Dancing, considering she's competing on the show while also balancing filming commitments.
Tonight, Kym and her professional dance partner Graziano Di Prima are set to perform the Quickstep to Ballroom Blitz by Sweet (Come Dancing), as part of the BBC's centenary celebrations.
Last week, the couple survived the dance off, with singer Matt Goss and his pro partner Nadiya Bychkova being sent home.
While Kym has a lot on her plate with her Strictly training, the 46-year-old also has to juggle two separate filming commitments – her part in Waterloo Road, and her role as a presenter on BBC One's Morning Live, which she co-hosts with Gethin Jones.
