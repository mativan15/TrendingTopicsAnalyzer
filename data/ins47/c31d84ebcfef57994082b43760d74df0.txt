The slide in cryptocurrency markets has called into question a trend that peaked along with its price: getting paid in digital assets.

Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, was among the recipients. After taking office in January, he said that his first three pay cheques would be 'automatically converted' to ethereum and bitcoin via Coinbase, the crypto trading platform.
