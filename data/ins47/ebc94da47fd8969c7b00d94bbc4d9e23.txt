Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has called for a general election as the current government are an 'absolute sham'.

Neville has been public of his criticism of the Conservative government for years and a call for a vote came after a chaotic day in Parliament. During a vote on banning fracking there were reports of 'manhandling' with the whip and the deputy whip resigning and un-resigning.

It has led to more MPs calling for Prime Minister Liz Truss to be ousted and Neville reacted to a story saying a lot of politicians want Boris Johnson back in charge.
