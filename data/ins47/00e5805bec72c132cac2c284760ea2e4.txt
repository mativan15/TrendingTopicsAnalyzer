Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) takes shocking action in EastEnders next week in the wake of a car crash that leaves Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) in a severely bad way. 
The schemer is on tenterhooks as the week kicks off, concerned that Linda will spill the beans about her involvement in Nancy (Maddy Hill) and Zack Hudson (James Farrar) losing their restaurant money. 
Linda, as it happens, intends to reveal all, as she and Nancy embark on a trip to Watford. But with Zack having let spill that Linda was contemplating departing the Square several weeks ago, animosity soon ensues between the mother and daughter duo.
