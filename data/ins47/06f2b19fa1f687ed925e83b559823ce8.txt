After being drafted by the Broncos in the third round of April's draft out of UCLA, Dulcich impressed in the spring but was then hindered by a hamstring injury for most of training camp. Denver decided to treat the injury carefully and placed Dulcich on injured reserve, giving him plenty of time to recover.
Dulcich is now healthy again and he's expected to make his NFL debut against the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday Night Football in Week 6.
