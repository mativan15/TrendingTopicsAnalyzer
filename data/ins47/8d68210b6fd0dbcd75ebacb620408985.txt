ATLANTA — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock voted Monday at a polling place here on the first day of early voting in battleground Georgia, and dialed up his criticism of Republican challenger and former football star Herschel Walker.'My opponent Herschel Walker is not ready,' Warnock told reporters afterward. 'The people of Georgia deserve a serious person to represent them at serious times.''He claimed to be a police officer. He's not,' he said, mocking the 'fake badge' that Walker flashed during their Friday debate.
