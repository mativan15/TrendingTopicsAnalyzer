The director of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Remake has left Ubisoft after more than 11 years at the company.

As reported by VGC, David Grivel announced on LinkedIn that he'd be moving on to a new adventure following more than a decade working on Ubisoft games including Assassin's Creed Unity, Far Cry 5, and most recently Splinter Cell Remake.

Its unclear how Grivel's departure will affect the remake's development at Ubisoft Toronto but he appears to be leaving on good terms, meaning Ubisoft likely had plans for his replacement in place (though a new director is yet to be announced).
