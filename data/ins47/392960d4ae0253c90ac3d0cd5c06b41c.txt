The political scientist James Walter says 'the Liberals' situation today is as dire as what happened in the early 1940s'. Robert Menzies' first prime ministership, as leader of the United Australia Party (UAP), ended in 1941 when his party lost faith in him. The UAP went backwards at the next election and later disbanded. Menzies would not return to the prime ministership until he'd founded the Liberal Party, complete with a reconsidered political platform, in 1949. That set the Liberals up for 23 years continuously in office.
