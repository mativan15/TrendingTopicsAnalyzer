When Laura Pratt went to vote last week at the advance poll set up at All Saints Church, she saw something that she had never seen before: two Windsor police officers."I was surprised to see it and a little off-put," she said. "Elections in Canada are free and fair."As Pratt entered the voting area inside the church, two uniformed police officers were the first people she saw. They had laptops in front of them, she said, and were talking to each other.The City of Windsor says police officers have been stationed at advance polling stations in previous elections.
