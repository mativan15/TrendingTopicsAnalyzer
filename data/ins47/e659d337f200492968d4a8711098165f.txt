Aries (Mar21/Apr20) It is time to put your mind to long overdue financial transactions. If it makes sense to end old financial arrangements in preparation for new and more appropriate ones, look into this now and get it done. You could save yourself a lot of money by doing so. Taurus (Apr21/May21)If you put your patience to good use, you should be able to sort out any problems you are facing. Persuade others to leave it to you to deal with plans that are still mixed up and muddled at the moment. Gemini (May22/June21)It will be your positive outlook that helps you overcome obstacles both on the family front and on your career path.
