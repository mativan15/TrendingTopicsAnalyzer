The election in the newly redrawn 25th Congressional District features two lifelong residents of the Rochester area promoting themselves as moderates within their parties. One, two-term Democratic incumbent Joe Morelle, has spent his entire life in politics, while his challenger, newly minted Republican and first-time office-seeker La'Ron Singletary, boasts of a different kind of public service.

Morelle, 65, is running for re-election on a platform that includes reproductive rights, gun control and health care reform.
