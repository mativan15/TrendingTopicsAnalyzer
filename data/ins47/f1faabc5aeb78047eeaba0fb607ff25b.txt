Nobody wants to be premature and say the stock market slump is over, but with stocks up more than 6% from their lows last week, there are some signs of hope emerging.Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy team for Evercore, says that there are some indications that the worst is over, including the falling yield on 10-year US Treasuries and the fact that the dollar has slipped from its recent highs.Other factors such as solid corporate earnings, a loosening of the stock-bond correlation that's emerged this year, and improvement in China's economy could also contribute to a more positive environment for stocks.
