A new poll suggests nearly 60% of likely Massachusetts voters say they'll vote yes on Ballot Question 1, which would amend the constitution to bump taxes by 4% on income exceeding $1 million.

Fifty-nine percent of nearly 1,000 respondents said they're in favor of the so-called millionaires tax or fair share amendment, according to a MassINC Polling Group survey sponsored by The Barr Foundation released Thursday morning.

Thirty-one percent plan a 'no' vote and 10% did not respond or remain undecided on the proposal, which has driven heated debate and millions of dollars in fundraising this fall after several previous failed attempts to raise taxes on Massachusetts' wealthy.
