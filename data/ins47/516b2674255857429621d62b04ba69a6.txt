The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a ruling blocking a Texas law aimed at preventing big social media services from 'censoring' users or content based on viewpoint.

The court ruled 5-4 to block the law, which is pending a challenge before a federal appeals about whether it is constitutional. The court did not provide a reason for why it upheld a lower court's injunction preventing the law from taking effect pending appeal.
