Ford's chief executive says the global auto industry is headed for a huge price war in the coming years as electric vehicle costs drop and multiple companies sell EVs priced around US$25,000 (NZ$38,500). CEO Jim Farley told the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Wednesday that the US$25,000 electric vehicle will democratise EVs. Materials to build that vehicle will cost around US$18,000, he said. It currently costs much more to build an EV than it does one powered by a gas engine, Farley noted.
