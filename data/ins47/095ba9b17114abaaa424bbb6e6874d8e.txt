Off the pitch, Brazilian star Neymar is going through a troublesome period but the striker is in red-hot form for his club after his goal gave Paris St Germain a 1-0 home victory against bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille in Ligue 1.
Neymar found the back of the net on the stroke of halftime to put leaders PSG on 29 points from 11 games, three ahead of second-placed Lorient.

Back from injury, Lionel Messi hit the crossbar and combined well with Neymar and Kylian Mbappé throughout the game with the 'MNM' combination creating many chances on the break in a lively match at the Parc des Princes.
