Pgiam/iStock via Getty Images PepGen Inc. (NASDAQ:PEPG) won bullish ratings on Wall Street as analysts from Wedbush to SVB Leerink launched their coverage on the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech with the expiry of its post-IPO quiet period on Tuesday. PepGen's (PEPG) lead candidate, PGN-EDO53, is designed to target DMD patients whose mutations are responsive to an exon 51-skipping therapeutic approach. Wedbush analyst Laura Chico argued the technology Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) has used in its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drugs EXONDYS 51 and SRP-5051 has validated the approach in PGN-EDO51.
