Media outlet Forbes will no longer pursue its previous plan to go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the New York Times reported Tuesday, citing two people familiar with the matter.

The Times attributed the decision, which would have taken Forbes public at a $630 million valuation through a merger with Hong Kong-based SPAC Magnum Opus Acquisition, to waning interest in the once-popular investment vehicle as several recent SPACs have not performed well.
