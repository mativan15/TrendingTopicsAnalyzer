New York CNN Business —

After the bell Tuesday, Netflix announced its Q3 earnings, beating expectations and adding 2.4 million subscribers, driven largely by growth in Asia. The news marked a reversal from the previous two quarters when Netflix saw stunning declines in subscriber growth. Wall Street reacted approvingly, with the company's stock price spiking more than 14% in after-hours trading.

But, while Netflix started adding subscriptions again, the company's message to investors strikingly suggested that they pay less attention to those very numbers.
