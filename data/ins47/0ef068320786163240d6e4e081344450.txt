The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) held the Economics paper for Class 12 students on May 28. The exam was conducted from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm amid the new Covid guidelines that all the students must follow. Soon after the exam was over, the students gave mixed responses over the difficulty level of the question paper. While some called found it difficult, others were able to attempt the questions with little struggle. However, going by the teachers' responses, the question paper seems moderately difficult.
