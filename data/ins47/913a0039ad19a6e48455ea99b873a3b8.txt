The Chinese consul-general has said that he was doing his duty when he and embassy staff dragged a pro-democracy demonstrator into the consulate grounds in Manchester. Zheng Xiyuan, named in the House of Lords for his part in the attack, told Sky News that he did not beat Bob Chan, 35, who had been protesting outside. Footage appears to show him pulling Chan's hair and dragging him inside. "He was abusing my country, my leader, I think it's my duty," Zheng said. Diplomats may be expelled and the police are investigating.
