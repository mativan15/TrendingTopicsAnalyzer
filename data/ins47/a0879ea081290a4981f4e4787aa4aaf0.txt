Philadelphia businessman David Adelman is buying into the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils, purchasing equity previously held by Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin.

Adelman, who is chairman of the development company in charge of the 76ers' new arena project, is buying a majority of Rubin's nearly 10% stake in Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, according to people familiar with the transaction. The rest of Rubin's equity, one of the people said, will be divided among HBSE principals Josh Harris and David Blitzer, and some other LPs.
