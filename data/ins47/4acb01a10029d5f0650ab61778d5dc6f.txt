Stocks are capping off a strong week Friday, despite some choppy trading, as rising yields failed to dampen market enthusiasm over stronger-than-expected corporate earnings results. The S & P 500 is 3.6% higher week-to-date, on pace for its best week since the one ending Sept. 9, with every sector in the broader market index in the green. Energy saw the strongest advance, up 7.6% this week, followed by materials and industrials. The best-performing stocks this week surged on the back of strong earnings beats.
