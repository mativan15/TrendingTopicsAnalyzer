NortonLifeLock Inc. (NASDAQ:NLOK) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in day or so. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase NortonLifeLock's shares before the 7th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 22nd of June.
