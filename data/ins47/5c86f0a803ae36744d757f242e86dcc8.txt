President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said India is providing the most affordable medical facilities in the world and people from abroad, especially the neighbouring nations, visit the hospitals in the country to avail the health care services. He also said that India is fast emerging as a medical tourism hub. "India has the cheapest medical facilities in the world and in the hospitals, especially in Delhi, people from neighbouring countries are found getting treatment more than the local patients," Kovind said here after inaugurating 'Arogya Manthan', a conference on the topic 'One Nation, One Health System'.
