Since 1950, Wisconsin's average temperatures have climbed 3 degrees Fahrenheit and its yearly rainfall has increased by 17%, drowning crops and plaguing those that survive with white mold that costs farmers dearly.

But Democrats are hoping the chaos might yield another term in the governor's mansion.

A new 30-second ad from the progressive climate group Evergreen Action, which grew out of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's climate-focused 2020 presidential bid, praises Evers' plan to move the state to 100% clean energy by the end of the decade, a tactic the group hopes can fire up young and liberal voters in one of the closest gubernatorial races in the country.
