India's fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market's value growth fell 16.5% sequentially in May compared with the month of April, signalling reduced consumer spends on daily essentials due to rising prices across products. Sales grew 33% as compared to the May of last year, when the country was in lockdown due to the deadly Delta wave, according to the latest report by Bizom, a sales automation firm that tracks 7.5 million retail stores. 
Even for electronics such as air-conditioners and refrigerators, sales fell up to 15% in May on a sequential month comparison, industry executives said.
