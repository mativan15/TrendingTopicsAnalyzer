Gambling giant Caesars bid for a casino in Times Square is sparking strong opposition from Broadway.

As news of the idea for a Caesars Palace Times Square was announced, the Broadway League jumped into the debate, saying they don't see a gambling mecca as a good fit alongside the dramas and musicals that draw tourists to New York.

'The addition of a casino will overwhelm the already densely congested area and would jeopardize the entire neighborhood whose existence is dependent on the success of Broadway,' the Broadway League said in a statement.
