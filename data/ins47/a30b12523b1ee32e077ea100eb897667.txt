Magic Leap executives laid out why the AR company has an edge over rivals Meta and Microsoft.

The CTO and CEO say they're catering to the business world, not trying to create an "alternative universe."

The Magic Leap 2 launched with developers in March, joining the race alongside Meta's Oculus and Microsoft's HoloLens.

Magic Leap's top two executives believe their augmented reality firm has a significant leg up on competitors like Microsoft and Meta, formerly known as Facebook.
