Oct. 19—Spokane's past use of federal dollars to clean up environmental blights earned high marks from a delegation of top state and federal Environmental Protection Agency officials during a visit Tuesday.

"There's a lot of thoughtfulness here about what neighborhoods can and should be," said Janet McCabe, deputy administrator of the EPA who is second-in-command of President Joe Biden's effort to enforce environmental policy. McCabe met with city officials, including Mayor Nadine Woodward, on Tuesday and received a tour of so-called "brownfield" sites in town, areas that had previously been designated as underused due to pollution.
