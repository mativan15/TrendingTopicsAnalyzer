The Trudeau government's proposed legislation aimed in part at reducing the mass imprisonment of Indigenous people in Canada misses the mark, Murray Sinclair said Thursday.The former Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) chair and retired senator told the Senate legal committee studying Bill C-5 that it "does not go nearly far enough" as a strategy to reduce the overincarceration of Indigenous and Black offenders.The bill, if passed, would eliminate about one third of the country's mandatory minimum penalties, provisions in the criminal code imposing compulsory prison time for those convicted of certain offences, Sinclair explained.
