Approximately 255,000 passengers commute daily between the two cities via subway, accounting for 14 percent of the total number of daily commuters. The Guangzhou-Foshan Line is the first intercity metro line in China, with an average daily passenger volume of about 531,000, said Zhang Jian, an official with Guangzhou Metro Group Co Ltd.
