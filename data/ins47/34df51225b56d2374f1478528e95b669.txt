(Bloomberg) -- A new electric DeLorean will arrive in 2024, says the latest iteration of the DeLorean Motor Co.This is the brand John DeLorean founded in 1975, which went bankrupt by 1982. The collapse was due to mismanagement, complaints about poor fabrication and lackluster performance—and the fact that its founder was charged with conspiring to smuggle 55 pounds ($24 million worth) of cocaine into the US. He was acquitted.Now rebranded as DeLorean Motors Reimagined LLC after years of wallowing as a niche steel-car automaker in Texas, DeLorean says it's making a modern electric coupe, the Alpha5.
