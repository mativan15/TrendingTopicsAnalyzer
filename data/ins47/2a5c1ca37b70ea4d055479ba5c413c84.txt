It's been quite the year on Wall Street. Since hitting their respective all-time highs less than a year ago, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and tech stock-driven Nasdaq Composite have plummeted by as much as 22%, 26%, and 35%, respectively. With declines of this magnitude, all three stock indexes are currently mired in a bear market.
Yet amid this heightened volatility, investors have found solace with stock-split stocks.
