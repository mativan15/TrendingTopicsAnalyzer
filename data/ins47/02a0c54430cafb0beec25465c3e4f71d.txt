The Bank of England was not briefed properly about the disastrous mini-budget that forced it to launch a £65bn rescue of pension funds, it has told MPs.Its deputy governor said the Bank would have warned then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng if it believed there was a threat to 'financial stability' – but was unaware of the full scale of tax cuts to be unleashed.'We did not have a full briefing of the package the night before,' Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Commons treasury committee, of the 23 September 'fiscal event'.
