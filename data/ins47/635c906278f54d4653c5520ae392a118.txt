The debate over the future of HSBC is set to be reignited after the bank invited analysts and investors to an event to detail its strategy for its UK high street banking business, which some in the City believe could be spun off.The event was organised before it emerged that Ping An, a Chinese insurer and HSBC's biggest shareholder, was agitating for a break-up of the bank.HSBC has rejected the proposal. However, bosses are expected to face fresh questions about the feasibility of a split at a seminar on its UK ring-fenced bank that The Times has learnt will take place in Birmingham on June 16.
