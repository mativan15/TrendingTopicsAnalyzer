Covid-19 and related social restrictions became the final nail in the coffin for the nation's oldest medical association, its outgoing chair says. The New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA) will be wound up after members voted to liquidate the 136-year-old organisation on Monday. At its annual general meeting, 380 votes were cast in favour of the motion to liquidate and 66 against. Dr Alistair Humphrey, who has been the association's chairperson for one year, said he knew the main challenge would be to halt declining membership and increase support from younger doctors when he took on the role.
