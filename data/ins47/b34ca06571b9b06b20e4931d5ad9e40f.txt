Apple has announced a new model refresh of its entry-level iPad, which now includes support for USB-C charging and a significant overhaul to the tablet's design.

The 10th-generation iPad Pro features a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with flatter edges, bearing some similarities with the last two generations of the iPad Air or the most recent iPad Mini refresh. Instead of the front camera placed on the top of the display, the latest iPad now moves the camera to the longer side.

The new model also ditches the headphone jack and home button in favor of Touch ID, which you use by pressing the power button on the top-right corner of the tablet — a feature that has been present in the newer iPad Air, Mini, and Pro models.
