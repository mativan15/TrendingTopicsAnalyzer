UConn big man Adama Sanogo came to the United States from Mali about five years ago. He started playing club basketball two years prior and on Tuesday, was named the Big East preseason player of the year.

'With all the great players in the Big East, I'm honored that I was picked as preseason player of the year,' Sanogo said. 'I will try to live up to the honor this season.'

The Huskies are expecting Sanogo, the first UConn player to receive the honor since Rudy Gay in 2005, to improve beyond the nearly 15 points, 9 rebounds and 2 blocks he averaged per game on his way to a first team all-Big East selection in 2021-22.
