Iurii Garmash/iStock via Getty Images I have been following Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) for about ten years. Over that time the oil and gas industry writ large, always volatile, has seen major convulsions that have left it fundamentally changed. MLP's, typically much more stable businesses than their exploration and production brethren, have generally seen less upheaval in their operations but huge upheaval in their shareholder bases. This upheaval has left many MLP stocks at significantly lower valuations despite admirable cash flow growth and improved balance sheets.
