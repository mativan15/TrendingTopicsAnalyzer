MADISON, Wis. — The state Department of Justice has agreed to pay an agency administrator $46,276 to resolve her discrimination complaints. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday that the department signed the settlement with Division of Criminal Investigation Administrator Tina Virgil on May 17. Virgil filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year alleging that she was paid less as chief of the department's law enforcement services division than her predecessor because she's a Black woman.
