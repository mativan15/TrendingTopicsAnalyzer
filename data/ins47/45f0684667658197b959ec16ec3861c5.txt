Bamboo Health, a Louisville-based health tech company that has had significant growth in recent years, is now visible from the side of a major highway.

Bamboo Health was formed out of the merger of Appriss Health and Patient Ping in 2021. Until recently, an 'Appriss' sign adorned the side of its headquarters at 9901 Linn Station Road, but it's recently been changed to reflect the new name.

The contractor on the project was FastSigns. The new sign is visible from Interstate 64.

Bamboo is a health tech company focused on fostering care and collaboration across the continuum of care.
