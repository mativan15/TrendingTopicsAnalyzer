Collider.com CBS has rewarded its top three most-watched new shows of the year with full-season orders. Fire Country, East New York, and So Help Me Todd scored massively impressive viewership numbers, becoming the three most-watched scripted shows not only at CBS but across the major broadcast networks. All three shows recently premiered on the network less than a month ago, with each airing not more than three episodes so far; regardless, their impressive numbers have been enough to convince the brass at CBS that they are deserving of a long-term investment.
