Uttar Pradesh minority affairs minister Dharampal Singh is aware of the controversy that the government's twin surveys of madrasas and waqf properties have kicked up in the most populous state. But while staying clear of contentious issues of lack of funds and madrasa board affiliation being held up, he says that the surveys are 'well intentioned' and 'no good Muslim' is opposing them. During the survey so far, the government says about 6436 unaffiliated, non-aided madrasas have been identified and 5170 of those identified have been surveyed.
