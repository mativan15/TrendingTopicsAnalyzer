BURGER King has just launched a new item on its menu - and it's just in time for the warmer weather. 
 The high street fast food chain is now selling Fanta Lemon and Fanta Strawberry frozen drinks. 
Doesn't the new Fanta Lemon drink look incredible?
Burger King added the new items to its menu earlier this week, announcing them on Twitter.  
Last year, Burger King launched a limited edition Frozen Fanta Strawberry, but it's the first time the lemon version has been available. 
It said: 'Only a month until it's officially summer, and it's already heating up out there.
