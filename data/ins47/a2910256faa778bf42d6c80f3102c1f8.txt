Pakistan's election commission on Friday disqualified former Prime Minister Imran Khan from completing his current term in Parliament, escalating the political showdown between the country's ruling establishment and its former leader and raising the possibility of mass unrest.

The commission found him guilty of illegally selling gifts given to him by other countries when he was prime minister and concealing the profits from the authorities, according to Azam Nazeer Tarar, the country's justice minister.
