Oct. 19—TOWN OF NIAGARA — The town board tabled a resolution at its meeting Tuesday night that called for setting a public hearing on a proposed expansion of the Covanta Environmental Solutions facility on Quarry Road.

"We caught wind of the fact that there was some opposition to (the proposed expansion)," Town Supervisor Lee Wallace said. "The DEC (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation) doesn't seem to have a problem with (the expansion), and we (the town board) don't necessarily (oppose it), but we want to be completely above board and transparent about this process.
