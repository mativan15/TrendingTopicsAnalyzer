(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Anil and Sunil Varanasi could have done whatever they wanted.

For fun they hacked into their Xbox to make it do their bidding, and built and sold custom PCs. Once in college at George Mason University, the Varanasis thrived in classes ranging from biochemistry to economics to computer engineering. They seemed set for a bright future in a buzzy field such as cryptocurrency or smartphone-enabled food delivery.
