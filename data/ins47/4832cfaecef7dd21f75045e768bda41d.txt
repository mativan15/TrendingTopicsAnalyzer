LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - The British pound edged higher against a faltering U.S. dollar on Monday and was set for its first monthly gain in five as the risk-sensitive currency benefited from improving sentiment.

As markets have readjusted their rate hike expectations from the Federal Reserve lower, the dollar index has weakened over 3.5% from its mid-May peak. This helped lift sterling after it reached its lowest level since March 2020 earlier in the month.

"The rebound in GBPUSD largely reflects USD depreciation," said Vasileios Gkionakis, EMEA head of CitiFX G10 strategy, who remains bearish on sterling against the euro and commodity FX, citing weakening growth, depleting household savings, absence of meaningful fiscal stimulus and a likely resurfacing of Northern Ireland protocol-related headlines.
