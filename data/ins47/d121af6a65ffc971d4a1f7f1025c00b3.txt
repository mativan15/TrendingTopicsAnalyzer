Since tastytrade became part of IG Group in June 2021, the Company's focus has been on integration which has gone very well, with successful cross pollination and synergies created across the business including tech and marketing. With integration materially complete, co-founder Kristi Ross has decided to move to a strategic advisory role and step back from day-to-day responsibilities at tastytrade and IG, from 1 July 2022.
