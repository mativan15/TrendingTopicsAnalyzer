Virologists said they were left shocked after viral social media posts from an influencer and farm owner showed her cuddling TikTok's most famous emu, lovingly called Emmanuel Todd Lopez, after it contracted avian flu.Experts are warning US farmers to cease cuddling and coming in close contact with infected birds, saying it could be 'extremely dangerous'.One expert has said this was 'no different than exposure to bird flu from a bird market or wet market anywhere in the world'.The warnings have come after an outpouring of sorrow and support for Taylor Blake, an influencer, whose family-owned bird farm in Florida, Knuckle Bump Farms, came under attack from the disease and led to the deaths of 50 birds.
