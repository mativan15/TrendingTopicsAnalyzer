TIJUANA, Mexico – Baby formula can be easily found south of the U.S. despite the shortage, parents in a Mexican border town told Fox News. "Well, right now, when I got the formula, I've seen two, three people getting formula from the other side," Jorge, of Tijuana, said. "They have it everywhere at the pharmacies, any store."As the United States deals with a baby formula shortage due to a recall and pandemic-related supply chain issues, some Americans told Fox News they're purchasing baby formula from Mexico.
