One of the countries that have always fascinated me has been China. I made my first trip to China in the early 1990s and have gone on many business trips to various cities in China over the last 30 years. It has a rich and complex history, and its people, culture, and food are mysterious to many outside Asian cultures. One of China's architectural wonders is the Great Wall of China. On two business trips to Beijing, I took an afternoon off and went to the closest entry gate to the Wall from Beijing, called Badaling.
