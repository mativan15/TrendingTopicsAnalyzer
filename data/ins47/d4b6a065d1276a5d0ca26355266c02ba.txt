Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale expressed his 'elation' after his side held on to win 1-0 at Leeds and extend their lead at the top of the Premier League.

Man-of-the-match Ramsdale put his body on the line as the Gunners came through a chaotic match at Elland Road with all three points after Bukayo Saka's emphatic first-half finish.

Ramsdale pulled off a string of decisive saves to keep Leeds at bay and ensure a ninth win from 10 league games this season for Mikel Arteta's side, leaving them four points clear of Manchester City and Tottenham at the top of the table.
