Q A London estate agent is requiring that I undertake 'financial verification' with their nominated broker before I can view a flat with them.They say their broker is independent of them, and won't pass my data back to them. However I feel uncomfortable that I would have to give any financial data to a third party at their request, and before I even have any intention of entering into a transaction. I explained this to them but they maintain I have no choice if I want a viewing.I'm not trying to buy a multimillion-pound mansion, just a small ex-local-authority one-bed flat.
