SAN FRANCISCO — The Warriors have said they would like to move on from the now infamous practice punch Draymond Green landed on Jordan Poole earlier this month. But the controversy remains a topic of discussion, in part, by Green's doing. 
Green's self-produced mini-documentary on TNT, released shortly before the season opener Tuesday, reignited conversations about the mid-practice fight. 
In the segment, Green, who gave TNT behind-the-scenes access to his preseason, discussed what it was like for him to see one of his 'worst moments' go viral.
