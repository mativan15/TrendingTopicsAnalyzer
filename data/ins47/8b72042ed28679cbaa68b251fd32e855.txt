High: 93 Low: 71. 📢 I'm looking for business owners and marketers in Savannah who want to build awareness, connect with customers and increase sales. I have a limited number of sponsorships available to introduce our Savannah Daily readers to local businesses they need to know about. If that's you, then I invite you to learn more and secure your spot now.
