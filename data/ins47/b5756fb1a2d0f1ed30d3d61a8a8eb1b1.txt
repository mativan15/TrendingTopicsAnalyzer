Published: 00:29 EDT, 22 October 2022 | Updated: 01:09 EDT, 22 October 2022 Rishi Sunak is believed to have become the first Conservative leadership candidate to secure the backing of 100 MPs, shoring up sufficient support to be on the ballot for Monday's vote. On Friday night the former chancellor's supporters said he had amassed the necessary numbers to reach the threshold, way ahead of the deadline. Boris Johnson was lagging behind, as was Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt who became the first to confirm her candidacy to replace Liz Truss as Prime Minister.
