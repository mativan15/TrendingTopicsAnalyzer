Work marketplace Upwork announced the launch of Upwork Academy, an educational hub designed to help professionals build their independent businesses.  The Great Resignation has seen many Americans leaving traditional jobs in favor of positions that allow them to work remotely. According to CNBC, the trend of workers quitting their jobs isn't likely to end soon, with some experts predicting the end of job loyalty. In a recent study by Microsoft, a surprising 52% of Gen Z and millennial workers said they were likely to consider switching jobs this year, a 3% increase from 2021.
