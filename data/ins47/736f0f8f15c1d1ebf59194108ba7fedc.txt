(RTTNews) - Asian stocks ended mixed on Wednesday after a private survey showed China's factory activity shrank less sharply in May than expected. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI rose to 48.1 in May from a 26-month low of 46.0 the previous month. Manufacturing expansion slowed in Australia and Japan's manufacturing activity grew at the weakest pace in three months, underlining investor worries over the economic slowdown. A firmer dollar and higher Treasury yields weighed on gold prices, while oil prices rose over 1 percent in Asian trade on expectations of firmer fuel demand from China.
