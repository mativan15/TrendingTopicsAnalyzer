With Saturday night's thrilling win over the Gators, Brian Kelly becomes the first coach to ever lead the Tigers to road wins against Auburn and Florida in the same season.

LSU made its first road trip of the season to Auburn to face another team of Tigers, and although it only had five passing yards in the second half, it came away with a 21-17 win thanks to tremendous plays on defense.

On Saturday, LSU traveled to Gainesville to take on the Gators, and it was the polar opposite of the Auburn game.
