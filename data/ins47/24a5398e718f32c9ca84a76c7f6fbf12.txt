Global superstars BTS gave a free 'Yet to Come in Busan' concert in Busan, South Korea, Saturday night, lending their star power to the port city's bid to host the World Expo in 2030,

The seven members of BTS delivered a performance that was equal parts reunion, delayed homecoming and civil service as entertainment for the 100,000 fans from around the world who city officials expected to make the journey for the concert and adjacent events. The 'sold out' Busan Asiad Main Stadium has a 50,000-person capacity, with an additional 12,000 spots to see the show's live stream on massive screens at Busan Port and Haeundae Beach.
