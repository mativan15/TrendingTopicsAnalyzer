For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 12% in three years, versus a market return of about 26%. It's down 15% in about a month. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 9.2% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.
