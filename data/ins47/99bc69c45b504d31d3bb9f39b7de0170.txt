'His Majesty the Tree! ' Colonel David Waterman, standing on the front gallery of the Hall, took off his hat with a flourish toward the live-oak.'His Majesty the Tree!' echoed Young David at the colonel's elbow, with a sweep of his battered straw hat, and a bow which was an exact imitation of his father's.James, older by two years than his brother David, kept his eyes glued to the geography open upon his knee.The Hall stood at the extreme east end of the straggling little Southern town; it had a dignified air, the oldfashioned white mansion, with its ample front and back galleries, its wide middle hall whose doors were set ever hospitably open, its sloping roof and arcaded wings, and its enormous outside chimneys, climbing like red-brick towers up either end.
