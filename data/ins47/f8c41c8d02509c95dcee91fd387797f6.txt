If you want to know who really controls Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 55% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

And institutional investors saw their holdings value drop by 6.0% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 18% for shareholders.
