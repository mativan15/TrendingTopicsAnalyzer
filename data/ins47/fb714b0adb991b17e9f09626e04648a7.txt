By Denny Jacob Amprius Technologies Inc. shares fell 13%, to $9.54, a day after the company said it was awarded a $50 million cost-sharing grant from the U.S. Energy Department's Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains. The lithium-ion-batteries manufacturer said it is among the first set of companies to receive funding from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aims to expand domestic manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and the electrical grid. "We are working to scale production capabilities to meet significant domestic demand and to accelerate the electrification of mobility," said Chief Executive Kang Sun.
