Daniel Craig just got one step closer to becoming a real-life James Bond thanks to Princess Anne.In January, Queen Elizabeth bestowed the actor with the privilege of receiving the same honorific as that fictional master spy, making him a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. However, the monarch wasn't able to hold an investiture ceremony for Craig prior to her death, so it was left to her daughter Princess Anne to impart the title. The ceremony was held at Windsor Castle on Tuesday and announced on the royal family's official social media pages.
