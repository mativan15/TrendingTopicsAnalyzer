Andreas Rentz Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) sank after releasing earnings results that showed it was not immune to macro headwinds. While the company's growth rate and free cash flow were still solid, investors may have been spooked by near term guidance and the implicit retraction of long term guidance. The stock price weakness is a buying opportunity for long term investors, as PLTR remains a compelling investment on the use of artificial intelligence to maximize the value of data. Trading at just 9x forward sales, PLTR is a strong buy.
