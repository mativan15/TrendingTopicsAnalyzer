'We've made it clear we will be finding savings – definitely you'll see stage one of the audit into waste and roads, you'll see the results of that [in the budget],' she said.Loading'But we also said it will be delivering on our election commitments, helping with cost of living pressures where we can do that without adding to inflation.'Neither minister would reveal how much the government will save from axed grants or programs ahead of the budget, King said the commuter car park fund will not continue, and there was 'a big mess' in the regional grants programs.
