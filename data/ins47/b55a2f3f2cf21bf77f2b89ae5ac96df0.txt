Things are looking up for the travel industry, especially in Florida, according to a recent study.

Released Oct. 17 by the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), the study indicates that leisure travel revenue jumped 14% in the U.S. in 2022, compared to 2019, while business travel revenue inched up 1%.

According to the association, which advocates for the nation's lodging industry, a full "post-pandemic" revenue recovery for hotels will likely take several more years. It reviewed revenue metrics for all 50 states and added that 2022 projections were not adjusted for inflation.
