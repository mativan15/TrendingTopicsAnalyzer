Targeting Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav over his 'gobar' remarks, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said it's an irony that the leader of opposition smells odour in cow dung which is considered as a form of Goddess Lakshmi. During the discussion on the budget in the state assembly, Yadav on Monday had said that Kannauj, which is famous for "ittar' (perfume), needs a perfume park instead of a 'gobar' plant. In his speech in the assembly on Tuesday, the chief minister said had he (Yadav) done 'puja', he would not have said so.
