In his new position as reigning monarch of the U.K., King Charles III may be getting ready to change things up. According to a source at the Daily Mail, the royal has reportedly decided not to move to Buckingham Palace, a move that was previously reported as fact given the residence's title as the monarch's official home.

Per the source, the palace will become the King's 'operational headquarters' as he continues to live with Queen Consort Camilla in Clarence House, their official residence since 2003.
