Keisha Castle-Hughes as Hana in FBI: Most Wanted

Warning: spoilers ahead for the fifth episode of FBI: Most Wanted Season 4, called 'Chains.'

FBI: Most Wanted put Hana through the wringer (and back again) in 'Chains,' after her attempt to help a young girl resulted in her being kidnapped by some very bad people. While the rest of the Task Force frantically tried to find help in locating her , Hana managed to overcome a blow to the head, repeated drugging, and chains to not only escape her captors, but also rescue a sexually abused 12-year-old girl and infant.
