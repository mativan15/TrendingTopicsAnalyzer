Alligators exposed to 'forever chemicals' in North Carolina's Cape Fear River may be experiencing adverse clinical and autoimmune effects, a new study has found.

In addition to showing genetic indicators for immune system impacts, the animals had many unhealed or infected lesions, according to the study, published on Thursday in Frontiers in Toxicology.

'Alligators rarely suffer from infections,' Scott Belcher, an associate professor of biology at North Carolina State University, said in a statement.
