The last time the Celtics took to the parquet for an NBA game that counted was Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals on June 16. They watched as the Golden State Warriors won a championship on their hallowed hardwood and celebrated in their building. On this night, 3,095 miles to the west, the Warriors received their championship rings. Still stung by that defeat, the Celtics rang the bell of a fellow contender, the 76ers. Message sent.The tone was set by Tatum and Brown, who combined to shoot 27 of 44 from the field, and became the first pair of teammates to each score 35-plus points in a season opener since Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West did it for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1969.
