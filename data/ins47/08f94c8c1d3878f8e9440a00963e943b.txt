There are 12 games on the NHL slate for Thursday and lots of options for bettors to go with.

The pregame narrative: High-scoring games have been a theme for the Boston Bruins and we don't expect that to change against the Anaheim Ducks. We also like the Vegas Golden Knights at home against the Winnipeg Jets and Tyler Toffoli to score a point against the Buffalo Sabres.

Check out our top NHL picks for October 20 below.

Odds as of 12:06 p.m. on 10/20/2022.
