The Archbishop of Canterbury has now weighed in on the Prime Minister's use of trickle-down economics. This economic theory sees the wealthy receive economic help in order for the poorer to be benefitted by investments from the rich which in theory opens more jobs and opportunities.Justin Welby told The Guardian that he is 'deeply sceptical' of Liz Truss' use of the economic policy as Brits tackle the cost-of-living crisis.While on a visit to Australia, the Archbishop said that the economic policy would see the wealthy save their money while the those in need continue to struggle without sufficient Government help.
