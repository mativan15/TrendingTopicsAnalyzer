I recently realized that many of the things I do to protect the planet also save me money. I've been doing these things for years, starting in my first year of college.Back then, I took an environmental science class. It was the first time I heard terms like "zero population growth" and "acid rain." My college boyfriend majored in environmental science, and since we lived together, I also learned more about the need to recycle, reuse, repurpose, compost, and cut down on overall waste. All of this happened in the mid to late '80s.
