Police and BC Crime Stoppers are raising the alarm about resurgent phone scams that target seniors.
Metro Vancouver Crime Stoppers Executive Director Linda Annis told Global News, there have been around 20 recent cases of this type of fraud in Vancouver.'Seniors will get a call that their grandson or granddaughter has been involved in a serious car accident and they need some bail money, quickly,'  Annis said.'The person will offer to handle the payment on their behalf. The seniors are also told not to tell anybody because if they do their grandchild will be in even more trouble.
