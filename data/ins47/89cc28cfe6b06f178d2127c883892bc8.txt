Trinamool Congres MP Mahua Moitra on Saturday took a dig at the Centre after India was ranked 107 out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2022. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan of 'na khaunga, na khane dunga' (would not take bribes, nor let anyone do so), Moitra tweeted, 'Quite literally Modiji's slogan has ensured India ranks 107/122 in Global Hunger Index.'


 In another tweet, the TMC's firebrand MP said, 'India at 107/122 countries in 2022 global hunger index. Messrs Modi & Shah - all our neighbours who you so lovingly call termites & ‘ghoospetias' are doing better than us ! Well done!'









 India ranked 107 out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2022, much behind its South Asia neighbours, with the child wasting rate at 19.
