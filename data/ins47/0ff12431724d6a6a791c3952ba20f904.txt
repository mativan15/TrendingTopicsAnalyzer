Kolkata: Three deaths by suicide in Kolkata – of a budding television actor on May 12, an aspiring model on May 25 and another aspiring model and a friend of the second woman on May 27 -- have led veterans in the Bengali movie industry to believe that the victims sank into depression for various reasons, including professional uncertainties and relationship woes. All three women were in their early 20s. Their bodies were found hanging. A common factor that binds them is that they were born into middle-class families in the suburbs and moved to the city to pursue careers with no formal training.
