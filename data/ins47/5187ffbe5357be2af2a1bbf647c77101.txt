Rihanna, the Grammy-award singer, is expanding her lingerie store to the Midwest and plans to open her first Chicago-area store next year.

Savage X Fenty signed a lease to occupy 3,500 square feet at Orland Square mall, located at 288 Orland Square Dr. in Orland Park, Illinois.

Fenty is Rihanna's last name. She also owns beauty companies Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin.

The store is slated to open mid-2023, Christiane Pendarvis, co-president and chief merchandising officer for Savage X Fenty, told the Chicago Business Journal.
