If you want to know who really controls CWC Energy Services Corp. (CVE:CWC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

CWC Energy Services is a smaller company with a market capitalization of CA$153m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
