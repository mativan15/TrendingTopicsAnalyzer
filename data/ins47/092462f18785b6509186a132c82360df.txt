Pakistan is off the ‘grey list' of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) after four years, a development that has been welcomed across the country.
What does that mean? Let's start with FATF.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is commonly referred to as the world's 'terrorism financing watchdog', which means it is the author — and custodian — of an international regime that works to ensure that the flows of money in the global financial system are not misused to fund terrorist activities.
FATF describes itself as an inter-governmental body that works to 'set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system'.
