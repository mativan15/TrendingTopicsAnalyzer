Jennifer Hale, the voice actress behind Bayonetta in the upcoming Bayonetta 3, has issued a statement about the situation surrounding the character's previous voice actress, Hellena Taylor, and her claims of being underpaid to reprise her role.
Controversy exploded over the weekend when Bayonetta's original voice actor, Hellena Taylor, went to Twitter and claimed how Bayonetta 3 developer PlatinumGames only offered her a $4,000 flat rate to work on the entire game. She urged fans to boycott the game as well.
