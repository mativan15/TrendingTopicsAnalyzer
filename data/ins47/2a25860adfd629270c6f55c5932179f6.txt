The game that sent Tim Curry into space will soon no longer have an online mode as EA shuts down a number of games from the late 2000s.
If you want to play a retro game from the 80s or 90s all you have to do is get hold of the cartridge and stick it in the console, but for more recent games it's not as simple as that. Online features were commonplace by the mid-2000s and yet most publishers aren't keen to pay the money to keep them running.
As a result, it's now a standard part of a game's life cycle that it gets its online features switched off after a decade or so, with Ubisoft and EA, in particular, always seeming keen to drop support as soon as possible.
