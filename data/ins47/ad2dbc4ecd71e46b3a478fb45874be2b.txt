Pgiam/iStock via Getty Images Stock index futures are higher Thursday after two losing sessions. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) +0.6%, S&P futures (SPX) +0.4% and Dow futures (INDU) +0.4% are gaining. The market finished in the red yesterday, although off the lows of the day, with some jitters after JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of an economic hurricane. But JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic isn't on board with his boss' assesment, saying that there will be no recession and the late-May stock rally will be echoed in strength later this year.
