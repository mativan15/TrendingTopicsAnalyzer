All around the world, the rate of digitalisation has accelerated, shaping societies and ushering in a new economic paradigm with significant ramifications for the future of work and employment. The way people live, work, and spend money has shifted radically in the last decade, owing in large part to advances in technology and the gig economy. Primarily gig economy is composed of three fundamental elements: one, independent job seekers who are paid as per the gig (i.e., a task or a project), as compared to employees who are compensated on an hourly basis or salary; second, consumers who require a specific service and third, enterprises that connect the gig workforce to the end consumer, such as digital-first technology platforms.
