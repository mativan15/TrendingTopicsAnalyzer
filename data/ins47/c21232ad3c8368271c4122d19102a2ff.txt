It's not possible to invest over long periods without making some bad investments. But really bad investments should be rare. So spare a thought for the long term shareholders of On the Beach Group plc (LON:OTB); the share price is down a whopping 76% in the last three years. That'd be enough to cause even the strongest minds some disquiet. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 69% lower in that time. Even worse, it's down 23% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.
