My Search. My Business. 'I simply tired of seeing only what big tech thought I wanted to see, and it's getting worse. Now, big tech is capitalizing on its patron's privacy rights by compiling their search behavior via cookies and selling it to advertisers and government.' - Steve Marshall, Founder of SearchRockit.com SAN JOSE, Calif. (PRWEB) June 02, 2022 SearchRockit™ accesses information beyond big tech by adding over 1.2 Billion Unique URL's including images and videos. The search engine is powered by Gibiru™ - and uses Wormhole Technology™ a system that modifies big tech's search algorithm, that not only eliminates cookie trackers they install on its users' computers, but also allows customers to conduct queries without being subjected to the 'personalization' major search engines insist on.
