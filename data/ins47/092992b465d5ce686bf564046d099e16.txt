CAPE MAY, NJ — Montreal Beach Resort is literally going to the dogs. A beloved local tradition, the resort's Doggie Day Pool Pawty returns on Oct. 30, from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m., after a pandemic break."Years ago, after uneventfully closing their pool each season, the owners decided that it would be fun for one day a year to let the pups jump in for a dip," the resort said in a press release. Over the years, it's turned into a community tradition that raises money for Animal Outreach of Cape May.Madison Resorts and new owner Dan Alicea say they want to bring back the event and carry on the tradition.
