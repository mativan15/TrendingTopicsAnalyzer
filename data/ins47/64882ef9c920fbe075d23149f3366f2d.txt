Gloria Gaynor and Mario Cantone were both voted off "The Masked Singer" on Wednesday night's episode, but both are walking away with nothing but positive memories and a sense of gratitude for having been on the show. Wednesday night was Andrew Lloyd Weber night, with the famed Broadway producer joining the judges panel and all contestants singing songs from his many successful musicals like "Any Dream Will Do" from "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," "Bad Cinderella" from "Bad Cinderella" and "Heaven on Their Minds" from "Jesus Christ Superstar.
