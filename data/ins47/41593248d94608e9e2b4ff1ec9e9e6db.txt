Jonathan Kitchen The last time I covered Tekla Healthcare Investors (NYSE:HQH) more than six months ago, the stock was trading around a price of $20. The price moved beyond $22 within a month, and then started falling, and is currently trading below $18. I recommended a buy, due to its strong and steady yields, which was well supported by its earnings. The yield that time was 8.8 percent, and was also the same for the past five years. I opined that income seeking investors would be delighted to hold this fund for the long term and would enjoy the quarterly incomes.
