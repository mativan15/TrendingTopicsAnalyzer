Animal Rebellion activists have disrupted Trooping the Colour. 
The demonstrators vaulted the fences near Buckingham Palace and got on to the mall with placards saying ‘plant-based future', before being tackled by police.
The vegan activists accused the monarchy of having a ‘Royal disregard for all life', as they called for rewilding of Royal land. 
Around 25 activists were planning to interrupt the procession this morning, in an effort to draw attention to the climate crisis during the Queen's Platinum Jubilee.
