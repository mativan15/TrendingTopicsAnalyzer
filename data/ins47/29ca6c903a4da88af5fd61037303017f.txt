Ohio State needs $13 million through name, image and likeness deals to maintain its football roster beyond next season.That's the eight-figure estimate coach Ryan Day provided to about 100 businesspeople at an NIL event held at the Covelli Center Thursday.His comments were reported by Cleveland.com after he spoke as part of a panel that included athletic director Gene Smith and senior associate athletic director Carey Hoyt, who oversees the school's NIL administration.Opportunities for players to make money through NIL opportunities are seen as one of the leading factors behind the sharp increase in transfers throughout the sport this offseason.
