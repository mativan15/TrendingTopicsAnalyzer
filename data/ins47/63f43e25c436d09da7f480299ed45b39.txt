Mukesh Ambani-owned and US buyout firm Apollo Global Management are moving ahead to make a firm offer for Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's international chemist and drugstore units, known as Boots, said people in the know. Their binding bid could come in as early as Friday, they said. ET was the first to report in its April 27 edition that and Apollo are teaming up for Boots. The Reliance-Apollo combination's chances have improved in recent weeks, said people involved in the transaction, after Bloomberg reported on May 26 that a competing consortium backed by billionaire Issa brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who run a supermarket group Asda, and TDR Capital baulked at a request by Walgreens to increase their offer for the Boots drugstore chain, one of Britain's best known retailers, and were planning to walk away from the competitive race.
