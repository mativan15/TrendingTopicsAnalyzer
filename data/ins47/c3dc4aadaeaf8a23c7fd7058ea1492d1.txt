Jun. 2—ANDERSON — The Indiana Public Access Counselor has ruled Madison County was in violation of the state's open door law concerning the American Rescue Plan funding.

Public Access Counselor Luke Britt issued an advisory opinion on a complaint filed by local resident Sean Smith in March.

The complaint by Smith was filed shortly after the Madison County Commissioners approved without public comment spending $3 million of the $25.1 million in American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding.

The county is expected to start the review process this month for the next round of ARP funding requests.
