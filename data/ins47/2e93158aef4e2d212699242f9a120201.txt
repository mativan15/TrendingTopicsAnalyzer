Gun violence good for business and Congress

As long as we allow the NRA and gun lobby to finance members of Congress, we will never see the end to angels and heroes being slaughtered. These people in Congress who are supposed to safeguard us from terror care more about their pocketbooks than they do about the people that sent them to Washington.

When more than three-quarters of the country wants meaningful weapon legislation and members of Congress ignore them so they can continue to line their pockets, we will continue to have slaughters of children and those who try to protect them.
