Elon Musk told Tesla executives to pause all hiring worldwide because he had a "super bad feeling" about the economy and needed to cut 10% of the company's workforce, Reuters reported. Tesla's annual SEC filing indicated that the company employed almost 100,000 people at the end of last year, which means thousands of jobs could be axed. Musk's comments came two days after he sent a memo to all Tesla employees to return to the office or resign. He titled his first email "remote work is no longer acceptble" and appeared to address it to executive staff only, Electrek reported.
