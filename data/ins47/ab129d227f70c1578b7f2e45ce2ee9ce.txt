New Delhi: Food and grocery delivery platform Swiggy has emerged as one of the possible contenders for the India operations of German wholesale retailer Metro AG, said executives with knowledge of the matter. Thailand's CP Group and Reliance Retail are the other two likely candidates for a possible acquisition of Metro Cash & Carry at the moment, they said. 'Swiggy has evinced interest in the acquisition, and a potential deal will enable Metro Cash & Carry's wholesale stores to feed Swiggy's Instamart delivery model,' one of the executives said.
