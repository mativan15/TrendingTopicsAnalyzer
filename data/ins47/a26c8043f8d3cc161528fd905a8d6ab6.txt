Peer-to-peer car sharing company Turo is expanding to New York State and France in June, the company said on Wednesday. The expansion comes at a time when post/mid-Covid tourism is beginning to heat up, but renting a car will be difficult and expensive due to ongoing semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues.
Turo's launch in New York follows the state legislature's passing of SB 6715 in December 2021, a law that provides a regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car sharing operations in the state.
