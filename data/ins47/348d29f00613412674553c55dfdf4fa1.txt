Netflix has vowed to start cracking down on password-sharers who let others log in to their account.
The streaming giant has indicated it will start charging users who share their password beyond their household an additional monthly fee.
Although Netflix has been warning about introducing measures to clamp down on password sharers for months, it seems like things are about to get serious.
The firm said during a quarterly earnings call on Tuesday it was considering ‘monetizing account sharing' from early next year.
