LeBron James is officially a billionaire. The Los Angeles Lakers star is worth an estimated $1 billion, according to Forbes, which makes him the first active NBA player to join the billionaire club.

The only other basketball player to be worth seven figures is Michael Jordan, who earned that moniker 11 years after he retired when his stake in the Charlotte Hornets increased to 89.5 percent in 2014.

While James has earned more than $385 million in pretax salary during his 19-year NBA career, per Forbes, he accrued most of his wealth off the court through some savvy business moves over the past few years.
