James Harden looks forward to having a fresh start on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics will battle it out for their 2022-2023 season opener. It will mark the first matchup James Harden will begin a full season with the Sixers.

Last year, Harden joined the 76ers via trade. In a February blockbuster, the Brooklyn Nets swapped out Harden for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, and Andre Drummond. The Sixers became the third franchise Harden would play for in a matter of fewer than two years.
