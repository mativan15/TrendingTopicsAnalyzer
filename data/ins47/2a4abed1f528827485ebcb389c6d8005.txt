Say cheese! 
That's exactly what Jets rookie cornerback Sauce Gardner did by donning a cheesehead in celebration of the his team's 27-10 win over the Packers on Sunday at Lambeau Field. And it didn't seem to initially sit well with Green Bay's Allen Lazard. The receiver knocked the franchise's signature cheesehead off Gardner's head as he made his way into the tunnel.

Gardner, who turned in another outstanding performance, had been posing and soaking in the statement win while getting cheered from traveling Jets fans and booed from the Packers faithful before Lazard chased him down, as seen in a Twitter video from NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.
