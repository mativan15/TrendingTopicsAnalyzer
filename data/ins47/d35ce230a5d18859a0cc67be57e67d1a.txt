primeimages/iStock via Getty Images Wall Street succumbed to lingering worries about the economy on Wednesday, with the major averages finishing solidly in negative territory. Stocks retreated early in the day but cut their losses during the afternoon. Pessimistic comments from JPMorgan's CEO contributed to the decline, with financial stocks suffering the brunt of the skepticism. This also put pressure on cryptocurrencies, sparking a double-digit percentage decline in Coinbase (COIN). Lithium-related stocks also participated in the retreat.
