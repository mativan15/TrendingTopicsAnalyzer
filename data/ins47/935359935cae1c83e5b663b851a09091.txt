It is a tough time for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) investors. The company is being hit from multiple fronts and, as a result, the stock is stuck in a rut. However, the underlying fundamentals remain compelling, which is why the momentary blip is not a cause for concern.

For the third quarter, the electric vehicle manufacturer reported $1.05 in adjusted earnings per share on revenue of $21.45 billion. While earnings beat analysts' estimates, revenue came up short. The company said it is working at a "smoother delivery pace" as it hopes to increase production of its electric cars.
