Aughinish Alumina has availed of special legal measures to delay filing annual accounts amid questions over the outlook for the business because of rising gas prices and international sanctions against Russian aluminium interests.The Russian-controlled business employs more than 400 staff in Co Limerick, refining imported bauxite into alumina which is shipped to France and Sweden and smelted to make aluminium.As a major supplier to European industry, Aughinish has so far avoided EU sanctions linked to Russia's war on Ukraine.
