Great British Bake Off star Candice Brown has spoken about the importance of kindness as she opens up about her mental health.
The professional chef, who won the 2016 series of the acclaimed show, runs a pub with her brother in Eversholt, where she can be found changing kegs and cleaning up as well as running things in the kitchen.
Speaking to Metro.co.uk as part of the launch of the Heineken Green Pubs guide, Candice spoke candidly about the joy – and struggles – of being a pub landlord, as well as how important it is to look after your mental health.
