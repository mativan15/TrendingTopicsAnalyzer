 Statistics Canada is expected to release September inflation numbers Wednesday morning.
In August, Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 7.0 per cent, largely driven by the price of gasoline falling, but the cost of groceries continued to climb.RBC expects the annual inflation rate to come in at 6.7 per cent for September.At the same time, the bank says core measures of inflation, which are less volatile, are unlikely to decline because of strong demand for services in the economy.
