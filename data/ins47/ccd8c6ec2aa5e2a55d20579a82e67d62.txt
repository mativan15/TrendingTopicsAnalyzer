Barangaroo is a symbol of squandered opportunities to make a better Sydney. I was part of the winning team – Hill Thalis Architecture + Urban Projects, Jane Irwin Landscape Architecture and Paul Berkemeier Architect – for the 2005-6 international competition for this 22 hectares of publicly owned foreshore, a 1.2km-long stretch of the city centre's harbour front. Of 137 entrants, this scheme was unanimously selected by the NSW government-appointed jury.The foundation of our plan was that the entire foreshore – 50 per cent of the site – be transformed into a continuous and inalienable public park.
