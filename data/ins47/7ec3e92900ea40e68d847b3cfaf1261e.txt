Atlassian has warned users of its Confluence collaboration tool that they should either restrict internet access to the software, or disable it, in light of a critical-rated unauthenticated remote-code-execution flaw in the product that is actively under attack.
An advisory dated June 2, 1300 PT (2000 UTC), does not describe the nature of the flaw, and reveals "current active exploitation" has been detected. No patch is available.
The flaw is present in version 7.18 of Confluence Server, which is under attack, as well as potentially versions 7.
