AppleSoon, sellers using Square's Point of Sale app can accept payments with only an iPhone. The mobile payment company has announced that it's working with Apple to enable the feature within its application and will launch the service to the public later this year. It will provide sellers with an easy-to-use payment solution, since they'll no longer need to use Square's add-on devices and terminals. All customers need to do is to tap their credit cards, debit cards or phones with digital wallets such as Apple Pay on the seller's iPhone.
