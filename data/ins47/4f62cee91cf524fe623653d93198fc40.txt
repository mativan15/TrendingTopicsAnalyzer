Tech investor Paul Meeks identified the FAANG stock he would currently stay away from despite the recent rout in the broader sector, saying parts of the company's business "could be in some trouble." That company is e-commerce giant Amazon , whose shares have dropped more than 30% so far this year, as of the Thursday close. "In the United States, e-commerce revenues have slowed down as an industry and right during the same time over the last couple of years, Amazon has added 800,000 employees," Meeks, portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management, told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Thursday.
