Pond Technologies (OTCQB:PNDHF) has received a $350,000 milestone payment under its contract with a major undisclosed Fortune 500 Oil and Gas company signed in August 2021. The company met the milestone after it extracted recombinant proteins from algae that performed on par or better than conventional proteins in a lateral flow diagnostic test. Lateral flow tests in August 2022 showed that Pond's algae-based recombinant proteins were able to test for COVID antibodies and were more reactive than conventionally manufactured proteins.
