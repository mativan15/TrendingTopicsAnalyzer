Published: 02:03 EDT, 1 June 2022 | Updated: 02:03 EDT, 1 June 2022 June 1 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed Freedom Holding Corp , a financial services firm focused on East Europe and Central Asia, will sell its Russian arm to the company's founder Timur Turlov in the second quarter. Relations between Moscow and the West have worsened markedly since Feb. 24 when Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what the Kremlin calls "a special military operation." The move prompted unprecedented western sanctions that hammered Russia's financial markets and the economy.
