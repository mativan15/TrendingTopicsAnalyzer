A Philadelphia man was arrested on murder charges for allegedly stabbing his boyfriend to death nearly three years ago, then withdrawing money from the victim's trust fund and taking over his social media accounts to make it look like he was still alive.

Keshaun Sheffield, 20, was arrested Wednesday and charged with first-degree murder, third-degree murder, theft, receiving stolen property, and other crimes, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele announced.

Sheffield was in a relationship with the victim, 22-year-old Rashid Young, for roughly two years before the murder on Aug.
