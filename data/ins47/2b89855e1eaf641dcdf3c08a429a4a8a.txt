Apple today announced an updated iPad Pro and a redesigned entry-level iPad.

Cupertino talked up the new iPad and iPad Pro models alongside a third-generation Apple TV 4K that supports HDR10+ and sports an Apple-designed A15 Bionic processor, a step up from the previous gen's A12.

The revised iPad Pro, likewise, is an update to last year's model, opting for pretty much identical hardware with an updated M2 system-on-chip and a new Apple Pencil "hover" feature that previews marks on the screen before the stylus makes contact.
