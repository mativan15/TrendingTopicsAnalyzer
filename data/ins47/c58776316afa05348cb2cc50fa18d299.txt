Shares of Novavax Inc. NVAX, -24.73% tumbled 22.9% in trading on Friday after the Food and Drug Administration published a report that detailed the agency's assessment of the clinical data for the company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. There were at least four instances of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation, in the clinical-trial participants. "If causally associated, the risk of myocarditis following NVX-CoV2373 could be higher than reported during post-authorization use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines," the FDA said.
