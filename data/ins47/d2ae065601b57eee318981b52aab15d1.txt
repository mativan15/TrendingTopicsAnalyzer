Matthew Perry has revealed he was turned down by Jennifer Aniston years before Friends and was still harbouring feelings for her during the 90s sitcom.
The 53-year-old actor portrayed Chandler Bing, who ends up marrying Monica Gellar (Courteney Cox) in the long-running series, while Jennifer played fashion-obsessed Rachel Green.
But before being cast in the series created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, Matthew revealed he had previously encountered The Morning Show star and asked her out on a date.
