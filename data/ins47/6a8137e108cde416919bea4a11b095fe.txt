Here's another sign of possibly waning Democratic momentum with the midterm elections just 19 days away: The Republican Party's edge in the generic ballot has reached its highest level in about four months.The generic ballot refers to a poll question that asks voters which party they would support in a congressional election without naming individual candidates. Analysts tend to see it as a useful indicator. Republicans are scoring 47.9% support in a RealClearPolitics average of generic ballots as of Thursday, with Democrats behind by 3 percentage points at 44.
