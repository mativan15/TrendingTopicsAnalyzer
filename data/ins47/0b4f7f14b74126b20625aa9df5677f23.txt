We Are/DigitalVision via Getty Images Sixth Street Specialty Lending Inc. (NYSE:TSLX) is a high-quality business development firm with a well-covered base dividend. The BDC has a defensive investment portfolio that is primarily made up of high-quality, highly secured loans that are mostly floating rate, which means that Sixth Street Specialty's portfolio income will increase if interest rates rise. TSLX is a buy because of its floating rate exposure (inflation protection), high yield, and special dividend potential.
