Shanna Moakler has had her fair share to say about ex Travis Barker's relationship with his new wife Kourtney Kardashian. The mother of his two kids - Landon, 18, and Alabama, 16 - has now announced she plans to rid herself of the engagement ring her former lover gave her. Shanna, 47, dated the Blink-182 star, 46, between 2004 and 2008 and seemingly wants to distance herself for unnecessary sentimental items. Speaking to US Weekly, the model said: "That chapter of my life is over and even though wearing it at one time brought me great joy, I hope it will find a new home and continue to bring someone as much happiness as it once did to me.
