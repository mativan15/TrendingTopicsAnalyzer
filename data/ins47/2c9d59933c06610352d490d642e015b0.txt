Scotland's leading countryside agency is calling for a revolution in the way farmers and crofters are paid to help restore wildlife and natural habitats damaged by decades of intensive agriculture.Under the current system of agricultural subsidies, more than £450 million is spent annually on food production, compared with £50 million on schemes that improve the environment.NatureScot, a Scottish government advisory body, is warning that unless the amounts are equalised the natural environment is unlikely to recover and targets for mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions will not be reached.
