Jun. 5—The MIAA statewide girls lacrosse pairings were released on Friday.

The top 32 teams in each of the state's four divisions, based on the MIAA power rankings system, qualified for the tournament. Teams outside of the top 32 that had a .500 record or better also qualified.

After a dominant regular season, CAL Kinney champion Newburyport (17-1) is the No. 1 seed in Division 3. The Clippers made the state semifinal last spring, and will start their run this time around hosting the winner of No.
