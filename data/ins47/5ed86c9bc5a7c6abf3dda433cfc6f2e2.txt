Terra launched a new version of its failed luna token — and it's already underperforming. The relaunch comes as part of founder Do Kwon's revival plan for the Terra ecosystem, after an intense crash of its stablecoin terraUSD and its sister token luna. The terra USD (UST) and luna projects, headed by Terraform Labs, plunged with UST losing its peg to the dollar and luna tanking 97%. The crash ultimately fed a cryptocurrency bloodbath that saw major tokens like bitcoin, ether, cardano, solana, and dogecoin crater to astonishing lows.
