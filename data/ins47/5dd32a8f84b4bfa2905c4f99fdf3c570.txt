Diablo Immortal is the first free-to-play (and mobile) entry in Blizzard's storied ARPG franchise, and as such it works a little differently from other games in the series. While all of its story content--as well as dungeons, raids, PvP, and future content like new classes--are free, there are numerous ways to spend real money, whether it be on cosmetic armor and weapon appearances, the game's Empowered Battle Pass, or upgrade materials.That begs the question: Do you really need to spend money in Diablo Immortal to progress? Or can you play completely for free and have a good time? The answer is a little bit of both.
