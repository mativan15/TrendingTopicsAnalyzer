Japan will not withdraw from Russia's Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project even if it's told to do so, the country's industry minister told parliament on Tuesday. 'Sakhalin-2 is an asset that our predecessors worked hard to acquire. The owner of the land may be Russia, but the leasehold and the liquefaction and transportation equipment belong to the Japanese government and Japanese companies. We do not intend to leave, even if we are told [to do so],' Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Koichi Hagiuda said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
