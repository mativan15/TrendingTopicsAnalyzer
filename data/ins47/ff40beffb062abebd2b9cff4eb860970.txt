The pound moved higher in early Asia trade after the UK government made a series of U-turns as it abandoned tax cutting policies.

Sterling gained around 0.5% to trade above $1.12 in Monday morning trading.

On Friday, Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and said the mini-budget "went further and faster than markets were expecting".
