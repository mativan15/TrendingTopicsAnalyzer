Claer Barrett, consumer editor at the Financial Times, appeared on ITV's Lorraine today, to share some 'good news' about the best interest rates on the market. She said: 'Savings rates are increasing at a rate of knots at the moment because we're expecting another rise from the Bank of England.'The journalist also said: 'Around £268billion worth of cash is stuck in accounts paying no interest at all.'It's not surprising because people haven't been able to get a great rate on their savings for such a long time.
