WASHINGTON - With President Joe Biden's approval rating hovering in the 40s, he has not received a lot of invites to campaign with embattled Democrats. But that is not stopping him from spending the week touting policies that he hopes will resonate with voters - though his stumping has mostly been in D.C. and without a candidate by his side.

On Tuesday, Biden announced that he is releasing 15 million more barrels of fuel from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move aimed at easing gas prices less than three weeks before the midterms.
