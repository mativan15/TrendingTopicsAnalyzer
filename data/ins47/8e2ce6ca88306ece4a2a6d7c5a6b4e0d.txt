iStockGreen bonds usually have the same credit ratings and bondholder recourse as conventional bonds of the same issuer (all else being equal).Green Bonds are fixed-income instruments issued for the specific purpose of funding projects that have constructive environmental and or climate benefits. Like any typical coupon-bearing debt instrument, they have a specified end objective for using the funds raised. The bond issuer is bound to exclusively utilise the proceeds to finance eco-friendly ventures or assets such as renewable energy, clean transportation, sustainable waste and water management systems, energy efficient and green buildings, and biodiversity conservation.
