(Bloomberg) -- Bond investors aren't in a forgiving mood right now. Not with inflation soaring across the globe and eating into the value of their investments.So when Gustavo Petro, Colombia's new leftist president, and the more radical members of his cabinet started publicly mulling a bunch of heterodox policy proposals, including a plan to issue debt to buy land for the poor, the market reaction was swift. Investors dumped local government bonds, sending the peso tumbling and yields soaring.The whole thing has gotten so out of control, with benchmark local yields topping 14%, the highest in nearly two decades, that Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo and his aides have been forced to come out repeatedly to throw cold water on Petro's ideas and try to calm markets down.
