'January 6th was one of the most dramatic and consequential moments in our nation's history,' proclaimed Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) as portrayed tonight on Saturday Night Live once again by Kenan Thompson. 'So, to fight back, we assembled a team of monotone nerds to do a Power Point,' the long time cast member added as fellow SNLers played Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and soon-to-be departing Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), with the latter in the form of Heidi Gardner.

	Yep, with double duty by Megan Thee Stallion as host and musical guest today, the third episode of SNL's 48th season kicked off with the January 6th Select Committee's unanimous October 13 vote to subpoena Donald Trump.
