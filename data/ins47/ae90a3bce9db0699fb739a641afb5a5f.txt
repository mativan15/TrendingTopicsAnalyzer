May 30, 2022 07:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Debite, the dynamic financing platform for early-stage companies, has today announced its UK launch with a mission to help businesses more effectively manage their cashflow and maximise their growth potential.

Tackling one of the primary reasons why most start-ups fail, Debite's Buy Now Pay Later model means customers benefit from smoothing the cost of expensive business payments, such as subscriptions, marketing and inventory, via a flexible and affordable repayment plan.
