Over the past few years, Netflix built an animation factory that was a creator's dream, enlisting big-name talents like Craig McCracken and Alex Hirsch and churning out a steady stream of new animated movies and series.It was part of a boom in kids TV, fed by multiplying streaming services that saw kids content as a way to keep families subscribing — and amplified by the pandemic, when homebound kids were glued to their screens more than ever.But earlier this year, Netflix began canceling high-profile projects including "Antiracist Baby," based on Ibram X.
