Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy will once again have Dak Prescott under center, as he expects him to be cleared for practice by Wednesday. While McCarthy says backup quarterback Cooper Rush has "put us in a good spot," Prescott, as expected, will be ushered back into his starting role right on schedule after recovering six weeks from thumb surgery. "Dak is going to be cleared officially. …The expectation is for Dak to be cleared today or tomorrow," McCarthy said via the Dallas Morning News.
