Observations and other notes of interest from Wednesday night's 116-108 loss to the Chicago Bulls:

– Difficult to discern which was worse in this one.

– Bam Adebayo trying and being unable to score?

– Or Kyle Lowry perhaps even more passive than before?

– But there has to be more than the one-two punch of Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro.

– That isn't sustainable.

– As the Heat learned after Wednesday night's first quarter.

– Yes, Herro can make shots.

– Yes, Butler can get to the line.

– But a limited menu ultimately provides limited results.
