(Bloomberg) -- Stocks slipped and US equity futures fluctuated, while bonds fell Tuesday as euro-zone inflation accelerated to a fresh all-time high, intensifying the debate at the European Central Bank about how rapidly to raise interest rates.S&P 500 contracts were down by about 0.4% and those on the Nasdaq 100 switched between gains and losses. Europe's Stoxx 600 Index edged toward halting four days of gains, retreating from a one-month high. Treasury yields climbed across the curve, joining Monday's selloff in German bunds and European bonds.
