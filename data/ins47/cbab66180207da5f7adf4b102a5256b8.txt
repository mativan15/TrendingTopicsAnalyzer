After coming out on top against Swedish tennis player Elias Ymer at the Stockholm Open, American professional tennis player Frances Tiafoe acknowledged that the long season was beginning to wear him down. Frances Tiafoe was sluggish to get going and local hero Ymer took control early as he claimed the first set and built a 4-0 lead in the second. Tiafoe admitted feeling "very fatigued" after his trips to the US Open, Laver Cup, and Japan Open.

However, the American tennis player picked up a few gears and, in two hours and 36 minutes, managed to win by scores of 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), and 7-6(7-2).
