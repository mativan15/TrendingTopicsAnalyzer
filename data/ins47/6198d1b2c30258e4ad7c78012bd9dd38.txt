By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:30 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 21:30 EDT, 28 May 2022 Finance Minister Katy Gallagher says Labor has inherited a serious set of economic and budget challenges, but will take tough decisions while also focusing on cost of living issues. Senator Gallagher and Treasurer Jim Chalmers were sworn in last Monday, while taking on a swag of interim ministries, so the government could hit the ground running on its key priorities. That includes getting the budget back in order and in preparation for Labor's first budget in October.
