The Starbucks Anderson location on Interstate 85 and Clemson Boulevard two days after employees participated in a strike, June 12, 2022.

Eight Starbucks employees, three of whom were fired by the company, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Starbucks and a former manager, Melissa Morris, who accused the employees of kidnapping and assault prior to the start of a shift in early August.

A summons for the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 17 after the Anderson County Sheriff's Office found that Morris' criminal accusation was false, according to the summons.
