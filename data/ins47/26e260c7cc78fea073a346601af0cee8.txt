stockcamAirbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) is a fantastic business, and we have used Airbnb services several times over the last few years while vacationing in the US, Europe, and South America. Airbnb services benefit both the guest and the host, and we expect the company to gain a significant slice of the hotel and traditional lodging market share. We expect Airbnb revenue continue to grow meaningfully over the next few years, driven by newer offerings such as experiences, etc. While we are bullish on Airbnb's business prospects, we believe the shares are at risk of a violent sell-off in the near term due to their rich valuation.
