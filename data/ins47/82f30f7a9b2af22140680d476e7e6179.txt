ReWire Group is joining the Start-Up NY program with a goal of creating 75 new jobs over the next five years on the University at Albany campus.

As part of the move, ReWire will take space at the UAlbany Innovation Center, located within the university's Emerging Technology and Entrepreneurship Complex on the Harriman State Office Campus in Albany.

Brothers Kenneth and Alan Evans started ReWire Energy in 2015 along with several of their siblings and their father, Milton. The Saratoga Springs-based company began with a focus on planning and analysis, figuring out ways to lower clients' energy bills while bringing in new technologies like solar, smart thermostats and net-zero energy technologies.
