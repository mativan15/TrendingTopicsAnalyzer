By the numbers alone, the surge of the original Luna token on Tuesday is eye-popping. The one-time stablecoin, which collapsed earlier this month, has soared over 4,500% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk. But the spike is a good reminder that percentage increases don't always show real-world gains.

Despite its moonshot surge, Luna classic, as the original coin is now called, is still trading for just 6/10ths of a penny. As of 10:00 a.m. ET, you'd need 213 of the token to purchase one Dogecoin.
