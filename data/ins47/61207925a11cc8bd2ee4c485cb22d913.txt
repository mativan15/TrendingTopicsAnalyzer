imaginima/E+ via Getty Images The state of Texas has sued Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), accusing the tech giant of collecting the biometric data of Texans without consent for nearly a decade. Attorney General Ken Paxton says in the suit that Google grabbed "millions" of identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through products including Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Nest Hub Max. That's a knowing violation of Texas' Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, the AG's office says.
