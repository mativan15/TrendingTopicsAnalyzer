During the mini-budget debate in the House of Commons, Conservative MP and vice-chairman of the 1992 committee William Wragg, admitted he would like to vote with Labour against fracking, but that he would not because otherwise he would lose the party whip. Wragg claimed he had written a letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the committee, calling for a vote of no confidence in Liz Truss. Tory MPs have been told they have to vote against the Labour motion on fracking on Wednesday evening, Sky's Beth Rigby reports.
