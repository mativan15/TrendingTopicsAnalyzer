On 22 October, alt-rock icons Garbage, fronted by Shirley Manson, will play at the ninth annual We Can Survive concert — part of Audacy's I'm Listening mental health initiative in support of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention — at the legendary Hollywood Bowl.

Among the acts performing will be Alanis Morrisette, Weezer, Halsey, and OneRepublic, but surely one of the night's highlights will be the set by the 'Only Happy When It Rains' supergroup whose fierce Scottish frontwoman has always been an advocate for the disenfranchised and open about her own mental health struggles.
