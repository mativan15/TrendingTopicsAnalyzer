Published: 00:47 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 00:48 EDT, 16 October 2022 The race to be Governor of New York has tightened dramatically recently as Republican challenger Lee Zeldin has closed the gap and made the race a 'toss-up' against Democrat incumbent Kathy Hochul. A RealClearPolitics average of polls taken between September 30 to October 12 shows Hochul's lead over Zeldin has dwindled to just 5.3 percent - with 7 percent of voters yet to decide. Zeldin, a US army veteran and congressman from Long Island, was down by as much as 24 points back in August, and his late surge shows the rising crime in New York may be beneficial to the tough-on-crime candidate.
