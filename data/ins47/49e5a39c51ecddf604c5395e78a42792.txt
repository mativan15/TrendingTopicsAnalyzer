European Union countries have adopted sanctions on Iran over Iranian-made drones supplied to Russia and used in attacks on Ukraine, the EU Council's Czech presidency has said.
'After 3 days of talks, EU ambassadors agreed on measures against entities supplying Iranian drones that hit Ukraine,' the presidency said on Twitter on Thursday.
Ukraine has accused Russia of using Iranian-made 'kamikaze' drones in attacks on cities and energy infrastructure in recent weeks. It says its military has shot down more than 220 Iranian drones since mid-September.
