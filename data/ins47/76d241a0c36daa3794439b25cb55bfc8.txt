Business stakeholders on International Drive-Sand Lake Road met on Oct. 18 to help the future pedestrian bridge finally take shape — conceptually.

Why it matters: The bridge will help move pedestrians off the busy intersection and help them cross above the streets — increasing safety and making traffic more efficient. The bridge also will provide construction opportunities and possible future branding if partnered with sponsorships.

The meeting, which is the third of a series to bring the bridge to fruition, discussed various shapes of the proposed bridge from traditional square and circular shapes to more complex "I," "X," and a slightly curved intersecting "C" designs.
