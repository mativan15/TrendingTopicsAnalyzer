The podcaster, who has terminal bowel cancer, wrote on instagram of how she spent a day in tears before the sleepover raised a smile 'like a cheshire cat'. She revealed the group watched Cinderella from a teepee pitched in her living room. Her ‘Bowelbabe' fund has collected £6.6million for charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden. She has been made a dame for her fundraising, including launching her own fashion range, and work to help those affected by cancer.
