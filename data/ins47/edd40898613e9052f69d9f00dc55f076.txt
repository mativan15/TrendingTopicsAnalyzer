A Nelson-based airline will be resuming services to North Island after having to reduce flights because of Covid-19 restrictions. Originair customer services manager Tania Armstrong said the airline was taking its first steps to resuming its usual schedule. Omicron's effect on air travel meant the airline had been forced to reduce its flight schedule in February. However, Originair could now resume key services and business-timed flights. Services between Nelson and Napier would be resumed, and additional direct flights between Nelson and Palmerston North would be added.
