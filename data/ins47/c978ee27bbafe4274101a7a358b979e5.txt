Shires Fruit and Vege Market has been part of the fabric of Dannevirke for 100 years, not just providing fresh produce, but also being part of the community. The Tararua business has been in the same family for a century, passed down through three generations after its founder Chhiba Patel arrived in New Zealand from India as a 16-year-old. To celebrate the family is holding a big family reunion and dinner this weekend at the Dannevirke Town Hall. Chhiba came to New Zealand in 1918 from the Gujurat state and landed in Auckland en route to Fiji.
