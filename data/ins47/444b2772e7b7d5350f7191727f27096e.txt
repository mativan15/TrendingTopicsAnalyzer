Published October 21, 2022 1:29pm EDT American Airlines is getting rid of first-class seats on international flights because people simply are not booking them, an executive for the airline revealed this week. "The first class will not exist on the 777 or for that matter, at American Airlines for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it," Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja said during an earnings call Thursday. The comment caused a stir because many observers assumed Raja was announcing a new move by the airline, but an American Airlines spokesperson clarified to FOX Business that Raja was referring to the carrier's announcement from last month pertaining to long-haul flights.
