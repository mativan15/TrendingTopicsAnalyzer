College football is a sport played between rosters of dozens of players, in front of tens of thousands of fans, with networks paying millions to air the games to millions.

And sometimes, they all have to wait because one pony pooped on the field.

Specifically, that would be the pony mascot of Southern Methodist University, whose game against Navy on Friday was delayed more than 15 minutes after said pony defecated during its run across the field at Gerald J.
