JPMorgan Chase is giving some customers early access to their direct deposits, a feature popularized by fintech rivals, as it hopes to attract users to a no-overdraft checking account.

The bank is switching on this feature — which accelerates payments including payroll, tax refunds, pensions and government benefits by up to two days — to customers of its Secure Banking product starting this week, according to Ryan MacDonald, head of growth financial products for Chase.

That typically means getting paid on a Wednesday rather than Friday, he said.
