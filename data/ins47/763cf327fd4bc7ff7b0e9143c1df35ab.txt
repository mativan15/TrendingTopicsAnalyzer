Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called for sanctions against Iran on Tuesday saying the world should "sanction the duck" of the country for providing drones to Russia in the war in Ukraine.

"If Iran walks like a duck, talks like a duck and admits to supplying drones to the biggest duck in the world then I think we have enough evidence to say that Iran is a duck. Let's sanction the duck out of them," tweeted Landsbergis.
