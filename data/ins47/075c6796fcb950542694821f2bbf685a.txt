New Brunswick's official languages commissioner says it's important for the province to help people become bilingual.Shirley MacLean says her office takes precedence over all legislation in the province — except the Education Act. So she doesn't have a direct say over pending changes to French immersion in the province.Education Minister Bill Hogan has said changes are coming next year, and different programs are still being considered. MacLean contends immersion is a "very important, very vibrant part" of contributing to bilingualism in New Brunswick.
