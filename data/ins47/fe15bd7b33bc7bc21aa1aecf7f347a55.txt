Russian oil and gas sales could hit $285 billion this year, outstripping last year's takings by 20%.

Europe is a major buyer of Russian energy products, accounting for about 50% of its crude oil exports and 75% of its natural gas exports in 2021.

Germany was the biggest buyer of Russian energy in the first two months of the war.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its 100th day on Friday, with no clear end to the war in sight.
