(Bloomberg) -- UK bonds were under pressure Thursday morning and the pound dropped amid doubts over whether Prime Minister Liz Truss can cling onto power. Yields on 10-year notes rose as much as 14 basis points before partly retreating. Long-dated bonds held up better, with the 30-year yield only rising by 2 basis points to 4.00%. They continued to outperform shorter-maturity debt after the Bank of England this week said it would exempt them from active sales of its gilt holdings from Nov. 1.While Truss' tenure has largely been rejected by markets so far, her departure would nonetheless plunge the UK into yet more turmoil -- and boost short-term market volatility-- particularly if it were to come before Oct.
