Skip to content Press Statement Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State October 19, 2022 
 One year ago today, Houthi forces breached the compound used by the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen prior to its suspension of operations in 2015 and began detaining, without justification, Yemeni Locally Employed Staff. As of today, twelve current and former U.S. and UN employees remain detained. Most have had no contact with their families, and one passed away in detention earlier this year.
The ongoing detention of these Yemeni employees shows gross disregard for diplomatic norms and constitutes an affront to the entire international community.
