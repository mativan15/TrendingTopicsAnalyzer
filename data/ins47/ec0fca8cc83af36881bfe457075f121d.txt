Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat profit estimates but missed revenue estimates.

The report generated mixed reactions from Wall Street, with JPMorgan cutting their price target to $150.

"We continue to see risk to guidance for +50% annual unit volume growth over time," JPMorgan said.



Tesla's third-quarter earnings report drew mixed reactions from Wall Street despite CEO Elon Musk's bullish view that the electric vehicle company could one day be worth more than $4 trillion.
