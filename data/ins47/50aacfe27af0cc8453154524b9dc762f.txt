Rome (CNN) Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sparked controversy this week when audio released by Italian news agency LaPresse revealed the 86-year-old speaking about his "re-established" relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Berlusconi says in the audio that Putin sent him 20 bottles of vodka and a "very sweet letter" on his birthday last month.

His office confirmed with CNN on Thursday that the clips were authentic -- apparently having been secretly recorded during a meeting of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the parliamentary chamber on Tuesday.
