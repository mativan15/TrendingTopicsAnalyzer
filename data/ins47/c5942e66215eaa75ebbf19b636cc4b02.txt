bjdlzx (Note: This article was in the newsletter on September 3, 2022.) Crescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) management had a little noticed statement in the latest quarterly report that cannot be emphasized enough. Management was disposing of noncore assets and so was adjusting the production guidance. Even though now is clearly the time to sell assets (especially those smaller holdings that appeal to a limited market) many companies do not "clean house" until the next market bottom. "Cleaning house" during a time of weak commodity prices usually results in very poor sales prices that can cost investors a whole lot of money.
