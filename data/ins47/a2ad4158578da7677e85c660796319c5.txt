A US software company has kicked off a High Court battle against Metro Bank over claims the lender leaked trade secrets for its "magic money machines".  
Philadelphia-based Arkeyo created software more than a decade ago for Metro's coin-counting machines, which are aimed at children to add up small change and remain in all of the bank's branches.
However, Arkeyo is now suing Metro for damages over claims the bank misappropriated its intellectual property by leaking its software to a rival company and infringing its copyright, court documents filed in the US show.
