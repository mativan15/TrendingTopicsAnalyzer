Over 40 years ago, Kansas lawmakers required the state's prosecutors to create 'diversion' programs, whereby people charged with certain lower-level crimes could avoid a criminal conviction by getting drug or mental health treatment, working a job or simply staying out of trouble.

Back then, the Legislature made the commonsense determination that these programs served the 'interests of justice' by lifting people up, not locking them up.

However, as tough-on-crime rhetoric replaced smarter approaches like diversion through the 1980s and 1990s, many prosecutors in Kansas and across the country have cut back on this valuable tool.
