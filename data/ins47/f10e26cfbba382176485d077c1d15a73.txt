Trying something new paid off for a Walpole Island grandfather — to the tune of $100,000. Ricky Kewayosh has been a regular lottery player for 20 years he got his big win by playing a ticket he hadn't tried before, Instant 5x the Cash. 'I chose this ticket because it was new in the display,' he said in an OLG news release. 'When I was playing my ticket and revealed the number 49 and saw the corresponding prize, my mind started racing.' When Kewayosh shared the good news with his family, he says at first they didn't believe him.
