According to a report from a New Brunswick Crown Corporation, the number of people living in poverty in the province was cut in half between 2015 and 2020.
A progress update on the province's five-year poverty reduction strategy from the Economic and Social Inclusion agency says that 58,000 New Brunswickers were experiencing poverty in 2020, down from 119,000 in 2015.But not everyone is convinced by those numbers.'I've done a little bit of digging into the data and certainly it's a wonderful example of what spin doctors can do to put lipstick on a pig,' said Green Party leader David Coon when asked about the report.
