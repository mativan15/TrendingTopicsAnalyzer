LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A Los Angeles County man faces sentencing this morning for threatening to bomb Small Business Administration offices and assault employees in response to his inability to obtain COVID-19 emergency business loans. Christopher Antoun, 30, pleaded guilty in March to a single federal count of making threats by interstate communication, a felony carrying a prison sentence of up to five years, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Antoun -- who owned Federal Student Loan Consulting, a company he ran out of his home in Lakewood -- attempted to obtain a COVID-19 Emergency Injury Disaster Loan two years ago, court papers show.
