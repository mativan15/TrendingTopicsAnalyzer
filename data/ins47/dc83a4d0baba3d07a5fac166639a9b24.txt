One of the Browns best draft picks of the 21st century has decided to hang up his cleats. Longtime starting center Alex Mack, a first-round pick by the Browns back in 2009, has retired from the NFL according to reporter Mike Silver.

Mack played for the Browns from 2009-2015 and quickly established himself as one of the best in the business. He earned three Pro Bowl nods in Cleveland before cashing in on free agency and moving to Atlanta. The Falcons made Mack the highest-paid interior offensive lineman in NFL history at the time to lure him away.
