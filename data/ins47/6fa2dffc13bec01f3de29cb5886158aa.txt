The Tech Port Center and Arena at Port San Antonio will host a new event in honor of local veterans.

A group of investors, headed up by Marcos Resendez, is presenting 'Doc Watkins & Friends, Salute to Troops' on November 11. With a format similar to a classic variety show, the event will feature Doc Watkins, resident artist at JazzTx in Pearl, as well New Orleans jazz trumpeter and composer Kermit Ruffins, singer-songwriter ZZ Ward, soul-rock band The Seratones and comedian James P. Connolly.

'I'm honored and thrilled to help bring this grand tradition back, right here in my hometown of San Antonio,' Watkins said in a news release.
