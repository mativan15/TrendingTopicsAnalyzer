Jun. 4—ENFIELD — The public school system was recently designated an Alliance District, which doesn't come as a huge surprise after officials knew it was a distinct possibility.

However, in unexpected news, Enfield will not be receiving grant funding.

That second part came as a shock, said Superintendent Christopher Drezek during an update to the Board of Education this week.

At the 11th hour, he said, the legislature expanded the network from 33 districts to 36.

In past years, three districts had to "graduate" out to let in three new ones.
