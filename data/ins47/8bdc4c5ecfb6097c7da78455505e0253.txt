The European Union is set to develop an energy efficiency label for blockchains.

The European Commission has introduced these measures as part of wider plans to control the energy consumption of the ICT sector, including an environmental labeling scheme for data centers, an energy label for computers, and measures to make clearer how much energy telecoms services use.

'The aim is to make our energy system more efficient and ready for increasing share of renewable energy sources,' said energy commissioner Kadri Simson.
