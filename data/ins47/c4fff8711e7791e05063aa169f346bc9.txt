Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Investment Thesis SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock staged a near-term bottom after our call for investors to get out of the stock after its Q1 earnings. Are we surprised with the near-term rally? Not at all, because nothing goes down in a straight line. We had been waiting for a near-term bottom, but it had not formed when we published our previous article. Notably, we wish to remind investors that we had already liquidated all our positions in early March at $12.
