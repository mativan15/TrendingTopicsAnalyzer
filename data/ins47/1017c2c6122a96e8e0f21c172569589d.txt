The future of Draymond Green with the Golden State Warriors is uncertain as he enters the final two seasons of his current deal while he has the option of becoming a free agent in 2023. Green also punched Jordan Poole during a preseason practice that has tested the team's patience with him on a personal level. Green, however, is unlikely to decline his $27.5 million option. "For Draymond Green with that $27.5 million option next season, he almost assuredly is going to exercise that," said Adrian Wojnarowski.
