PAUL POGBA WILL NOT return to Juventus this summer as he's afraid to challenge boss Massimiliano Allegri, it's been claimed.
Pogba played under Allegri at Juve for two years between 2014 and 2016, before sealing a big money move back to Manchester United.

Things haven't exactly gone to plan for the Frenchman at Old Trafford and he's out of contract at the end of June, opening up the possibility for a return to the Old Lady.
But in an interview with former Italy and Juve star Andrea Barzagli, Allegri has joked that Pogba WILL NOT be returning as he is afraid to challenge him.
