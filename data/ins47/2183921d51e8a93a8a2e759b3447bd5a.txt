Thalavoor grama panchayat has joined the list of local bodies that have attained complete constitution literacy as part of ‘The Citizen', a constitution literacy campaign jointly organised by the Kollam district panchayat, District Planning Committee and Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA). As part of the campaign, all residents of the panchayat above the age of 10 were educated on the Constitution, its history, fundamental rights and legal system with the help of trained volunteers. The panchayat authorities also installed the preamble in all households, government offices, quasi-government and educational institutions.
