The 60-40 stock-bond portfolio has been a bedrock of traditional investing, but it's also been a loser thus far in 2022.

'Investors who own a 60-40 balanced portfolio just feel like they've been punched in the gut,' Emily Roland, co-chief investment officer at John Hancock Investment Management, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above), adding that year-to-date so far it's down about 10%.

A 60-40 portfolio consists of 60% equities and 40% bonds or other fixed-income offerings. Stock and bond prices historically move inversely.
