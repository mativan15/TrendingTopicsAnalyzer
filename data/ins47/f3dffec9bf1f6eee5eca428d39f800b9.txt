We can readily understand why investors are attracted to unprofitable companies. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune.

Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether OncoCyte (NASDAQ:OCX) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn.
