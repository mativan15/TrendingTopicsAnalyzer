Rohit Warrier appeared on Sony Tv's most popular show, Shark Tank. He presented his idea of Sippline, a mask for glass and was severely rejected. Even he was mocked for delivering such a horrible idea. Sippline is a new patented invention by Rohit Warrier wherein oral hygiene is given utmost importance. A rim is attached to the glass to prevent direct contact of the lips on the glass, ensuring proper oral hygiene. However, after the sharks turned down his idea in the first season of Shark Tank, he was not discouraged.
