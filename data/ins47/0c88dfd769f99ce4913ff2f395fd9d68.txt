The death of three women at a Chicago senior living facility during a May heat spike has brought tragedy to families and raised questions about how well the city is prepared for the climate crisis.On 14 May, three women—Janice Lee Reed, 68; Gwendolyn Osborne, 72; and Delores McNeely, 76—were found dead in the city's James Sneider Apartments.The county medical examiner has yet to officially rule on the cause of their deaths, but their families believe that building's managers refused multiple complaints to turn off the facility's heating system, causing the women to perish in apartments that felt like a 'brick oven.
