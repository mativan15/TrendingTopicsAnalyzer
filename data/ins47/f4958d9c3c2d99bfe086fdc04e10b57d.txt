Scientology was front and center on Tuesday as the rape trial against 'That '70s Show' actor Danny Masterson began.

Masterson is a Scientologist and each of his alleged victims was a Scientologist at the time of the alleged rapes, which span from 2001 to 2003.

The first witness to take the stand — who prefers to be known as Jane Doe #1 — testified that the church warns members against 'fraternizing with the enemy,' and refers to non-Scientologists as 'wogs.'

That testimony drew an angry rebuke from Judge Charlaine Olmedo during a break, who blistered the prosecutor for straying from her pre-trial rulings on the issue.
