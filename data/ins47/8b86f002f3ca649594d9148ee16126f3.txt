Magellan Financial Group's new chief executive David George says the embattled group is capable of almost doubling its funds under management over the next five years to $100 billion as the investment landscape undergoes a structural shift.The confident tone struck by George, who joined Magellan in May, comes as the fund manager works to resuscitate its fortunes after a horror 12 months in which it shed $62.4 billion in funds under management. Magellan's share price has slumped over 43 per cent this year.
