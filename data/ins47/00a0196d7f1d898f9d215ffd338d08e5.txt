Celtic boss Ange Postceglou was glad to see Kyogo Furuhashi get back among the goals because he says strikers feel 'the world collapses in on them' when they're not scoring.The Japan forward had netted just one in his last eight games before scoring the final goal in the 4-0 League Cup win at Motherwell as Celtic teed up a semi-final with Kilmarnock."He is contributing, he's causing problems for the opposition. I'm pleased for him to get the goal, but it doesn't change my assessment on how he's been playing.
