HELSINKI (AP) — Finland's prime minister said Tuesday she was convinced that there is a 'wide support' within the Parliament to build a fence on the Nordic country's border with Russia as proposed by the Finnish border guard officials.

'It is a question of securing proper surveillance of Finland's (eastern) border in the future,' Prime Minister Sanna Marin told reporters at the legislature before a meeting with parliamentary groups on the border fence issue.

The Finnish Border Guard had earlier suggested covering parts of the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border Finland shares with Russia, the longest of any European Union member, to help in preventing possible large-scale and illegal migration — a concern that has grown in Helsinki amid Russia's war in Ukraine.
