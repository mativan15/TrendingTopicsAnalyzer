The risk of an overshoot by the Bank of Canada on its key benchmark rate is lessening as supply chain problems ease, according to CIBC Capital Markets.

Deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal said there are early signs the supply-side factors driving consumer prices higher appear to be abating, which should bode well for the central bank's fight against surging prices.
