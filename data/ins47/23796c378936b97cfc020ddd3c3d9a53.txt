May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. equity funds attracted net inflows in the week to May 25 as shares rallied, with stock markets breaking the longest streak of weekly declines since the dotcom bubble burst.

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, investors purchased U.S. equity funds worth a net $4.61 billion, the first weekly inflow since April 6 and the biggest since March 23.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, have both gained more than 3% this week after seven straight weeks of losses, their longest losing streak since 2001.
