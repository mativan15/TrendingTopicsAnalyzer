Late last week, it was announced that former president Barack Obama would be hitting the campaign trail for Democrats. His appearances will include one in Atlanta for Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock and would-be governor Stacey Abrams, one in in Detroit for Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and another in Milwaukee for Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and his Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, who is running for Senate.

Mr Obama also appeared on Pod Save America, a show hosted by a squad of his former speechwriters and aides.
