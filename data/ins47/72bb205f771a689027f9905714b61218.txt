LONDON — Liz Truss' premiership looked close to imploding after she fired one minister over a security breach and two others were heard resigning amid the fallout from a chaotic parliamentary vote before agreeing to stay in their posts.Many Conservative lawmakers now want Truss to resign immediately, a sudden reversal from a widely held view that a leadership change should wait at least until a new economic plan is announced on Oct. 31 to calm financial markets.Late on Wednesday cabinet ministers were holding private conversations about whether the prime minister should quit, according to two people with knowledge of those talks.
