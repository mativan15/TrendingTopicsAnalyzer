Today, Monday, June 6, is the Gregorian calendar date of the anniversary of the Six Days War. It is also the anniversary of the invasion of Normandy by allied troops in 1944. And it happens to be the National Day of Sweden, whose ambassador Erik Ullenhag hosted an event last week to mark the 110th anniversary of the birth of the great Swedish diplomat and humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg, who saved the lives of thousands of Hungarian Jews. Among the speakers were Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and US Ambassador Tom Nides.
