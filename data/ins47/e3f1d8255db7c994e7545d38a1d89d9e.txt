Time to invest in crime prevention, Oct. 15

It's impossible not to believe in the formula that $1 investment in crime prevention equals $5-$7 in justice-system costs. The City of Mississauga and the Region of Peel, plus some private investors, are contributing $12.7 million into converting an unused swimming pool into a state of the art youth hub in Malton.

Here, the formula would equate to saving $63.5 million to $88.9 million in future justice-system costs.

Managed by the city, this building will provide social services, safe gathering space, life skills, access to nutritious food … all run by a 20-student board of directors.
