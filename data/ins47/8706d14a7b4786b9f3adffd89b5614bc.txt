The Baltimore Ravens will take on the New York Giants in a pivotal Week 6 matchup that should provide plenty of fireworks over the course of 60 minutes. Baltimore will look to improve their record to 4-2, while New York will hope to continue their impressive start and move to 5-1.
There are plenty of things to watch over the course of the game, including if Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson can bounce back from two rough games against the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals. He faces off against former Baltimore defensive coordinator Don Martindale, who will certainly be looking to get the better of his the Ravens.
