South Korean Do Kwon presided over one of the biggest busts ever seen in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. His Terraform Labs Pte created the TerraUSD stablecoin, which was meant to have a constant $1 value via a complex mix of algorithms and trader incentives involving a sister token, Luna. Their combined value soared past $60 billion until confidence in the ecosystem evaporated in May, prompting investors to flee and leaving the tokens almost worthless. Kwon's whereabouts became unclear four months later after South Korea issued an arrest warrant on allegations including breaches of capital-markets law.
