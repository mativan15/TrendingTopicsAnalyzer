Publicly traded Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment appears likely to beat a Nasdaq countdown that threatens to delist the stock of the football-themed business next month.

Shares of Hall of Fame, which trade under the ticker HOFV, have suffered mightily since the business went public by a SPAC merger in June 2020. After debuting at $12.30 and enjoying periods of strong investor interest through last year, shares fell below $1 in February. The cause is primarily due to the bear market, which tends to have outsized effects on smaller stocks like Hall of Fame Resort.
