With the exception of some carefully chosen British imports, you might normally associate public television with broad-based comedy.  But, in 1994, America's own PBS did something that they've never done since:  they produced and aired a 30-minute sitcom.
The program, 'The Steven Banks Show,' ran for 13 episodes in 1994.  Five episodes of the series are housed in the archives of the Library of Congress having been sent to the Library in 1994 and 1995 as copyright deposits.
