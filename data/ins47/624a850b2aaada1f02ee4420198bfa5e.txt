Train passengers are facing further chaos as the UK's biggest rail union on Tuesday urged its members to back six more months of strikes in its campaign for pay rises and to protect jobs.A ballot opened on Tuesday for more than 40,000 RMT members at Network Rail and 14 train firms, including London Overground and Avanti West Coast.A yes vote would allow union chiefs to plan further walkouts over Christmas and until the end of May.There have already been eight strikes on the national railways since June – the worst disruption in a generation.
