Kadarius Toney has no doubt that he'll be back to make dynamic plays for the Giants.

'When I step back out there, I feel like I'm gonna be who I originally was,' Toney said Thursday.

The problem is Toney hasn't stepped out there much due to injuries to both of his hamstrings. He is slated to miss his fifth straight game on Sunday in Jacksonville. He's jogging on the side of Brian Daboll's practices, cautiously rehabbing.

'I mean when you go hard, stuff happens,' Toney said, explaining his frequent injuries.
