'The top sectoral bet is going to be real estate. I do not know about the next one year. It is very difficult to pick but I think if you play real estate well in terms of bottoms up stock picking, that should be one of the better ones,' says Samit Vartak, Founding Partner & CIO, SageOne Investment 
You said do not chase the theme, do not run after a sector because that could get you in a bit of trouble. Given that you are very optimistic on the India story, what would be the appropriate portfolio strategy for the next Samvat and down the line, according to you?I think it is important that for really successful investment returns, one needs valuations as well as the tailwind of earnings behind it.
