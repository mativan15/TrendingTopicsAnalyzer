The price of bitcoin has dipped back below $30,000 amid warnings that the crypto market will likely see unusual volatility over the coming weeks.

After hitting an 18-month low below $27,000 in mid May, bitcoin finished the month strongly by bouncing back by 18 per cent. Any hopes of a sustained recovery were ended by yet another mini crash at the start of June, dropping 7 per cent on Thursday.
