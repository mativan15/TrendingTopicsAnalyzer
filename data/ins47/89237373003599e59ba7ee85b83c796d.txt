In the wake of new reports that the Trump crime family (aka the Chicken All-Fredos) profited handsomely from the Secret Service's visits to Trump-controlled properties during Donny's 'presidency,' MSNBC unearthed a telling clip of Eric Trump—who keeps showing up at Mar-a-Lago no matter how often his dad sends him to live with Chuck Grassley's barn cats—brazenly lying about the fees Trump hotels charged the government. While it's an article of faith among MAGA types that Trump risked his imaginary billions in order to humbly serve as our president (Trump himself once risibly claimed that he'd lost between $2 billion and $5 billion while doing whatever that was in the White House), Trump appears to have been less than shy about using his position to reap unearned benefits.
