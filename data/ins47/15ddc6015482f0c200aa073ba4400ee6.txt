Police in Budapest have dismantled a criminal organisation involved in industrial-scale money laundering and fraud, according to Europol.Officers descended on 24 homes in the Hungarian capital on May 9. Sixteen people were arrested, including five on suspicion of moving some €44 million in illicit funds through bank accounts across three continents.The criminal network to which they allegedly belonged, Europol said, was set up in September 2020 and sought to launder the proceeds of crime: mostly fraud and cryptocurrency-related swindles.
