KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, May 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In the current volatile world of cryptocurrency, where over 80% of trading platforms have no certification, BitDD certified crypto exchange is bringing greater confidence and credibility to the industry in the APAC region.

BitDD is a new breed of trusted secure crypto exchange platforms focused on "stablecoins," which are cryptocurrencies tied to a reserve asset including fiat currency such as the US dollar or a commodity such as gold. Stablecoins are backed by real-world reserve assets, and therefore less prone to wild fluctuations in price even in a rapidly shifting market.
