San Francisco Mayor London Breed lashed out at Tesla boss Elon Musk as 'the person who got a ton of tax breaks in California and decided to take that money and run.'
Breed, who has lamented the adverse economic impact of remote work on her city, has expressed frustration at tech CEOs for promoting the narrative that the Bay Area was a crime-infested hellhole full of drugs and homeless people.
'My hope is that those who are critical would focus on trying to be a part of the solution rather than part of the problem,' Breed told Bloomberg News.
