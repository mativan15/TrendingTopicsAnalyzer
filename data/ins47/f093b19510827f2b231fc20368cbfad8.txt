Ominous
The Kerala Governor's warning that he has powers to remove any Minister criticising him has dangerous overtones not only for Kerala but for other States as well. The public has not forgotten the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor's confrontation with Aam Aadmi Party Ministers and the West Bengal's Governor's spats with the Trinamool Congress. It is time the powers of Governors are revisited, reviewed and redefined and the Governor's post made an ‘overseeing one'.A.V. Narayanan
