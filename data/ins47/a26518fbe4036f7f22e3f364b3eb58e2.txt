Covishield accounts for over 90% of the doses given in India.

Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has said it had to dump 100 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine after they expired.

The firm stopped producing Covishield in December last year due to low demand, CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Thursday.

SII, the world's largest vaccine maker, has been making the local version of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria jab.

Covishield accounts for over 90% of the doses given in India.

India has administered over two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines.
