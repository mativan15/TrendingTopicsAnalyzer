Hearing aids make it easier for people of all ages to hear better. But many Americans put off buying hearing aids because of financial concerns. Luckily, a recent FDA rule change will make it easier for Americans to get the hearing aids they need at a more affordable price. Nearly 30 million U.S. adults could benefit from hearing aids, according to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. But many Americans ignore the need because they worry about the total cost they will pay.
