Patrons who have been turning up to buy cryptocurrency at a Devon pub have had to be turned away following new rules from regulators.
The disappointed Bitcoin devotees had previously used a hyper-modern Bitcoin ATM-style machine at the olde worlde Bishop Lacy Inn in Chudleigh.
But since the government has cracked down on crypto ATMs, the pub has been keeping people at arm's length of the machine for 15 months. All while the owners of the company which has been installing the machines in Devon has been applying for a licence.
