Jeremy Hunt, the new Chancellor, our fourth in one year, has said that difficult decisions will have to be made in his Medium-Term Fiscal Plan: taxes won't go down as promised, some will go up, and all government departments will have to find efficiencies. The latest development is that the cut to the basic rate of income tax will be delayed.
In other words, Liz Truss's brave attempt to forge a different economic path for the UK, rejecting the 'abacus economics' of the Treasury in favour of an unashamed dash for growth built on lower taxes, is over.
