When investing in your own future, knowing what to expect from different types of businesses you can invest in is a great way to get a leg up. Of course, knowing what to expect isn't always as straightforward as it could be. Take the case of AbbVie (ABBV -0.14%) and Moderna (MRNA -4.16%). They're both commercial-stage drugmakers but their potential growth trajectories could hardly be more different.
Given enough time, both of these pharma stocks can double their shareholders' original investment.
