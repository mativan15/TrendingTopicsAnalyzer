KPMG has named Lisa Daniels vice chair of growth and strategy, appointing her to the accounting firm's U.S. management committee.

She will continue to work out of KPMG's office in San Francisco, where she was previously office managing partner. She was succeeded in that role by Chris Cimino last July.

Most recently, Daniels has been assigned global lead partner for one of the firm's major tech clients, which she declined to name. Earlier in her career, Daniels led KPMG's offices in Phoenix and Silicon Valley.
