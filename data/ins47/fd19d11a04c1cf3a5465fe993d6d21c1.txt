Campbell baseball coach Justin Haire was interviewed on SEC Network and ESPN live stream during his team's NCAA Tournament Knoxville Regional game against the Tennessee Vols on Saturday.

During the interview, the broadcast displayed a package of Marlboro cigarettes in the Campbell dugout. The interview occurred in the bottom of the fifth inning.

If the package contains cigarettes and the cigarettes were used, it is a violation of the University of Tennessee and NCAA policies.

The game occurred at Lindsey Nelson Stadium on the University of Tennessee campus.
