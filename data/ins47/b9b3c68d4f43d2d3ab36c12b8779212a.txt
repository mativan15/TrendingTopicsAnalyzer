In 2013, I was working as an engineer and making $80,000 a year. But I felt unfulfilled by my job, so I started a food blog called Delish D'Lites. Shortly after, I was laid off from my job. At the time, it felt like a setback. But it was actually the start of something great, because it made me realize that I didn't want to rely on just one income stream anymore. So I continued to work on my blog, even after I got another full-time engineering position. I set aside time to post once a day, sharing recipes inspired by my Puerto Rican heritage.
