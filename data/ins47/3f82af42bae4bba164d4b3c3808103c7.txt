International television crews in Qatar for the Fifa World Cup will be banned from interviewing people in their own homes as part of sweeping reporting restrictions that could have a 'severe chilling effect' on media coverage.Broadcasters, such as the BBC and ITV, will also be forbidden from filming at accommodation sites, such as those housing migrant workers, under the terms of filming permits issued by the Qatari government.Instead, they will be permitted to film in public places in only three locations in Doha: the Corniche waterfront promenade, the West Bay area and the Towers area.
