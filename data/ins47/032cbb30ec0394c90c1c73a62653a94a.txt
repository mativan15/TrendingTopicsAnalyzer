ATLANTA – Atlanta voters had mixed opinions on whether abortion access or the economy carry a bigger influence on how they'll cast their ballots in November's midterm elections."Honestly, economy," one woman, Kaia, told Fox News. "My money is everything. Money makes the world go 'round."Jasmine, however, said that while the economy is important, "the bigger issue for me would be women being able to support themselves and having that choice.""Especially being a woman myself, abortion is very imperative," she added.
