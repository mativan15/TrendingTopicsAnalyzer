	The BBC has ready secret scripts to read on emergency broadcast channels if the UK experiences energy shortages that result in blackouts or loses gas this winter, according to the Guardian.

	The scripts deal with the results of a 'major loss of power' that impacts everything from mobile phone signals to internet access to traffic lights, according to the paper.

	The National Grid, which oversees the UJ's power supply, recently issued a rare warning that electricity supplies could be at risk in coming months.
