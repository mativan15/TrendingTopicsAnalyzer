I've played the early hours of Pokemon games in pretty much exactly the same way since the '90s, always picking the fire starter, getting to its second evolution before the first gym and obsessively gathering a balanced, cool looking team. It's a comfortable tradition, and encapsulates so much of my experience of the monster collecting and battle series. So attending a preview session for the upcoming Scarlet and Violet in New York City earlier this month proved a slightly alien experience as I dived directly into a bunch of new features with a pre-made team of six Pokemon (with helpful publicists watching my every move).
