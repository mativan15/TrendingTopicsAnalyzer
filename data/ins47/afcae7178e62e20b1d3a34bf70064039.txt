Senior Congress leader and Member of Parliament P Chidambaram Saturday took a swipe at the Narendra Modi-led Central government as India slipped down to the 107th position in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) of 2022.
The GHI, published yesterday, ranked India in the 107th position among 121 nations. India's rank was 101 in 2020. India is ranked behind its neighbours Nepal (81), Pakistan (99), Sri Lanka (64), and Bangladesh (84). The GHI, which lists countries by ‘severity', has given India a score of 29.
