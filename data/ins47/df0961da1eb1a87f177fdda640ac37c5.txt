marchmeena29/iStock via Getty Images Introduction Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) is one of the two utilities in my portfolio - the other is Duke Energy (DUK). I've covered the stock in the past as it's one of my favorite defensive stocks. In this article, I want to assess the stock from a dividend growth investor's point of view. The bad news is that XEL is somewhere stuck in the middle when it comes to dividend growth investing. Its yield is below peer average and not what some are looking for when buying utilities, while its dividend growth isn't high enough to warrant an investment in a somewhat low yield for a lot of investors.
