In my tests for the best robot vacuums, the iRobot Roomba s9+ cleaned up as the best robot vacuum overall winner. Read on for my in-depth review. After spending over a month putting seven robot vacuums through their paces cleaning cereal, coffee grounds and baking soda, I found that the best robot vacuum overall was the iRobot Roomba s9+. Several features make the s9+ clearly superior to its competitors. It has a unique D-shape, allowing it to get closer to corners and walls for a more comprehensive clean; the self-emptying base means you don't have to fuss with a dust bin over the trash can after each cycle; and the connected iRobot app is super simple to use to schedule cleaning from afar.
