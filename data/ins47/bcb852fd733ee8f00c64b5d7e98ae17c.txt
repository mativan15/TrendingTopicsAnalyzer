New Huddersfield boss Mark Fotheringham's father runs a scaffolding business in Scotland – now he's trying to build a Terriers side who are poles apart in the Championship. Once Celtic's youngest-ever player when Kenny Dalglish handed him his debut as a 16-year-old 22 years ago, Fotheringham used to clean Paul Lambert's boots an an apprentice. Lambert, who went on to win the European Cup with Borussia Dortmund, cheerfully described himself as 'the crap one' in an outstanding side. Fotheringham followed Lambert's trail from Scotland to Germany, where his last stop was as assistant to ex-Fulham manager Felix Magath at Hertha Berlin.
