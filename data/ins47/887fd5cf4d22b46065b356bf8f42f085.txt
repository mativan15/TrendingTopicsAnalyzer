In addition to several other Silent Hill announcements, today we learned that one of the upcoming new Silent Hill entries is being co-produced by a surprising pairing: Annapurna Interactive, and NoCode Studios. It's called Silent Hill: Townfall.Announced at today's Silent Hill Transmission Livestream, Silent Hill: Townfall's reveal consisted of a series of unsettling images. Most of the teaser swapped between images of ocean waves in black and white (and, at the end, bright red) and a slow zoom in to a pocket CRTV while a voice demanded to know why the listener was here.
