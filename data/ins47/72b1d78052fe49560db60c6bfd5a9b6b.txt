Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has aimed a dig at his rival Jurgen Klopp over Liverpool's title prospects this season.
Liverpool beat City 1-0 last Sunday in a heated affair at Anfield and it seems tensions are still relatively high between the two clubs and their managers.
Going into the fixture, the Reds were trailing the Citizens by 13 points after an awful start to the season, with Klopp claiming that his team were already out of the running for the Premier League title.
This view wasn't shared by Guardiola who even claimed that Liverpool were still his side's biggest challengers in the title race, snubbing the likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and league leaders Arsenal in the process.
