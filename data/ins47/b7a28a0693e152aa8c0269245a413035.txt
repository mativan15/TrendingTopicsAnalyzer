European Union leaders have agreed a compromise deal to ban more than two-thirds of Russian oil following weeks of wrangling over a new sanctions package.Charles Michel, the European Council chief, said the deal would cut a 'huge source of financing for Russia's war machine' as the bloc ramps up economic pressure on Moscow.The ban will not affect imports delivered by pipeline and contains exemptions for Hungary – a landlocked country that relies heavily on crude piped from Russia.EU leaders also agreed to cut off the largest Russian bank, Sberbank, from the SWIFT system and to ban three more Russian state-owned broadcasters, Mr Michel added.
