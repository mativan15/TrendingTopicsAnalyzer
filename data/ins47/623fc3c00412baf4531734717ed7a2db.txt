Genesis Trading has lost its newly appointed chief risk officer Michael Patchen after just three months in the job, according to a person close to Patchen.

Patchen was brought in at Genesis at the end of July when the firm's CEO, Michael Moro, stepped down amid a wave of job cuts. Genesis' Chief Operating Officer Derar Islim was made interim CEO, while finance veteran exec Tom Conheeney was brought in as a Senior Advisor.

Genesis' cryptocurrency lending business revealed it had a large exposure to failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital back in July of this year.
