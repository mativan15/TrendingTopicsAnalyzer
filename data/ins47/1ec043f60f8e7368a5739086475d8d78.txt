Liz Truss's government was tonight rocking on its foundations, after a day of chaos which saw the shock dismissal of her home secretary followed within hours by the apparent resignation of her chief whip.Suella Braverman launched a savage broadside on the prime minister after being sacked from the Home Office for breaking security rules, effectively accusing her of breaking pledges to voters and failing to take responsibility for her mistakes.And there were allegations of bullying in the House of Commons as Ms Truss survived a Labour challenge to her decision to lift the ban on fracking, but provoked chief whip Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig Whittaker into fury over a U-turn over their efforts to bring rebellious Tories into line.
