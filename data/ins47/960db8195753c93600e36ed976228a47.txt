There's big news on the gas side of the Corolla family, too. The LE, the most popular grade, now has the 169-horsepower 2.0-liter Dynamic Force four-cylinder engine used in all other gas grades. Replacing a 139-hp 1.8-liter engine, it offers much more dynamic performance (0-60 two seconds quicker than with the 1.8L engine). Yet, it is also more efficient, improving on the previous engine fuel economy ratings by nearly two miles per gallon with a manufacturer-estimated 31 city/40 hwy./34 combined MPG.
