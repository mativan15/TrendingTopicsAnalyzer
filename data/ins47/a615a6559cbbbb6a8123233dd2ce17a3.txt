Treasures from yesteryear are being discovered in a 1800s school house, but it's the safe that could hold the biggest mystery. Items pulled from the under the floorboards and inside the walls of Nelson's Hardy Street School House give away clues of its time as a girls' school between 1860 and 1897, including slate boards with slate pencils, English Grammar books, 19th century newspapers, and what appears to be the remains of a Victorian style woman's jacket. Nelson resident Jason Monopoli purchased the building two years ago and has been renovating the inside of the heritage listed building.
