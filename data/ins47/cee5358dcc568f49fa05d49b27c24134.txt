The Boston Celtics are a team on a mission after falling just short of winning an NBA title in the 2022 Finals, with the roster having been augmented to address their experience-thin bench, and their resolve toughened by the loss to the Golden State Warriors in six games.
Now, the Celtics will integrate Malcolm Brogdon, Blake Griffin, and maybe even Danilo Gallinari with some luck as they take the court under interim head coach Joe Mazzulla for the first time on Tuesday, Oct. 18. With an NBA title their goal, Boston looks the part of a contender on the parquet as they build on the foundation they laid last season.
