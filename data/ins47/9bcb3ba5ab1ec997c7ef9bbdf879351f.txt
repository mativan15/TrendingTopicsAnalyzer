According to a statement released by both nation's broadcasters, the cost of participating in the music competition has been a key factor in them choosing to withdraw.They join Russia on the list of non-participating nations so far. Russia was banned from competing in the 2022 contest due to the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, with the ban remaining in place for next year.Each broadcaster of the contest pays a fee to have their country take part, which is based on the size of the country.However, some countries have been asked to pay more due to the absence of Russia, previously a large financial contributor towards the show, according to a BBC report.
