I just landed a role 4 months ago as a Sales and Operations Analyst with a Supply chain technology company that provides EDI( electronic data interchange) for businesses.

I have worked in sales as an account manager for 3 years before that and decided selling wasnt for me. I applied for the sales analyst role as I thought suited my temperament more.

My current day to day role involves data analysis of sales data, forecasting, territory planning, determining close rates, win/loss rates, ad hoc reports, compensation analysis, salesforce administration and optimization and contract administration/deal desk management.
