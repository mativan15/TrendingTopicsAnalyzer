Manchester United have been told to sign Raphinha from arch-rivals Leeds United by former defender Paul Parker - with the ex-right-back claiming the Brazilian would be a very good signing for the Red Devils.Raphinha joined the Whites from Rennes in the summer of 2020 and instantly endeared himself to the Elland Road faithful with a string of impressive performances. The winger star was Leeds' player of the season last time out as they escaped relegation on the final day with a hard-fought victory over Brentford in the capital.
