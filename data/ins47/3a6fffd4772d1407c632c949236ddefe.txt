MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Mexico's economy likely stagnated in September after two months of expansion, according to a preliminary estimate provided by the national statistics agency on Thursday.

The Economic Activity Indicator (IOAE) did not register any variation compared to the previous month.

For Mexico's secondary sector, which includes manufacturing activities, no monthly variation is expected in September either, while for the tertiary sector, covering services, a 0.1% contraction is anticipated, according to the report.
