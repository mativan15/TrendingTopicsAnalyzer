If there is a sure-fire way to make money during these bleak economic and geopolitical times, it may be a bet on Brad Jacobs's next move. The billionaire CEO of XPO Logistics is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building a company that jumped in market value to about $10bn from about $160m.
