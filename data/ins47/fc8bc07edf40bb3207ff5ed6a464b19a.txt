A Gwinnett County charity is collecting donations of unexpired baby formula during the ongoing nationwide shortage. 'Helping Mama' says low income mothers are in desperate need of scarce formula to feed their babies.

'We are getting calls daily not just from moms that need it, but other organizations, health clinics, health departments. We had one mom say she was looking everywhere and was down to less than a week of formula when we gave her some,' said 'Helping Mama' Founder Jamie Lackey.
