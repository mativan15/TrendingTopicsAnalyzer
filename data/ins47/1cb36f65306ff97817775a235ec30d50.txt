Jalen Brunson had a full training camp and four preseason games to acclimate himself with his new teammates, and now the games start for real for the Knicks and their imported $104 million point guard.
Ready or not, the Knicks face a stern opening test Wednesday night in Memphis against Ja Morant and the Grizzlies before returning to the Garden for the home opener Friday against the Pistons. A first unit featuring Brunson and four returning starters largely appeared ready and cohesive throughout a 3-1 preseason slate.
