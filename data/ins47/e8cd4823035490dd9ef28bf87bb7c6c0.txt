Alex Wong/Getty Images News A hush fell over the crowd at the Berkshire Hathaway 2022 Annual Meeting as Warren Buffett announced his decision to slow Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) share repurchases. Berkshire has now outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 5 years, thanks to Buffett's historic buybacks and timely purchases of Apple (AAPL) shares, beginning in 2016. However, the stock is no longer the blatant value it was. Berkshire trades around 19x our estimate of its true earnings power. While long-term investors can be fairly certain they will get their money back from an investment in BRK.
