Point Piper's trophy home colloquially known as 'the Bang & Olufsen house' has, for almost a decade, stood as an unofficial monument to the wealth and stature of its rumoured owner Yafu Qiu, head of Chinese textile giant Shandong Ruyi.But early this year, creditors and liquidators started circling Ruyi's debt-laden fashion subsidiaries, and it seems the Qiu family hopes to make what one source dubbed a 'quiet exit' from the landmark Sydney house.The Bang & Olufsen house last traded in 2013 for $33.
