House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will not hand a 'blank check' to Ukraine if his party wins next month's elections, apparently confirming that bipartisan congressional support for Ukraine's fight against Russia is wavering.

McCarthy, speaking to Punchbowl News, acknowledged the significance of the conflict, but said Americans are dealing with economic problems at home and can't afford to prioritize helping Ukraine.

'I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,' McCarthy said.
