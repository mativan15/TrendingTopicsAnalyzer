The office of the New Jersey Attorney General will investigate the unusual murders of a well-known couple in the state who were found killed in their home in 2014 but have yet to be solved.

The news of the fresh probe comes after the WNYC Studios podcast series Dead End: A New Jersey Political Murder Mystery reviewed the deaths of John and Joyce Sheridan.

They were found in their bedroom early on 28 September 2014 after being stabbed to death and the room having been set aflame, Gothamist reported.
