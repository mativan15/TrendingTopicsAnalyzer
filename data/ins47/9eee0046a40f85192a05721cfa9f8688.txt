NEW YORK -- Whenever the Yankees needed him over the course of 162 games, Aaron Judge always seemed to be ready with a home run, no matter what situation the Bronx Bombers found themselves in, en route to becoming New York's new American League home run king with 62 long balls.
This postseason, that story hasn't played out as well as Judge and the Yankees might have hoped, as he started the American League Division Series 0-for-8 -- his first-inning strikeout Tuesday gave him 10 total in the best-of-five set, an instance that has happened to only 13 players (twice for Judge, both coincidentally against the Guardians).
