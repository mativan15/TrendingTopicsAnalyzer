Published: 14:00 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 14:00 EDT, 2 June 2022 It's a widespread problem at schools in cities around the world, and now a new study has warned that noise pollution can affect children's memory.Researchers from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health studied children attending 38 schools in Barcelona.They found that children at schools with higher traffic noise had slower cognitive development.'Our study supports the hypothesis that childhood is a vulnerable period during which external stimuli such as noise can affect the rapid process of cognitive development that takes place before adolescence,' said Jordi Sunyer, an author of the study.
