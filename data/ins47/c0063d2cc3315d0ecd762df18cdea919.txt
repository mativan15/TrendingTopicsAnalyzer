Months before sanctioning the release of convicted rapists and killers in the Bilkis Bano case of the 2002 Gujarat riots, the Union Home Ministry framed guidelines that 12 categories of convicts, including 'prisoners convicted for the offence of rape' are not eligible to be released prematurely under a special remission scheme to commemorate 75 years of Independence.On June 10, to celebrate the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav programme, the Ministry wrote to all the States where it proposed to give special remission to certain categories of prisoners in three phases – August 15, 2022, January 26, 2023 and August 15, 2023 – where the concurrence of the Union government is required.
