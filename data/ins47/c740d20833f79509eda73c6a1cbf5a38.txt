VALLETTA (Reuters) - Demonstrators in Malta marked five years since the car bomb murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on Sunday, two days after two brothers admitted to her killing and were each sentenced to 40 years in prison.

Many of those present carried pictures of Caruana Galizia and Maltese flags. They chanted: "Daphne was right" and "We want full justice".

European Parliament president Roberta Metsola, who is from Malta, laid flowers at the site where the explosion occurred close to Caruana Galizia's home, accompanied by Daphne's husband, their three sons and Maria Falcone, sister of Italian anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, who was killed by a car bomb in 1992.
