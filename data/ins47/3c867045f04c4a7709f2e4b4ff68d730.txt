Boris Johnson "is the best choice" to replace Liz Truss in the newly-launched Conservative leadership contest, a prominent Ukrainian politician has told Express.co.uk. Mr Johnson resigned after overwhelming pressure from his own party and Cabinet just three months ago, triggering a drawn-out leadership contest from which Liz Truss emerged as the winner.As he was ousted from office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky paid homage to his 'true friend', and said he hoped 'close relations' between No 10 and Kyiv would continue.
