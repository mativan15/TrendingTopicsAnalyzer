An open letter to the Aurora City Council:

Esteemed Alderpeople, I write to you today so that your friends, family and neighbors will read it and perhaps discuss its contents with you. Like myself, most people are probably not tuned in to all the comings and goings of our city's government. But this casino deal is so bad, so egregious, that I had to speak up.

Per the terms of this deal, the City of Aurora will provide $50 million in general obligation bond funds to sweeten the pot. The city's Office of Economic Development clarified that this is probably closer to $58 million when you include all interest and fees.
