In the latest stop of his UK tour, only days after winning a multimillion-dollar defamation trial against Amber Heard, Johnny Depp was spotted holding a cub badger in Kent.'Guess who's been to see us,' Folly Wildlife Rescue Trust wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday, which received thousands of likes. 'That's the real Johnny Depp!'The actor visited in a break from touring with the musician Jeff Beck, a patron of the charity. Depp accompanied Beck's wife, Sandra, the charity wrote, as they toured the hospital and he held an orphaned badger cub, Freddie – 'as in Mercury', it added.
