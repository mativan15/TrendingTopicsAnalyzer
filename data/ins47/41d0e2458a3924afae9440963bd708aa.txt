It looks like one of Love Island's strongest couples, Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran, have split.
After finding love on the reality dating show last year, the pair are believed to have broken up after Chloe jetted to Morocco with former co-star Millie Court last week.
Over the weekend, Chloe told her social media followers that ‘you know I f***ed off for a week to Morocco with Millie… yo all I had to say was I want to go and she did everything. Millie Court deserves the f***ing world.'
She later added a photo of herself on holiday on Instagram and captioned it, ‘took a break and f***ed off to Morocco and want to award Millie Court the award for being the best f***ing friend I've ever had.
