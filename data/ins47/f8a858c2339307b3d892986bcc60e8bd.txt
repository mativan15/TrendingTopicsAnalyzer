The Christian Democrats, and Nile, survived the threatened coup but a declining membership base over the next two years, including a nasty court battle with former party treasurer Charles Knox, resulted in Nile being locked out of the party's headquarters.In a note to his supporters after his party was dissolved, Nile apologised, saying 'key governance issues in our party, as well as the character and intentions of members and supporters of this party, have been misunderstood'.'This is not the end of Christians in politics but indeed a new beginning.
