Mumbai: The decade-old retrospective tax controversy that put India on the global map is finally over with the tax department withdrawing its petition from the Supreme Court challenging a 2015 high court ruling favouring Sanofi. While Sanofi, like many other multinationals, settled this with the taxman under India's plan to rescind the indirect transfer of assets amendment or retrospective tax amendment in December, the appeal in Supreme Court was yet to be withdrawn. In a May 6 order, the apex court dismissed all the appeals.
