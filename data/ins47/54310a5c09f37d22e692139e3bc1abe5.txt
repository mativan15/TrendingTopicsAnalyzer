The New York Giants are coming into a road game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with plenty of momentum after winning five of their first six games of 2022. For the Jaguars to get their first win of October, the team will have to crack a Giants defense that has allowed the seventh fewest points in the NFL.
Fortunately for the Jaguars, head coach Doug Pederson said the team can draw on experience from a couple previous opponents.

'You can look back earlier in the season, I think a little bit of the Washington [Commanders game, even the [Los Angeles] Chargers game in there where they want to mix multiple personnel, play five man fronts, get after the passer, make you throw the football,' Pederson said of the Giants defense.
