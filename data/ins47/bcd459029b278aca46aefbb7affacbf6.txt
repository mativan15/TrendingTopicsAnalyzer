A cafe in the UK has come up with an epic way to reward customers for simply being polite.
Chaii Stop's new policy means a chai tea could cost you $2.12 if you are polite or $5.59 if you're rude.
A sign at the Preston cafe explains the pricing gauge.
If a customer were to ask, 'Hello, Desi Chai please', they could expect to pay $2.12 for their drink.
'Desi Chai, please' will get you your tea for 3.35.
And you will be stung $5.59 for ordering your tea by saying 'Desi Chai'.
Usman Hussain said he hoped the method would promote 'good vibes only' in his business.
