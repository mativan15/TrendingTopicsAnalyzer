AsiaVision/E+ via Getty Images Healthcare plays remain a long-term trend that should reward investors, given longer life expectancies and the aging baby boomer population. It can be tricky, however, to bet on the right horses, as certain companies come with plenty of risk. That's why it may make sense to buy into drug distributors, which serve as the "pipelines" of the healthcare industry. This brings me to AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), which I found to be rather cheaply priced last year. Since I covered it in March of last year, ABC has returned 38% based on share price appreciation alone, far surpassing the 6% return of the S&P 500 (SPY) over the same timeframe.
