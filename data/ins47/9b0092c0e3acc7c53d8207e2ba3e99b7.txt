Michael Avenatti, the high-profile lawyer who took on President Trump, was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison for cheating his most famous client, porn star Stormy Daniels. Combined with his previous conviction for attempting to extort Nike, he now faces a total of five years behind bars — and it could still grow. He has yet another trial on separate fraud charges slated to begin in California later this summer. Avenatti, in a lengthy statement to the court during his sentencing, said he'd made 'mistakes' and had 'disappointed scores of people and failed in a cataclysmic way.
