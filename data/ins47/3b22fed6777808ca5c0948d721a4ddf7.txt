NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Axial, the online M&A platform for buyers, advisors, and sellers of small and medium-sized businesses, has released its Q3 2022 Lower Middle Market Investment Banking League Tables. Despite rising inflation and the looming threat of an economic recession, there is light at the end of the tunnel as signaled by growing employment, decreased oil prices and ongoing improvement in consumer spending. And nowhere is this clearer than in the lower middle market, which continues to see robust deal flow despite slightly relaxed growth in Q3.
