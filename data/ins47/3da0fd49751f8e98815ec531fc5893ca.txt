After a momentous return this year following the coronavirus pandemic, music lovers are already gearing up for Glastonbury Festival 2023.
The event will take place from June 21 to 25 at Worthy Farm, with tickets set to go on sale from early November – though they'll set you back a whopping £340.
This year's festival saw performances from an array of all-star acts, including headline slots from Billie Eilish and Sir Paul McCartney– with Diana Ross and Kendrick Lamar closing the show.
Naturally, festival goers are already trying to deduce who will be performing at next year's event with rumours flying around who could nab the coveted headline spots.
