CHAPEL HILL — North Carolina basketball target Matthew Mayer has picked Illinois as his transfer destination.

The former Baylor wing forward announced the decision Friday night in a social media post, choosing coach Brad Underwood and the Fighting Illini ahead of Memphis, Texas Tech and the Tar Heels.

No need for Mayer to wait anymore on making a choice, apparently. He could've visited the campuses of prospective suitors as soon as this weekend, when a dead period lifts Saturday on the NCAA men's basketball recruiting calendar.
