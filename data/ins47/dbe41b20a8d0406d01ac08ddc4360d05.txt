The Miami Dolphins defense depth took a hit during their Week 6 loss against the Minnesota Vikings

The Miami Dolphins placed cornerback Nik Needham on injured reserve Wednesday in a move that was expected, but the unfortunate development is that he was joined by veteran edge defender Trey Flowers.

Both players were injured during the Dolphins' 24-16 loss against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, with Needham going down with an Achilles injury and Flowers leaving the game with a back injury.

While Needham will be out for the season, there has been no word on the severity of Flowers' injury — though it's obviously serious enough to cause him to miss at least four games.
