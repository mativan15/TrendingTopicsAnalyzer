Back in 2005, when I was younger, Resident Evil 4 looked so cool. Then I found out that it would only be released on the Nintendo Gamecube, which I didn't own. My dreams were shattered because I was a dumb kid and didn't realize that one day it would come to more consoles. Since that sad moment in my life, RE4 has been released on nearly every platform possible. And every time a new port is released, I can't stop myself from buying it again and again.
