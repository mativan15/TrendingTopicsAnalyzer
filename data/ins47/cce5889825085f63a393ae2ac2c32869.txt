After missing two games with a sprained right shoulder, Detroit Lions running back D'Andre Swift is trending towards being back in the lineup Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys.

"I'm pushing towards that," Swift said Wednesday. "Like I said, taking it day by day."

Swift, who leads all NFL players at 8.6 yards per carry, returned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday and said he is "definitely going in the right direction" from a health standpoint.

Detroit Lions running back D'Andre Swift is hugged by coach Dan Campbell at the end of the 36-27 win over the Washington Commanders at Ford Field, Sept.
