Almost three weeks after the Terra blockchain collapsed and TerraUSD lost its peg to the dollar, a new iteration of the Terra blockchain is set to launch, dubbed Terra 2.0 or Luna 2.0. A new Luna coin will also be minted in the process. Here's what you need to know.
What is Luna 2.0? It's a fork of the original Luna blockchain, which will see the launch of a coin named Luna.
Doesn't the Luna coin already exist? Yes, but the old Luna coin, which became virtually worthless earlier this month, will be renamed Luna Classic and traded under the ticker LUNC, reports Bloomberg.
