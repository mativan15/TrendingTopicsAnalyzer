DALLAS, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- October 31 is near, and in 2022 parents may be more enthusiastic about escorting their kids out on Trick-or-Treat expeditions than they were the past two Halloweens. But as long as we're extra-focused on our children's health, why not consider an alternative to those sugary treats?
For the past four years, the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) has hosted its Cash for Candy campaign, with the goal of encouraging parents to give kids cash instead of candy on Halloween – and use the moment as a teachable one to build children's money management skills.
