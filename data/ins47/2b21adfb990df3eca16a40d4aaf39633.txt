DEHRADUN: Despite the Indian government's advisory to "immediately leave war-torn Ukraine following escalation in attacks by Russia ", over 1,500 Indian students, who went back a few months ago, are refusing to leave, saying they want to complete their studies in Ukraine, even if that means they have to "come back in coffins.""We are not going to leave after returning here just a few months ago, having faced all sorts of odds. We will only go back to India after completing our studies or in coffins, in case we die in the ongoing turmoil," said one of the students in Ukraine, who agreed to be identified only by his last name, Sharma.
