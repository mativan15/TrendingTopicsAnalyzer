A mum of two from Orpington will be cycling around London to raise money in memory of her husband who died in 2015.

Emma Plowman, of Orpington, is preparing to cycle 50km overnight from June 11 to raise money for the Brain Tumour Research charity.

The 39-year-old will complete the Nightrider London challenge with her friend Alix Duplock.

Emma's husband Paul, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in August 2013 and died of sepsis two years later.

Emma said: 'Paul's brain tumour was actually shrinking, and he appeared to be making a recovery when he started to suffer with gallstone pain.
