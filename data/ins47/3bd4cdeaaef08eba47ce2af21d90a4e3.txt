If you're on the hunt for a new laptop, don't let marketing get the better of you. Recent ads and tech conferences may tempt you to buy the latest and greatest gear, but you don't always need to purchase a new HP model or an upcoming release to get your hands on a capable machine. While the consumer electronics industry pumps out shiny new devices, you might satisfy your needs with a refurbished one and save a few bucks.
Take this HP EliteBook, for example. This refurbished laptop comes with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed (a $199 value on its own) and usually retails for $527, but you can get one now for $399 with no coupon necessary.
