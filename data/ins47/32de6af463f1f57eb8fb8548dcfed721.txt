It offers a variety of solutions, digital technologies, and services to various actors along the fresh produce value chain to improve the quality and extend the shelf life of the products. The company has been very turbulent, and this is because agricultural stocks are very volatile. Since 2020, the corporation has been on a downward trend, possibly because of the Covid 19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted the world economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and produced volatility and upheaval of financial markets.
