Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, BERTRAND BUSSELL, philosopher and mathematician, now in his ninety-first year, has led the forces in Britain that demand an end to nuclear testing. He says and believes that it is later than we think.THE danger of a nuclear war is viewed by a great many people with an easygoing optimism. They are persuaded that a nuclear war would be horrible, and they think that both sides would shrink from it. I wish I could share this view, but there is much expert testimony tending to show that a nuclear war is not only possible but probable.
