Former Punjab minister and BJP leader Sunder Sham Arora was arrested by the state vigilance bureau for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 50 lakh to one of its officers to help him clear his name in the inquiries against him, a top official said on Sunday. Arora was arrested on Saturday night in Zirakpur in Mohali when he tried to allegedly handover the cash to the Assistant Inspector General of the vigilance bureau. He is the third former minister of the previous Congress government to be arrested after the AAP government came to power in March this year.
