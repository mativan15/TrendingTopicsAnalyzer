A day after singer-turned-politician Sidhu Moosewala was gunned down in broad daylight, the Punjab police struggled for leads in the killing. Sources said a number of persons had been detained for questioning from across districts, including one person from Uttarakhand, who was reportedly disguised as a pilgrim on way to Hemkund Sahib.
