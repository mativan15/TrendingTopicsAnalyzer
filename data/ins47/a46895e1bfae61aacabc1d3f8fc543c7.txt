The union's Scottish organiser, Kevin Lindsay, said more talks with the rail operator would take place on Monday. He said his aim was to avoid industrial action by negotiating a deal that was acceptable to his members. But he warned that the railways could be hit by a series of 24-hour strikes if the issue is not resolved.
