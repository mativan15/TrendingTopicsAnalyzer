Doom seemed inevitable when Dak Prescott broke the thumb on his throwing hand against the Buccaneers in the Cowboys' season opener.
The prolific passer and two-time Pro Bowler was responsible for so much in offensive coordinator Kellen Moore's scheme that it was hard to imagine Dallas staying afloat long enough for Prescott to get healthy and elevate his team again.
Roughly six weeks later, after the 4-2 Cowboys exceeded all expectations without their talisman and with Prescott set to practice full-go for the first time since early September — Dallas hasn't been in this advantageous of a position in a long time.
