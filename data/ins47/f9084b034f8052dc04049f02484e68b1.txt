Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen are arguably the two best young quarterbacks in the NFL, and they have the potential for a Peyton Manning/Tom Brady-level rivalry over their careers. Paired up for The Match, though, Mahomes got the festivities going early with a total roast of his partner.
On the set of Hot Seat Press Conference 2.0, hosted by J.J. Watt of the Arizona Cardinals, Mahomes was asked what he believes is Allen's biggest fear. 
'Josh Allen's biggest fear? A coin toss,' Mahomes deadpanned before letting out a grin.
