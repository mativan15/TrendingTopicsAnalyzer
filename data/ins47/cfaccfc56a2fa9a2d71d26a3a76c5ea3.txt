 As with many other popular memes, the origin of HODL can reportedly be traced back to a typo.
It all started when a user named GameKyuubi made a post on the crypto forum Bitcointalk in December 2013 with the title 'I AM HODLING.'
GameKyuubi explained in the post that he planned to 'hold' his Bitcoin (BTC) investments because he knew he was a bad trader.
In no time, the term HODL spread like wildfire throughout the crypto world.
