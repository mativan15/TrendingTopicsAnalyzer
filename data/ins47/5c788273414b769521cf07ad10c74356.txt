LIBRA
SEPT 23 - OCT 23
A new moon of travel firsts can bring a one-off weekend ticket
Your creative flow may feel slower, even stopped, thanks to Saturn - but this is a perfect moment to take stock, and throw out all the ideas you sense are not currently right for you.  
This will leave the one or two that can be winners.
In love, too, you can make deep change happen, but only if it's truly in your heart. 
A new moon of travel firsts can bring a one-off weekend ticket.

DESTINY DAYS: Stay away from gossip on Monday - it doesn't suit you.
