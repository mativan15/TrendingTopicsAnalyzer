In the wake of the Karnataka government's decision to hike reservation for SC/ST communities, Vokkaligas in the state have now raised the demand to increase the reservation for their community to 12 per cent. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the government can only act based on the recommendations of the courts and the Backward Classes Commission.
Prominent Vokkaliga seer Swami Nirmalanandanatha of Adichunchanagiri mutt said that though Vokkaligas comprise 16 per cent of the state's population, reservation for the community was only four per cent.
