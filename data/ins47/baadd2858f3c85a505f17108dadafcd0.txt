ISLAMABAD, Pakistan—Pakistan's Election Commission barred former Prime Minister Imran Khan from holding office, according to his party, further roiling Pakistan's tumultuous politics.

The disqualification Friday was issued over official gifts that Mr. Khan had received as prime minister from foreign governments, some of which he later sold. The Election Commission ruled that he hadn't properly declared the gifts and transactions, lawyers said. It wasn't immediately clear how long the disqualification would last.
