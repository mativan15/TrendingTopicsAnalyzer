Insurance sector regulator Irdai on Friday relaxed capital requirement norms significantly for insurers to encourage their participation in the government's flagship programme Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY). The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has reduced the capital required to be held by insurers offering PMJJBY by almost 50 per cent. This move will enable life insurers to offer more policies under the scheme, and provide financial security to the bottom of the pyramid of the Indian population through life insurance, Irdai said in a statement.
