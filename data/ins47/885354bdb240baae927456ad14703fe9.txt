When Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he unveiled a sweeping vision for the 'great rejuvenation' of the country — a "dream' that would make China powerful and prosperous. Ten years later, Xi has transformed China. He has consolidated the country as a force on the world stage, with an expansive economic footprint, a modernizing military and rising technological prowess. But China has also become an increasingly restrictive place for its citizens, with swift suppression of dissent, pervasive surveillance and mounting social controls, which have only grown more pronounced under Xi's costly and isolating zero-Covid policy.
