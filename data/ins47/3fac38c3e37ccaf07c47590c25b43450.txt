Virgin Money has launched a new incentive for new and existing customers called Virgin Red - a club that turns everyday spending into points that unlock rewards.Every month everyone will be given the chance to enter a free prize draw as long as they make at least one transaction a month.What's more, new customers switching to the Virgin Money M Plus Account and Virgin Money Club M Account will also receive a bonus of 20,000 Virgin Points to spend.The points can be spent on whatever people want but some other ideas include Virgin Wines, three course meals or an Astronaut Experience for two at Space Store.
