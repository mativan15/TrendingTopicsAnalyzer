Former civil servant and Backto60 campaigner Pauline Hinder lamented the lack of appropriate measures targeted at helping her age bracket cope with growing costs in Jeremy Hunt's mini-budget announcement. Ms Hinder questioned the removal of the energy price guarantee from next April, noting that 1950s women have already had to make do with six years less in state pension payments and will face further struggles. Speaking to Sky News, Ms Hinder said: "Why haven't they brought back triple-lock in one of the most difficult years since the 70s?"They've left that out.
