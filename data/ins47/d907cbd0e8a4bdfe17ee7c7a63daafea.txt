Paul Vance, who has died aged 92, wrote scores of songs for artists such as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Johnny Mathis, but will be remembered chiefly for the novelty tune Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini, a worldwide hit in 1960.
The inspiration for the song came from a family trip to Long Island. His wife had bought their infant daughter Paula a new bathing costume, but when some boys made fun of her skimpy attire, shouting she had no clothes on, she retreated to the locker room and refused to come out.
