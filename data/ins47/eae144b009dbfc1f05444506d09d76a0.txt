Despite some fans' dreams, it's not likely Dallas is going to rush to the phone lines to spend the extra cap space gained by spring's release of La'el Collins. The Cowboys had $13 million of cap space already, more than enough to work with and sign someone from the remaining free agency pool. The additional $10 million moves Dallas into the top 5 of teams with cap space going into the season.

As has been pointed out over and over again in this space, while Dallas could still sign someone this offseason, it appears they are preparing to make a push in the 2023 offseason.
