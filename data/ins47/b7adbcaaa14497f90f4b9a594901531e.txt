Downtown Winnipeg is an issue that comes up in every municipal election, and concerns over safety, business, pedestrians, motorists, and parking remain very relevant to the 2022 slate of mayoral candidates.
Glen Murray, who previously served as the city's mayor from 1998–2004, says big steps toward improving downtown by dealing with the ‘sea' of parking lots reducing walkability in the area.Murray told 680 CJOB he wants to redesign downtown streets so they're more accessible for walkers, but and still convenient for drivers.
