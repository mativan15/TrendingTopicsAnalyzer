Jun. 3—HIGH POINT — Scott Blackburn never really envisioned himself as a fiction writer, but the more fiction he read, the more he believed he could write it, too.

And now, seven or eight years after deciding to give it a try, the 39-year-old High Point man stands on the brink of releasing his debut novel, a mystery/thriller titled "It Dies With You" (Crooked Lane Books, $26.99). The book will officially be released Tuesday, and Blackburn has a book launch event scheduled for that evening at High Point's Sunrise Books.
