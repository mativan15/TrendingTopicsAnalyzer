The Washington Post issued a lengthy correction to its report from its "internet culture" columnist Taylor Lorenz, which was previously stealth-edited. Lorenz wrote an article Thursday about how content creators were the real winners of the explosive Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation lawsuit that concluded this week due to larger followings and spikes in revenue during the six-week trial. Her article cited two YouTube personalities, "LegalBytes" host Alyte Mazeika and an anonymous user named ThatUmbrellaGuy.
