Boris Johnson could be set for an unlikely return to frontline politics after a stunning poll saw him top a list of Conservative Party candidates in an election showdown against Keir Starmer. A fresh Opinium poll, carried out for the ITV Peston programme, has dealt another significant blow to Liz Truss' crisis-hit tenure as Prime Minister. Ms Truss is clinging onto power in No10 ahead of a crunch meeting of the 1922 Committee.Earlier on Thursday, Sheryll Murray became the 11th Conservative MP to call for Liz Truss to stand down and says she has submitted a letter of no confidence to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.
