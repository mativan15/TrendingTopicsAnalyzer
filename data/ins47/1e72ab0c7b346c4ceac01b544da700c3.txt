Allison, a 50-year-old office assistant from Nottingham, had recently ended a relationship, and was keen to meet someone new. Logging on to a dating website, she met a person claiming to be a Naval officer. He said his name was Karl Jones, which was in fact an alias, as he had used an entirely fake identity.She told Rip Off Britain: 'He was American Navy, and the photo was absolutely gorgeous. It started from there.'The pair quickly hit it off, and their conversation moved off the website onto a private messaging service.
