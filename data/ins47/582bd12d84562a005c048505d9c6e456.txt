Grace Torres' photography business is more than a passion project that turned into a career. To the 23-year-old, it represents financial freedom. After falling in love with photography at age 13, Torres spent years documenting Sweet 16 parties in New Jersey for little pay and working at Chick-Fil-A to afford a $500 set of camera equipment. While attending Southeastern University in Lakeland, Florida, she earned some clients and cash – but wasn't confident that photography could pay the bills after college.
