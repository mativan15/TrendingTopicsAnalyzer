TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A South Florida judge on Friday dropped charges against a Miami man swept up in Gov. Ron DeSantis' push to crack down on voter fraud, signaling an early legal loss for the administration's highly touted elections investigation unit.

Miami Judge Milton Hirsch dismissed two voting-related charges the state filed against 56-year-old Robert Lee Wood, claiming that Office of Statewide Prosecutor does not have jurisdiction in the case. The Office of Statewide Prosecutor brought the charges on behalf of the newly-formed Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security, which was created at DeSantis' urging during the 2022 legislative session to stop voter fraud.
