More than $163 billion in benefits likely leaked from the unemployment system during the pandemic, with a "significant portion" attributable to fraud, according to a U.S. Department of Labor report.Congress created many new programs in March 2020 to support millions of people who lost their jobs from the Covid-19 fallout. Together, the programs raised weekly benefits, increased their duration and expanded the pool of workers eligible for payments. They ended last September, though many states opted out sooner.
