CNN — Even the uber-rich are on edge now about the economy.Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, two of the wealthiest people on the entire planet (who generally don't agree on much of anything), are both signaling some tension about a looming recession.Bezos earlier this week commented that it's time to "batten down the hatches," in a tweet that included a video of Goldman Sachs' CEO saying there was a good chance of a recession on the horizon.Musk, for his part, was a little more sanguine as he sought (unsuccessfully, in the end) to ease Wall Street's concerns about Tesla's growth prospects.
