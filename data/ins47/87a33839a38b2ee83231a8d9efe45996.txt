Shares of beleaguered mobile e-sports company Skillz (SKLZ 20.43%) were surging 20.2% as of 3:43 p.m. ET, in stark contrast to the rest of the market, which was significantly in the red at that time.
Why the big pop today? It likely has to do with a combination of Skillz's beaten-down share price and the announcement of its new NFL game today. Given the popularity of American football in the U.S. and around the world, investors may be hopeful the new game will reignite Skillz's flagging engagement and sales.
