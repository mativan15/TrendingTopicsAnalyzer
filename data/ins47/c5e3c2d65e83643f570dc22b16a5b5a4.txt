A policy that aims to remove barriers for disabled people is continuing to receive criticism from the community. The strengths and shortcomings of the Accessibility for New Zealanders Bill were debated at a panel discussion on Monday. The Government says it will set up a new legislative framework, but critics believe it is unlikely to lead to change and is potentially harmful. Workbridge is an organisation that helps disabled people find employment and chief executive Jonathan Mosen said the bill has suffered from a lack of consultation.
