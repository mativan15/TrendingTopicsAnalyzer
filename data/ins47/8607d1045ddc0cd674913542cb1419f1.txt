(Bloomberg) --

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said that there are tough choices ahead on tax and spending as he seeks to calm financial markets, after weeks of chaos since Prime Minister Liz Truss came to power.

'We have some very difficult decisions ahead,' Hunt said on Saturday in a Sky News interview. 'The things that people want, the markets want, the country needs now is stability. No chancellor can control the markets. But what I can do is show that we can pay for our tax and spending plans.
