Published: 03:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 03:54 EDT, 20 October 2022 Labour will use 'every mechanism' at its disposal to topple the Conservative government, shadow Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray has said. The Edinburgh South MP said the Tory party was in 'complete shambles' amid growing pressure on Prime Minister Liz Truss. It follows claims of Tory MPs being 'manhandled' into supporting the Government during a vote on fracking in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted on Wednesday that the scenes were 'an utter shambles' and echoed calls for an election.
