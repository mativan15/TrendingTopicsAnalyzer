High-profile technology fund manager Cathie Wood took the Federal Reserve to task last week in an open letter warning that its ongoing rate-hiking policy risked an economic bust.Her displeasure isn't surprising, given rate hikes have decimated the speculative growth stocks that dominate Wood's flagship Ark Innovation ETF. The fund hit another 52-week low last week and is now down 77 per cent from February 2021′s peak, almost matching the Nasdaq's infamous 78 per cent collapse during the 2000-2002 dotcom bust.
