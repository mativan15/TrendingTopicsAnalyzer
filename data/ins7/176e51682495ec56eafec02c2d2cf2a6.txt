By Eric Cheung and Wayne Chang, CNNCNN — Taiwan and the United States could begin talks to deepen trade and economic ties "in a few weeks," two senior Taiwanese government officials told CNN on Friday.
The new discussions will "explore concrete ways to deepen the US-Taiwan trade and investment relationship," the officials said, with the focus on institutionalizing cooperation in supply chain resilience, labor, environment and sustainable development.
A formal announcement will come after "coordination and consultations are made," according to a senior official.
