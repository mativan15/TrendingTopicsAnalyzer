Thanksgiving and football remains an elite combination.

It's a pairing that has been in place since the NFL's founding in 1920, with the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys being two of the teams that routinely host a game on the annual holiday.

Detroit has traditionally hosted a contest since 1934 while Dallas, bar 1975 and 1977, have done the honors since 1966.

This year is no different, as the Lions and Cowboys are two of the six teams on the triple-header slate the league has lined up, with one of those squads returning from 2021.
