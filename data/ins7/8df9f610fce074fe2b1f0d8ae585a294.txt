United Nations inspectors are currently visiting Australia to see if we are on track to implement a critical new human rights framework for people in detention.Back in 2017, Australia ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (Opcat), designed to protect the rights, health and safety of people experiencing any kind of detention. This includes people in prisons, juvenile detention centres, immigration detention centres, hospitals, mental health facilities, aged care facilities and facilities for people with disability.
