Tencent Holdings, China's most valuable tech giant, has made significant inroads in its bid to attract a wider audience for short videos on its super app WeChat, as it seeks to challenge the dominance of TikTok's Chinese version, Douyin, and the country's second-largest player, Kuaishou. The Shenzhen-based company said in its latest quarterly report that the volume of videos and total viewing time on Channels, its WeChat-based short-video platform, saw "significant growth", thanks to more entertainment programming and improved algorithms.
