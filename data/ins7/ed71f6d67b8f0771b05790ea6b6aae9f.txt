Taser developer Axon said this week it is working to build drones armed with the electric stunning weapons that could fly in schools and 'help prevent the next Uvalde, Sandy Hook, or Columbine.' But its own technology advisers quickly panned the idea as a dangerous fantasy. 
The publicly traded company, which sells Tasers and police body cameras, floated the idea of a new police drone product last year to its artificial intelligence ethics board, a group of well-respected experts in technology, policing and privacy.
