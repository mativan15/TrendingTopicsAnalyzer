London CNN —

The resignation of Liz Truss on Thursday after a disastrous six-week premiership has set the ball rolling on the race to be the next Conservative Party leader.

A new leader, who as head of the largest party in the House of Commons becomes Britain's prime minister, is expected to be announced on Friday October 28, according to the Conservative Party official responsible for the process.

The opposition Labour Party, which opinion polls put on course for a landslide victory, immediately demanded an early general election.
