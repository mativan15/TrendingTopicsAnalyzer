Bowel cancer is not one of the most common cancers in the UK, but like all forms of the disease it is insidious and deadly. Around 42,000 people every year will be diagnosed with bowel cancer according to data from Cancer Research UK. Of those 42,000, 16,000 will die and just under half will not survive for 10 or more years after diagnosis. However, the earlier bowel cancer is spotted the more effective treatment will be.Symptoms of bowel cancer are most easily spotted during the process of defecation.
