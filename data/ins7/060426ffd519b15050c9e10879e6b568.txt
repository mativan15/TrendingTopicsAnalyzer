Wall Street is betting on a big comeback for Netflix after a no good, terrible start to 2022 where the streaming giant hemorrhaged subscribers amid fierce competition from the likes of Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.

Netflix posts third-quarter results after the stock market closes Tuesday, and co-chief executives Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos will lead a call with Wall Street analysts to map out their strategy. They are charging full-speed ahead to launch an advertising-supported version of the platform in November, and on Monday unveiled the first step to cash in on the massive number of subscribers who share passwords.
