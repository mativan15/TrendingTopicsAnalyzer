By KIMBERLEE KRUESI - Associated Press NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has signed off on a new campaign finance and ethics face-lift, bucking objections from some of the state's most influential advocacy groups who opposed the measure.'I think that transparency is a good idea," Lee told reporters earlier this month. "I think that whenever we have transparency into organizations that politically lobby, that's a good thing.'The Republican governor signed the measure Friday. The move comes as a federal investigation has hovered over the GOP-controlled General Assembly for over a year that has so far led to one Republican lawmaker pleading guilty to a federal wire fraud charge over allegations she helped carry out a political consulting kickback scheme.
