Another group of Wall Street market strategists have signaled to their clients that it's time to buy back into stocks – especially stocks that aren't trading in the US. While global equity funds saw their first net inflows over the past week since April, a group of analysts at Citigroup recommended to clients who are concerned about the durability of the rebound that they might be better off buying Europe or emerging-market equities, which have more attractive valuations than the US.
