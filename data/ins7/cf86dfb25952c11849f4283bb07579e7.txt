A Palmerston North retailer says government funding to protect small businesses from ram-raids does not address the problem. The Government announced a $6 million fund to protect small businesses on Monday, following an increase in ram -raid crimes throughout the country. It includes the formation of a crime prevention programme run by police, which will include the installation of bollards or other forms of protection. But Palmerston North Hunting and Fishing owner Simon O'Connor said the money was just 'the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff' for a societal issue that needed to start with greater accountability for offenders.
