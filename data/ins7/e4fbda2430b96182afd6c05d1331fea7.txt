CLEVELAND — Aaron Judge is back in his comfort zone. After leading in 36 games this season, the Yankees slugger, who has gotten off to a slow start in the playoffs, was dropped to the No. 2 spot in the Bombers' batting order for Saturday night's Game 3 of the American League Division Series against the Guardians at Progressive Field.

'Just kind of woke up on it. I just did not want to have all the focus on the first at-bat of the game, and settle in,' Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before the game.
