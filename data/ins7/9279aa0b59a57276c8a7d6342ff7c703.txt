Warning: There are mild spoilers ahead for "Black Adam," Dwayne Johnson's DC antihero movie.

The Rock and a shocking mid-credits scene are the best parts of the film.

The end offers a glimpse of hope for DC's future if they can get it together.

Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been telling us for two years that "Black Adam" will change the hierarchy of the DC universe.

Based on the film we saw, it won't.
