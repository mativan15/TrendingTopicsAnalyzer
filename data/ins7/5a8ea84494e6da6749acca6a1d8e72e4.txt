The UK's prime minister apologised as she admitted her government had made mistakes over the mini-budget last month that spooked the financial markets.

Liz Truss was speaking after new finance minister Jeremy Hunt ripped up her economic plans.

He dramatically reversed most of the tax cuts and spending proposals that his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng announced less than a month ago.

"Now I recognise we have made mistakes," Truss, who has only been in office a little more than a month, told the BBC.
