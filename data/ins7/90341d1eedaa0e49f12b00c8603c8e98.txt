When you're a top executive at the most popular NFT marketplace, you are automatically privy to information about key decisions that impact the price of NFTs. But if you trade on that non-public information, the Department of Justice will charge you in connection with an NFT insider trading scheme, as OpenSea's former head of product Nate Chastain found out this week. In a series of alleged insider trades last year, Chastain made a total profit of 18.875 ETH, or $33,200 in today's value. Now, Chastain has been arrested and faces decades in prison on charges related to what prosecutors called insider trading.
