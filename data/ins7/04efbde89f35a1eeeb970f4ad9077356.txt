The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) started firmly on the back foot on Friday as the Conservative party scrambles to find a new leader after Liz Truss stepped down on Thursday.

London's bluechip index tumbled 0.6% to 6,900 points after the opening bell, the CAC 40 (^FCHI) was 1.3% lower in Paris, while the DAX (^GDAXI) slid 1% in Frankfurt.

Truss's resignation after just 44 days in office makes her the shortest serving prime minister in modern British history.
