Last week, Bobcat Co. unveiled the new $70 million expansion of its Statesville manufacturing facility. This week, Statesville's city council is scheduled to consider a rezoning request from a developer seeking to build new apartments at a neighboring site.

Documents show that Statesville City Council will hold a public hearing at its meeting tonight to consider the first reading for a rezoning request from Elevation Real Estate Group. The company has applied to rezone a 16.7-acre site at Glenway Drive and James Farm Road to facilitate the development of up to 264 apartments, documents show.
