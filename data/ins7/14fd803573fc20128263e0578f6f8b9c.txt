Jun. 5—NEW HAMPSHIRE nonprofits are hopeful Granite Staters will share their summer stash during a 24-hour fundraising drive this week.

Kicking off at 5 p.m. Tuesday, nearly 600 nonprofits will be participating in NH Gives, an annual online event.

Last year, more than 14,000 people donated $3.8 million to 584 nonprofits through NHGives.org., according to the New Hampshire Center for Nonprofits, which launched NH Gives in 2016.

Since then, the event has raised $8.7 million. The participating nonprofits provide a variety of services, including feeding the hungry, mentoring youth and promoting the arts.
