The majority of Americans feel the U.S. is either in a recession, or headed towards one, according to a recent Maru Public Opinion survey compiled for Yahoo. A bit more than half of respondents say they are now stricter with their money habits.

The poll of 1,512 people shows 62% feel the country is already in a period of contraction. Another 19% believe the country is headed toward one.

'Based on what they've seen, read, heard, or are personally experiencing, two-thirds (62%) of Americans think the country is currently experiencing a recession compared to four in 10 (38%) who don't think that's the case,' states John Wright, executive vice president of Maru Public Opinion.
