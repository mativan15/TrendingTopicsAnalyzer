Despite fluctuating value, NFTS, "one-of-a-kind" digital artifacts, are still popular, with items ranging from videos to Tweets to paintings having been sold as digital collectibles. Now, Web3 and the Metaverse are staking a claim in a new frontier — real estate.

An NFT of a real-world home was sold for $175,000 over the weekend in Columbia, South Carolina.

The home boasts three bedrooms and was recently renovated, featuring a large living room and dining room area complete with a galley-style kitchen and walkout patio.
