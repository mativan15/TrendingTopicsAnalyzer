Graduate Roosevelt Island, which opened on June 1, 2021 on the Cornell Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island, transformed one of its big meeting rooms into "The Loft Suite," a room inspired by Josh Baskin's bachelor pad in Big.  RECOMMENDED: See inside Roosevelt Island's first-ever hotel opening this summer Photograph: Courtesy Graduate Hotel Roosevelt Island The room, which accommodates six, has a giant piano you can hop on to play, a Zoltar fortune teller machine that you can ask about your future, a trampoline you can jump on, a pinball machine, a basketball hoop, an inflatable T-rex, bunk beds, a Pepsi Cola vending machine and more retro toys from the movie.
