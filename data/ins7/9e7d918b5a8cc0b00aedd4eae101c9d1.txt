Democracy is often criticised as 'the tyranny of the majority', but in local government that couldn't be further from the truth. More often than not at the council level, democracy is the will of the minority. In our largest and least-engaged city, a new mayor was elected having won the support of 15% of Aucklanders. He had a compelling lead over his nearest rival, Efeso Collins, who had just 10% of eligible voters give him their support. The overwhelming majority of Aucklanders, at 65%, voted for no-one.
