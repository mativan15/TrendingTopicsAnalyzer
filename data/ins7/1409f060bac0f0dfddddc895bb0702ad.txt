LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) -

Yields on British 30-year government bond yields fell below 4% for the first time in more than two weeks on Wednesday after the Bank of England said it would not sell long-dated debt when it launches its quantitative tightening (QT) programme on Nov. 1.

The 30-year gilt yield fell as low as 3.966%, down about 30 basis points on the day and the yield on 20-year British government bonds similarly fell to a low of 4.135%.

Yields on other gilt maturities, which will be sold by the BoE from next month, fell less sharply on the day.
