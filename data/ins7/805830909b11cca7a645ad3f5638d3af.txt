Spring 2022 Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels constitutes about 80% of the human-made greenhouse gas emissions contributing to the Earth's rising temperature. Two researchers affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute—ROSEI for short—are working on a way to pull those harmful gases out of the air and convert them into a form of solid carbon useful in applications ranging from farming to construction. Changing for Good This is not the first time scientists have tried to combat CO2 emissions by turning the gas into a different substance, but most previous attempts processed it into fuels such as methanol, which create their own CO2 emissions when reused.
