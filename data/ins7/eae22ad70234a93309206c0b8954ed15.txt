A coastal management body in Mumbai has issued a show cause notice to Union minister Narayan Rane's bungalow in Juhu area here for alleged violation of the Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) norms, an official said on Tuesday. Earlier, the city civic body had also issued a notice to Rane's 'Aadhish' bungalow over alleged unauthorised construction and rejected his proposal for its regularisation. The latest notice, issued on May 24 by the District Level Coastal Management Committee, has asked M/s Artline Properties Private Limited to attend a personal hearing before the collector at 11 am on June 10.
