MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday held that a law in Maharashtra governing town planning does not exempt builders from payment of development charges when projects including those for redevelopment, are on civic or government land.The legislation never intended that a developer or any third party, who seeks to carry out redevelopment on a plot owned by a public body or Government for their personal gain, should be allowed to claim exemption merely because the land belongs to government or such body, said the bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and Kamal Khata.
