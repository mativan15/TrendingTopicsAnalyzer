One of Taranaki's most recognisable farmers, Bryan Hocken, has backed the Groundswell movement, joining farmers on Thursday as they protested the emissions tax in New Plymouth. Hocken, who was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's Birthday Honours, said the tax was 'bloody disgraceful'. 'The Government should have been listening to us.' His sentiment was echoed by other farmers who said the Government wasn't listening and has its head in the sand.
