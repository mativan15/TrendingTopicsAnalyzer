Rishi Sunak unveiled a £15billion package to help Britons struggling with the cost of living crisis throughout the country. The mammoth economic rescue plan is part-funded by a 25 percent windfall tax on gas and oil company profits. However, Catherine McBride, from the Centre for Brexit Policy, warned that these measures were simply "taking money out of our pensions".The economist told GB News: "I don't think we can afford to have an ad hoc taxation system."Whatever he wants to call it, by doing a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies, that is not a good way forward.
