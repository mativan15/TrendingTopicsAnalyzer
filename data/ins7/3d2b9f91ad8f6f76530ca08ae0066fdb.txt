It's been a chaotic week in the world of politics.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman spoke out against the ‘tofu eating wokerati' before resigning, TV coverage descended into pandemonium, and a lettuce did battle against Liz Truss before the Prime Minister stepped down after just 44 days.
Krishnan Guru-Murthy found himself embroiled in the madness and left rather red-faced after calling MP Steve Baker a c**t during a livestream.
The Channel 4 presenter butted heads with the Northern Ireland minister over the backlash Prime Minister Liz Truss faced from Tory rebels ahead of her resignation.
