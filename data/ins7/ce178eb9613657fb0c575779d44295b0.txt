In a heated interview with NBC News, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker confirmed that he gave a check to the now-mother of one of his children, but said is was not for an abortion.

Walker's ex-girlfriend told The Daily Beast earlier this month that the former NFL star sent her money in 2009 after asking her to abort their first child.

'Yes, that's my check,' Walker told NBC journalist Kristen Welker after being presented with an image of the $700 check endorsed by his signature.

However, the candidate said his ex-girlfriend was lying about the reason for the check, although he did not give an alternative reason for sending her the money.
