NEW YORK — When Manny Bañuelos reached the mound at Yankee Stadium on Friday night, many years after that dream seemed to have famously escaped him, catcher Jose Trevino offered a simple message. "Hey man, welcome home," Trevino recalled saying. "This is where you're supposed to be. This is where you are right now. Enjoy it." Formerly a touted New York Yankees prospect, Bañuelos finally got the chance to pitch in pinstripes 14 years after he first joined the organization and seven years after he was traded away.
