Oct. 18—Evan Mobley was the NBA Rookie of the Month last November in his first full month in the league. His shot from midcourt sealed the skills competition for Team Cavaliers at the All-Star Skills Competition, and he narrowly lost the Rookie of the Year award to Scottie Barnes of the Toronto Raptors.

Do not fear a sophomore jinx taking down Mobley in his second season with the Cavs. Or if something like that does happen, it won't be because the 21-year-old forward/center from USC spent the offseason with his feet up on the end of the couch, tossing peanuts in the air and catching them in his open mouth while watching his favorite television show.
