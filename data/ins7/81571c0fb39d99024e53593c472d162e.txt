The day has come when Netflix relented and gave a disclaimer that ‘The Crown' which is now launching its fifth season, is 'fictional'. As children and even some adults are prone to believing whatever the OTT dishes out as reality and people think that the stories narrated through Netflix are historical or real events. Netflix however has agreed to giving out disclaimers after mounting pressures from many quarters, especially Dame Judi Dench. So, Netflix states that theirs is a fictional dramatisation of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
