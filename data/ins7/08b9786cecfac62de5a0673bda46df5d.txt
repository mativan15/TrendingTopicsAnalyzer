Rebecca Leveridge was described as 'very manipulative' (Image: Leicester Mercury)Rebecca Leveridge, 52, walked free from court last week with a suspended sentence, despite years of dishonesty by "siphoning off" nearly £25,000 of Danny Gray's money. Mr Gray's two sons and his sister were "shocked" at the sentence as Leveridge, who had been with Mr Gray for 20 years despite never marrying, deliberately failed to tell him a lump sum of more than £30,000 was paid into his account, along with a £595 monthly allowance - after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
