Shawnee-based Fulcrum Global Capital has been riding a wave of success this year, exiting two successful investments, raising capital for a second fund and hiring more people to help manage a pipeline bursting with prospects.

Duane Cantrell, Kevin Lockett and John Peryam founded Fulcrum in 2019 after leaving the Kansas Bioscience Authority. The KBA aimed to accelerate growth in biosciences and generate jobs by serving as a self-sustaining venture capital organization. The KBA made about $34 million in direct investments in nine companies, including Leawood-based Aratana Therapeutics Inc.
