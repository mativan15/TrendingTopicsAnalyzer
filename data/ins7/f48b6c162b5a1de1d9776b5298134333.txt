Over the last couple of months, there's been some striking reporting about Jared Kushner and the generous investments he's received from Saudi Arabia. The New York Times reported yesterday that the deals have sparked the interest of a key congressional committee — which has begun an investigation.Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the New York Democrat who leads the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, gave Mr. Kushner a two-week deadline in a letter sent on Thursday to furnish documents related to the Saudi fund's investment last year in his firm, Affinity Partners.
