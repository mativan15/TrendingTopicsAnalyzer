Kelly Carlin, daughter of the late comedian George Carlin, is mystified that Donald Trump followers and right-wingers have tried to claim her dad as one of their own.

'Before he died in 2008, and Hillary was running, my dad was like, ‘You know, it'll be good. Hillary [Clinton] will get in there and she'll get some people some jobs.' I mean, of course he leaned that direction. My dad was a lifelong New Yorker and lifelong New Yorkers hate Donald Trump,' she says with a laugh on this bonus episode of The New Abnormal podcast.
