Fanatical has a new mystery grab-bag offer, appropriately called the Phantom Mystery Bundle--since, y'know, it's spooky season. Customers can get a handful of mystery PC games starting at 1 key for $1, and up to 10 keys for just $7.Since this is a mystery bundle, it's hard to say which games are in the pool of possible keys you'll get, but the store page says to expect high-rated AAA and indies. Users in this Reddit thread are posting their results, and games like Peaky Blinders: Mastermind, Monster Sanctuary, Oddworld: Strangers Wrath HD, and Saints Row 2 seem to be common pulls, though there are dozens of other possible games you could end up with.
