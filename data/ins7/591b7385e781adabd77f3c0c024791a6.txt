Hundreds of homeless people Quebec City will lose a haven in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood next Friday.

The Local, a shelter in the basement of the Saint-Roch Catholic Church, will close after the parish of Sainte-Marie-de-l'Incarnation chose not to renew its lease at the end of June.

The shelter has helped 450 people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless in the past year.
