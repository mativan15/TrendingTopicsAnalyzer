LeBron James' list of accolades is already incredible as is. The 19-year NBA veteran has racked up four NBA titles and 18 All-Star selections, tallied up a duo of Olympic gold medals, opened up his own school in his hometown of Akron, Ohio and more. And although he won't be suiting for another basketball until next season, the 37-year-old athlete still has a reason to celebrate as he's just accomplished another milestone: billionaire status.

According to Forbes, LeBron James is now the first active NBA player to make the billionaires list.
