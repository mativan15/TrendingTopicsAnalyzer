The three major Indian telcos-Bharti , Reliance Jio, and (Vi)-are eyeing the ₹74,600 crore advertising market through their ad solutions verticals. While Airtel and Jio launched their ad solutions products in 2021, Vi told ET exclusively that it will soon be entering the market as well. "Vi aims to participate as a major player in the multibillion dollar Indian advertising industry through our own AI/ML driven Adtech platform," Avneesh Khosla, chief marketing officer at Vi, told ET. He added that a telco has the opportunity to provide deep insights to marketers for effectively reaching out to the right target group, considering marketers today are faced with two major challenges-of authentic insights and enhanced reach.
