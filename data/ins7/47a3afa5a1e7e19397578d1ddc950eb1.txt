(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group has shut cafeterias and imposed other curbs on workers across its main iPhone assembly campus in central China, becoming one of the largest companies to respond to a resurgence of Covid cases.Foxconn, which assembles the majority of the world's iPhones from its Zhengzhou facility, has asked workers to take meals in their dorm rooms instead, it said in an online notice. They must wear more-secure N95 masks, Foxconn said on its official WeChat account. It also restricted movement, closing some entrances while mandating employees commute to plants along only certain routes, the South China Morning Post reported.
