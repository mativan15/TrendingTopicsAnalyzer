Photo: ANDREW KELLY/REUTERS Revlon Inc. shares will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after a surge of market interest in the beauty-products supplier following its chapter 11 filing in June. Shares fell 5% on Thursday to close at $3.90 before the NYSE said it had denied Revlon's appeal to stay listed on the Big Board. The stock is now expected to continue trading over the counter, according to the company, which was trading around $2 when it filed for bankruptcy but soared more than 400% the following week.
