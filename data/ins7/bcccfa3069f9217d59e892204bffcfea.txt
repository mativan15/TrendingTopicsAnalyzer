Dow component American Express (NYSE: AMEX) was trading 5% lower in the pre-market Friday following the company's third-quarter earnings report.

That may sound like the company missed views, but in fact, it beat on both the top and bottom line, and boosted its full year guidance. The broader indexes were trading lower ahead of the open Friday. Concerns about higher interest rates are among concerns for American Express, despite better-than-expected results.

American Express' profit came in at $2.
