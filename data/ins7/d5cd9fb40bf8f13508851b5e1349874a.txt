Prime Video's new William Gibson adaptation, The Peripheral, is produced by Westworld's Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan and follows the high-stakes, high-tech tale of a young woman (Chloë Grace Moretz) who realizes the virtual world she's been visiting in a video game is actually the future—a very bleak future, with a murder mystery entwined within it. It's a thought-provoking series with multi-layered themes, as you might expect from the source material, with a lot to say not just about the far-flung future, but the near future too.
