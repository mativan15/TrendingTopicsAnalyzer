On the latest episode of BBC Radio Leeds' Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast, the panel have been discussing whether Crysencio Summerville deserves to be ahead of the likes of Joe Gelhardt, Wilfried Gnonto and Sonny Perkins in the pecking order.Simon Rix said: "Summerville was great for the Under-21s and he ran it, but has he done anything to make you think this guy has got a future at Leeds?"I think he is playing because he wanted to go on loan and we didn't want him to go. I presume someone has promised him plenty of minutes, but we are not seeing much.
