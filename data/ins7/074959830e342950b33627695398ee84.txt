The country's national parks have entered into a £70 million private finance deal to fund the restoration of degraded peatland by selling carbon credits to corporations.A grouse moor in the Cairngorms has become the first to benefit, with the owner of almost 600 hectares of degraded peatland being paid a guaranteed price for the restoration of the habitat to offset corporate carbon emissions.The 15 protected landscapes have joined forces with Palladium, an international advisory and management company, and Respira International, a carbon finance business, to create the largest carbon credit investment fund in the country for peatland restoration.
