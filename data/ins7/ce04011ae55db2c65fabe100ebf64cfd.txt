Vaduz, Liechtenstein --News Direct-- Cantina Royale

One of the first real time free-to-play and play-to-earn (P2E) shooter metaverse games on the market, Cantina Royale is the latest addition to Elrond blockchain ecosystem, where it will push the boundaries of GameFi and web3.

As Elrond is a high speed, eco-friendly blockchain, the Cantina Royale team will utilize these capabilities to their full capacity. Playable like a traditional game on mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop operating systems, Cantina's free-to-play model has been designed to eliminate friction while at the same time supporting the blockchain ethos of interoperability.
