Grayscale Investments filed its first brief last week in its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the agency's refusal to let it convert its bitcoin fund into an exchange-traded fund.

In an interview Monday for Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein says that the litigation transcends its own attempts to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.

'We really feel that this lawsuit isn't about bitcoin,' Sonnenshein told Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer.
