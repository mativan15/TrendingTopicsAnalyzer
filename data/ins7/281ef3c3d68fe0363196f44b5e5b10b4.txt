MEGHAN Markle will be braced for her ex-husband's account in a new tell-all book - and is likely to find the prospect "terrifying", a royal expert has said. 
The Duchess of Sussex started dating Trevor Engelson in 2004, with the pair marrying for 18 months in 2011.

The couple divorced in 2013 - five years before Meghan started her new life with Prince Harry.
But Brit biographer Tom Bower is now expected to delve back into her time with Engelson, promising fresh interviews with the film producer in a new biography.
