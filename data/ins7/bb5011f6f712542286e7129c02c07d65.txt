Investing.com - European stock markets fluctuated around the flat line Wednesday, with the recent positive tone punctured by hotter-than-expected U.K. inflation which suggests further aggressive monetary tightening ahead.

By 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while U.K.'s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.

The U.K. consumer price index, already at its highest level for decades, jumped to 10.1% for the month of September, as food prices in particular continued to squeeze household incomes.
