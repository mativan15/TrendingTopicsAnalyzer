A former Tennessee-based securities broker who drained nearly $6 million from a Centre County business' pension fund was sentenced Thursday and couldn't avoid prison time.

John S. Jumper, 56, was sentenced by federal Judge Matthew W. Brann to 6 1/2 years in prison and was ordered to pay $2.4 million in restitution. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors wrote in an email.

He's scheduled to report within 30 days.

An April 2018 indictment accused Jumper of embezzling $5.
