TAIPEI—Wen Lii has been jogging with an inflatable yellow fish these days.

It's part of a colourful bid by the 33-year-old to become the next county magistrate of the Taiwan-governed island chain of Matsu.

From the southeastern coast of mainland China, the large island of Taiwan isn't visible, but it's easy enough to spot the smaller Matsu, a lush home to 13,000, where the yellow croaker fish is renowned, and not just as seafood.

'The fish are known for croaking loudly in the sea, energetic and unafraid to make their voices heard!' Lii explains on a recent day between campaign stops and island hopping.
