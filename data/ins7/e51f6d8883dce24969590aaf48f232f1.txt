Sweden's new rightwing government has announced it is ditching the country's pioneering 'feminist foreign policy', launched by the leftwing administration in 2014, saying the label could be counter-productive.The foreign minister Tobias Billström announced the move just moments after prime minister Ulf Kristersson presented his new government, backed by the far-right Sweden Democrats for the first time.The 'feminist foreign policy' concept has been copied by several countries but also ruffled feathers in others, notably in the Middle East.
