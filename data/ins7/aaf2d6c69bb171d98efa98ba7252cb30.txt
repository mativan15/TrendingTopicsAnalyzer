Stocks ended Thursday's session higher as investors halted a two-day slide by moving past a downbeat update from Microsoft and another view of aggressive rate hikes from a key Federal Reserve official. The Nasdaq Composite popped up more than 2%, the strongest gain among Wall Street's major equity indexes, with Nvidia, PayPal and Okta among big gainers.  On the S&P 500, all but the energy sector gained ground. Microsoft weighed on the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average early Thursday after the software heavyweight cut its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings guidance because of unfavorable currency exchange moves, highlighting this year's strength in the US dollar.
