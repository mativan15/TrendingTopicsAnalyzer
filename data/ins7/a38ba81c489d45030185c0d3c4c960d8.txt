Draymond gets tech after chippy incident with Grant Williams originally appeared on NBC Sports Bayarea

It wouldn't be a Warriors playoff series without Draymond Green being involved in a chippy play.

In Game 2, it took several minutes into the first quarter before Green and Celtics forward Grant Williams got into it a little bit. Williams was whistled for a foul when he was tangled up with Green while Steph Curry had the ball at the top of the key.
