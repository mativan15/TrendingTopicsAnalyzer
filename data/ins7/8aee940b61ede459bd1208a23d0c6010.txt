A new law may soon allow retirees to keep their money untouched a bit longer.

The Securing a Strong Retirement Act, a bill originally pushed in 2021 but which may finally pass this year, would push the starting point for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from age 72 to 74 and 75. That means retirees could stave off being required to tap into their tax-deferred retirement accounts like 401(k)s and preserve their nest eggs for more years.

This is on top of the news from earlier this month that the IRS is adjusting its actuarial tables on RMDs for the first time in 20 years.
