Chinese state media said in an article Friday it is "necessary to eliminate" Taiwan's independence as rhetoric surrounding Taiwan has escalated in recent days.The China Daily wrote that "the reunification of the two sides across the Taiwan Straits is more than the reunification of the mainland and the island.""It is about Taiwan residents identifying with the Chinese nation and Chinese culture," the piece said."Based on over 20 years of governing experience in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions after their return to the motherland, the complete national reunification requires social and cultural integration of the two sides of the Straits.
