(Bloomberg) -- The stock market might be trying to bounce back, but one group of investors is staying on the sidelines: retail traders. That's according to an esoteric indicator designed to track small-time speculators, something known as the Dark Index that is kept by options-analysis firm SqueezeMetrics. Its current reading -- 40.9% -- is hovering around the lowest levels on record and is near a 2022 trough, meaning that the group is 'selling into the rally.' It's another read on what at-home traders, who helped ignite rallies in 2020 and 2021, are doing now that a bull market run up has given way to a deep decline.
