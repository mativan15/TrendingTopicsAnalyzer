After being beaten and terrorized in the basement of a house along Boyer Avenue in Johnstown, James Smith and Damian Staniszewski were placed in their vehicle by members of a drug gang and driven to another area in the late afternoon of March 27, 2017.

The victims must have seen a wooded area outside their vehicle's window when the truck stopped. The two men probably had some idea what was happening. After all, they had admitted to stealing large quantities of drugs and money from the gang's stash house in Johnstown.
