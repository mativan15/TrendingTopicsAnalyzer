APBeijing has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060.China aims to double its wind and solar capacity by 2025, according to a new road map that also allows for more coal-fired power plants to bolster energy security. The world's biggest polluter earlier estimated it needs to double wind and solar use by 2030 to deliver on its pledges under the Paris climate accord. The latest plan -- if implemented -- means China might reach that goal earlier. But Beijing has also ramped up on coal-fired power plants in recent months to support its ailing economy as the Ukraine war pushes up global energy prices.
