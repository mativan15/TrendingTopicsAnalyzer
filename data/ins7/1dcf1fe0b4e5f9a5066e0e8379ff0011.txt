Former Lake City-area State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister will spend 40 months locked up for corrupt deals that undermined his office's integrity in return for money, a judge said Monday.

"Attorneys also have to hold attorneys accountable," U.S. District Judge Marcia Morales Howard said as she handed down the sentence in federal court in Jacksonville.

The elected prosecutor for the seven-county 3rd Judicial Circuit until 2019, Siegmeister pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy, wire fraud and tax charges that carried a statutory potential for up to 48 years in prison.
