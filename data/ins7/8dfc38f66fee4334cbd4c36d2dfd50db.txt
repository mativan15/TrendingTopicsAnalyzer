A CONTROVERSIAL song about Prince Andrew has been creeping up the charts this week amid the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations.
Although away from the public eye after testing positive for Covid, the disgraced Duke's presence has still cast a shadow over festivities after the risky tune was released.

The song, by Essex anarchist punk band The K**ts, is a take on the children's rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York.
It has awkwardly made its way into the UK Top 20 this week as Andrew's mum, The Queen, enjoys celebrations to mark her outstanding 70-year reign.
