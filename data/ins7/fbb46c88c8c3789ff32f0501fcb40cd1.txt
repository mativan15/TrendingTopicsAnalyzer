If you like betting home underdogs in the NFL, you won't have to wait long for opportunities.

The thing that stands out most about the Week 1 NFL lines, which are already posted at BetMGM, is how many road teams are favored.

Of the 16 opening-week games, there's a road favorite in 10 of them. That could go to 11 if the Buffalo Bills take over as the favorite in the Thursday night opener against the Los Angeles Rams. The Bills are favored at some other books, and this week BetMGM said the Bills were getting 81 percent of bets and 91 percent of the handle for their game against the Rams.
