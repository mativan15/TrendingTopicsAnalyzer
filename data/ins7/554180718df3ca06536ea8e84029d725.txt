Rory O'Neill, aka drag queen Panti Bliss, is a little unclear what his job is. 'I'm not really an actor. I'm not really a stand-up comedian. I tell rambling silly stories ... They involve funny bits and serious bits ... But what is that? I'm not comedian. I say, I'm a ‘stand-up chameleon'.''You're a storyteller,' says his friend, the actor and comedian Tara Flynn. 'I see myself very similarly ... I prefer a yarn, letting the story go where it needs to ... Hashtag soz, not soz.''Hashtag stay mad,' says O'Neill.
