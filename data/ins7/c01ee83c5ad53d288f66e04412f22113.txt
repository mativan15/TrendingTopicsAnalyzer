When, not if, Sheryl Sandberg leaves Meta has been one of the most speculated questions among current and former employees over the past few years. Even still, the news Wednesday that she will soon leave her position as the social media giant's number-two executive sent shockwaves throughout the company and the rest of Silicon Valley.
In her own words, there are two big factors in Sandberg's decision to leave now: the fact that Meta's executive team has been built up to make way for her departure, and that, as the leader of the 'Lean In' movement, she wants to focus more on philanthropy and women's rights.
