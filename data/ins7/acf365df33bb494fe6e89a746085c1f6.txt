Shares of PayPal Holdings (PYPL 4.35%) were up 4% at 10:41 a.m. ET on Monday, outpacing the S&P 500 index. The stock got a boost as investors digested a strong earnings report from Bank of America. PayPal also announced PayPal Rewards, a new app feature that combines cash-back rewards and merchant offers in a single shopping experience.  
Slowing growth and increasing competition from Apple have contributed to PayPal's 73% decline since reaching an all-time high in 2021. Can it claw its way back?
