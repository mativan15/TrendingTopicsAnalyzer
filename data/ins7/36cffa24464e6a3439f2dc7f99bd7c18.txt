Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is looking to combine News Corp. and Fox Corp. into one single entity and reassemble a conservative media giant he split apart about a debate ago.

News Corp., which owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, announced in a news release on Friday the formation of a special committee that will explore a potential merger with Fox Corp., which runs Fox News and affiliated stations and media.

The committee formed shortly after Murdoch sent a letter to the board of directors, according to the release.
