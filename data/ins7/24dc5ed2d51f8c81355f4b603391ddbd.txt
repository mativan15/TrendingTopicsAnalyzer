The number of homeless families in Fort Worth has nearly doubled since the spring, leaving shelters at capacity and some families without safe places to sleep, city leaders said.

'All of our emergency shelters are at capacity for families,' said Lauren King, the executive director of the Tarrant County Homeless Coalition.

Throughout summer, there was an average of 162 households — defined as at least one adult and one child — without permanent shelter at any given time, according to data from the Tarrant County Homeless Coalition.
