In its Q3 earnings conference call, American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) Chief Commercial Officer Vasu Raja provided some detail about replacing its first-class international flight seats with new business-class suites, announced last month.

'And frankly, by removing [first-class seats], we can provide more business-class seats, which is what our customers most want or are most willing to pay for.'

International flights from Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) have already supplanted first class.
