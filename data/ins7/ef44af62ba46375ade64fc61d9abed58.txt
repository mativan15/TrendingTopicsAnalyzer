Jeremy Hunt leaves 10 Downing Street on Friday

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is to fast-track many billions of pounds worth of tax and spending measures from his debt plan, announcing them a fortnight earlier than expected.

The Treasury will outline details of the plans later on Monday.

It is the latest of a series of U-turns on policies announced in the mini-budget.

The move is designed to help reassure jittery markets before they open in London.

The pound gained around 0.9% higher in early Asia trade on Monday to trade above $1.
