The last time Mike Scott suited up for an NBA game, he was a member of the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2021 playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks. Scott averaged 4.2 points and shot 34.2% from deep in the 2020-21 season for the Sixers before his contract expired and it was not renewed.

Since then, the 9-year NBA veteran has not been able to find a spot in the league and after biding his time and waiting for another opportunity in the league, he will head overseas.

Scott has signed a deal with SLUC Nancy which is a basketball club in Nancy, France.
