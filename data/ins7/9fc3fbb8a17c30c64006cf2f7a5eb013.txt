Jun. 2—The Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport was the destination recently for one of the longest cross-country flights performed by an electric aircraft of any kind in North America since 2016.

The flight took place last week and involved an electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, also known as an eVTOL. The particular aircraft that embarked from the east coast before finally landing in Springfield was a Alia-250 eVTOL aircraft, which is being developed by Beta Technologies.

The news of the flight, which stopped at several regional airports along the way in order to recharge was shared by Electric VTOL News, which is part of the Vertical Flight Society, a non-profit technical society for the advancement of vertical flight.
