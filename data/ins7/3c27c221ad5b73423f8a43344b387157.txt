The addition of a new gateway arch, sculpture, pavers, canopies, energy efficient lighting and sound system will transform DuPage Court into the centerpiece of downtown Elgin, city officials said.

Already a gathering spot for outdoor events and activities, the closed-to-traffic area at the end of DuPage Street, located between Spring Street and Douglas Avenue, is the city's latest investment in revitalizing the downtown district.

DLA Architects will do the design and engineering work under a $227,000 contract awaiting Elgin City Council approval.
