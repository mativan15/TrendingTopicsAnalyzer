Snap Inc. reported its slowest quarterly sales growth ever, saying that a decline in advertising spending continues to drag on results. Its shares plunged more than 20% in late trading.

The Santa Monica maker of the Snapchat app said third-quarter sales increased 6% to $1.13 billion. That was just shy of analysts' average estimate of $1.14 billion, according to projections compiled by Bloomberg.

Snap and platforms such as Meta's Facebook and Alphabet's Google are competing for a shrinking pool of advertising dollars.
