The first trailer for the upcoming third Creed installment packs an emotional punch as friends become foes and take to the ring to hash out old grudges.
The upcoming sequel is the ninth overall in the Rocky franchise, with Michael B Jordan treating fans to a first look of him in character as Adonis ‘Donnie' Creed earlier this week.
For the first time, Black Panther actor Jordan will be stepping behind the camera, as he directs and stars in the upcoming drama.
