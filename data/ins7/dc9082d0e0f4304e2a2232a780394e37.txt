Plans for a major affordable housing development on the grounds of a Christian university in North York are pitting Toronto's former chief city planner against local residents, some of whom charge that building towers on the site would amount to sacrilege. Markee Developments, a company co-founded by Toronto's former chief planner Jennifer Keesmaat, is working with Tyndale University to build an 85,000 square metre, 1,530-unit residential development on the school's campus at 3377 Bayview Ave., south of Steeles Avenue.
