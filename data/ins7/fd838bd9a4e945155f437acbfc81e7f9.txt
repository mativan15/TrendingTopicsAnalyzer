ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak argued that U.S. labor force participation is seeing a "decent recovery" and there are some "encouraging signs" amid soaring inflation. "Rapid job growth is not causing inflation," Pollak told "Mornings with Maria," Wednesday. "A full labor market recovery will be a good thing. Having more people come back to work will be a good thing... We're seeing labor force participation is higher among teenagers than ever before."Pollak's comments come on the heels of the number of job openings decreasing to 11.
