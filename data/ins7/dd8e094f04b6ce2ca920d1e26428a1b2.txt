ozgurdonmaz Stocks posted a modest decline again on Thursday, adding to a downdraft seen during the previous day and further trimming a sharp rebound experienced earlier in the week. An attempted rally early in the day petered out during intraday action, as more hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials dulled the upward momentum generated from the latest round of earnings reports. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) finished -0.6%, the S&P 500 (SP500) ended -0.8% and the Dow (DJI) closed -0.
