Under the shade of the koa trees, we dig holes in the soil and gingerly plant new seedlings of hapuu, hinahina and koa, all native Hawaiian plants. We're working on the grounds of a naturally formed watershed located in the western region of Maui atop Mauna Kahalawai, also known as the West Maui Mountains.

Mauna Kahalawai provides water to most of Maui, and the forest is essential to the watershed. The trees and plants soak up the rainwater like a sponge, filtering it through the earth and down to the aquifer, where the Department of Water Supply sources its water for many of Maui's homes and hotels.
