Retail is at an inflection point.
A trend for online shopping that took off with the dotcom boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s and picked up pace during the 2008 recession has been turbo-charged again by the pandemic.
The result? Consumers no longer just expect a shopping experience that's fast, personalised and 'always-on' – they demand it. What was once considered cutting-edge customer service is now the norm. For retailers, this means they have to speed up their digital transformation to meet the needs of their customers or risk becoming obsolete.
