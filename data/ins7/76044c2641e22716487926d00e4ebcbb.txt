Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has declared he will seek two nominees to the board of AGL if he succeeds in blocking the energy giant's controversial plan to spin out its coal-fired power stations into a standalone company.In a letter to AGL chairman Peter Botten on Friday afternoon, the Atlassian co-founder reiterated his 'unequivocal opposition' to the planned break-up of AGL's retail and power generation divisions, which he believes will create two smaller entities less able to fund the accelerated shutdowns of its emissions-heavy coal-fired power stations in line with necessary global climate action.
