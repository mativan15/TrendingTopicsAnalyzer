Samsung fans can grab some great limited-time deals on the Galaxy Tab S8 range (Image: SAMSUNG) Apple has just unveiled its latest entry-level iPad, which comes with a big redesign and a new more expensive price tag to match. The base device - which sports a fresh new look similar to the iPad Pro and iPad Air - is priced from £499, which is £130 more than its predecessor. It's very expensive and if that new price tag is making you think of switching from Apple to Samsung the South Korean tech giant is running some great deals on its Galaxy Tab S8 that could help convince you.
