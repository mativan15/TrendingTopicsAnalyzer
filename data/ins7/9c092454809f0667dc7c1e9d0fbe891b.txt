From June 6 onwards, cheques and demand draft related to payments have to be submitted in the name of commissioner of the MCD only, officials said on Saturday. Cheques or demand draft (DDs) submitted in the name of commissioners of the erstwhile three municipal corporations were earlier being accepted, they said. The already existing accounts of erstwhile corporations would be kept active till June 5, 2022 so that online payments processed by third party agencies or any cheques in pipeline can be realised and get credited to old bank accounts, the MCD had said on Friday.
