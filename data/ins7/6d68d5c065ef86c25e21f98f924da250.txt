Artemi Panarin has at least one point in each of the Rangers' first five games this season, marking the strongest start of his eight-year NHL career.
His five-game streak is the longest of its kind by a Ranger since Brad Richards' hot start to the 2011-12 season. Panarin's 11 points (three goals and eight assists) also matched a Rangers record, set by Rod Gilbert in 1971-72, for the highest total through five games of a season.
Just four Rangers in the past 20 years have posted a longer run of consecutive games with a point.
