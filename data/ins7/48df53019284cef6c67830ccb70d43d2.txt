A single mother living in Mossbank, Sask. said the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) owes her thousands of dollars in back pay after years of not receiving the Canada Child Benefit (CCB). Randi Pickens has two sons: Bennette, 11, and Brody, eight. The CCB is a tax-free monthly payment to help cover the cost of raising children under the age of 18, according to the CRA's website. A person is eligible for the benefit if they are the primary caregiver of a child under 18, they are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, and they are a resident of Canada for tax purposes.
