It was an eventful offseason for Brooklyn Nets. First, Kyrie Irving opted in to a fourth year in Brooklyn, ending speculation that he might be on his way out. The franchise was then jolted by reports claiming that Kevin Durant had asked the front office to trade him out. While the side tried to find suitors for the forward, the trade fell through. Durant ended up staying, and the roster was boosted with Ben Simmons returning fit. With the three big names back together, Nets will set its season in motion, making a dash for the Conference and NBA Finals.
