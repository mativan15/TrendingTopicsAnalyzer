From shoreline flooding to an explosion that rocked the town of Wheatley, it's been a tough four years at the helm of Chatham-Kent for incumbent mayor Darrin Canniff. He's now squaring off against two challengers who promise change and more accountability in the municipality. 'Those are some challenges,' says Canniff, who said the COVID-19 pandemic also made the last few years a rough ride. 'But through that we've come together as a community and got through it all.' Canniff points to an increase in the municipality's population as evidence that Chatham-Kent is on the right track, noting it's becoming more attractive as a place to do business and live.
