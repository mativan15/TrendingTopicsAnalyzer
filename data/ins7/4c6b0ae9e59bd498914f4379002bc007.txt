A new report from DataDog has found that serverless computing could be entering the mainstream with over half of all organizations using serverless on one of the three major clouds – Amazon, Microsoft or Google.
The company found in a 2020 report that while some customers were using Lambda, Amazon's Function as a Service, the other clouds lagged behind. This year's report showed that DataDog users were using serverless tech across all three clouds with Amazon leading the way with over 70% and Microsoft and Google each over 50%, showing that it has caught on in a big way across all of the major cloud platforms.
