With the game staying scoreless past the first batter of the bottom of the 15th—and into the 16th inning—the Astros and Mariners now hold the record for the longest a postseason game has gone without a run being scored. The Cleveland Guardians and Tampa Bay Rays broke the previous record in Game 2 of this year's AL Wild Card series, which Oscar Gonzalez won for Cleveland with a walk-off home run in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 15th.

Houston Astros fans should be used to lengthy postseason battles by this point.
