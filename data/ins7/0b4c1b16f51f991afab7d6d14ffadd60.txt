Shelves at the Westmoreland Food Bank will soon be a little fuller, thanks to the Rotary Club of Delmont-Salem and Busy Beaver.

The pair teamed up to host a drive-up food donation event Saturday morning in Salem Township.

'The reality is that whatever we collect today is more than they had at the beginning of the morning,' said Chris Tomley, with the Rotary Club of Delmont-Salem.

The event was the Rotary Club's third annual food drive and aims to collect 10,000 pounds of food.

'The initiative actually started out of the pandemic, back in 2020, and then from there it's been an ongoing program that we've continued to support,' said Tomley.
