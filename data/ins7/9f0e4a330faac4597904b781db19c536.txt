International Sex Worker's Day is observed on June 2 every year to focus on the rights of sex workers who are often marginalized and stigmatized in society.The day marks the historic protest in 1975 at Saint-Nizier Church in Lyon, France, during which hundreds of sex workers gathered to express their frustration at their exploitative living conditions and criminalization of their work.The protestors occupied the church for eight days and launched a campaign asking for the legalization of sex work in the country.
