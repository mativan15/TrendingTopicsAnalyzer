The Packers may or may need to simplify their offense. But they are at least getting a veteran receiver back in the mix at practice this week.

Head coach Matt LaFleur said in his Wednesday press conference that the team is beginning the 21-day practice window coming off injured reserve for Sammy Watkins.

'We'll see where he's at,' LaFleur said, via Wes Hodkiewicz of the team's website. 'I don't think anybody's ready to say he'll be ready to play this week.
