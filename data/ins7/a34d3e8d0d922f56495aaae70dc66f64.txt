The United States will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia, President Joe Biden said on Monday. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv for its fight against Russia.

"We're not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems' that can reach into Russia, Biden told reporters after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware. Ukrainian officials have sought a longer-range system called the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS, that can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of miles away.
