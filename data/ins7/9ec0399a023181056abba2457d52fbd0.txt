(Bloomberg) -- President Emmanuel Macron resorted to a fast-track decree to push through France's 2023 budget, effectively bypassing the lower house of parliament and underscoring the challenges faced by his minority government in seeking broader support for key legislation.'We must provide a budget for our country,' prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said as she announced the measure in the lower house on Tuesday. The budget bill was debated in France's National Assembly for several days during which it became clear it wouldn't secure enough votes to pass.
