Bill de Blasio, the former mayor of New York City, will join New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service as the 2023 Marnold Visiting Fellow. Arriving in January, he will give formal talks, engage directly with students, faculty, and alumni, and teach a graduate course in the spring.
De Blasio's experiences in public service are notable and extensive. They began when he was Volunteer Coordinator for the mayoral campaign of David Dinkins in 1989. He went on to work as Assistant Director of Community Affairs at City Hall for the Dinkins administration.
