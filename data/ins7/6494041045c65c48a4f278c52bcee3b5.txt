When you want to disrupt an industry, timing matters. Serial entrepreneur Marc Lore would know — in 2016, Lore's Jet was famously acquired by Walmart (WMT) for $ 3.3 billion and, six years prior, his Diapers.com sold to Amazon (AMZN) for $545 million. While he began his career as an e-commerce innovator, Lore's latest venture, Wonder, is all about re-thinking a very different industry: food.'If you think about the last innovation in food, you have to go back to the fast food franchises in the 1950s,' he told Yahoo Finance after his talk this week at TechCrunch Disrupt.
