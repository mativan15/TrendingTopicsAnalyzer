A builder who murdered two women six months apart and then burnt their bodies described himself as a ‘psychopath with a conscience', a court heard.
Mark Brown is accused of killing Alex Morgan, 34, and Leah Ware, 33, who both disappeared in Hastings, East Sussex last year.
Both women had been working as escorts and were registered with an online agency Mr Brown regularly used.
Hove Crown Court heard how the 41-year-old, who had a long term partner and a young son, killed both sex workers six months apart at a remote farm he rented near Hastings.
