Congressional District 3 Physician Kermit Jones, left, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones and Assemblyman Kevin Kiley. This congressional district, which includes some of the state's most beautiful vistas such as the Sierras and South Lake Tahoe, is an open seat because GOP Rep. Tom McClintock opted to run in a nearby district that has more registered Republicans. Still, Republicans have a 5-point voter edge in this newly drawn district, which includes Placer, Nevada, Mono, Sierra, Inyo, Plumas and Alpine counties and parts of Yuba, Sacramento and El Dorado counties.
