Canada's mayors and municipality leaders have congregated in Regina for the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) conference this week. It is the first in-person meeting since 2019. Delegates from the federal, provincial and municipal jurisdictions are making pitches to each other on how to better the lives of Canadians. The pandemic has increased the need for affordable housing across the county. Regina Mayor Sandra Masters said each jurisdiction has a part to play. 'It's not something municipalities can do on our own,' she said.
