 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the chief of the Siksika First Nation have signed a historic land claim settlement, which the federal government says is one of the largest agreements of its kind in Canada.
Trudeau and Marc Miller, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, participated in the signing ceremony Thursday at Siksika First Nation with Chief Ouray Crowfoot, band council and community members.
'We're gathered today to right a wrong from the past,' Trudeau said during the ceremony.
