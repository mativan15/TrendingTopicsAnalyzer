Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday released ₹16,000 crore into the bank accounts of more than 85 million farmers across the country, in the 12th instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. Over ₹2 lakh crore has already been transferred to the accounts of farmers to help them manage input costs, Modi said, adding that the amount would be directly credited into their accounts and that there "will be no mediators."

The initiative provides farmers up to ₹6,000 a year as minimum income support.
