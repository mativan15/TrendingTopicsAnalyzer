After graduating close to 100 deep-tech startups from its outposts in Israel and Germany, Intel Corp. is bringing its 12-week accelerator program Intel Ignite to Kendall Square.

Tzahi Weisfeld, the Tel Aviv-based general manager of Intel Ignite, said that the ten startups who'll be in the first Boston batch will be announced in the coming days. Serial entrepreneur Mark Castleman will be managing the hybrid program, slated to start in November.

The Santa Clara chipmaker (Nasdaq: INTC) employs approximately 800 full-time workers in the Bay State, mostly to support the research and development of Intel's technology.
