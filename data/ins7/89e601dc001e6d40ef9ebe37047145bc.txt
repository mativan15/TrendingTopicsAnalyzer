The stunning car will now go on display after a couple's investigations revealed its royal origins. Trevor Lee paid just £2,000 for the DS420, including a discount he asked for when he feared a lack of service history would stop him getting his money back if he sold it.Mr Lee and his late wife Cheryl found there was also no record of the car ever having been taxed.That led to Mrs Lee trying to uncover the car's provenance until Jaguar "reluctantly confirmed" its distinguished former owner.Now Mr Lee has had several sizeable offers from people interested in buying the car.
