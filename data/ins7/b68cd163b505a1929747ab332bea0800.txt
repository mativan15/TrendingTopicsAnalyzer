Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura &Co is assessing options to unlock value at its high-end brand Aesop as the company seeks to restore investor confidence following a 76% stock plunge over the past 15 months. The shares rebounded as much as 18% Tuesday.

The Sao Paulo-based company will start studies for a possible initial public offering of Aesop, or a spinoff that could be followed by a public offering, the company said in a filing Monday. The announcement prompted JPMorgan Chase & Co. to upgrade Natura shares to overweight from neutral.
