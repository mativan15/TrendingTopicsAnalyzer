October 20, 2022 01:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the prevalence of vehicle safety features has steadily increased, a new poll by PEMCO Mutual Insurance finds that drivers' trust in the latest technology-driven bells and whistles has risen significantly, as well. But while drivers today may embrace safety tech assistance from tools like back-up cameras and brake assist, most admit that they're not ready to jump into the passenger seat of a driverless car.



According to the PEMCO Poll, as certain vehicle technologies have become more commonplace in new and used cars, drivers in Seattle and Portland are two- to three-times more likely than they were six years ago to have safety features like brake assist, back-up cameras, blind spot warning and collision avoidance installed in their vehicle.
