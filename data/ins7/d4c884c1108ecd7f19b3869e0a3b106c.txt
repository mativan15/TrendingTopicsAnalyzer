(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s traders once again helped rescue results from a sharp slowdown in investment banking just as the firm prepares for a reorganization that will combine the two business units.The trading operation posted $6.2 billion in third-quarter revenue, an 11% increase that was better than analysts had forecast. Fixed income led the gains, according to a statement Tuesday. Goldman was the last major US bank to post results in a quarter that has highlighted the resilience of the US consumer.
