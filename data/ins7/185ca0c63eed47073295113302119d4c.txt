NEW YORK - Former President Donald Trump's world, which has been hit with impeachments, a sweeping civil lawsuit, and several federal investigations, is about to grapple with a new legal challenge - a criminal trial of his namesake business.Barring any late settlement with New York City prosecutors, jury selection in the Manhattan District Attorney's case against the Trump Organization is scheduled to start on Monday.Trump himself is not charged.Instead, a 2021 state court indictment accuses two subsidiaries companies that do business under the Trump Organization name in a fraud scheme that paid untaxed, off-the-books payments to Allen Weisselberg, Trump's longtime top financial lieutenant, and others from 2005 to mid-2021.
