The French government has said it supports making the country the first in the world to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right, after the right-dominated senate (Sénat) voted down the left's first attempt at a proposal.Several political parties in France, from the left to the centrist lawmakers of Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party, began pushing for abortion rights to be written into the constitution after the US supreme court's decision in June to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade ruling, which recognised a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalised it nationwide.
