Liz Truss's advisers are concerned members of her Cabinet are planning to resign to try to force the UK prime minister out of office, amid reports that UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman has left the government.

The Guardian newspaper reported Braverman's departure, in a dramatic blow to the embattled premier.

A person familiar with the matter said Truss's advisers see Education Secretary Kit Malthouse and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch as resignation threats.
