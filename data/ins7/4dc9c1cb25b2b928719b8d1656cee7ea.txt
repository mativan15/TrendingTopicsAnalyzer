Tesla CEO Elon Musk has criticised Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer after the meme-coin creator called him a 'grifter.' Dogecoin was created in 2013 by software engineers Billy Markus and Palmer as a 'fun' alternative to Bitcoin. It was started as a satire on the numerous fraud crypto coins that had sprung up at the time and takes its name and logo from a Shiba Inu meme that was viral several years ago.
Palmer in an interview with the Australian news site Crikey spoke about Musk's acquisition of Twitter for $44 billion which was put on hold after the billionaire made several statements around the issue of bots.
