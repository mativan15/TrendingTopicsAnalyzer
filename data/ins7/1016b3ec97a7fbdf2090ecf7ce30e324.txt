The analogy was first drawn by august finance journal The Economist, which said the shelf-life of a lettuce was longer than Liz Truss's period with any actual political power as British Prime Minister, after she "blew up her own government with a package of unfunded tax cuts and energy-price guarantees on September 23rd."
Then no-holds-barred tabloid the Daily Star ran with the idea, broadcasting a live online feed of an actual lettuce decaying in real-time next to a photo of the British Prime Minister.
