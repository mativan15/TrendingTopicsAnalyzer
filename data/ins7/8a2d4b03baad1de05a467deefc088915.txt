WASHINGTON — Nearly a decade after it was signed, a directive that laid out the ground rules for U.S. autonomous weapons is due for a refresh, according to the leader of the Pentagon's emerging capabilities policy office.

Given the time passed and significant advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, now is 'actually an opportune time' for the Department of Defense to 'take a look at that directive and figure out what should be done to reflect, sort of, where we are now compared to where we were a decade ago,' Director Michael Horowitz said May 17 at the Nexus 22 symposium.
