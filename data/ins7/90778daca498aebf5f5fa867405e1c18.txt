 (The Hill) — Instagram users will begin seeing AMBER alerts for missing children in their area, the company announced Wednesday.  The feature is rolling out first in the U.S. and 24 other countries, with plans to expand it to more places going forward.  The alerts will include details about the child, such as a photo, description, location of the abduction and any other available information that can be provided, Meta's director of trust and safety Emily Vacher said in a blog post.
