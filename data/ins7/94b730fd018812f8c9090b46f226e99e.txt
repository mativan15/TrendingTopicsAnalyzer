tang90246/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Luxury fashion company Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) has a particularly attractive price-to-earnings (P/E) at just shy of 10x. This is in stark contrast with the likes of Hermes (OTCPK:HESAY) at 44.3x or LVMH (OTCPK:LVMUY) at 22x. But does that mean Tapestry is due for an upturn in share price? This analysis looks at the company's positioning and fundamentals in comparison to peers to understand what's next. It concludes that there's weakness in some of its recent numbers, and it doesn't always compare well with peers either.
