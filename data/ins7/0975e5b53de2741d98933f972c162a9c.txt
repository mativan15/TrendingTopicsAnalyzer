On a bright Saturday afternoon in Warren, Michigan, a Twitch streamer and YouTuber who goes by the name Haz descended on Macomb Community College with mic in hand, ready to grill Trump supporters lining up for a rally.

His pitch for the Oct. 1 event: A new ideology of prosperity and working-class unity, built on the ashes of America's liberal democracy.

'It sounds crazy. It's called ‘MAGA Communism,' and the ‘communism' thing means common wealth, common prosperity,' Haz tells one man, in a video he posted to his YouTube channel from the event.
