Last week was a good respite for investors, with the stock market showing signs of life for the first time in a while. Big gains for the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.05%) helped erase a small part of the index's losses for 2022. Moreover, the Nasdaq is doing a better job at holding its own than other indexes, clawing back from early morning losses to eke out a five-point gain as of 12:30 p.m. ET.
Some of the biggest stocks in the market were among gainers on Tuesday, but a couple of smaller companies stood out.
