In 2014, the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou began investigating the biotech startup Theranos. Its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, claimed the company had revolutionary technology that could run sophisticated medical tests on patients with just one drop of blood.

The more Carreyrou probed, the more he grew skeptical of Holmes' claims. Eventually, he wrote a series of damning stories that revealed Holmes to be a fraud. Four years later, he published 'Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup," a New York Times best-selling book covering the rise and fall of her company.
