KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) — Fantasy Fest is kicking off in Key West, Florida, on Friday with a full slate of events for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than two years ago.

The annual 10-day-long party runs through Oct. 30.

'Due to the COVID pandemic, this will be the first full Fantasy Fest since 2019,' Fantasy Fest board chair Steve Robbins said. 'So I know our guests and staff are excited about getting back to the real Fantasy Fest.'

Dozens of themed events are set for the festival, including a nighttime parade featuring floats and elaborately costumed marching groups on Oct.
