Newcastle could launch a big-money move to try and convince Arsenal to sell defender William Saliba during the summer transfer window, reports have claimed.

Sailba has just finished an impressive season while on loan with Marseille. He is due to return to the Gunners but there is already talk of him being lured away again. This despite the fact Arsenal are keen to keep hold.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has justified the decision to loan Saliba out last season.
