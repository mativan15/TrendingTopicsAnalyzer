War, pandemic and sluggish markets hit the world's billionaires this year. There are 2,668 of them on Forbes' 36th-annual ranking of the planet's richest people—87 fewer than a year ago. They're worth a collective $12.7 trillion—$400 billion less than in 2021.
The most dramatic drops have occurred in Russia, where there are 34 fewer billionaires than last year following Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and China, where a government crackdown on tech companies has led to 87 fewer Chinese billionaires on the list.
