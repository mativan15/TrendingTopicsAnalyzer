Toronto police are announcing the arrest of three men in a more than six-month human trafficking investigation that involved an 18-year-old girl. Officers said the investigation began more than six months ago on Oct. 25. In a Saturday release, they allege that a 17-year-old girl from Edmonton was recruited and flown to Toronto to work in the sex trade once she turned 18-years-old. For more than eight days, officers said the girl was sex trafficked in Toronto hotels and at a house. Police added that she was also forced to sell illegal drugs.
