May 29—Sean Mitchell grew up in the Dayton area, but it was only when he decided to stay as an adult that he truly fell in love with the city.

"You start noticing the little things you took for granted," he said.

Dayton is a place where strangers soon become friends, and Mitchell realized it is the people that make the city such a great place to live.

Now he is a major proponent of the area, supporting Dayton businesses, organizations, bars and restaurants. He enjoys acting as a connector in a place with such diversity and opportunity, where a 20-minute drive can take you to a suburb, a farm, an industrial area or a military base.
