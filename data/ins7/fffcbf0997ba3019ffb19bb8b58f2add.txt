Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, ordered strikes to rain down in Ukraine, including Kyiv, in a major escalation in the conflict. Last week, at least 10 cities were targeted as a barrage of attacks began, with Russia using both drones and missiles to batter critical infrastructure across the country. One weapon, the Iranian-made Shaed-136 drone, was used on Monday, despite Putin claiming he would not launch any more "massive strikes". Dubbed "kamikaze" drones, the weapons swoop down and crash into targets before detonating an explosive device, which is where they get their terrifying moniker.
