There has been a dry spell for killer clowns at the movies since the release of 'It: Chapter 2' but the sequel to a beloved indie slasher film is creating headlines both in good and bad ways. Entertainment Weekly reported Terrifier 2 to be in the top 10 successes at the box office, making around $1 million with a budget of less than $250,000. 
The writer-director Damien Leone's work delights most viewers in theatre. But some are reportedly not handling the gore in the best way. People took to social media to write about Terrifier 2 and how it's forcing audiences to call paramedics, rush to the bathroom to puke or just try to exit the theatre.
