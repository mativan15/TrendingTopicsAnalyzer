U.S. stocks pulled back from day's highs and the dollar edged higher amid signs of weakening investor sentiment. The S&P 500 pared gains as declines in oil weighed on energy stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose 0.4 per cent, after climbing more that 2 per cent. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. jumped the most intraday since July following better-than-expected third-quarter results.  Treasuries gained, sending yields lower across the board. The pound weakened after the Bank of England denied a report it's delaying the sale of government bonds until markets are calmer.
