A family on their first trip abroad since the pandemic started had a less then ideal start when all five of their suitcases were lost en route from Manchester to Spain. 
Emma Hayward, 44, said she along with her husband, two children and elderly mother had no clothes except what they were wearing when they arrived on the island of Fuerteventura. 
They had to spend €500 (around £425) on buying new clothes, shoes and toiletries after arriving on Sunday, and still don't know where their bags are or when they will arrive.
