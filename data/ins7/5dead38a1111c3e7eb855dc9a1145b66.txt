Thanks in no small measure to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, it's easy buy a low cost index fund, which should provide the average market return. But you can make superior returns by picking better-than average stocks. For example, the Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) share price is up 43% in the last three years, slightly above the market return. It's nice to see the stock price has more recent momentum, too, with a rise of 27% in the last year.

Since the stock has added US$182m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.
