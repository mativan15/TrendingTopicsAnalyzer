BNPL companies generally don't report to the credit-scoring companies when consumers use these loans. That makes it a challenge for a lender to know how many loans a consumer has outstanding. "That makes a big difference in terms of how much you should loan," said Kenneth Lin, CEO of fintech company Credit Karma. "Oftentimes, a credit system is actually blind to how much you owe in the Buy Now Pay Later scenario."Consumers with multiple BNPL loans with multiple payment dates may find themselves in a debt spiral.
