Netflix is just over a year into its active push into games — and it's doubling down on the strategy. Netflix's VP of games Mike Verdu, speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 conference Tuesday, announced that the streamer was 'seriously exploring' a cloud gaming offering to be able to extend its catalog of games to be playable on TVs and PCs. 'We're going to approach [cloud gaming] the same way we did with mobile, which is start small, be humble, be thoughtful, and then build out,' he said at the TechCrunch event, per a video replay.
