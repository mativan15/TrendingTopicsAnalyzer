Stacy Francis never planned to become a financial advisor, especially one for women going through divorce. But a candid talk with her grandmother shifted her career trajectory. Her grandmother, Myra, was a victim of spousal abuse and, before passing, she confessed to staying in her marriage because she felt "financially trapped.""That's what drove me to go into this field," said Francis, who founded Savvy Ladies, a non-profit providing free financial advice and education for women, along with her advisory firm Francis Financial in New York.
