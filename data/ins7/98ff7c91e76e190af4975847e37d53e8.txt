'Terrifier 2' has become an unexpected box office hit this Halloween movie season. Writer-director Damien Leone's gory sequel to his 2016 killer clown cult hit shocked the industry over the weekend when it grossed just over $1 million at the domestic box office, up 28% from its $805,000 debut the weekend before. While these grosses may seem low, don't forget that 'Terrifier 2' is a micro-budget indie with a $250,000 price tag and next to zero mainstream marketing. What's driving interest around 'Terrifier 2'? It might have something to do with all the reports claiming the horror movie has caused various moviegoers to walk out, faint or vomit in the middle of the movie.
