Andrii Dodonov/iStock via Getty ImagesDespite my distaste for mortgage real estate investment trusts due to their sometimes unsustainable yields, I just added Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT (NYSE:EARN) to my dividend portfolio after the mREIT decreased its dividend to $0.08 per share. The mortgage trust represents a 3% allocation in my portfolio, making it a rather minor holding. Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT, like other mREITs in the first quarter, announced a significant decrease in book value for 1Q-22, and management slashed its monthly dividend pay-out by 20%.
