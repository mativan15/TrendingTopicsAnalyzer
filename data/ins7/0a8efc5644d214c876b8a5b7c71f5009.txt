Mallikarjuna Kharge's (80) election as AICC president may slow a potential drift of a section of the Scheduled Caste (SC) members towards the ruling BJP ahead of a likely close contest in the ensuing assembly polls in Karnataka. Kharge belongs to SC (right), a dominant sub-sect the BJP has quietly made inroads into. Sections of them may throw their weight behind Kharge, considering his win as significant recognition for the community by Congress. The party, too, is likely to send out a loud message to voters that it is led by a Dalit president, and a Congress regime will take care of their interests.
