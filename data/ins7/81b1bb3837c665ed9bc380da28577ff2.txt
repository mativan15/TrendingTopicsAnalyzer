Apple's latest iPhone software update, iOS 15.5, brings a small handful of new features and updates to your iPhone. It's not the biggest iOS update, but you're missing out if you haven't downloaded it. The follow-up to iOS 15.4 offers a few small upgrades and improvements to apps that lay the groundwork for larger iPhone updates in the future (maybe in the form of iOS 16). Instead of bigger new features like Universal Control and mask-friendly Face ID, iOS 15.5 brings updates to Apple Cash, Photo Memories and the Podcasts app, to name a few.
