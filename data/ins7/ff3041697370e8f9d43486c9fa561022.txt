Published: 19:35 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 19:43 EDT, 2 June 2022 One of the biggest power retailers has removed offers for new customers over fears it will be unable to provide low rates without losing money as energy prices soar. Simply Energy will instead focus on trying to keep its 730,000 customers in a bid to stop clients from changing providers.  'Our current focus is on helping our existing customers understand their energy costs and manage short-term rate rises, while taking steps to keep our business strong in a changing energy market,' a spokesperson said.
