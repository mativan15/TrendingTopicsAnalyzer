Variety - Film News 'Black Adam' is rated PG-13 for 'sequences of strong violence, intense action and some language,' but it turns out the first several cuts of the film were even more violent. Producers Beau Flynn and Hiram Garcia confirmed to Collider that 'Black Adam' originally earned an R rating, and it took 'four rounds' of cuts for the MPA to agree to lower the rating to the team's desired PG-13. The crew always knew it wanted 'Black Adam' to push the limits of PG-13 violence considering the title character's comic book roots.
