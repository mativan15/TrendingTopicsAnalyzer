More than a year later, and after considerable political wrangling, the US Congress passed the CHIPS Act. This legislation will channel billions of dollars in subsidies to the US semiconductor industry to secure a vital component for future manufacturing, compete with China, and ride the next big wave of economic growth. There is one major problem with this plan: The US doesn't have the people to do the job.
Even today, when the US produces only about 12% of global semiconductors, the sector faces a shortfall of about 90,000 workers, including technicians, scientists, and engineers.
