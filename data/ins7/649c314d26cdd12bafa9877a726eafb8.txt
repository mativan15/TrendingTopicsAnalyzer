After an extraordinarily busy year in merger and acquisition activity in 2021, the Business Courier held a forum featuring experts in that space who assessed the current environment for deals and looked ahead to what might be next given the current economic conditions.

The featured panelists were: Kevin Bruegge, a private wealth advisor and managing director of The Evelo|Singer|Sullivan Group wealth management firm; Keith Carlson, managing director and shareholder in VonLehman CPA and Advisory Firm; and Michael Hurley, a partner at Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, who practices in the corporate law and finance arena.
