President Joe Biden on Wednesday is slated to meet with executives from baby-formula makers, with the huddle coming as new data suggest that the country's formula shortage is deepening. An estimated 23% of powdered formula was out of stock in the week ended May 22 vs. 21% during the prior week, according to a Wall Street Journal report published on Wednesday that cited the latest figures from market-research firm IRI. The shortage is particularly hitting low-income families and states in the South and the Southwest, the report said.
