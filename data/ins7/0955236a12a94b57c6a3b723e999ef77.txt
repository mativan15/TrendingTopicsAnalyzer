Now that interest rates are rising, it is vital you find the right home for your savings to help you get the most out of your money.
These are the best rates available right now on Isas, bonds, savings and current accounts. A current account is a transactional account that typically pays no interest but gives you a lot of flexibility in how often you access your money – whereas with a savings account the bank pays you interest for keeping your money and therefore imposes some restrictions on how many withdrawals you can make.
