Continued gains in market share and price hikes during the September quarter are likely to help report double-digit growth in sales, both in volume and value terms. The paint maker's consolidated net sales for the quarter are seen rising 25% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 8,880 crore, according to the average of estimates given by five brokerages. Brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities expects Asian Paints' outperformance in growth vs peers to continue even as the gap narrows. In terms of volumes, analysts see the company reporting a growth of over 5-12% on-year.
