Its turquoise waters and white sand beaches have made Italy's Costa Smeralda, or Emerald Coast, an elite holiday destination for the world's rich and famous.

This stretch of coast on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia became a second home for Russian oligarchs, who docked their superyachts in Porto Cervo's harbour and built luxury beachfront villas on its shores.

But this year, as the war in Ukraine rages into its eighth month, the landscape is very different.

Yachts and mansions lie empty, seized by the Italian government as part of sweeping EU sanctions against Russia for Vladimir Putin's invasion.
