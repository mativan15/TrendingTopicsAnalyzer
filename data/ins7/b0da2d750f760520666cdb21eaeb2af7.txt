As vegetable prices continue to rise, a vertical farm based in Hamilton has the potential to keep the shelves full all year round. The new business, Greengrower, is in the final stages of building New Zealand's first large-scale vertical farm for lettuce and other leafy greens. It comes after food prices reached a 13-year high with fruit and vegetables up 16% in September and bad weather left supermarket salad shelves empty. By the end of the year, chief executive Tom Schuyt​ said they will be able to produce over 4000 bags per day across the North Island offering some relief to the country's supply chain issues.
