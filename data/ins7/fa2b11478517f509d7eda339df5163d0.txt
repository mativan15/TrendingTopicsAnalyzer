Mumbai: In a major step, the Maharashtra government has decided to write off loans of over ₹964 crore taken by farmers from land development banks (LDBs) in the state. The move has come as a big relief for over 34,000 farmers who had taken loans from these banks over two decades ago, mortgaging their land as collateral.The state has also approved the payment of another ₹275.40 crore to employees of LDBs for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) and other dues. The decisions were taken in the state cabinet meeting on Thursday.
