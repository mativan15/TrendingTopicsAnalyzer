By Dominic Chopping STOCKHOLM--Ulf Kristersson, the leader of Sweden's conservative Moderate Party, was named Prime Minister on Monday after parliament voted in favor of his appointment. Mr. Kristersson leads Sweden's right-wing coalition of parties who last month edged out the incumbent center-left alliance in a close-run national election. In Monday's prime ministerial vote, he received 176 votes backing his appointment, with 173 against. The right-wing bloc of the Moderates, Sweden Democrats, Christian Democrats and Liberals spent just over two weeks after the election haggling over ministerial positions and policy agreements, and said Friday that they had agreed on the terms and composition of a new government.
