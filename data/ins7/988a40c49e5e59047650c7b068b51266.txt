After giving a hefty summary of injury statuses on Monday, Lions head coach Dan Campbell was asked about a couple more walking wounded players prior to Wednesday's practice session in Allen Park.

Campbell was more bullish and upbeat about RB D'Andre Swift than he was on WR DJ Chark. Swift, who has been suffering with both a sprained shoulder and an ongoing ankle injury, Swift has missed the last two games prior to the Week 6 bye and has not practiced in over a month. But Campbell expects Swift to participate on Wednesday.
