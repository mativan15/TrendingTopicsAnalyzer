SKY is swapping dishes for streaming with a brand new TV box launching on Tuesday.
And better still, customers don't have to be stuck with a lengthy contract for the first time.
Sky Stream's box is tiny and plugs in with a HDMI and WiFi

Sky Stream from £26 per month - buy now on Sky.com

The company's new Stream device plugs into the back of your existing telly, meaning no need for a costly installation person either.
Doing away with the need for satellite dishes means using WiFi instead, no matter who your provider is.
