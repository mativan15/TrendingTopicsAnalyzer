Traitov/iStock via Getty Images Rising interest rates and climbing home price appreciation is bound to lead to softer demand in the second half of 2022, said Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ:OPEN) Chief Investment Officer Daniel Morillo during the Jefferies Virtual Internet Summit on Tuesday. "We expect a decline in demand. We don't expect a rapid decline as we had in 2008," he said. There are several reasons for that. Household balance sheets are much stronger now than they were before the financial crisis due to the postponement of major life events and debt-to-disposable income has increased.
