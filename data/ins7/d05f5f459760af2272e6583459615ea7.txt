One month beforehand, Mr Johnson had bestowed the Ukrainian president with the Sir Winston Churchill Leadership Award which recognises "extraordinary leadership by individuals".
Previous recipients include the Prince of Wales, UK prime ministers Sir John Major and Baroness Thatcher, and US secretaries of state Madeleine Albright and James Baker.
Following Mr Johnson's resignation on July 7, after a series of scandals engulfed the Conservative Party, Mr Zelensky said his 'friend' should not disappear from politics.
