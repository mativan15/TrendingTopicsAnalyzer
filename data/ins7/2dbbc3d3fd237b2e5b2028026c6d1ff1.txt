Led by China, one in two cars will have an electric powertrain by 2030, a new report showed on Monday. Electric powertrain includes main components that generate and deliver power to the road surface for fully electric, hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications. Main components of its powertrain are engine, transmission and driveshaft. According to Counterpoint Research, the increase in environmental awareness among buyers, favourable carbon emission norms, support from governments and the collaborative efforts of ecosystem players are all helping electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the world.
