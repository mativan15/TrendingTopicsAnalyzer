On Oct. 13, the Labor Department released data that showed the consumer price index rose 8.2% in September. Over the past year, the core inflation index, which excludes food and energy, increased 6.6%, the highest level since September 1982. The latter number is very concerning because it proves that the underlying inflation trends are headed in the wrong direction. Supply chain issues, pent-up consumer demand and economic stimulus from the pandemic have partially driven inflation.

Inflation has been rapid for some 18 months.
