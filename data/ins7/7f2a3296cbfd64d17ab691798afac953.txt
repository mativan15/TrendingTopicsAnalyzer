Universal Credit is gradually replacing six benefits, known as legacy benefits.If you are claiming these benefits, you will eventually be switched over to Universal Credit (UC) and be given a single sum of money to help you with the costs of daily life, including housing, raising children, caring for dependents, disabilities, and illnesses.The DWP has started to contact people about moving to Universal Credit - you can decide to move sooner as you might be better off moving to UC.There are currently six benefits that fall under legacy benefits and these are:housing benefitincome-related employment and support allowanceincome-based jobseeker's allowanceincome supportworking tax creditThese benefits will be discontinued and will instead become part of UC.
