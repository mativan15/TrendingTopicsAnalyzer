Jordan Leavitt has mixed feelings about his upcoming fight with Paddy Pimblett.
Leavitt (10-1 MMA, 3-1 UFC) meets Pimblett (18-3 MMA, 2-0 UFC) on July 23 at UFC Fight Night in London where he'll have a chance to shut down the rising star's hype in enemy territory. But as exciting as the opportunity is for Leavitt, he admits that the matchmaking has him wondering if he's being underestimated.
'Honestly I was a bit offended because he's been kind of picking fights that are easy,' Leavitt said in an interview with The Schmo.
