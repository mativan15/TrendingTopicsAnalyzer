SeanShot/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) stock is diving 7.8% in Wednesday premarket trading after the market information and credit rating company suspended its previously issued forecast due to market volatility and uncertainty over the issuance environment. Due to the uncertain outlook, "the company cannot affirm its previously issued guidance," it said in a statement on Wednesday. As interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive for companies and other entities to issue new debt.
