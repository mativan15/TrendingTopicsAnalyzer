A few laptops, remote access tools, an internet dongle and a few technophiles were how a 146 crore-bank heist, albeit an unsuccessful one, was pulled off. In a first-of-its-kind ‘technical' investigation, the UP cybercrime cell on Friday claimed to have cracked the case of a failed attempt to steal ₹146 crore from Uttar Pradesh Cooperative Bank (UPCB) on October 15. The accused had mischievously installed a laptop in the bank network. That was how the hackers remotely accessed the bank server, the police said.
