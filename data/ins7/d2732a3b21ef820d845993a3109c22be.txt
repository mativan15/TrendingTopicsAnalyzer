Bhagavan 'Doc' Antle, who was featured in the Tiger King docuseries as owner of the rival Myrtle Beach Safari, has been arrested by the FBI. Police records don't disclose what charges he is facing, but TMZ reports that his arrest is related to a money-laundering investigation. This isn't the first time Antle has been in trouble with the law. In 2020, he was indicted in Virginia for allegedly trafficking in lion cubs and was slated to go on trial this summer.Read it at TMZ
