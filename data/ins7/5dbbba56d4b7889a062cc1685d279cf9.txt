A New York City activist investor firm disclosed a 7.4% stake in Columbus-based Vertiv Holdings Co., saying in a presentation it sees "significant margin expansion opportunity" to revive an undervalued stock.

Starboard Value LP owns 27.8 million shares of the maker of power supply and other infrastructure for data centers, according to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm through several funds built up the stake in smaller trades since late August.

A Vertiv spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
