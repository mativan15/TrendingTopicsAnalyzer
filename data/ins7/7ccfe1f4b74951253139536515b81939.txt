SAVANNAH, GA. – Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) declined to say on Friday whether President Biden should run for a second term, saying that he's focused only on his own reelection efforts.

Asked during a debate sponsored by The Hill parent company Nexstar whether he would support Biden for reelection in 2024, Warnock demurred.

'I've not spent a minute thinking about what politicians should run for what in 2024,' Warnock said. Pressed for a yes or no response, Warnock offered no ground.

'Maybe this is difficult for people to understand, because that's how politicians think,' he said.
