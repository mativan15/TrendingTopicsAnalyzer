Preformed Line Products Co. has acquired Delta Conectores S.A. de C.V., a market-leading manufacturer in central Mexico, for undisclosed terms.

Based in Aguascalientes, Mexico, Delta designs and makes substation connectors and other hardware for high-voltage AC systems, PLP said in a statement.

The acquisition "will greatly expand PLP's operational and technical capabilities in the region" while supporting its global strategy for supplying hardware for substations, said the Mayfield Village, Ohio-based company.
