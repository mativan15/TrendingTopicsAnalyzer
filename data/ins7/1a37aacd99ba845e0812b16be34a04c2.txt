The big shareholder groups in Centaurus Metals Limited (ASX:CTM) have power over the company. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Warren Buffett said that he likes "a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people." So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

With a market capitalization of AU$500m, Centaurus Metals is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors.
