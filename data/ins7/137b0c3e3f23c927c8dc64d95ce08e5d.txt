AgenciesAs per officials, the students can now heave a sigh of relief as results will be declared by the 2nd week of June. Tentative date for the results to be announced has been stated as the 10th of June. What might delay the release of the results could be the effect of teachers of unaided schools protesting the evaluation process. The teachers of unaided schools had begun protests demanding 100% support of government grants for their schools. But before the demonstration by teachers of unaided schools could have any adverse effect, a strict warning was issued by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE).
