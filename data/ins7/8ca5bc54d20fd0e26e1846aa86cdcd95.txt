McCourt School students, faculty and staff had the opportunity to experience the future of technology at the 2022 Unfinished Live conference. McCourt School students, faculty and staff joined the McCourt Institute, Project Liberty and several other partner organizations for Unfinished Live, an immersive four-day event at The Shed in New York City. The experiential conference, exploring the collision of technology, art, ideas and impact, is produced annually by Unfinished, the preeminent convener of engaged citizens invested in our digital future.
