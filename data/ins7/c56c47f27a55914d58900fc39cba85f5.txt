One way to spot a good deal in the markets is by looking at stocks that are trading below their book values. It can be a sign that investors are concerned about possible risks associated with the companies. But for the following dividend stocks, there's more potential than there is risk.
Viatris (VTRS -1.57%), Citigroup (C -1.82%), and Paramount Global (PARA -4.11%) all pay dividend yields of at least 2.8%, which is double the S&P 500's average payout. And these high-yielding stocks are also incredibly cheap right now.
