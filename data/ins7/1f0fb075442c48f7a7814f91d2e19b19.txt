I was pleased to see the Government responding to the cost of living crisis. This is a crisis that has threatened a dramatic fall in living standards for people on fixed and low incomes including pensioners reliant on savings.
No one under 40 has ever seen double digit inflation. No business leader today has had to navigate inflation at this level. The last time inflation was this high I had just started at the Treasury as a junior economist.
Prior to the Chancellor's statement this week, I had argued that the Government needed to respond to the cost of living crisis with the same ambition it had approached the pandemic - at scale and at pace.
