TORONTO - North American stock markets closed lower to start June amid rising interest rates and fears of persistently hot inflation. The Bank of Canada adopted a more hawkish tone Wednesday as it raised interest rates by 50 basis points for a second time in two months and said it was 'prepared to act more forcefully' as it forecasts higher consumer prices to come this year.'Inflation is still very elevated and in some cases may be becoming a little bit more entrenched in the economy and will be possibly harder for central banks to fight,' said Mike Archibald, vice-president and portfolio manager with AGF Investments Inc.
