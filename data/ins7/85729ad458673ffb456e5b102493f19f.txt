Who should have the right to vote?

A common answer is adult citizens of a country. Indeed, the national electoral laws of most countries – including Australia – adopt this approach.

But what about the approximately 3.4 million permanent residents and temporary visa holders? Many of them call Australia home, having lived and worked in this country for years, and together they amount to more than 13% of the Australian population.

Should they be denied the right to vote because they don't have citizenship, despite the strong connections they have to the country?

I argue 'no'.
