While the major U.S. indexes are hovering around gains of 3% for this week, one electric vehicle (EV) stock is blowing that away. As the start of production for Fisker's (FSR 4.08%) first vehicle approaches, its shares are surging this week. As of midmorning Friday, Fisker shares have jumped about 14% since last Friday's close, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
So what
There was no major news from the company this week, but the stock had been on an extended decline. Even with this week's double-digit gain, the Fisker shares have plunged more than 25% over the last three months.
