TEMPLEGATE goes hunting for winners on a busy Saturday.
He is also trying to build the bank ahead of next week's Derby Festival - and don't forget to back a horse by clicking their odds below.

SEA LA ROSA (2.55 Haydock, nap)
She sailed through last season without finishing outside the first three, landing four wins. 
The pick of those came at Lingfield in October as she destroyed a useful field to win a Listed contest. She stays well and has strong turf form too. WOBWOBWOB (2.40 Beverley, nb)
He was taken off his feet a little by the pace over six furlongs at York last time.
