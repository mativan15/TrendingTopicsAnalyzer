London (CNN Business) Britain's new finance minister, just days into the job, will rush out details of a revised tax and spending plan on Monday in a frantic effort to control jittery markets.

Jeremy Hunt will deliver a statement later Monday on how the United Kingdom intends to put public finances on a sustainable path, the UK Treasury said. He hadn't been expected to make an announcement until the end of the month.

The move helped avert a panicked sell-off in markets early Monday. UK government bond prices rose and the pound climbed 0.
