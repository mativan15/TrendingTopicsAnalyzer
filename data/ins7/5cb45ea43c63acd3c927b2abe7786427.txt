Harris entered his first undergraduate year intent on becoming a doctor or a lawyer and left on a path of faith. He credits a large part of that transition to the mentors he had during his time at university.
As he begins his latest journey on Monday as associate dean for USC's Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, Harris, 30, hopes he can provide the same level of support and direction his mentors gave him when he was a student.
