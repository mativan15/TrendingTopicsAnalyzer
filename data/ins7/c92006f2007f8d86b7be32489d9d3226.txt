RichLegg/E+ via Getty Images It's been an inauspicious life as a publicly traded company for Embark Technology (NASDAQ:EMBK) since going public in 2021. Shares of the autonomous driving technology company have fallen over 80% since listing on the NASDAQ, with marked declines coming in recent months as much of high-flying tech has sold off. However, according to CEO Alex Rodrigues, the short term turmoil is merely an entrée to the longer term opportunity in autonomous trucking. The young, Canadian-born CEO pointed to under-addressed niche opportunities in autonomous trucking and the company's recent testing of its technology in snowy weather.
