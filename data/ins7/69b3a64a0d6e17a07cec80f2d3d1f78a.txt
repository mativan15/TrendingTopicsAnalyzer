As the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protesters dug in their heels and blared their horns in downtown Ottawa, there was tension between the police service and its oversight board as calls grew to come up with a plan to remove the demonstrators, according to the former chair of that board.
There's always a 'push and pull' between the police services board and their corresponding police service, according to Ottawa city councillor Diane Deans, who served as the chair of the Ottawa Police Services Board during the protests in February.
