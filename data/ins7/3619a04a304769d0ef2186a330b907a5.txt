RudyBalasko Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) was one of the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 Index on Monday amid a strong day overall for consumer discretionary stocks with sentiment slightly improved. CZR got an extra boost after Stifel was positive on the casino stock after a recent meeting with management. "Based on where our estimates sit today, we believe there is considerable upside to 3Q22/4Q22 estimates, across all three verticals: the Strip, Regionals and OSB/iGaming," updated analyst Steven Wieczynski.
