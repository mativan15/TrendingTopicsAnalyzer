Disgraced South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh will pay out more than $4.3 million to the sons of his family's longtime housekeeper who claim they never saw a penny of her life insurance payout.The attorney, who remains jailed for allegedly organizing his own assisted suicide — which failed — and stealing millions from his clients, has settled a lawsuit from Tony Satterfield and Brian Harriott after their mother, Gloria Satterfield, died after a fall at the Murdaugh complex in 2018.Satterfield and Harriott claimed that Murdaugh set them up with a lawyer to negotiate the initial insurance payout without telling them that the attorney, Cory Fleming, was his longtime friend and college roommate.
