THE Lapu-Lapu City Council has yet to approve the construction of a fourth bridge that will connect the city and Mandaue City.



Vice Mayor Celedonio 'Celsi' Sitoy made the clarification on Saturday, Oct. 15, 2022, after the Mandaue City Government held a consultative meeting with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) about the proposed project on Tuesday, Oct. 11.



'We did not approve the project because we did not agree on the alignment of the approach,' he told SunStar Cebu.



The DPWH plans to build the foot of the bridge near the second bridge, also known as the Marcelo B.
