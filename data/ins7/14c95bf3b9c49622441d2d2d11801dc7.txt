Gazing out from the new offices of online bank Starling, Anne Boden sees the familiar, modest surroundings of the Welsh capital Cardiff rather than the skyscrapers of London's City financial district."We have great universities in Cardiff, and we have great talents here, we're using that talent to create something that's really special for the customers," say Boden.Boden is the head of Starling, which has just opened the Cardiff site, where about half of its 1,800 employees will be based.With almost three million customers and eight percent of UK business banking market share, Starling has managed to carve out a niche in the hugely competitive world of fintech, and, unlike many competitors, turn a profit.
