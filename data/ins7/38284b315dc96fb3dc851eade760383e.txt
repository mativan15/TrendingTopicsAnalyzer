American Battery Technology Company has completed its initial exploration program of its permitted 22-hole plan at its 10,340 acre Tonopah Flats Lithium Project in Big Smoky Valley, Nevada. 'These additional exploratory drill results exceeded our expectations, and the fact that the material sampled at 710 feet is still exhibiting anomalous high lithium concentrations indicates that we have yet to identify the bottom of this deposit,' stated ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert.
