UBS cut lithium company Albemarle to a neutral rating from buy on Thursday, after the stock's 35% surge in May — even as the broader market faltered. Much of the stock's rally is due to the company reporting strong earnings at the beginning of May amid a boom in lithium prices. The company hiked its full-year guidance twice over the course of the month. At this point, UBS said that near-term earnings growth has been pulled forward into 2022 and the first half of 2023. "While this benefits near term earnings, lithium prices are now well above the cost curve, and the likely direction of pricing over the next 5 years is down," analysts led by Joshua Spector wrote in a note to clients.
