A small but vocal group of Redditors has taken umbrage at the Securities and Exchange Commission's latest attempt to 'educate' retail investors. Meme-stock traders on subreddits like 'Wall Street Bets' and 'Superstonk' are complaining that the latest entries in the SEC's 'Investomania' series of YouTube videos are insulting and even hypocritical. CNBC showed one of the videos earlier this week, perhaps helping to trigger the backlash. In a thread entitled 'A Message to the SEC', one Redditor said the 'entire market is a meme stock,' while claiming the agency has allowed dark pools and algorithmic market makers to continue tilting the market to their advantage, but leaving retail traders without adequate information to compete effectively.
