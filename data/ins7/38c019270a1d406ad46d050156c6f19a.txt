David McCormick has conceded the Republican primary in Pennsylvania for US Senate to the celebrity heart surgeon Dr Mehmet Oz, ending his campaign more than two weeks after the election as he acknowledged an ongoing statewide recount wouldn't give him enough votes to make up the deficit.McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO, said on Friday evening that he had called Oz to concede.'It's now clear to me with the recount now largely complete that we have a nominee,' McCormick said at a campaign party at a Pittsburgh hotel.
