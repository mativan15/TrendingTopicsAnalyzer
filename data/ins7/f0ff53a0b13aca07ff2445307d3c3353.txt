Collider.com It's hard to believe how long it's been since new episodes of The Dragon Prince were last released. Prepare to gasp…it was November 2019! Despite the lengthy wait, it's been time well spent for all involved in the show's production, but a bit more on that later. Firstly, just a quick refresher on who made the series, what it's about, and where we last left all these characters. The Dragon Prince was co-created by Aaron Ehasz and Justin Richmond. Ehasz has been involved in animation for a long time, being the head writer on Avatar: The Last Airbender, as well as a writer and story editor on Futurama.
