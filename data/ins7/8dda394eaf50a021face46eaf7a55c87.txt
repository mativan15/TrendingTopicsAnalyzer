Giovanni DiGiacomo is a redshirt junior outfielder from Naples, Florida, that has played at LSU for four seasons. Over those four seasons, he amassed a career .275 batting average with 12 doubles, three triples, six homers and 48 RBI.
Last season was statistically his worst season as a Tiger, as he only hit .206 in 36 games played. After LSU fell to Southern Miss in the NCAA Hattiesburg Regional, DiGiacomo announced he was going to enter the famed transfer portal to see what opportunities were possible outside of returning to Baton Rouge.
