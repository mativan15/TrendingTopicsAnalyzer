Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal on Sunday accused the Tamil Nadu government of distributing sub-standard quality of rice to the poor in the State. Rejecting his charge, State Food Minister R. Sakkarapani countered that such allegations were being levelled since Tamil Nadu was opposing many of the BJP-led Union government's policies.
