Britain has paid Rwanda an extra £20 million to fund the processing of migrants, despite failing to deport anybody to the African country, it has emerged.The extra payment has pushed the cost of the government's controversial Rwanda policy up by almost a fifth before it has been implemented.It comes on top of the £120 million that the UK initially agreed to pay Rwanda under the initial terms of the migration and economic development partnership that was signed in April.That money went towards unrelated development projects in the African country.
