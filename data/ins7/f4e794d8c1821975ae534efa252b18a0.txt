iStockRepresentative ImageGujarat-based electric two-wheeler maker WardWizard Innovations on Thursday said it has recorded over a three-fold jump year-on-year in sales to 2,055 units in May, driven by the growth in the low-speed category. The company, which sells its two-wheelers under the 'Joy e-bike' brand, had sold 479 vehicles in the market in May last year, it said in a statement. WardWizard Innovations also announced that it will commence deliveries of its high-speed scooters this month. The company, early this year, made its entry into the high-speed scooter segment by launching three scooter models -- Wolf+, Gen Next Nanu+ and Del Go.
