If all four exit Stamford Bridge it would leave Thiago Silva, Trevoh Chalobah and Malang Sarr as the club's only recognised centre-backs, though the Brazilian defender may have given Boehly a hint as to who his preferred defensive partner would be next season as he liked an Instagram post linking Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea.Kounde played every minute of Sevilla's Europa League campaign this season, along with 32 La Liga and five Champions League appearances, as the Spanish side were knocked out of the group stage in the Champions League and then by West Ham in the last 16 of the Europa League.
