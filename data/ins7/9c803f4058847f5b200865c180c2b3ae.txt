Oct. 17—OXFORD — No. 7 Ole Miss has played well on the road so far in 2022. But the next two Saturdays will be a completely different beast.

The Rebels (7-0, 3-0 SEC) travel to Baton Rouge to face LSU (5-2, 3-1) on Saturday at 2:30 p.m., the first of tough back-to-back games against SEC competition in hostile territory. Ole Miss faces Texas A&M (3-3, 1-2) on Oct. 29 at 6:30 p.m.

Ole Miss is 24-42-1 all-time in Baton Rouge. LSU has won four of the last five meeting against the Rebels overall. Ole Miss hasn't won at LSU since 2008.
