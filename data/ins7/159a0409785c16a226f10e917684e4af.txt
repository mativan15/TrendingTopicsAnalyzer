The Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday announced its first list of 62 candidates for the Himachal Pradesh assembly elections slated for November. The party, in a bid to buck anti-incumbency, denied tickets to 11 sitting legislators, shifted two ministers and fielded 16 new faces. The list also features five women. The nominees were finalised in the central election committee meeting held on Tuesday night, which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah and national president JP Nadda.
