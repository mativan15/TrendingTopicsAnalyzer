There have been many times I had to make sure I put in the right amount so that more money wouldn't disappear out of my account. Yung Joc found himself in a little bit of a mistake. Joc posted on his Instagram that he accidentally sent $1800 to someone via Zelle. He sent the money to a random person. First off, how do you do that? Well, after realizing what he did, he texted the number he sent the money to and asked for them to do the right thing and return the money since he didn't know them and they don't know Joc.
