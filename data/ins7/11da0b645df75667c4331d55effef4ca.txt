Scott Olson/Getty Images News U.S. stocks had pared most of their gains, with the S&P 500 slipping into negative territory, and Treasury yields were again inching up as positive momentum from strong quarterly reports and weak housing data stalled after further hawkish commentary from a Fed official. The benchmark S&P 500 (SP500) was 0.09% lower at 3,691.73 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP.IND) had gained 0.24% to 10,706.44 points, as a rise in shares of Alphabet and Amazon counteracted a slide in Tesla.
