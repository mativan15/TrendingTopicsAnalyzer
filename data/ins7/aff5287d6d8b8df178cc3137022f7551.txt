Since being named the new president of CNN, Chris Licht has been vocal about his ambition of shifting the network away from being anti-Trump TV in order to restore the journalistic credibility CNN once had. At first, his personnel and programming changes seemed to signal his seriousness. Licht fired Brian Stelter, Jeffrey Toobin and John Harwood, all three were known for their hostile commentary towards former President Trump. He then yanked uber-liberal anchor Don Lemon from primetime and demoted him to a soon-to-be-revamped morning show (he denies he was demoted) alongside Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, replacing "New Day" co-host John Berman and Brianna Keilar (both will find new roles at the network).
