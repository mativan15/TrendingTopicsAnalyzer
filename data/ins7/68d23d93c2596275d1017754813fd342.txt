Friday was a good day for the broad market, but a great one for oil and gas stocks. Schlumberger Limited (SLB 10.33%) ended today's session up 10.3% following an encouraging third-quarter earnings report, lifting several competitors' stocks with it. Transocean (RIG 5.59%) rallied 5.6% while Chevron (CVX 2.50%) closed 2.5% higher, for instance, capping off a third week of bullishness that could continue into the foreseeable future.
Still, investors will want to carefully pick and choose energy stocks in this environment.
