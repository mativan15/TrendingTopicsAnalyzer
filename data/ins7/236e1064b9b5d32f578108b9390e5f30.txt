Year: 2016

Over the roars of a crowd celebrating in the closing seconds of the Class 1A championship, Minneapolis North coach Charles Adams noticed his phone ringing.

Former Polars standout Tyler Johnson — he was a Gophers freshman by then and on his way to an NFL career — was calling Adams to congratulate him on North's 30-14 victory over Rushford-Peterson.

"He is the only person that has that kind of clearance," Adams said, laughing.

Johnson and Adams were sharing a moment that was five years in the making.
