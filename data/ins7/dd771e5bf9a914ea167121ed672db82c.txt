Oct. 19—PULLMAN — Ahmir Crowder had been a key piece in Washington State's rotation at the defensive tackle position during the past two seasons. But the veteran Cougar lost his spot this year. Now, he's looking for a new home.

Crowder announced Tuesday through Twitter that he has entered the NCAA's transfer portal.

"I'm nothing short of grateful," he tweeted. "I have made relationships here at Washington State that will last a lifetime. However, after talking with my family I have decided that it is best for me to take my opportunity elsewhere.
