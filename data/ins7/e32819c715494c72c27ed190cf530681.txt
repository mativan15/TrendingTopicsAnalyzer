The Charlotte Knights returned to profitability during the 2022 season, bolstered by an attendance increase of 31% over last year. Despite the gains, the Triple-A Chicago White Sox affiliate still fell short of 2019 attendance and revenue — in line with industry trends.

Dan Rajkowski, Knights chief operating officer, said the team delivered a solid business performance after pandemic-marred seasons the previous two years. In 2020, minor-league baseball canceled the season because of Covid-19. And in 2021, the season began with capacity limits in North Carolina due to state health protocols.
