Kena Betancur/Getty Images News Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) investors have been on one heck of a ride, and all that excitement may be obscuring the tremendous fundamental progress the company has been making. Going public in April 2019, the company grew rapidly due to COVID lockdowns and enterprises' rapid shift to work from home. From October 2019 through October 2020, the stock went from ~ $66 to ~$560 per share. However, the stock began to pull back as investors realized that the valuation got ahead of itself, and there were better returns available with reopening plays such as Marriott (MAR).
