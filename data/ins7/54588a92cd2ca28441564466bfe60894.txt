The Kansas City Chiefs were on the losing end of the latest battle with the Buffalo Bills in Week 6. The crowd at Arrowhead Stadium was in full force, as usual, to support the Chiefs continuing to build on the famously loud reputation.

Bills TE Dawson Knox joined a special NFL-hosted Twitter space on Tuesday night in honor of National Tight End Day, which takes place on Sunday. Speaking with NFL Network hosts Rhett Lewis and Stacey Dales, Knox opened up about the team's preparation going into last Sunday and the raucously loud crowd at Arrowhead Stadium.
