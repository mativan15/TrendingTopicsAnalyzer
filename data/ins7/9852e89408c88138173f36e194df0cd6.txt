With free agency around the corner again, we're entering a new transactions cycle that will come with many trades. This is why HoopsHype prepared its first trade value rankings

The HoopsHype staff got together to vote on these players to compile these rankings. We got to this conclusion after weighing factors such as a player's talent, age, availability, positional scarcity, current salary, and what their next contract could look like.

Ranking will be updated constantly as events such as new contracts, injuries, and changes in performance occur.
