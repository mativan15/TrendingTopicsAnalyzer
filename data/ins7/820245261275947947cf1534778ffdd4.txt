Six months ago, community-funded emergency crisis shelters were placed on church properties throughout the Halifax Regional Municipality.
The Archdiocese of Halifax-Yarmouth facilitated the project with the goal of providing a safe and warm shelter for people in need over the winter.One of the project coordinators says since then, the need has only increased.'We've extended for the summer and we're preparing by putting in some air conditioning. We're hiring a full-time project coordinator to be more intensive in our efforts to assist the people in the units take the next step,' John Stevens said, a member of the Archdiocese of Halifax-Yarmouth.
