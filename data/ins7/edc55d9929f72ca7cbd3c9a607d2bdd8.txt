The Government is hinting at a Royal Commission of Inquiry into its Covid response, with the intent of using it to help shape future pandemic laws. While announcing steps to scrap the bulk of Covid powers, including lockdowns, mandates and gathering limits, Chris Hipkins said Cabinet had had discussions about an inquiry into the response. Hipkins, who was standing in for Covid-19 Response Minister Ayesha Verrall, said he had always been clear that once New Zealand's Covid response got to the point it is in now 'it would be the right time to do something more formal and more sort of arm's length than we've done before'.
