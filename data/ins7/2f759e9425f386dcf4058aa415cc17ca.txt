The Delhi High Court has stayed the trial of former coal ministry official MP Dixit in a money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate till the next date of hearing (February 8) and issued notices to ED on Dixit's petition. "Once sanction for prosecution has been declined and the file of the case under Prevention of Corruption Act has been consigned to record room, there is no offence registered or pending enquiry or trial before a competent forum," HC said in its stay order passed last week.
