I fear I'm going to upset a few people with this column.

That's because I'm going after both sides in the divisive debate over identity in crypto and finance: blinkered monetary regulators on the one hand and blind crypto idealists on the other. In their own way, each is obstructing progress on sensible cryptographic identity systems, the kind that would give us solid online privacy while also enabling the secure, sustainable expansion of digital innovation in the public interest.

The type of regulator I'm targeting is unable to think outside the business-as-usual box of bureaucracy.
