Some alleged unpaid royalties are catching up with this entertainer, according to a new lawsuit. Rapper B.o.B. — born Bobby Ray Simmons, Jr. — now owes $3 million to his former managers, TMZ reports.

According to Round Hill Music and Artists Rights Management, the Georgia native allegedly violated a deal that he had with the companies after refusing to hand over royalties for public performances from some of his tracks dating back to 2017.

'I have not seen the lawsuit but am aware my former manager had entered into agreements without my knowledge,' said B.
