Key Points

Adobe called for about 9% growth in the upcoming fiscal year, compared with almost 13% growth in the most recent quarter.
But the forecast would have been 4% higher if it were not for the stronger U.S. dollar, Adobe said.
CEO Shantanu Narayen said the company continues to succeed in the current economy.

Adobe shares rose as much as 4% late on Tuesday after the software maker issued guidance for the next fiscal year that fell short of expectations, but blamed some of the shortfall on a stronger dollar and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
