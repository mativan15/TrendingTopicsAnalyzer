The Jaguars have the opportunity to earn its third-straight victory against a division opponent.

Before October began, Southern University was 1-2 after being shut out by Texas Southern. Since the turn of the month, the Jaguars have looked like a new team, completely destroying Arkansas – Pine Bluff 59-3, then defeating Prairie View A&M 45-13 at Prairie View.

Quarterback Besean McCray was already producing for the Jaguars this season, but his improved accuracy is the biggest difference between the first three games and the last two.
