Danielle Allen accidentally bought a $4,000 piece by surrealist master Salvador Dalí at an auction.

She says she bid on it out of FOMO, expecting to be quickly outbid. Instead, she won.

Allen took to TikTok in a now-viral video, sharing the story and encouraging bids.

28-year-old Colorado-based Danielle Allen didn't intend to purchase a $4,000 piece of art history at an art auction she'd found via billboard, but that's exactly what happened.
