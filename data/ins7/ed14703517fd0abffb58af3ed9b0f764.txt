Oatly Group AB (NASDAQ:OTLY) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 18% in the last month. But that isn't much consolation for the painful drop we've seen in the last year. Indeed, the share price is down a whopping 83% in the last year. It's not uncommon to see a bounce after a drop like that. The real question is whether the company can turn around its fortunes. We really feel for shareholders in this scenario. It's a good reminder of the importance of diversification, and it's worth keeping in mind there's more to life than money, anyway.
