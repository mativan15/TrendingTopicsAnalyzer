Datsun is the oldest existing Japanese automaker, and there's some interesting and unusual history about their automobiles.
In 1914 a company called the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in Tokyo built a car they branded 'DAT,' which were the initials of the company's three partners. The company built some cars and military trucks starting in 1918, and by 1925 DAT began to build civilian trucks in addition to cars. In those days, the car market was pretty small, so the emphasis was on trucks. A year later a merger changed the company's name to DAT Automobile Manufacturing Co.
