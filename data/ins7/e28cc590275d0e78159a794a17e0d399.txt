Arrest warrants have been issued for South Korea's former defence minister and coast guard chief over their alleged involvement in a cover-up related to North Korea's killing of a South Korean fisheries official in 2020.
The Seoul Central District Court issued the warrants on Saturday for former Defence Minister Suh Wook and former Coast Guard Commissioner General Kim Hong-hee, citing risks of the suspects fleeing or destroying evidence.
Last week, South Korea's investigative agency, the Board of Audit and Inspection, demanded prosecutors probe a total of 20 people, including Suh and Kim, for allegedly covering up key facts related to the 2020 killing of 47-year-old fisheries official, Lee Dae-jun, by North Korean border soldiers.
