The Securities and Exchange Board of India has written to the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) seeking a special exemption for nominee directors appointed by debenture trustees on the board of companies, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. The proposal is aimed at shielding these directors from disqualification in the event of the company defaulting on its debenture obligations. Currently, under the Companies Act, if a company fails to file its annual reports or other statutory documents for three years, the directors of the company stand disqualified.
