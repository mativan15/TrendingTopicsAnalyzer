On September 30 1982, Bruce Springsteen released Nebraska, his sixth studio album. Recorded in the living room of a rented house in Colts Neck, New Jersey, with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica as its prominent instruments, the 10-song collection is its author's most complete, not to mention his most compelling, examination of street-level America. As one of the record's doomed narrators warns, 'down here it's just winners and losers and don't get caught on the wrong side of that line'. 
It's a tough world, alright.
