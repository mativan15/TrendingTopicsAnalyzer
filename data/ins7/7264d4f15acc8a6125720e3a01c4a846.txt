UFC heavyweight and Tommy Fury's former training partner Tom Aspinall has offered his support to Jake Paul as he continues his boxing career. The YouTuber-turned-boxer is a controversial figure in the combat sports world, and has an ongoing feud with Aspinall's old pal Fury. But he has also made a push for positive change with regards to fighter pay, demanding that Dana White offer UFC fighters more money than the current promotional average. And he has the support of the No.6-ranked UFC heavyweight, who is set to return to the octagon against Curtis Blaydes in London on July 23.
