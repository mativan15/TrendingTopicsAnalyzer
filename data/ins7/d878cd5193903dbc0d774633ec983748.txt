(RTTNews) - Ahead of Friday's holiday for Queen Suthida's birthday, the Thai stock market had moved lower in back-to-back sessions, sinking more than 15 points or 1 percent along the way. The Stock Exchange of Thailand now sits just above the 1,645-point plateau and it may take further damage on Monday.

The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft on pessimism over the outlook for interest rates following a stronger than expected jobs report from the United States. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion.
