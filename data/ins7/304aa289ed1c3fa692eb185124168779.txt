N.C. State baseball coach Elliot Avent said after an ACC Tournament win over Wake Forest last week that his team had done enough to make the NCAA Tournament.

The Wolfpack (36-21) won two games after defeating the Demon Deacons, advancing to the ACC title game before falling 9-5 to UNC.

"I definitely think we've done enough to be in the NCAA Tournament," said Avent, who watched his team come back from a 4-0 deficit to beat the sixth-seeded Demon Deacons and eliminate them from semifinal contention.
