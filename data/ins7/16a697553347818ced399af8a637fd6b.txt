Analysts are divided over the near-term and future trajectory of Tesla shares after the electric vehicle company posted mixed third-quarter results.

Shares traded about 6% lower in the premarket amid the news. Piper Sandler's Alexander Potter attributed much of the move to the company's gross margins — which came in at 27.
