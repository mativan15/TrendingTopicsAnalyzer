According to the latest figures from estate agent Foxtons rents rose in September up from the record amount of £549 set in June this year as landlords raised rents. Supply shortages still dominate in the capital with an average of 29 renters compete for each property with many private landlords expecting bidding wars and six months to a year rental up front from rental applicants.
