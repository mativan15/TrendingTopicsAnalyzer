The Playlist It's been a minute since 'The Crown' season four, two years to be exact, which was almost an entire pandemic ago, but Peter Morgan's acclaimed Netflix series finally returns in November. Season four was set between 1979 and 1990, is set during Margaret Thatcher's 11-year run as prime minister, and also introduced Lady Diana Spencer into the series. The fifth season of 'The Crown' is set entirely in the 1990s and, in doing so, ages up a lot of the characters who are now played by new actors.
