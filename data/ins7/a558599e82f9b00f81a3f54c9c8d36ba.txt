 MONTREAL — An Iranian-Canadian director says he was unable to attend a film festival in London Friday as Iranian authorities prevented his departure.
Director Mani Haghighi said in an Instagram video that he was unable to attend a screening of his film at the London Film Festival because Iranian authorities stopped him from boarding his flight in Tehran and later confiscated his passport.
