We have always adored Shweta Tiwari for not just her screen presence but also for her vibrant closet choices. Embracing the summer trend of wearing bright outfits, Shweta opted for a turquoise one-shoulder mini dress. The full sleeved dress had a layered ruffle detailing and a beautiful flare to it. Shweta accessorised the look with golden hoop earrings. Leaving her silky mane loose, the actor kept her makeup minimal with soft kohled eyes and pale pink lip tint. Bright summer palette trend cannot be missed as Bollywood divas have been slaying some colourpop summer outfits lately.
