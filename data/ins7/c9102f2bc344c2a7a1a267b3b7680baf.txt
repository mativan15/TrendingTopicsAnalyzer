The first occurrence was unprecedented. The second was unfathomable. Utility player Tucupita Marcano hit a two-run home run off Julio Urías' poorly located four-seam fastball in the second inning Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates an early four-run lead. Just as he did Monday night against Walker Buehler. Second inning. Poorly located four-seam fastball. That three-run home run provided Pittsburgh with an early lead. The home runs were the first of Marcano's big league career.
