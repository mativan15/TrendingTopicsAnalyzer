Hallmark meets Harlequin in "Book Lovers," a fun, witty (and occasionally quite steamy) rom-com of a novel by Emily Henry, the author of "People We Meet on Vacation" and "Beach Read." Platinum blonde "shark" Nora Stephens has a demanding career as a literary agent in her native Manhattan, and a beloved younger sister, Libby, who is a married mother of two. Four times, Nora has lived through the "small-town love story," in which she's dumped when her boyfriend decides to leave the big city (and her) for a sweet gal in the hinterlands.
