Legislative proposals to impose minimum service levels on transport networks during strikes erode devolution, Scotland's transport minister has said.Jenny Gilruth said the Scottish Government will not support the Transport Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill which aims to place restrictions on trade union industrial action.It follows numerous rail strikes in recent months as workers campaign for better pay and conditions.The Bill would mean employers could specify the number of staff required to meet an adequate service level during strikes.
