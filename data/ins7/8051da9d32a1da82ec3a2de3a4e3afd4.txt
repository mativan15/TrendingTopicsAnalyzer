Energy bill reminder on telephone

A scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April, the new chancellor has said.

Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost "significantly less than planned".

He said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring wholesale energy prices.

The move sparked concern among consumer groups who warned households would be plunged into uncertainty.

"Everyone knows why decisions have been made at breakneck speed, but there are questions that need to be answered, and answered quickly," said National Energy Action boss Adam Scorer.
