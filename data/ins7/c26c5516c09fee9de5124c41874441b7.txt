APPresident Joe Biden speaks to reportersUS President Joe Biden said Monday he would not send rocket systems to Ukraine that could hit targets well inside Russian territory, despite urgent requests from Kyiv for long-range weapons. "We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia," Biden told reporters in Washington. 
 Pro-Western Ukraine has received extensive US military aid since Russia invaded its outgunned neighbor in late February, but says it needs long-range rockets equivalent to what Moscow's forces use.
