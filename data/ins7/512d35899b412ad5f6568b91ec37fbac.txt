The Uttar Pradesh BJP organised a first-of-its-kind meeting of Pasmanda Muslims in Lucknow on Sunday (October 16), part of the party's effort to reach out to the non-privileged majority among the community in India.
UP Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak compared the treatment of Pasmandas by political parties to ‘tejpatta' (bay leaves), which are thrown away after the ‘biryani' has been flavoured, and assured the gathering that the Narendra Modi government would be different.
Who are the Pasmanda Muslims?
Pasmanda is a Persian word that means the ‘ones left behind'.
