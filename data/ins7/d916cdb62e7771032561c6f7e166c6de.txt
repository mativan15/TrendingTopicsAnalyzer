G0d4ather/iStock via Getty Images Communications stocks returned to downward movement for the past week - a week after the sector pulled off a broad rally - as economic uncertainty reigned in the past several days, including fretting about a potential recession even amid a strong jobs report. The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) fell 1% over the past five sessions, in line with a broader market drop as S&P 500 stocks fell just over 1% for the week. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was tops among big-company gainers over the past five sessions.
