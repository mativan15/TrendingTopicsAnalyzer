Duke (4-3, 1-2 ACC) at Miami (3-3, 1-1), Saturday, 12:30 p.m. EDT (Regional networks)

Line: Miami by 9 1/2, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

Series record: Miami leads 15-4.

WHAT'S AT STAKE?

Might be time to start thinking about bowl eligibility. One of these teams will pick up loss No. 4, and neither team has a cakewalk schedule down the stretch of the regular season as they try to get to that six-win bowl-eligibility level.

KEY MATCHUP

Miami vs. Duke's red zone defense. The Hurricanes have moved the ball well over the last two weeks — piling up nearly 1,000 yards in games against North Carolina and Virginia Tech — but all that real estate has led to only 44 points.
