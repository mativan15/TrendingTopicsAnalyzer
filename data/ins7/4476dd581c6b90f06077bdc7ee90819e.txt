Located just west of Charlottetown, Seven's Pinballorama offers the most playable pinball machines under one roof in Canada. Opened in the spring of 2022, the arcade features around 40 machines and counting, ranging from the 1950s to the present day. Players can try their hand at electro-mechanical machines from the 60s and 70s, solid-state games from the late 70s (hello, digital display readouts, ramps, and flashing lights on the playfield), and increasingly complex dot-matrix display machines of the 1990s.
