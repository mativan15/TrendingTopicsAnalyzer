Q: My financial advisor wants me to buy some 'private' real estate investment trusts that are not listed in the paper. Is that something to be worried about?

I'd say yes. You should be so worried that you should consider advice from someone else. Nontraded REITs are notorious for paying several layers of high commissions to promoters and broker/salesmen. The investments stay opaque for years and many investors do not receive all their initial investment back, much less any return on their investment.
