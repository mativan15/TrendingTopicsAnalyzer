With the holiday dales events finally in the rear view mirror, many retailers can now focus on the next PS5 restock. We know the next big PS5 restock is headed to Walmart on June 2 at 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET). This Walmart Plus Day restock is part of Walmart's paid membership program as a way to encourage people to sign up and take advantage of other discounts. That doesn't mean this will be the only PS5 restock this week, in fact it's likely Best Buy and PlayStation Direct will offer up similar opportunities to score a console.
