Economists and politicians were expecting to cheer a decent drop in inflation on Tuesday, but when it arrived it was so small that it failed to muster even a polite 'gidday'. Annual inflation has dropped from 7.3%, to 7.2%, but economists are now not writing-off the risk that the next move in inflation could be up rather than down. What's driving inflation now? The price of imports and other goods and services whose prices are largely determined overseas (tradeables) are still rising faster than those of locally-priced goods and services (non-tradeables) and account for a decent chunk of overall inflation.
