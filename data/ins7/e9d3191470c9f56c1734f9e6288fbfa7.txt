By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 21:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 Temporary accommodation for Queensland natural disaster victims will be fast-tracked in a bid to ease the state's housing crisis. Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Steven Miles says temporary housing after disasters such as floods won't need planning approval from Friday. The moves comes after the state government's housing summit on Thursday, with a suite of other proposals to ease the housing crisis to be presented to parliament next month.
