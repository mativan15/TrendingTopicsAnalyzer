SEATTLE -- Julio Rodríguez has lived nearly his entire life -- 21 years of it -- with the Mariners sitting on a blank page between chapters of success.
Seattle's superstar was just nine months old when the 2001 Mariners made this franchise's last postseason appearance, tying an MLB record with 116 wins before falling to the Yankees in the ALCS. Ichiro was a rookie and MVP. Edgar Martinez was 38. Flip phones were cool.
Now, the Mariners have been reborn in a new image, and so much of their new identity is Rodríguez.
