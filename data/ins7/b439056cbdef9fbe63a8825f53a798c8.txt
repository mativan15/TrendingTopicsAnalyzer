(RTTNews) - The Japanese stock market is sharply higher on Monday, extending the gains in the previous session, with the Nikkei 225 moving above the 27,200 level, following the broadly positive cues from Wall Street on Friday, with Technology stocks higher, mirroring their peers on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The slowing inflation data from the U.S. also lifted sentiment. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is up 470.98 points or 1.76 percent at 27,252.66, after touching a high of 27,298.40 earlier. Japanese shares ended notably higher on Friday.
