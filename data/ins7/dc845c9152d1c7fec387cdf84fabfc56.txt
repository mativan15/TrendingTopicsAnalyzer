Faced with rising inflation including record-high gas prices, Americans are the most downcast about the U.S. economy since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new Gallup poll. The findings echo those of a recent CBS News poll which also found widespread pessimism about the state of the economy. Public confidence in the economy is the lowest it has been since the end of the Great Recession in early 2009, Gallup found in surveying more than 1,000 adults representing all 50 states between May 2 and May 22.
