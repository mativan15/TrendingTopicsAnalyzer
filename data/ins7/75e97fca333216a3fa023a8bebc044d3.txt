Sign up to receive the Future Tense newsletter every other Saturday. When my husband asked me if I wanted to try the 'cat trivia game' on Netflix, I thought it was going to be some sort of quiz about felines. I like cats, so I said sure. Then things got weird. Really weird. The 'cat trivia game,' it turns out, is Cat Burglar, which Netflix calls an 'edgy, over-the-top, interactive trivia toon.' It debuted in February and comes from the makers of Black Mirror. While you answer trivia questions, a Looney Tunes-esque cartoon about a cat named Rowdy tries to pull off a museum heist; answer the questions right to keep the story moving.
