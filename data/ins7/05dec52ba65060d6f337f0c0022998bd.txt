Just days after voicing his displeasure with the role in the team's offense, Jets wide receiver Elijah Moore is looking to move on

According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Moore has asked the Jets to trade him. Moore has been frustrated with his role and the number of targets in the team's offense.

Rapoport says the Jets have no plans to trade Moore at this time. He is the second Jets player this year that has asked for a trade. During the preseason, wide receiver Denzel Mims also requested a trade, but the Jets did not accommodate his wishes.
