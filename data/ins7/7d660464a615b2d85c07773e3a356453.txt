Standing in front of the mirror and maneuvering a thin thread of floss between your teeth is not a pleasant task. But, in addition to brushing your teeth with toothpaste, flossing is an important part of any oral hygiene routine. It removes plaque, a sticky film made of bacteria that coats your teeth and can cause cavities and eventual tooth decay. Dental floss is not the only option when it comes to removing plaque from teeth, however. Water flossers — also called powered interdental cleaners or oral irrigators — are an alternative to traditional dental floss that some may find easier to use.
