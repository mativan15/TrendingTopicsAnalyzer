As part of Ford's announcement that it will spend $3.7 billion to add 6,200 jobs at three of its Midwest factories in the coming years, it also revealed that a new model is on the way. The automaker said a new "electric commercial vehicle" will be entering production at its Ohio Assembly Plant sometime mid-decade, but didn't elaborate on what it will be.The facility currently manufactures F-Series Super Duty and medium duty trucks, but Ford CEO Jim Farley has recently said consumers shouldn't expect them to go electric soon, and that an internal combustion powertrain is better suited to the applications they are meant for.
