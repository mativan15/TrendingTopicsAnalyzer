Retail tycoon Mike Ashley has added fast fashion brand Missguided to his empire after snapping up the firm in a £20m ($25.2m) rescue cash deal.

It comes after the company collapsed into administration late on Monday after suppliers accused the business of millions of pounds worth of outstanding payments.
