Following the 1977 election, the incoming Irish government tried an experiment that ignored 'orthodox' economics. There was a splurge of public expenditure funded by borrowing, which the then government argued would result in a large and permanent increase in growth. Ministerial speeches assured that growth would be helped by dramatically reduced purchases of imported goods by Irish households, without any evidence they would actually do so.They didn't.The short-term fiscal stimulus brought temporary growth, but also a surge of imports into our open economy, eventually leading to a balance of payments crisis.
