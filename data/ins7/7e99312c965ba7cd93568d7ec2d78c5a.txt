TJX Companies (TJX) is competitively positioned to weather an economic slowdown, JPMorgan said Monday, underscoring the Club case for owning the off-price retailer. JPMorgan analysts added TJX — whose brands include T.J Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods — to their "Analyst Focus List," while reiterating an overweight rating and a Dec. 2023 price target of $80 a share. TJX stock, which is down about 13% year-to-date, was trading up more than 4% in midday trading Monday, at roughly $66.23 a share. The company's bargain department stores have historically remained appealing to shoppers during times of economic uncertainty, ranking TJX within "the top 10 percentile of consumer discretionary equity performance during an economic slowdown/contraction," the analysts wrote.
