As the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary heads to a recount, Democrats are going after both of the possible GOP candidates.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) released two ads on Thursday attacking Republican candidates Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick, who are separated by roughly 900 votes, or about 0.1 percentage points with Oz leading.

The winner will face off against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who cruised to victory in the Democratic primary.

The DSCC released separate ads attacking each Republican candidate, aiming to cast Oz as a 'Hollywood scam artist' and McCormick as a 'Wall Street insider.
