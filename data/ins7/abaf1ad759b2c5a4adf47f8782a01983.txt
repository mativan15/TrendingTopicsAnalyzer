A renowned Baptist minister in Louisiana pleaded guilty this week to stealing nearly $900,000 from his church, its rental properties and a charter school, using schemes that personally enriched him as he defrauded his parishioners of their donations and deceived tenants and educators, the Justice Department said.

Federal prosecutors said that the minister, the Rev. Charles Southall III, who wields far-reaching influence as the head pastor of the First Emanuel Baptist churches in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, where elected officials and police chiefs have been known to worship, pleaded guilty to a money-laundering charge on Tuesday in U.
