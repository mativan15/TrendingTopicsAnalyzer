Air New Zealand won't be the only place to experience some 'mother-tucking' flying fabulosity next year. Hot on the high heels of our national carrier, two more airlines have announced flights to the world's biggest LGBTQI+ celebration, WorldPride in Sydney, Australia. Qantas and Virgin Australia have also joined the Pride party with special services to what is being billed as the biggest event to hit Sydney since the 2000 Olympics. Organisers are expecting 500,000 participants over 17 days. Qantas' WorldPride Flight will take place from Los Angeles to Sydney on February 22 with entertainment from comedian Joel Creasey and drag stars.
