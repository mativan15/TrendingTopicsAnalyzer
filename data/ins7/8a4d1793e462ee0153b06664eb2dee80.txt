A soda company that's good for your gut all started over a gut feeling, its founders joke. Good Sh*t was the world's first pre and probiotic soda made in New Zealand. The range of beverages has four different flavours – cola, ginger, citrus and berry, and on Wednesday it launched its new flavour, tropical, after years in the pipeline. Co-founders Nick Brown and Rebecca Caughey created the drink that contained a billion probiotics, good bacteria that are like best mates for your gut, and 10 grams of prebiotic dietary fibre.
