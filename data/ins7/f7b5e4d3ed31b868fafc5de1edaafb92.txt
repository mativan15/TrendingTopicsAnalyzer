ImagineGolf/E+ via Getty Images Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) shares have popped ~4% pre-market after the oil and gas firm and its partners agreed to restart the West White Rose Project offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. The West White Rose Project is a $3.2B expansion project for the White Rose offshore oil field. The project, which around 65% complete, was stalled for over two years following pandemic-related market collapse. An amended royalty structure with the government of Newfoundland and Labrador, which provides safeguards to the project's economics in periods of low commodity prices, has contributed to the decision to restart the project.
