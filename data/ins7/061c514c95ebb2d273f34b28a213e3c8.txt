Bunting is an essential ingredient of any street or garden party but there are now fears of a shortage ahead of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations, amid a scramble for party supplies.Patriotic shoppers have been snapping up bunting, party hats and cake stands in huge volumes ahead of the bank holiday weekend. However the huge spike in sales had caught some retailers off guard, leading to some products selling out completely.The retail marketplace OnBuy said that jubilee paraphernalia such as a 20ft ream of union flag bunting that cost £4 had sold out, while button badges, union jack tablecloths and fancy dress props were selling in huge numbers.
