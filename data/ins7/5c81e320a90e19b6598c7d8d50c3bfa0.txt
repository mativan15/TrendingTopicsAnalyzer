The long-running stoush between the rail union and NSW government is set to escalate again with the union poised to switch off Opal card readers, in a move that will cost the government millions.

The readers will be turned off for the afternoon peak from Thursday, after members of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union voted in favour of taking protected industrial action last week.

From 3pm to 7pm every day - for an indefinite period - the readers will be switched off, the union said in a statement on Monday.
