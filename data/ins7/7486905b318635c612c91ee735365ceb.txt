Apple's latest-and-greatest tablets are here. Apple announced its next-gen iPad Pro lineup today without an in-person or prerecorded event. Instead, all we got was a simple press release. The biggest sell here is the M2 chip, which offers a modest 10% bump in processing prowess and a 35% jump in graphics grunt. Then there's the new Apple Pencil hover feature that shows contextual UI action before the stylus even touches the screen.
That's about the end of meaningful upgrades this year for the Pro tablet.
