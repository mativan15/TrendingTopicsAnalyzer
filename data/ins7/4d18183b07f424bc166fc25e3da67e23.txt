am a marketing analytics professional and have been at an agency for about 12 years now. Have had good growth and have worked on some large insurance and fin-tech clients focused on CRM analytics but mainly around direct marketing (direct mail, some EM) with exposure to some digital but limited.

I am at that place where I want to make a change, but don't want to just go to another agency. I would like to do something different and need help figuring out how to get to the next step.

Here are transferable skills-

crm analytics (segmentation, life time value etc.
