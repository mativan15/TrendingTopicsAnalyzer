The astonishing political demise of British Prime Minister Liz Truss shows what can happen when ambitious plans collide with a new financial market reality that places the fight against inflation above all else.

Truss resigned Thursday after just 44 days in office, a casualty of the market turmoil triggered by her plans to increase government borrowing and cut taxes despite an annual inflation rate above 10 percent.

The Truss implosion was fueled by distinctly British considerations. But the market upheaval - which at one point saw investors judge Britain a worse credit risk than notoriously profligate Italy - ignited unexpected difficulties in British pension funds and started a search for the next financial domino that could topple as interest rates climb.
