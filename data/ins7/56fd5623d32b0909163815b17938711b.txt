The Kerala High Court on Monday slammed the State government for playing hide and seek in the implementation of the High Court directives and government orders against the erection of illegal flex boards, hoarding, flags, and banners in public places such as the road margins and medians by political parties and others. Justice Devan Ramachandran, while hearing cases relating to the installation of unauthorised flags and banners, observed that the High Court was pursuing the issue for the last four years.
