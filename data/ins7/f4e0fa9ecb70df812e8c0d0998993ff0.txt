(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia is selling bonds and Islamic securities, while offering to buy back as much as $15.5 billion of debt.

The world's biggest oil exporter plans to sell sukuk maturing in six years and bonds due in 10, both denominated in dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter who's not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia asked holders of its bonds due in 2023, 2025 and 2026 to tender their notes for purchase by the kingdom for cash.
