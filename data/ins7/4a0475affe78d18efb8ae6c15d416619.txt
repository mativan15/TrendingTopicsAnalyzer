 Michael Flynn spent decades fighting wars overseas, from Central America to Iraq to Afghanistan.
Now, the retired three-star general is fighting a war at home.
The new documentary from FRONTLINE and The Associated Press, Michael Flynn's Holy War, traces that transformation, showing how Flynn has become a leader in a political movement that's attracting election deniers, conspiracy theorists and extremists from around the country.
Based on more than a year of reporting by award-winning director Richard Rowley (American Insurrection) and AP correspondent Michelle R.
