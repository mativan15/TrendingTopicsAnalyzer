By Kosaku Narioka Ain Holdings Inc.'s shares rose sharply Monday morning after the Japanese pharmacy operator posted a 5.9% increase in fiscal-year net profit and projected a sharp earnings growth for the new year.

Ain said Friday after the market closed that net profit climbed to 7.09 billion yen ($54.2 million) for the fiscal year ended April, as revenue gained 6.4% to Y316.25 billion, thanks to a recovery in the number of prescriptions and recent store openings, despite the continuing negative impact from the Covid-19 pandemic.
