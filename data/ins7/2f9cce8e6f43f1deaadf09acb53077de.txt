Michael Vi AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has become a more popular name among the dividend community over the years with good reason. Flat out, the company has performed on many different levels. Share Price Appreciation High-Yield Dividend Strong Dividend Growth All of these are what makes ABBV what I like to call an Investor's Trifecta. There are some high-yield dividend stocks out there that really only give you that nice yield. The dividend does not grow all that much and the share price stays pretty flat.
