Coinbase is pulling back on its hiring efforts. In a memo posted to Coinbase's site, chief people officer L.J. Brock announced that Coinbase is putting a pause on hiring new employees, as well as rescinding several job offers already accepted by prospective workers, citing 'current market conditions and ongoing business prioritization efforts.'
The shift comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to trend downwards, dragging the supposedly immovable stablecoins, which are pegged to a fiat currency or commodity, with it.
