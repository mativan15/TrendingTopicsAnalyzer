Police are treating menacing graffiti targeting actor James Nesbitt as a hate crime. The message threatening the Cold Feet star appeared on a wall in the predominantly unionist town of Portrush in Co Antrim, just weeks after the actor addressed a forum at an event organised by a group calling for a united Ireland. At the start of this month, James was one of the keynote speakers at an event organised by a group called Ireland's Future at the 3Arena in Dublin, in which the Bloody Sunday actor - who is from a unionist background - told the event he was open to a discussion about a possible united Ireland.
