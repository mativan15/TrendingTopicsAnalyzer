The N.W.T. can't spend money fast enough on existing capital projects, so it's revising how it's budgeting them and in some cases pushing timelines back on when they will be completed. A proposed $328-million 2023-24 capital budget was tabled in the legislature Tuesday. The territory's capital budgets have steadily climbed in recent years, but this one reverses course and is more than a third smaller than the previous year's budget of $502 million. There are no new big-ticket items proposed and no changes to annual allocations for small capital projects like annual highway chipseal work.
