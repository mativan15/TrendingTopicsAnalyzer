A woman has shared how, after leaving a relationship aged 38, she decided she was done putting off parenthood for when the right man came along.
Nikki Zachariou, from Jersey, Channel Islands, was so determined to enter motherhood that she opted for single parenthood instead. 
The pole dancing instructor, now 41, welcomed baby Kobi, now one, after undergoing two rounds of intrauterine insemination (IUI) – a fertility treatment that involves inserting sperm directly into her womb.
Initially, Nikki's plan was to freeze her eggs so they'd be ready for when she met the right partner.
