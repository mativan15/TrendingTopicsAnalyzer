A merger between Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. makes sense operationally but could be tough to get regulatory approval, analysts said.

Kroger (NYSE: KR) has 9.9% of the national grocery market share to rank second nationally, according to data and consumer insights provider Numerator. Albertsons (NYSE: ACI) ranks fourth at 5.7%. Walmart is the leader with 20.9%.

But regulators would look at individual markets. There's plenty of overlap in certain areas, particularly in the West in areas such as Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Seattle and Portland, Oregon.
