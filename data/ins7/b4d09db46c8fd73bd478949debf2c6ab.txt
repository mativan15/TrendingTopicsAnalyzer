The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it is taking legal action against six e-cigarette manufacturers to stop them from selling and promoting their products.

The agency for the first time asked the Department of Justice to seek permanent injunctions against vaping companies, after the companies repeatedly ignored warnings that some of their products are illegal, FDA and DOJ said in a joint release.

The action represents an escalation for the Biden administration, which has been facing criticism from Democratic lawmakers and advocacy groups for not doing enough to enforce existing law.
