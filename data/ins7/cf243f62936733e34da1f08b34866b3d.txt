Activision Blizzard has confirmed that the upcoming Diablo Immortal will not launch in the Netherlands and Belgium allegedly due to the restrictive legislation in these countries. Both the mobile and PC versions will not see the sunlight in both of these countries. Dutch news outlet Tweakers spoke to the communication manager of Activision Blizzard Benelux, who confirmed that the game will not be available in either app stores or the PC through Battle.net. "This is related to the current operating conditions for games in those countries," said the Blizzard spokesperson, who declined to comment further on the issue.
