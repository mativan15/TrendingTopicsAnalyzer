A Sydney high school has backed down on a plan to start scanning students' fingerprints when they use the toilets, after claiming it would stamp out 'vandalism'.The proposed measure by Moorebank High School, west of Sydney, raised alarm with one of Australia's leading digital rights groups over concerns it was an 'unreasonable' invasion of privacy.Activist group Digital Rights Watch said the school had since backflipped on the proposal after its campaign to the Department of Education.'The use of biometric surveillance — from fingerprint scanning to facial recognition — is on the rise,' a statement on their website reads.
