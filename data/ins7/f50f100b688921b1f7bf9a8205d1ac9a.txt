Taking on the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for searching premises linked to Shiv Sena Minister Anil Parab, the party on Saturday asked whether the central agency will raid Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over river Ganga getting polluted by floating dead bodies amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
The editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that there is a 'need to conduct global research on our country's investigative system and judiciary'. This comes in the backdrop of the ED raiding premises linked to Parab earlier this week.
