Tyson Fury elected to donate the £10,000 he won from his bet with promoter Frank Warren to charity DEBRA at today's press conference. It was today confirmed that the 'Gypsy King' would make a U-turn from his short retirement to step back into the ring with former two-time heavyweight rival Derek Chisora at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on December 3. The news was announced at a press conference today where he came face-to-face with 'WAR' as the pair prepare to do battle later this year. During the media event, Fury brandished a wad of cash worth £10,000 which he confirmed he had been given by long-term promoter Frank Warren after he bet that his planned contest with Anthony Joshua would collapse.
