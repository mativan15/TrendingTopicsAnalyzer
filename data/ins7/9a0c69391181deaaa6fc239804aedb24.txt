Checks on goods moving between England and Scotland would happen on two major trunk roads between the countries after independence, a Scottish Government document has said.The issue of the border has been a cause for concern over the years, with businesses worrying about the flow of goods from Scotland to its largest trading partner.A paper published on Monday by the Scottish Government sought to allay some fears over the issue, with the publication of the third document in a series designed to refresh the prospectus for Scottish independence.
