Technology giant Microsoft has sacked around 1,000 people in a fresh round of layoffs, according to US news website Axios. This is the third round of layoffs at the Big Tech firm since July. Microsoft had fired nearly 1% of its 180,000-strong workforce across offices and product divisions in July as part of a ‘realignment'.'Today we had a small number of role eliminations. Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities regularly, and make structural adjustments accordingly,' Microsoft said in a statement.
