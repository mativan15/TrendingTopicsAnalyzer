Monday night, when Sammy Blais took his first shift since suffering an ACL tear last Nov. 14, the winger told himself to land a hit to get going.
The 26-year-old wasted no time in getting back to his body-throwing ways in his season debut, which was delayed a few games due to a minor upper-body injury he sustained in the preseason finale. Head coach Gerard Gallant said he was just being cautious with Blais.
'It was something that, if I played through, I could have maybe made it worse,' said Blais, who recorded three hits and three shots on goal in 13:34 of ice time in the Rangers' 6-4 win over Anaheim.
