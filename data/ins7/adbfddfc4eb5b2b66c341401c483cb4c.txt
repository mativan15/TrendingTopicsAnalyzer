City officials in Hong Kong have cancelled an outdoor screening of the 2008 Batman movie The Dark Knight, according to a new report from Bloomberg News. No reason was given for the cancellation, but it's seen as the latest sign that Hong Kong is well and truly under the control of Beijing's censorship regime, something that would've been unthinkable just a few short years ago.The screening of The Dark Knight, which had been scheduled for October 27, was cancelled 'based on direction from the HK Government Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration,' according to Bloomberg.
