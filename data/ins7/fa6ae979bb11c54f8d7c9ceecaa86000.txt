Low- and no-code (LCNC) application builders leverage graphical user interfaces (GUI) and configurations to define and build databases, business logic, process flows, forms, and other application artifacts with minimal hand-coding. These tools convert the developer's designs into workable software that can then be deployed to corporate systems.

Low-code technologies, alongside customizable scripts and configurations, assist GUI designers in defining and building applications. Similar to low-code, no-code technologies create deployable and functioning solutions to develop applications primarily for people who are not familiar with coding.
