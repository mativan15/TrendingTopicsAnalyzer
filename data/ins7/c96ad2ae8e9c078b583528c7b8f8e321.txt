People are planning for smaller Christmases this year as prices soar, with a BBC survey uncovering growing concern about the squeeze on finances.

Three in five (62%) people polled said their Christmas and festive spending plans will be smaller than usual.

Adults with a household income under £40,000 are more likely to say their plans will be much smaller this year.

Prices rose at their fastest rate for 40 years again in September, with UK inflation expected to keep rising.
