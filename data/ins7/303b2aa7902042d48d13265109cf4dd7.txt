Health Minister Mark Butler accepts he may need to conduct an independent investigation into the system that has allowed billions of dollars to be rorted from Medicare without detection.

In an interview with the ABC's 7.30 on Tuesday, Butler said, 'that may well be where we end up', but he first wanted to see the initial results of an internal report he commissioned earlier this week on the Health Department's compliance and audit programs.

'Having asked the health department to inquire into itself, I've asked for a report on the existing systems and there will be further steps after that to ensure that we've got the best possible system to guarantee value for money,' he said.
