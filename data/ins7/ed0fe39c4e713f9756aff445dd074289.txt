Kudumbashree has launched a single State-wide toll-free number for accessing its Snehitha gender help desks across all 14 districts.Till recently, Snehitha help desks in districts could only be reached through separate toll-free numbers, which were not very easy to remember. While those individual toll-free numbers continue to be operational, a common six-digit toll-free number (155339) has also been made available now.'The new number being short has a higher recollective value, unlike the far too long toll-free numbers for district Snehitha gender help desks.
