Published: 16:06 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 16:06 EDT, 30 May 2022 Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon let loose spinning tunes at Napa Valley music festival's silent disco over the weekend. Solomon - one of Wall Street's toughest CEOs at one of its most demanding firms -  moonlights as a DJ where festival goers see a different side of the executive. Goldman Sachs, notorious for its long-hours culture, pushed for bringing staff in the office five days a week after only half of the bank's 10,000 person staff reported to headquarters in NYC when the office reopened on Feb.
