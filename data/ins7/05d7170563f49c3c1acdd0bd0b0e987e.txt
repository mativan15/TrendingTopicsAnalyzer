Days after the national capital got a new Lieutenant Governor in Vinai Kumar Saxena, the Delhi government on Monday effected a major bureaucratic reshuffle involving 40 officers. The transfer orders were issued by the Services Department, which comes under the LG. Former Principal Secretary (Revenue) and Divisional Commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar, who was shunted out to Ladakh last week following media reports suggesting misuse of official position, has been replaced by 1993 batch IAS officer Khilli Ram Meena.
