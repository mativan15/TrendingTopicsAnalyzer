Air India on Thursday said the airlines has received an 'unprecedented response' to its talent augmentation programme. The recruitment drive by the leading airlines, which was taken over by the Tata Group in January, forms a key pillar of its five-year transformation roadmap Vihaan.AI.

The airline, which had not recruited in non-operations areas for more than 15 years, is rapidly adding talent in all spheres of its business, ranging from commercial functions like revenue management, sales, distribution, network planning and marketing; business support services including HR, finance, IT and analytics; as well as operations, spanning inflight product design, ground, engineering & airport services, rostering and operations control.
