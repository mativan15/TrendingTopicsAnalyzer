The Los Angeles Times has launched a new civic engagement tool that shows Angelenos how to get involved in their communities.

Dubbed 'the people's guide to power,' Shape Your L.A. allows users to type in their address and get maps and relevant information about their local government and institutions, and how to contact their representatives in the state capitol and Washington, D.C.

'We're trying to demystify everything that is confusing and intimidating about L.A.,' said Times Utility Journalism Editor Matt Ballinger, who edited the project, which was spearheaded by the data and graphics and design teams.
