Jake DeBrusk returned and made an immediate impact.

Looking to stay undefeated in the young season, a heavily undermanned Bruins backend faced their toughest test yet against the high-flying offense of the Florida Panthers.

But a shorthanded Boston bunch wasted little time taking control in this one. A speedy and assertive Jake DeBrusk returned to the lineup with a bang, scoring just 21 seconds in.

Happy Birthday, Jake DeBrusk.
The B's winger scores on Boston's first shot of the night.
1-0 Bruins.
