If there's one thing I love as much as kissing my cat's fuzzy cheek while he rests it on his paws, it's an excellent sale on clean, celebrity-adored products. Luckily for me, Kosas' Summer Event sees 20 percent off all products through June 9 — but with bestsellers already going out of stock, the sale is worth jumping on quickly.

If you haven't been keeping up with the world of celebrity beauty recommendations, Hailey Bieber is the latest to profess her love for Kosas' concealer and talc-free setting powder (Emmy Rossum and Samara Weaving use the concealer, too).
