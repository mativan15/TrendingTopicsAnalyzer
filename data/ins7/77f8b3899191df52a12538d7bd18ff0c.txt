The St. Louis Cardinals exceeded internal projections for attendance at Busch Stadium in the 2022 season, ranking near the top of Major League Baseball for home attendance.

The Cardinals ranked second among MLB's 30 teams, with attendance of 3.32 million at Busch Stadium, trailing only the Los Angeles Dodgers' total of 3.86 fans. The Cardinals blew past their initial projections of home attendance of 2.75 million this season, with the unexpected surge comping in part thanks to the farewell tours of retiring star players Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina.
