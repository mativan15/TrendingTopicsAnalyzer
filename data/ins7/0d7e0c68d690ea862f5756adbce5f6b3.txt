After winning Bigg Boss Marathi 2, Shiv Thakare is now back in the game with Bigg Boss 16. The actor has left viewers of the show impressed with his strong personality, clear opinions and friendly nature, especially now that he is the captain of the house. Sharing that the Hindi show was always his dream, the actor said that God didn't want to give him such a big show at the start of his career and thus offered the Marathi show as the first step. 'Pehle ek sheher jaanta tha ab pura desh jaanega (Earlier just a state knew me, now the whole world will),' he told indianexpress.
