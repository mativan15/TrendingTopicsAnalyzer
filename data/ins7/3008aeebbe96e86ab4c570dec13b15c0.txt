Tensions arose between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier this week when BCCI secretary Jay Shah – who is also the president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) – made a big remark about traveling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup next year. Shah stated that India will not be touring the country for the continental tournament, and that the Asia Cup will instead be taking place at a neutral venue.The comment didn't sit well with the PCB, which issued a strongly-worded statement on the same on their official social media profiles on Wednesday.
