For a 90-minute pop concert, putting on Abba's new gig took a monumental effort. The band's return, in virtual performances in east London, which earned rave reviews from critics last week, has cost about £140 million, meaning they will need to play to almost full houses to turn a profit.Benny Andersson's son Ludvig, who is the show's music producer, said last week that he needs 'lots of people to come and see it for a very long time'. Why haven't Elvis and the Beatles done the same thing? Because it is 'so bloody expensive', according to Benny.
