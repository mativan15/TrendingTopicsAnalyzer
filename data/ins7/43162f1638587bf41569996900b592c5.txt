By Reuters Published: 03:09 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 03:09 EDT, 18 October 2022 Oct 18 (Reuters) - 888 Holdings Plc said on Tuesday its third-quarter revenue dropped, as the British bookmaker was weighed down by the country's tightened online player safety measures and the closure of its Dutch operations. Revenue in the reported period fell 7% to 449 million pounds ($509.48 million) from year-ago figures, the group said, adding that adjusted core earnings in the quarter improved from the first half of the year.
