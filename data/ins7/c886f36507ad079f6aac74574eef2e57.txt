[Photo/Xinhua] Russia slammed the United States on Wednesday for "adding fuel to the fire" in Ukraine as a result of Washington's announcement of a $700 million weapons package for Kyiv. US President Joe Biden announced that his administration agreed to send Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium range rocket systems, which the Ukrainian authorities have long asked for.
