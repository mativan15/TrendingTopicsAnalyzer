Cincinnati's convention center district would get $7 million from the city of Cincinnati under a proposal put forward by Mayor Aftab Pureval and the city administration.

The money will come from a massive, $85.1 million surplus with which the city ended fiscal year 2022. The city's FY2022 ended on June 30.

The funds would be used for pre-development and design costs associated with renovating the Duke Energy Convention Center, according to a memo by City Manager Sheryl Long.

Once the money is approved by Cincinnati City Council, the $7 million will be the first funds committed to the project by the city itself.
