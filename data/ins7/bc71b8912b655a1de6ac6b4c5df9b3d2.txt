At some point, somebody must have told Liz Truss that it hadn't gone well. That a) having to appoint a new chancellor after 39 days solely to cancel your entire program of government; and b) pretending you couldn't come to the commons chamber because you were too busy having a meeting with someone who it turned out was already in there; and then c) despite not being able to be there for a 'very serious' reason, suddenly appearing anyway like one of the twins from The Shining and sitting stock still, silent and smirking for a more than 30 minutes – this is not much of a way to pretend you know how to run a country.
