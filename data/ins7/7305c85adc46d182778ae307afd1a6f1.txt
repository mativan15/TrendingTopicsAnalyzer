Rita Melone, 94, was temporarily staying in a nursing home and constantly being reminded to use her walker by the staff when she needed to get somewhere. Melone, a retired instructional aide to middle school students, knew the constant reminders were frustrating to the home's staff.'You constantly heard everyone getting told to use their walker. If one of us fell, it would be a disaster,' she said during a recent interview. She spoke to her daughter, who was working at Hasbro Toys at the time, and said there needed to be a product out there that would make a noise and attract seniors to use their walker.
