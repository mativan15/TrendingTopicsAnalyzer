All three major stock indexes remained up in the final hour of trading on Monday, helped by improved sentiment after better-than-expected earnings from Bank of America Corp. and a decision by new U.K. finance minister Jeremy Hunt to abandon the bulk of previously announced, unfunded tax cuts. Dow industrials DJIA, +1.91% were up by 538 points, or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 SPX, +2.68% was higher by 2.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was up by 3.3%.
