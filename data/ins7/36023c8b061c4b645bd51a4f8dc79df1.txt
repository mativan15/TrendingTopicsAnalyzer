VANCOUVER, British Columbia and LONDON, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Construction of General Fusion's demonstration machine, which is being built at the UK Atomic Energy Agency's Culham Campus, advanced significantly with the fabrication of an at-scale fusion vessel trial ring by Sheffield Forgemasters. This critical component will confirm the specifications of the thick-walled fusion vessel, designed to withstand the high temperatures and compressive forces needed to create fusion energy with General Fusion's practical technology – Magnetized Targeted Fusion (MTF).
