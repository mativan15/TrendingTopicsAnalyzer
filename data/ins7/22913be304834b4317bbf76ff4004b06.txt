I am 66 years old and moved in with my girlfriend, who owns her own house. I invested $25,000 in repairs, and have made half the mortgage payments for the last five years. My name is on the refinanced mortgage, but not on the title deed.  What happens upon her death if there is no will? She has three children from her deceased husband. I believe the house should go to me. What should I do? The PartnerDear Partner, If your name is on the mortgage but not on the deed of the property, you are technically a co-signer on the mortgage — and you are responsible for paying the loan — but you are not a co-owner of the property.
