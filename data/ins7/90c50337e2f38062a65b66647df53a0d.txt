Former BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker has revealed that he feels "embarrassed by the amount I earn" by doing a job that he loves. The 45-year-old is set to start the next chapter of his career after making the decision to leave BBC Breakfast to be the new anchor for Channel 5 News. Dan was 18th on the BBC's highest-paid list, which was revealed last July, with a salary of between £295,000 and £295,999. This was for his presenting roles on the Breakfast Show and Football Focus - a role he left in April 2021 after 12 years.
