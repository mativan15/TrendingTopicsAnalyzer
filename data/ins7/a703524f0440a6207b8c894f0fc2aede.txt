Jun. 1—LARNED — A Topeka man facing felony forgery charges in three area counties appeared in custody Wednesday morning for formal arraignment in Pawnee County District Court.

Pawnee County Attorney Douglas McNett noted that Adam Collinge, 42, Topeka, is charged with forgery and theft by deception of at least $1,500 but less than $25,000. The charges stem from an allegation that on or about Jan. 20, Collinge passed a forged payroll check at a bank in Larned, McNett said.

At his scheduled preliminary hearing April 26, Collinge asked the Court to remove his appointed attorney, waived his right to counsel and demanded that the Court proceed with an immediate preliminary hearing.
