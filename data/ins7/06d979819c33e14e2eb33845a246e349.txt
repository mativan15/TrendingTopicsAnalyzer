Rushing to tell them about the company's acquisition agreement with the artist formerly known as Kanye West, top brass sent out an email that CC-ed a group of VIP members rather than blind carbon copying them. The result was that droves of partisan ghouls like Tim Pool and Laura Loomer had their email addresses shared with one another.News of the unintentional doxxing was initially shared by Adam Ryan, a newsletter writer, who tweeted Monday that the thread had exposed 'the personal emails of many verified users and Parler investors.
