The new US currency will be shipping this Monday and will have Chinese American actor Anna May Wong on its tail end. Her image on the currency will show her chin resting on her hands. Anna May Wong was the first Asian American Hollywood actress. She was a third-generation American whose acting career started with movies like "The Thief of Bagdad" in 1924 and "Toll of the Sea" in 1922. During that time, anti-Asian xenophobia was widely spread, and the Chinese Exclusion Act was still in effect. Anna May Wong became famous for dying a thousand deaths because she played many villainous roles.
