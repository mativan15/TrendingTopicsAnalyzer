LIVERMORE — A group of residents are pushing for the hotly-debated Springtown Golf Course to be transformed into open space and potentially even a park, a possibility city officials say is on the table but far from coming to fruition.

Stacey Swanson, a member of the recently formed North Livermore Community Alliance, said she and her neighbors think it's time to abandon the idea of reviving the golf course and instead focus on preserving the 90-acre parcel as a space for jogging, walking and other recreation.
