Toyota announced a number of updates for the 2023 Corolla lineup on Wednesday, but a few notable items didn't make the cut. The sporty-ish Apex Edition will go away for 2023, and Toyota will no longer offer a manual transmission in any Corolla -- well, except for the GR.The Corolla's standard engine is a 2.0-liter I4 with 169 horsepower and a continuously variable transmission. Previously, SE and XSE grades were offered with a six-speed manual gearbox -- complete with rev-matching, even -- but a Toyota spokesperson confirmed this will go away.
