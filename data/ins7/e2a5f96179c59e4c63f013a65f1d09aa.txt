Over the past century, the BBC has become a cornerstone of the world's broadcasting – bringing us such joys as the Queen's Christmas broadcast, to Blue Peter, Fawlty Towers, and beyond. Now, to mark its centenary, the British Broadcasting Corporation has announced a bumper year of sport, events, and landmark commissions for TV, radio, and online, to inform, educate, and entertain the nation. In 2022, special content has included the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, the Women's Euros, the Commonwealth Games, and the World Cup, as well as a host of other shows, from Frozen Planet II to Radio 1's Big Weekend.
