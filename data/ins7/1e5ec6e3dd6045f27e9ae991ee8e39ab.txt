USA TODAY Sports has released its updated bowl projections following Week 7 of the college football season. They currently have the Florida Gators playing the Oregon State Beavers in the Las Vegas Bowl, set to take place on Dec. 17.

Oregon State is having a moderately successful season. They currently sit at 5-2 overall, with their two losses coming in Pac-12 conference play at the hands of USC and Utah, two of the top teams in their conference. They are one win away from bowl eligibility, something that has eluded the Beavers in the last decade.
