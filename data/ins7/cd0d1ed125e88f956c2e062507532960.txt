The Kansas City Chiefs offense has shown resilience over the years against tough defensive opponents. Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes have found ways to humble some of the better defensive units around the league.
In Week 7, Mahomes will be faced with the San Francisco 49ers' talented defensive line that has helped skyrocket the defense to amongst the league's best. He had battles with their defense during Super Bowl LIV, most notably lineman Nick Bosa. The former league MVP shared his thoughts with reporters Wednesday on Bosa's impact during games, explaining that he's someone that you have to know where he's lined up at all times.
