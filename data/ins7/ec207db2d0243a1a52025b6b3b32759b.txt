Walton And JohnsonBy The Rod Ryan ShowOct 17, 2022Just when you thought politics couldn't get any weirder or more desperate, this happens: A 53-year-old named Mike Itkis is running for Congress in New York as an Independent, and basically has no chance. So he's trying to up his profile and win more votes . . . by releasing a SEX TAPE.   One of his platforms is "sex positivity." He thinks sex shouldn't be so taboo and wants to legalize prostitution. But political stunt or not, it's a REAL porno. He hired an X-rated actress named Nicole Sage to co-star in it with him.
