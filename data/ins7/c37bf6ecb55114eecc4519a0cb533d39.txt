Raiders tight end Darren Waller is due to make $7 million in compensation this season. That ranks 15th in the NFL at his position, and he ranks 17th in average pay for tight ends.

Waller has outplayed the contract he signed in 2019 as he has two years and no guaranteed money left on the deal.

Waller, though, has continued to participate in the Raiders' voluntary offseason program despite his desire for a new deal, letting his agent handle negotiations.
