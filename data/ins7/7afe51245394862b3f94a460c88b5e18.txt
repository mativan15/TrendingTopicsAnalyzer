Troubled Swiss bank Credit Suisse has paid $495 million to settle another legal case in the US over its mortgage-linked investments business in the latest scandal to hit the bank.The case relates to the bank's operations in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, when a decline in mortgage payments led to considerable losses for investors in its residential mortgage-backed securities.The bank has already paid out large sums to resolve similar claims, including $5.3 billion in a case brought by the US Department of Justice which said at the time that the products offered did not meet underwriting guidelines.
