Facility expected to be the largest of its kind to date in Europe, and the first of its kind in Germany

Part of a goal for multiple planned units across Europe and U.S. to add as much as 600 KTA of advanced recycling capacity by 2030, enabling greater supply of recycled plastic content to major brands across the globe

Mura's HydroPRS™ advanced recycling process is unique, as it uses supercritical steam to convert most forms of plastics, which have previously been deemed 'unrecyclable'

Represents a key contribution to Dow's climate and circularity target to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected, reused or recycled by 2030

Dow's support of Mura Technology enables Mura to build on its multi-year pipeline of planned projects, the first of which will be sited in Teesside, U.
