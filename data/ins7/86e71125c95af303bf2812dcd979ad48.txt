Canada has some of the highest rates of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in the world. On Sunday, the 27th annual Gutsy Walk took place across the country in support of Crohn's and Colitis. A large group of people gathered in Sudbury for this year's walk, to not only raise funds for research but to also raise awareness. Participant Steffany Byrnes was diagnosed with colitis almost a decade ago and has been participating in the walk ever since. She said raising money to find a cure is important to her.
