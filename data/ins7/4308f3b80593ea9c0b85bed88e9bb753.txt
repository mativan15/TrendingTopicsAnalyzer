Figures have revealed that more than two million people in Britain tested positive for COVID-19 in early October, while flu cases are also on the rise, as experts tell Express.co.uk that a "full force wave" could sweep across the nation this winter amid a possible "twindemic". According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), around one in 30 people in England had Covid in the week ending October 10 based on swab tests taken from homes selected at random. This means that cases went up from one in 35 seen the week before, indicating that 1,706,200 people in the community were infected in the latest week.
