Fifty-eight miles from Fort Smith, stop in Fayetteville and shift your attention to two former residents who moved on to a much bigger stage: As law professors at the University of Arkansas in the 1970s, a young Bill and Hillary Clinton lived in this college town before becoming political heavyweights. The modest one-bedroom home where they were married is now the Clinton House Museum﻿, with an array of campaign memorabilia and even a replica of Hillary's wedding dress.
