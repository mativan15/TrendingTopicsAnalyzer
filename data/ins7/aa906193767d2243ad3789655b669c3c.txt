It was a bad May for greenwashing. On the 31st, German police raided Deutsche Bank and its asset management group DWS over accusations that they fudged their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials. On May 25, the SEC proposed new rules that would require ESG funds to disclose their goals, criteria and strategies along with data measuring ESG progress. Two days earlier, the SEC fined BNY Mellon $1.5 million for '…Misstatements and Omissions Concerning ESG Considerations.' Last but not least, on May 18 S&P Global kicked Tesla TSLA off its new ESG index and, adding insanity to injury, swapped in Exxon Mobil.
