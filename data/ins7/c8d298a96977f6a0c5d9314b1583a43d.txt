Mike Franken has less than three weeks to do what no one has been able to accomplish in 64 years: defeat Chuck Grassley.

A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows he's within striking distance. Grassley leads by 3 percentage points among likely voters.

'We are right on the cusp, and he knows that,' Franken said of his opponent.

With early voting already underway, Franken is in a stronger position than Democrats could have hoped as he fights to defeat Iowa's seven-term Republican incumbent.
