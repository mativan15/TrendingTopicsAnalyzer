Fed up, Jason Selvig grabbed a microphone at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting this weekend and - just days after a shooter massacred 21 people at a Texas elementary school - applauded the gun lobby's longtime leader for his efforts to stop mass shootings.Selvig told fellow convention attendees that he was "sick and tired" of critics blaming NRA Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre for not doing enough to stop the decades-long scourge in the United States. He has done plenty, Selvig told them - namely, by offering his thoughts and prayers after each tragedy.
