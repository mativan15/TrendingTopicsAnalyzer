China will delay the release of key economic indicators originally scheduled to be announced this week, including the country's latest quarterly gross domestic product. The Chinese government revealed on its website on Monday that it will postpone the publication of GDP data from July through September, housing prices in major cities and other key economic indicators. Trade data, previously scheduled for release on Friday of last week, were also skipped. It's extremely rare for the government to put off the release of important economic statistics.
