A Uzbekistan citizen residing in New York City who had been convicted of conspiring to and attempting to provide material support to Islamic State was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said. 
Dilkhayot Kasimov, 34, was convicted of both counts following a trial in 2019. He was charged in 2015. 
"Kasimov is an ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) supporter who collected and gave money to another individual to fund his travel to join the terrorist group. With this sentence, Kasimov is being held accountable for his crimes," Matthew Olsen, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.
