It's Saturday!
1) The Supreme Court is set to hear a petition today filed by the Maharashtra government challenging the acquittal of sacked Delhi University professor GN Saibaba and others in a UAPA case. 
🔴 Here's what happened: The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court acquitted Saibaba and five others who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017 over alleged Maoist links. Soon after, the Maharashtra government moved the Supreme Court which declined to stay the acquittal order. 
🔴 Why Bombay HC acquitted Saibaba: The High Court ruled that the trial of Saibaba and five others were 'null and void' in the absence of a valid sanction under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.
