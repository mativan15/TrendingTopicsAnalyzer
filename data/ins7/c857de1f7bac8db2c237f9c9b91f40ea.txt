Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) is scheduled to report its Q3 2022 results on Wednesday, October 26. We expect NSC stock to trend higher, with the company expected to post results above the street expectations. The company should continue to benefit from a shift toward lower-cost transportation alternatives.
