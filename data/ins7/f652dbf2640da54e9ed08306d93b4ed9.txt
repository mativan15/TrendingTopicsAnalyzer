Published: 18:21 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 18:21 EDT, 18 October 2022 Dr Nick Coatsworth has issued a brutal wake up call to the doctors responsible for deliberately defrauding Medicare of an eye-watering $8billion every year. A report published by the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC this week has uncovered massive overcharging by doctors charging for services that they did not deliver that could amount to 30 percent of the entire Medicare budget.The Australian Medical Association (AMA), which is the peak body representing doctors, has hit back strongly at the claims, which they slammed as 'an unjustified slur on the medical profession' and that $8billion was an 'exaggerated figure'.
