The Baltimore Ravens welcomed cornerback Marcus Peters back to the field during Week 2 of the 2022 season, and he's slowly been able to work his way back into the fold after missing all of 2021 with a torn ACL. Baltimore's defense has benefited from him being on the field in a big way not only due to his playmaking ability, but his energy as well.
When asked about Peters and his energy, defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald raved about the cornerback's impact on and off the field. He mentioned how great of a team leader the veteran is, and also talked about how smart of a football player he is as well.
