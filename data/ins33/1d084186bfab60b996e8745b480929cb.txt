A senior Democratic lawmaker has raised alarms about the possibility that sensitive US defense technology could be shared with Russia by Saudi Arabia in the wake of the kingdom's recent decision to side with Moscow over the interests of the US.Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate armed services committee who has proposed a one-year freeze on weapons sales to Saudi following Opec+'s decision to cut oil production, said he would 'dig deeper into the risk' in discussions with the Pentagon.'I want some reassurances that they are on top of it and if there are risks, I want to determine what can be done to mitigate those risks immediately,' Blumenthal said in an interview with the Guardian.
