The Chicago Business Barometer, also known as the Chicago PMI, rose to 60.3 in May from 56.4 in the prior month.  Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal forecast a 55.9 reading.  The index is produced by the ISM-Chicago with MNI. It is released to subscribers three minutes before its release to the public at 9:45 am Eastern. The Chicago PMI is the last of the regional manufacturing indices before the national ISM data for May is released on Wednesday. The prior business surveys showed a sharp slowdown in business activity.
