(AP) - Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin offered a blunt assessment of the challenge facing the unbeaten and seventh-ranked Rebels when they visit LSU on Saturday. "This is the most talented opponent by far," Kiffin said. Mississippi (7-0, 3-0 SEC) is one victory away from its first 8-0 start since the 1962 Rebels won a national title with a 10-0 mark. But oddsmakers don't seem to think this season's Ole Miss squad is destined for such glory.
