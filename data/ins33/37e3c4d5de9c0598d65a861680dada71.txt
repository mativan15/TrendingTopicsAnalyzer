On a cloudy Saturday afternoon in Crenshaw, Danny Bakewell Sr.'s name is almost inescapable.

'Everything he touches has made an impact in our community,' said Jay Conedy, 60, from beneath a towering poster of Bakewell Sr. giving a thumbs-up.

'He's synonymous with the area,' added Yolanda Duvernay, 71, as she wandered Crenshaw Boulevard.

Indeed, nods to Bakewell, 76, filled Taste of Soul, the businessman's beloved Black cultural festival, this weekend. Amid R&B performances and Cajun food trucks, his name was everywhere from the video screens lining the event's main thoroughfare to the Bakewell Media Music Stage demarcating its southernmost end.
