Bannon is hardly the only one in Trump's orbit to resist cooperating with the Jan. 6 committee. Like Bannon, former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was charged with criminal contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with a subpoena. He's set to stand trial in federal court in Washington next month. Navarro unsuccessfully sought to delay the trial so he could promote a book.On the day of Navarro's arrest, the Justice Department said similar charges would not be filed against former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows or Dan Scavino, who served under Meadows.
