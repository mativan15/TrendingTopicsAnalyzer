Chaotic scenes in the House of Commons have been condemned as 'inexcusable' and an 'absolute disgrace', by a senior Tory backbencher.Sir Charles Walker, a former vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, said he was 'livid' about recent turmoil and warned that unless the party starts to 'behave like grown-ups' then 'perhaps 200' MPs could find themselves out of jobs.Those who helped put Liz Truss into power as Prime Minister also have a lot to answer for, he added.He was talking after the Government defeated Labour's bid to ban fracking amid farcical scenes in the Commons on Wednesday.
