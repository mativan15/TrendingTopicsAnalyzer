The abandonment of Liz Truss's growth plans will saddle Britain with one of the least competitive tax systems in the world, economists have warned.

The UK is set to tumble in the rankings from 26th to 33rd, its worst performance since the US-based Tax Foundation think-tank began compiling an index in 2014.

The Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), which also backed the research, said the decision to reinstate Rishi Sunak's corporation tax increase from 19pc to 25pc next April removes one of the UK's biggest potential attractions as a place to do business.
