In Emily M. Stark's Certificate Transparency is really not a
replacement for key pinning,
Stark asks a good question: [...] what is a domain owner supposed to actually do if they find a
malicious certificate for their domain in a CT log? [...]
 I don't have an answer to this, but we can ask a related question:
what does it mean if your CT log monitoring turns up a TLS certificate
for your domain that you don't know about? I think that there are four things that it could mean, which I'll
order from the least likely to the most likely.
