After rushing three times for eight yards in the first half of Monday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Denver Broncos running back Melvin Gordon was benched in favor of Latavius Murray and Mike Boone at halftime.
Gordon, who was limited in practice with neck and rib injuries last week, said after the game that he felt good and the injuries did not hinder him. Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett also said Gordon did not suffer any new injuries during the game, a sign that it was a coach's decision to bench the RB.
