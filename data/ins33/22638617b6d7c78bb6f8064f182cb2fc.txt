Eurozone bond yields climbed on Wednesday after the Bank of England (BoE) said it would start reducing its gilt holdings from November 1. The BoE said on Tuesday it would start selling some of its holdings of British government bonds from November 1, but added that it would not sell any longer-dated gilts this year.Britain's central bank was forced to start buying bonds again last month after the government's plans for unfunded tax cuts - which have now been almost completely reversed - sparked chaos in the market for long-duration gilts.
