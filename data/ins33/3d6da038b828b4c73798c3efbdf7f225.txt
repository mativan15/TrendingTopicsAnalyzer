The Jazz are so committed to their fire sale, Apple thought it could steal their marketing slogan for free.

Normally, there would be nothing noteworthy about Apple having a new "hashflag," the little symbol that appears after some hashtags on Twitter and a made-up word I'm sorry you just learned. However, the Utah Jazz have been using the hashtag #TakeNote since 2016. In fact, Jazz fans were so attached to the hashtag that the team brought it back after an uproar when they stopped using it in 2018.
