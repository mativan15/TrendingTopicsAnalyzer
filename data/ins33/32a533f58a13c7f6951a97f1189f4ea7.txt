New Zealand's arts council has pulled funding for a long-running Shakespeare festival, saying the works of the iconic British playwright were out of date and focused on 'a canon of imperialism.'The annual Sheilah Winn Shakespeare festival has been around for some three decades, with over 120,000 high-school students from more than half of the island nation's secondary schools taking part in it over those years. The platform allows the youths to direct, perform and create sets, costumes and music for their performances, featuring excerpts from the Bard's plays.
