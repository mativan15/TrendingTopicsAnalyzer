Springfield nonprofits working on projects aimed at building their communities are invited to apply to the 2022 A Community Thrives program, a $2.3 million initiative of the Gannett Foundation.

A Community Thrives, which is sponsored by the Springfield News-Leader's parent company, Gannett, is accepting applications through June 30 for this year's program.

The program supports nonprofits, schools and municipal organizations focused on community building. Special consideration will be given to organizations that work to build up historically under-resourced and under-served groups.
