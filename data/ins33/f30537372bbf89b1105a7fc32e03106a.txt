Robert Habeck, who is also Germany's economy minister, told the German parliament on Thursday that 'the income that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has obtained in recent months because of high prices hurts, and we can only be ashamed that we haven't yet managed to reduce this dependence more significantly'.
