The Saints are set to get one of their wide receivers back in the lineup on Thursday night.

First-round pick Chris Olave suffered a concussion while catching a touchdown in Week Five and did not play last Sunday, but he offered a positive update on his condition Tuesday. Olave said he has been cleared under the concussion protocol and will be on the field against the Cardinals later this week.

'I'm ready to get back to it, help the quarterbacks out,' Olave said, via Jeff Nowak of WWL Radio.
