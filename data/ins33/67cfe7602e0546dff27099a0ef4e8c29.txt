Jun. 3—ANTWERP — With summer break just around the corner, the focus now is on making sure kids foster a love for reading and keep it up when school is out.

Staff at Antwerp Primary School distributed dozens of books Thursday from Book Blast, a program of the Books Are Fun company, which aims to give as many books to as many students as possible. Classroom by classroom, packages of books were passed out, and the excitement was palpable.

Students helped fundraise to earn books for their home libraries and received up to 10 books depending on how much money they raised.
