Jill, a long-time Star reader, didn't hold back in a recent letter forwarded to me concerning our sports coverage.

Visually, the Star's sports section is very nearly an exclusively male world, she said. She explained that since moving to Toronto in the late 1980s she has leafed through the sports section daily, looking for photos of women and girls — but very little has changed in all those years.

She noted that aside from columnists, on October 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 not a single woman or girl was visible.
