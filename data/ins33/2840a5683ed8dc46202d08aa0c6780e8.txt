(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. launched its first fully redesigned entry-level iPad in five years and new Pro models, updating a tablet lineup that the company increasingly sees as a productivity tool. The latest iPad Pro adds the M2 chip used in recent Mac computers, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That product represents the Pro model's first upgrade in a year and a half. The company also introduced a cheaper Apple TV set-top box with 4K video support. Apple typically generates roughly 10% of its revenue from the iPad, which was a popular item during the early days of the pandemic but also suffered from supply shortages.
