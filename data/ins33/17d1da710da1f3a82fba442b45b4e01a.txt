Liz Truss has said she is "completely committed" to the pensions triple lock at a make-or-break PMQs in the Commons on Wednesday. That means state pensions should rise in line with inflation - currently running at a rate of 10.1%.
Ms Truss made the commitment in the Commons despite new chancellor Jeremy Hunt on Monday explicitly ruling out agreeing to any further pledges, including the triple lock, ahead of 31 October when he will announce a medium-term fiscal plan. A Downing Street spokesman repeated it on Tuesday.
