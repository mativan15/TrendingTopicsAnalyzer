Simu Liu is attached to lead a series adaptation of the Ben Mezrich novel 'Seven Wonders' that is currently in development at Amazon, Variety has confirmed. Per the official logline, the series follows 'brilliant botanist-adventurer Dr. Nate Grady (Liu) as he teams up with the slippery international fixer, Sloane Seydoux, on a breathless race to solve an ancient mystery tied to the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World.' Adam Cozad ('The Legend of Tarzan,' 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit') is attached to write and executive produce the adaptation, with Justin Lin onboard to direct and executive produce via Perfect Storm Entertainment.
