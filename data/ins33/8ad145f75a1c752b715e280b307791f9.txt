Resale, re-commerce, secondhand, and thrift are all interchangeable names for a rising sector in retail—the indecisive naming, both a sign of its youth and potential. A recent survey released by ThredUp, a leader in the resale space, and conducted by GlobalData, a retail analytics firm, revealed an estimate that the secondhand retail market will more than double by 2026 reaching $82 billion. In addition, resale will grow 16x faster than the broader retail clothing sector, with resale companies making up 18% of the clothing industry by 2031.
