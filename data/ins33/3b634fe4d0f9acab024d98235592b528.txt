The shooting death of a 10-year-old near Bartlett marked the 25th child to have been killed by gun violence in Memphis this year. The pace at which kids are being wounded matches 2021, setting the course for what could be the second year in a row with more than 150 children wounded in shootings.

The death on Oct. 13 fits a pattern that has accelerated throughout the past two years. More juveniles are getting shot and more kids are dying, according to data from researchers at Methodist Le Bonheur and statistics from the Memphis Police Department.
