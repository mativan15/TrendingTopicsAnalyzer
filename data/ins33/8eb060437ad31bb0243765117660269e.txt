Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a cautious manner Tuesday, ahead of the release of key Eurozone inflation data which could heighten concerns about the pace and scale of looming interest rate hikes.

By 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 outperformed, climbing 0.2%.

French inflation rose more than expected in May, with data released earlier Tuesday showing consumer prices rose 0.7% in May for a new record 12-month inflation rate of 5.
