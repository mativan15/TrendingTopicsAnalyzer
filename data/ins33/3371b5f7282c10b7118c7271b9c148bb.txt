Inside a flashy Auckland hotel, rigged with neon lights and pumping dance music, a new kind of crypto business announced its arrival this week. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange launched its New Zealand arm on Wednesday with much fanfare. But some experts are warning the company's recent behaviour should raise alarm bells. In March, Reuters reported at least NZ$4.1 billion (US $2.3b) of illicit funds was laundered through Binance in the past four years. Binance disputed the report, but has not pointed to specific inaccuracies.
