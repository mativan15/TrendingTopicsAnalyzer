Fewer than half of women in Northern Ireland are aware that abortion is lawful, despite being decriminalised there three years ago, a survey from Amnesty International UK says.Only 10 per cent of women know how to access abortion services, it says.Meanwhile, medical experts, service providers and human rights organisations have called on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to commission abortion services urgently in an open letter.The letter warns that the continued delay in establishing abortion services is 'unacceptable and causing harm every day', and says that 'at a time when we are seeing deeply concerning rollbacks on reproductive rights in other countries such as the US, we cannot forget that people in the UK are being denied their rights too'.
