Published: 03:15 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 03:15 EDT, 20 October 2022 UCLA coach Chip Kelly is facing his former school this weekend. Never have the stakes been this high. No. 9 UCLA plays at No. 10 Oregon this Saturday in a game that will likely narrow the Pac-12's College Football Playoff chances to two teams. Kelly lost the first two games against Oregon, the team he led to the 2011 BCS national championship game, but takes a much better team with him to Autzen Stadium this year. "It´s always special going back there, it´s a special place in my life and there´s a lot of great people there that had a profound impact on my life," said Kelly, Oregon's coach from 2009-12.
