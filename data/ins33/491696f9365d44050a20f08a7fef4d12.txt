BERLIN

Janik Haberer scored twice for Union Berlin to upset Borussia Dortmund 2-0 and consolidate its early-season Bundesliga lead on Sunday.

Haberer's two goals dealt Dortmund its fourth defeat from 10 games so far and lifted Union five points clear of second-place Freiburg before its visit to 10-time defending champion Bayern Munich later.

Union pushed forward from the start and Haberer got an early reward thanks to a mistake from Dortmund 'keeper Gregor Kobel in the eighth minute. Kobel received a back pass but slipped at an inopportune moment to give the lurking Haberer an easy finish.
