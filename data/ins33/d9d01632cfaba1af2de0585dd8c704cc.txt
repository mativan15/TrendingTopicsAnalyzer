Burnley defender James Tarkowski is expected to be one of the most sought-after domestic free agents this summer following the Clarets' relegation from the Premier League. With the Clarets returning to the Championship next season, it is likely that a number of their stars will leave Turf Moore this summer, with defender Tarkowski being heavily linked with a return to the top flight. Tarkowski is expected to be a free agent this summer with it being unlikely that he will sign fresh terms with the side who are set to appoint Vincent Kompany as their new manager imminently.
