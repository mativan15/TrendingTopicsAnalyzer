Ninth-year NFL referee Brad Allen and his crew are set to officiate the Kansas City Chiefs' Week 6 game against the Buffalo Bills according to Football Zebras.
If you're hoping for the officiating to be better after the clown show that was Carl Cheffers and his crew in Week 5, you're likely going to be disappointed. Allen and his crew officiated the Week 7 game against the Tennesse Titans and the Week 14 game against the Las Vegas Raiders in 2021. Those games ranked third (9 penalties) and fourth (8 penalties) respectively in terms of the Chiefs' most penalized games of the 2021 NFL season.
