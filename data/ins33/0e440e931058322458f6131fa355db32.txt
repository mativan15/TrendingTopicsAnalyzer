A plan to repeal working rules that would have made it easier to hire contractors has been scrapped by the new chancellor Jeremy Hunt.Kwasi Kwarteng, his predecessor, last month said undoing tax changes that were implemented in 2017 and 2021 would 'free up time and money' by making it simpler for businesses to engage contractors.Hunt said the IR35 reforms would remain in place. Keeping the rules will save the government £2 billion a year, the Treasury said.The reforms had aimed to tackle disguised employment, when contractors choose to work for companies off payroll, often through personal service companies, which arrange for them to pay less tax and national insurance.
