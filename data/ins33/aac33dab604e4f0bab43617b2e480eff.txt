The Philadelphia Eagles have made it through the 2022-2023 season without a loss so far, but they could face their biggest challenge this week. The Dallas Cowboys, who many thought would become an afterthought after Dak Prescott was injured in week one, have become a mighty force in the NFC East. And there's even a chance that Prescott could return this week, having returned to practice earlier this week. Regardless of whether he does, it's going to be a game worth watching. Meanwhile, in the AFC, the Chiefs and Bills are set to battle for bragging rights to the league's best record, as both are currently 4-1.
