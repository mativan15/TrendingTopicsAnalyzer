COLLEGE PARK, Md. — Matt Donlan's three-run home run in the seventh inning, one of four Connecticut blasts, broke the game open and the Huskies defeated No. 15 overall seed Maryland 10-5 Saturday night in the winner's bracket of the College Park Regional. The Huskies' power, which included Zach Bushling's two-run shot in a four-run eighth, dropped the Terrapins into a Sunday loser-out game with Wake Forest, with the winner facing UConn on Sunday evening. UConn (48-13) took a quick lead when David Smith and Erik Stock led off the bottom of the first with back-to-back home runs.
