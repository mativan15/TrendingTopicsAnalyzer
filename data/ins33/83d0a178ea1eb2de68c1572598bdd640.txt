The Supreme Court on Thursday turned down a petition seeking urgent hearing of a plea challenging the blanket ban on firecrackers in Delhi."Let people breathe clean air... spend your money on sweets," the apex court said. Earlier in the day, the Delhi high court refused to entertain a petition challenging Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) complete ban on sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers citing the pendency of issues related to firecrackers before the Supreme Court.
