bjdlzx During the past month, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stock price experienced significant ups and downs; however, the current stock price is equal to its level six months ago. Due to the winter season (from October 2022 to March 2023), U.S. oil and natural gas consumption will increase. Also, U.S. oil and natural gas exports increase as a result of the Europe energy crisis. I expect ET's financial results in the coming quarters to be strong. The stock is a buy. Quarterly highlights In its 2Q 2022 financial results, ET reported intrastate transportation and storage adjusted EBITDA of $218 million, down 3% YoY, driven by the increased cost of products sold (up 178% YoY) and partially offset by increased natural gas transportation volumes (up 22% YoY).
