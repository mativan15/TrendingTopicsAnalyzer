CINCINNATI (AP) Whether it turns around Cincinnati's season remains to be seen – there are 11 games to go – but the Bengals took a step in the right direction with their come-from-behind 30-26 win at New Orleans on Sunday. The Bengals completed the rally on Joe Burrow's short pass to his former LSU teammate Ja'Marr Chase, who broke a tackle and sped down the left sideline to finish off a 60-yard scoring play that gave the Bengals their first lead with 1:57 remaining. 'Breaking a lot of tackles,' Cincinnati coach Zac Taylor said.
