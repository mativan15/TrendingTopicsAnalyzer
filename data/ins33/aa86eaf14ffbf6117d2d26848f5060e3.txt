Will Wright, the original creator of The Sims and Sims City, is working on a blockchain game called Voxverse.Gala Games released a video yesterday, October 20, where Wright took the time to explain what the game will be like. Like many metaverse titles, Voxverse will be a sort of hub game, with Wright explaining "this is not only gonna be a world for games, but also a place for other games to live. There will be portals to other Gala games," which Wright notes you can bring your Vox into, the avatars of the game.
