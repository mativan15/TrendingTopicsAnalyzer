UK government borrowing costs have risen after the Bank of England dismissed a report that it could delay the sale of billions of pounds of bonds in an attempt to boost market stability after the mini-budget.The yield – or interest rate – on 10-year government bonds rose by more than 0.1 percentage points to trade above 4% after the central bank said the report in the Financial Times was inaccurate.Threadneedle Street's rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) announced plans last month to begin selling £80bn of UK government bonds from 31 October to wind down the portfolio of assets it had built up under its quantitative easing programme since the 2008 financial crisis.
