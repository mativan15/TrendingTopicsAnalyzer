Apple is yet to enter the world of foldables, even while Android phone-makers have already dived into the tech for years now, exploring newer form factors, but that could change from 2024. A new report from CCS Insight via CNBC on Tuesday suggested that the Cupertino-based company will launch a folding iPad in two years' time, followed by a foldable iPhone in 2025.
This strategy is different from what we are used to seeing — Android OEMs like Samsung and Huawei have always started off with foldable smartphones rather than foldable tablets, so if the prediction is to be believed, Apple will be taking the opposite approach here, bringing the new tech to a possibly smaller iPad market, before it comes to its iPhone-lineup.
