The Jacksonville Jaguars were hoping last year would start their rebuild after selecting Trevor Lawrence, but thanks to Urban Meyer being a massive flop, the team didn't make a lot of progress. That put them in a situation where they had to name a new coach in February as the team hired Doug Pederson.
Due to the coaching change and other changes within the organization, many in the football community are viewing the Jags as a team that is in the early stages of a rebuild. Among them are the people at Pro Football Focus, who ranked the Jags in the 'rebuilding' section of their recent power rankings.
