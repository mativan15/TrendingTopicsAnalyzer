LA GRANDE — An unconventional class assignment next fall awaits some La Grande High School students.

Students in the school's construction class will begin building an approximately 2,000-square-foot mid-level home.

The structure will be constructed as part of a homebuilding program now being created at the high school that will start early in the 2023-24 school year. The program recently moved a big step forward when the La Grande School District officials learned their district will receive $515,000 federal funding to start the program.
