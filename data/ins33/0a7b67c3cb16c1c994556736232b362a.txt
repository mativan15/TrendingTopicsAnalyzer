MASS. LEGISLATUREHouse Speaker Ron Mariano told reporters on Thursday that he wants a tax relief package passed and on Governor Charlie Baker's desk by the end of July, the deadline for complex bills this session. 'We're working on something [and] my goal is to have something,' Mariano said, when asked whether a tax-relief bill could be written and passed by July 31. Senate President Karen Spilka earlier this month expressed similar sentiments, after the state reported a huge surplus from April tax revenue.
