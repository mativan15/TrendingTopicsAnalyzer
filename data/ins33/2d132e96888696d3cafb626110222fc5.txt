As traditional retailers continue to move away from brick-and-mortar shops while adapting to a more tech savvy consumer, Amazon is going the other direction.

One of the world's largest retailers opens its second-ever Amazon Style store at Easton Town Center Tuesday at 10 a.m.

It's a space that displays Amazon's vast apparel inventory for shoppers to see, touch and try on though with app-enhanced capabilities aimed at creating a different sort of shopping experience.

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced the store this summer.
