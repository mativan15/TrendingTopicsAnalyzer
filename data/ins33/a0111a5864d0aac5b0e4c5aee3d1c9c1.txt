Published: 06:23 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 06:23 EDT, 20 October 2022 Graham Potter has admitted that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's heavy workload is the reason he was only given ten minutes against Brentford in Wednesday's exciting 0-0 draw. The Gabon forward was left on the bench until the 80th minute of the game, despite Potter's Blues clearly struggling in front of goal in the back and forth stalemate. But the Chelsea manager claimed Aubameyang has already 'played a lot' since his £10million arrival from Barcelona on transfer deadline day - and his absence allowed the likes of Kai Havertz the opportunity to play themselves into form.
