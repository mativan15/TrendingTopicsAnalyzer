After protesting a Government loan to a private school, Taranaki teacher Kealy Warren is on another mission. This time she wants to get nearly $300,000 in funding for her school children who have long-term intellectual disabilities. Warren is the deputy principal at Marfell Community School in New Plymouth and gained a national profile in 2020 when she led criticism of a Government funding decision. She is now campaigning to get money to help youngsters with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Fetal alcohol disorder (FADS).
