DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has asked the Irish Government to use its influence to attempt to prevent further scenes of people singing pro-IRA songs.Speaking following a meeting with Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Mr Donaldson said those responsible for singing the songs were poking unionists and victims of terrorism in the eye.A video which was posted on social media at the weekend and appeared to show a group of passengers at Dublin Airport singing a song in support of the IRA was widely condemned.
