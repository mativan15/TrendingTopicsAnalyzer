Gas utility Gail India is looking to import one million metric tonnes (MMT) of additional LNG for 10 years beginning 2023 to meet the country's rising demand for the fuel, a senior company official told ET. "We are trying to buy at least 1 MMT LNG more for 10 years. Whatever we were selling in the international market, we are trying to bring to India as demand here has increased," Manoj Jain Chairman and Managing Director, told ET. Jain added that the company is also talking to many players bilaterally to get a sense of the market and once the company zeros in on certain geographies, it would float expressions of interest.
