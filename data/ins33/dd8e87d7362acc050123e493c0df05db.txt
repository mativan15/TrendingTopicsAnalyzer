NORTH TEXAS (CBSDFW.COM/CNN) - The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way people lived and, for many, where they lived. According to new research, working from home was a significant driver of a "Great Reshuffling" and accounted for more than half of the steep increases in home prices seen during the pandemic.Remote work allowed some people to move to places farther away from their office and prompted others to buy larger homes to accommodate their new lifestyles. The demand for more house and the ability to move to warmer climates played a sizable role in pushing home prices higher, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the University of California, San Diego.
