The Shiv Sena on Sunday took a dig at the Centre over the Enforcement Directorate's summons to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. In its editorial mouthpiece, Saamana, the Sena that shares power with the Congress in Maharashtra asked if summons would be issued to the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru too. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were summoned by the ED in the National Herald case – a case that the investigating agency had closed in 2015 -- last week.



Stating that the National Herald was started by Nehru with a mission to publish articles on the country's freedom struggle in 1937, Sena said the newspaper had lost its importance long ago.
