Electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla (TSLA -8.07%) has continued to build on its industry lead recently -- in just the past few months, it opened two new production facilities to grow its global reach.
But it appears that CEO Elon Musk is slamming on the brakes. In an internal email Thursday, Musk told his executive team to cut jobs and pause new hiring, according to a report by Reuters. With the stock still at an extremely high valuation based on traditional metrics, shareholders might want to look at Musk's comments as a not-so-subtle warning.
