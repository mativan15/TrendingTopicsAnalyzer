Andrew Burton Investment Thesis Paramount's shares (NASDAQ:PARA, NASDAQ:PARAA) have slipped by over 20% since its last quarterly report. A lot of this is driven by a slowdown in linear TV, streaming, and advertising. But the company is continuing to report healthy growth in paid streaming subscribers. I think that its best-in-class TV ecosystem will continue to be a competitive advantage. Advertising will likely remain a source of volatility. But I think that there are meaningful tailwinds in the second half of the year.
