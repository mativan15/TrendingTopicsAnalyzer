The Las Vegas Raiders second-half schedule could actually be a spring-board for their season to rebound

At 1-4 coming out of their bye week, the Las Vegas Raiders have major ground to make up if they hope to contend for the playoffs this season.

Fortunately for them, their schedule for the rest of the season offers immediate opportunity for quarterback Derek Carr, defensive end Maxx Crosby and the rest of the Raiders to get right back in the hunt.

The Raiders' remaining strength of schedule is tied for the 26th easiest in the NFL, with their opponents winning percentage at 45 percent.
