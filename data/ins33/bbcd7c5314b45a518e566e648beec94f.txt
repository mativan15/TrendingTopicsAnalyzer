After defeating the Norwegian superstar in the Blitz event that preceded the Classical section, Anand claimed the victory in a thrilling Armageddon (sudden death game) after the regular match ended in a 40-move draw. In the Armageddon, the 52-year old Anand recreated magic of old when he stunned Carlsen to post a win in 50 moves.
