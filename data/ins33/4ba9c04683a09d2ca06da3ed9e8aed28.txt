The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued notices to the Kerala government, seeking an action-taken report in connection with a "human sacrifice" incident in the southern state. The panel said it has taken suo motu cognizance of a media report that two women, reported missing to police by their families, became victims of human sacrifice in a bizarre ritual orchestrated by a self-styled voodoo practitioner, professing to bring luck to a couple facing financial problems. 01:5403:2301
