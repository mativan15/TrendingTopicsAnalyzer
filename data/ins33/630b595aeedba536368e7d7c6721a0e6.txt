expects the Federal Reserve to push the fed funds rate to a peak of 5.25% in the first quarter next year, higher than market expectations and a level that could tip the world's largest economy into recession, the bank said in a research note on Wednesday. The French bank is forecasting the U.S. economy to go into recession in the second quarter of 2023. "We expect a more aggressive Fed response to stickier, more pervasive inflation to push the economy into recession," BNP said. "And in our view, the same inflationary dynamics which now make a non-recessionary outcome unlikely will similarly constrain the Fed from rapidly reversing course in the early stages of the downturn," it added.
