Elon Musk ripped into Jackson Palmer over claims the billionaire struggled with computer programming.

The Dogecoin co-creator made comments critical of Musk to an Australian news outlet.

Musk responded to the article and said Palmer "never wrote a line of Dogecoin code."

Elon Musk took aim at Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer on Twitter after he called the richest man in the world a "grifter."

In an interview with Australian news site Crikey, Palmer said he messaged Musk on Twitter several years ago after creating a bot that could help identify crypto scams on Twitter.
