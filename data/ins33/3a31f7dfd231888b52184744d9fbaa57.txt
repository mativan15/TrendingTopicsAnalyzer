Manish Maheshwari, the former head of Twitter India, is leaving the startup he co-founded just six months ago following disagreements with co-founder and investors.
'I am moving out of Invact to first take a break for a few months and then pursue new opportunities. It is heartbreaking for a founder to leave the startup, like a mother leaving her baby. I am going through the same emotion,' Maheshwari, who served as the startup's chief executive and managing director, wrote in a tweet.
Maheshwari left Twitter late last year to start Invact Metaversity with Tanay Pratap, a former Microsoft employee, TechCrunch first reported.
