Okta (OKTA 6.45%) investors trounced the market early Monday as the stock gained 7% by 12:30 p.m. ET, compared to a 2.7% spike in the S&P 500. That boost erased some of the identity management software specialist's recent losses, but shares remain in deeply negative territory for the year. Okta is down 77% since the start of 2022, in fact.
That wider decline set the stage for today's stock price spike, which appeared as investors turned more optimistic about stocks in general.
So what
Okta benefited from a wide market rally that lifted many other hard-hit stocks.
