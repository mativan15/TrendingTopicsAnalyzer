While Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMBC) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 11% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 40%, less than the market return of 80%.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
