PITTSBURGH, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- "I thought there should be an efficient and attractive insulation accessory for windows," said an inventor, from Van Buren, Ark., "so I invented the WINDOW SEAL. My design could save homeowners money on heating costs and it could add a decorative flair to the home."
The patent-pending invention provides a convenient way to insulate windows. In doing so, it prevents cold air from entering and warm air from escaping. As a result, it saves time and energy and it offers an improved alternative to cumbersome window insulation kits.
