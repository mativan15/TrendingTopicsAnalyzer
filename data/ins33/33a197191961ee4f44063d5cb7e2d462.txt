PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday played down an unseemly controversy around Bihar director general of police (DGP) SK Singhal for entertaining phone calls from a man who posed as the chief justice of the Patna high court and sought closure of cases against a 2011 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Aditya Kumar.'There is no point in dragging the matter. He is retiring in two months (December 19). If he committed a mistake and later realised it, the matter should be put to rest. I ordered an inquiry, which is going on,' Nitish Kumar told reporters on Friday.
