Australians who have been impacted by floods due to the deluge hitting the east coast of the country have been urged to call their bank if they need support.

With flooding continuing to affect thousands of people, the Australian Banking Association (ABA) has urged customers to speak up if they need help.

ABA chief operating officer Vanessa Beggs said Australia had once again been affected by multiple flood events which had tested the nation's resilience.
