In December 2020, a couple happened upon an incredible deal: two original Andy Warhol works for a combined price of $125,000. The first was titled 'And I Love You So'; the second was called 'Converse Sneakers in Conversation.'The gallery that sold the pieces to them, Danieli Fine Art in Palm Beach, Fla., allegedly said they were one-of-a-kind works of art.But federal prosecutors say they were both fakes. The real version of the first, featuring a blue bird flying under hearts and the words 'i love you so,' was actually hanging in a museum in Pittsburgh, a probable cause affidavit says, while the second wasn't even by Warhol.
