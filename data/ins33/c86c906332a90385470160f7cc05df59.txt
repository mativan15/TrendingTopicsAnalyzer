Published: 09:59 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 12:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 Scotland's First Minister has said building a 'stronger, fairer and more sustainable' economy was more likely with independence than remaining in the UK but refused to say when the country would move to a separate currency. The First Minister unveiled her Government's post-independence plans for the economy in a 108-page paper on Monday in a press conference at her official residence. The paper laid out some plans around an independent Scotland's currency, borders and more detail on a proposed £20 billion capital fund to be set up in the first decade after independence.
