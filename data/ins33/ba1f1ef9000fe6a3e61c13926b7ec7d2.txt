A Timaru group is worried any changes allowed to Showgrounds Hill resource consents is 'effectively allowing the death by a thousand cuts" to the town's central business district (CBD). Timaru CBD chairperson Allan Booth said they are concerned with the transparency of the Sale and Purchase agreement between TDHL and the current landowner, and how that is being implemented. 'For example, it was our understanding that no retail under 500m2 and a tavern would not be permitted until 2025,'' Booth said.
