Scientific American reports on a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA on the effectiveness of deep fakes. "The results suggest that real humans can easily fall for machine-generated faces — and even interpret them as more trustworthy than the genuine article." "We found that not only are synthetic faces highly realistic, they are deemed more trustworthy than real faces," says study co-author Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
