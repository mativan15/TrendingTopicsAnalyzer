It wasn't quite full, but hundreds of Liberal supporters filled the Hawthorn Arts Centre last Sunday morning to cheer John Pesutto's quest to take back a once-prized Liberal seat.Inside the classic Victorian building, he had the audience in the palm of his hand.This may have just been an individual launch for the seat of Hawthorn, but the message was much larger. This was about future leadership and the direction of the Liberal Party."Let's make this happen,'' Mr Pesutto yelled to a standing ovation that featured former Premier Ted Baillieu and a swathe of past and present MPs including Josh Frydenberg, Tim Wilson and Katie Allen.
