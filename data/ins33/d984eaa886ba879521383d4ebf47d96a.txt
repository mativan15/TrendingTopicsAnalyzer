Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine has proven lucrative for Australia's 'cartel-like' gas companies, which have pocketed close to $40 billion in profits over the last year while Australian households have paid 'extortionate' prices for local resources.

Now, experts are calling on the Australian government to introduce a windfall tax that could solve Australia's recent gas supply struggles, and fully fund the government's climate policy in just one year—with plenty of change to spare.

Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia supplied roughly 8 percent of the world with gas.
