Plant-based foods have become very fashionable of late, but investors in some of the most famous brands, Beyond Meat and Oatly, may be choking on their oat milk latte as the shares have plummeted in value. Beyond Meat sells meatless protein, including fake chicken, beef and pork which is made from plants but designed to emulate meat. Its shares have lost about two thirds of their value this year. Oatly sells alternative dairy products made from oats such as milks, yoghurt and ice cream. Its shares have halved this year.
