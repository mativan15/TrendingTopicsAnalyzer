The head of the Portland Business Alliance broke his recent silence on charter reform over the weekend to press members in an email to vote against the measure to overhaul city government next month.

The letter reflects how Portland's business community remains fractured over how to proceed with the November ballot measure amid broad recognition that the current way local government works is outdated and inefficient. PBA's local counterpart, Business for a Better Portland, endorsed the charter reform measure last month, with its interim executive director, State Rep.
