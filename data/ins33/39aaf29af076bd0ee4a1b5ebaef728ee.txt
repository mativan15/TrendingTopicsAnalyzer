Social Welfare Minister in the Delhi government and AAP leader Rajendra Pal Gautam on Thursday said the recent arrest of Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain was a sign of 'BJP's fear about AAP's political gains'. Jain, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday, has been sent to ED custody till June 9 in a case of alleged money laundering.
Gautam said the case has been dragging on for the past eight years and none of the central agencies have found any proof about the minister's alleged role in the matter.
