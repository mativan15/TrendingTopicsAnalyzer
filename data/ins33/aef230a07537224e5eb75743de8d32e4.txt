Uber and Lyft drivers will be allowed to continue driving in the state of California after voters approved Proposition 22, which defined app-based drivers as independent contractors, not employees. The initiative leads 57.9% to 42.1% with more than 10 million votes counted, according to figures released by the Secretary of State's Office. Prop. 22 came about amid a long, drawn-out battle between rideshare/gig companies and the California legislature after it passed AB 5, which sought to establish firmer rules when it came to independent contractors in the state.
