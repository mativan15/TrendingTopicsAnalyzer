U.S. stocks rose Thursday in another back-and-forth session after concerns over the economy and a weak outlook from market bellwether Microsoft (MSFT) weighed on sentiment in morning trading.

The S&P 500 jumped 1.2%, climbing back from a lower open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 200 points, or 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was firmly higher, up 2% as all three indexes attempt to bounce back from two straight days of losses in a downbeat start to the week.

'We are anything but market pessimists — in fact, we believe there will be substantial opportunity in stocks on the other side of this volatility and likely in the second half of the year," LPL Financial Technical Market Strategist Scott Brown said in a note Thursday.
