The power of the National Rifle Association (NRA) has once again come under scrutiny in the wake of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that left 19 children and two adults dead.The pro-gun lobbyist group has been widely condemned following the massacre at Robb Elementary School for holding a conference in Houston just days after the tragedy, as well as for how the group's influence on the Republican Party has held back any attempt at major gun reform in the U.S. for years.In the days since the May 24 shooting in Uvalde, others have also noted how the NRA has received money and other donations from Russian nationals over the years.
