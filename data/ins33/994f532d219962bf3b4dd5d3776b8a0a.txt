James Corden has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons this week after a New York restauranteur claimed he'd banned him from his eatery after the TV host allegedly "yelled like crazy" at a waiter. Balthazar chain owner Keith McNally, 71, hit out at the Gavin and Stacey writer, 44, on Instagram, claiming a waiter was "left shaken" by the apparent outburst. According to Mr McNally, James said he'd found traces of egg white in an egg yolk omelette and told the server, "You can't do your job! You can't do your job! Maybe I should go into the kitchen and cook the omelette myself!" After the story broke, Mr McNally stood down, claiming that James had been in touch and offered a grovelling apology.
