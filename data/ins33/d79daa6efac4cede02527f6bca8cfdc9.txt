Donald Trump has been formally subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The subpoena requires Trump to turn over documents by Nov. 4 and to appear for one or several days of deposition under oath beginning on Nov. 14. "We recognize that a subpoena to a former President is a significant and historic step," Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., wrote in a letter to Trump on Friday. "We do not take this action lightly." Thompson previously said the committee had an "obligation" to seek an interview with the former president, who they've argued was central in an attempted coup to remain in office.
