Cave rescuers said they played ‘the world's worst game of Jenga' to free a dog that was trapped under a pile of rubble for seven hours in Dartmoor. 
Springer spaniel Jess got stuck after granite boulders fell over a hole she ran down at the disused Haytor quarry.
Owner Shane Darwood said firefighters called on volunteer group Devon Cave Rescue Organisation (DCRO) to save Jess at about 11.30pm on Thursday. 
Rescuers dug her out using mine-excavation techniques – removing each individual boulder while trying to avoid a cave-in.
