REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File PhotoOct 18 (Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) on Tuesday released a set of new software tools designed to make it easier to create three-dimensional digital objects for marketing campaigns, video games and the metaverse.With its graphic design and photo editing tools, Adobe has long dominated the market for two-dimensional content creation, a position it sought to protect when it spent $20 billion in cash and stock last month to buy rival upstart Figma in the biggest buyout ever of a privately held software firm.
