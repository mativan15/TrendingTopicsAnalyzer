Gogglebox viewers were less than impressed after two of the programme's regulars branded a Top of the Pops segment from 1992 ‘the olden days'.
Best friends Abbie Lynn and Georgia Bell, Durham-based armchair critics, joined the series in 2018, and have provided us with plenty of entertainment over the years.
Abbie, 20, and Georgia, 21, were baffled watching a clip on tonight's show, which featured a look-back at an old Top of the Pops episode.
The British music chart television programme was broadcast weekly between 1964 and 2006, making it the world's longest-running weekly music show.
