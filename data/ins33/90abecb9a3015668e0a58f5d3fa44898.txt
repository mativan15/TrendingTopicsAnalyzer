After drawing both cheers and rebukes from within the finance industry, HSBC Asset Management's suspended head of responsible investing has now caught the attention of academia.A presentation delivered by Stuart Kirk earlier this month offered 'spurious correlations,' as well as 'weak methods' and an 'even weaker' grasp of financial theory, according to Noel Amenc, a PhD and associate professor at EDHEC Business School, and Frederik Blanc-Brude, a PhD and director at EDHEC Infrastructure Institute.
