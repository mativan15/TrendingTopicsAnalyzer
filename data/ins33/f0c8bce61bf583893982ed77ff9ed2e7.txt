Christine Brown has no plans to leave Sister Wives — despite her split from her longtime husband Kody Brown.
 
"I made a promise to Kody and everybody else that I would stay in Sister Wives as long as we have the show just to be fair," she told Entertainment Tonight. "It's what our family's been doing for so long. I feel like it would be disloyal if I decided to not be part of the show."
 
She continued, "So as far as Sister Wives goes, I'll still be doing things with Janelle [Brown] quite regularly.
