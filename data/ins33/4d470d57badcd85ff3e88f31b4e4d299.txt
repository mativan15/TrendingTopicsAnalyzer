We talked to Ducks Wire about the Pac-12 midseason defensive MVP. It's true that the Utah game was not a good one for the Trojans, but a full six games preceding the Utah loss have still established two USC Trojans as the leaders in this particular race.

This is what we told Ducks Wire:

Defensive MVP is a tie between two USC Trojans: Eric Gentry and Tuli Tuipulotu. Gentry was better through the first four weeks, but Tuipulotu has been consistent throughout the season and then got three sacks against Washington State.
