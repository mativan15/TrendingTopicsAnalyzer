In yet another confrontation between the Raj Bhavan and the AAP-led state government in Punjab, Governor Banwarilal Purohit has objected to the appointment of Punjab Agricultural University's (PAU) Vice-Chancellor.
In a letter to Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday (October 18), Governor Purohit has termed as 'illegal' the appointment of biotechnologist Dr Satbir Singh Gosal to the post of V-C. Asking for the V-C's 'immediate removal', the Governor has claimed the appointment was done 'without following UGC norms' and without approval from the Chancellor (the Governor is the ex officio Chancellor of PAU).
