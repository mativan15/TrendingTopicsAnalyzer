The Critics Choice Documentary Awards announced its nominees where Sara Dosa's lava-fueled love story 'Fire of Love' led the field with seven nominations including best documentary feature and director. Co-distributed by National Geographic and Neon, the film's Ryan White's 'Good Night Oppy,' the moving reflection on the Mars rovers, received a hearty six-nom tally including editing and score. 'This year's nominees prove that documentaries of all lengths and formats are advancing nonfiction media like never before,' said Christopher Campbell, Co-President of the Critics Choice Association Documentary Branch.
