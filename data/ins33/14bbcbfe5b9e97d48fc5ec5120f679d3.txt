Millions of dollars are owed after Wednesday's verdict, when jurors sided mostly with Johnny Depp against ex-wife Amber Heard.

The judge reduced the $15 million awarded to Depp to $10.35 million (based on a Virginia state law that limits punitive damages), and Heard was awarded $2 million in damages in her defamation countersuit. Her attorney Elaine Bredehoft said on Today Thursday morning that Heard's next step is to appeal the verdict — and confirmed that the actress can "absolutely not" pay the damages amount.
