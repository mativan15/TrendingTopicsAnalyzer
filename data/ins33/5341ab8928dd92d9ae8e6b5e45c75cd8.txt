President Joe Biden hailed the May US jobs report numbers Friday, calling them 'historically robust' and saying they are one of the signs of a 'healthy economy.'
Biden said because of the progress his administration has made on the economy, 'Americans can tackle inflation from a position of strength.'
'I know that even with today's good news, a lot of Americans remain anxious, and I understand the feeling,' the US president said from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
'There's no denying that high prices, particularly around gasoline and food, are a real problem for people.
