Hello! Welcome (or welcome back) to This Week in Elon, The Verge's occasionally revived newsletter for when there's Too Much Elon News. And, I mean, there's always too much Elon news. But what's happening right now feels worth digging into more deeply. So, let's get into it.
On Tuesday, Musk demanded Tesla employees come back to the office or 'pretend to work somewhere else,' which is an odd thing to say for a guy who splits his time between cities and at least four different companies. He's also looking to cut about 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, Reuters reported this morning, based on his 'super bad feeling' about the economy, and all I'm saying is 'I don't want to do layoffs, so I'm going to make you miserable enough to quit' would not be a particularly off-brand management tactic for Musk.
