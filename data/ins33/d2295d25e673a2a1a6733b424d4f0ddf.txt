By Reuters Published: 02:42 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 02:42 EDT, 30 May 2022 TOKYO, May 30 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei closed at its highest in more than a month on Monday, buoyed by machinery and technology stocks, as Shanghai's stimulus measures and decision to ease COVID-19 curbs tempered fears of a sharp slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. The Nikkei share average gained 2.19% to 27,369.43, its highest close since April 21. The broader Topix ended 1.86% higher at 1,922.44. Helping to lift risk appetite was news that Shanghai authorities will cancel many conditions for businesses to resume work from Wednesday, easing a city-wide lockdown that began two months ago.
