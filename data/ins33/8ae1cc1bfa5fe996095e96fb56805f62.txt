Porter, 22, started 61 games at point guard for the Rockets in 2021-22. He averaged 15.6 points and 6.2 assists per game last season, shooting a career-best 37.5% from three. He was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the No. 30 pick in the 2019 NBA draft and came to Houston by way of trade in January 2021.

Monday's contract marks a significant investment in Porter. The USC product has paired occasional brilliance on the floor with moments of immaturity across his brief career, including an incident in January in which Porter left the Toyota Center during a game after a locker room dispute with coaches.
