A football stadium in Indonesia will be rebuilt from scratch following a deadly stampede there earlier this month.President Joko Widodo promised to "thoroughly transform" football in the country following the tragedy which left 132 people - including 43 children - dead.
"Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang...we will demolish it and rebuild according to FIFA standards," he told reporters at the state palace after meeting Gianni Infantino, the head of world football's governing body.On October 1, police fired tear gas at the stadium - despite the control measure being banned by FIFA - after fans went on to the pitch at the end of the game, causing people to panic and attempt to flee.
