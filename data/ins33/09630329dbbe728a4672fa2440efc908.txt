Russian President Vladimir Putin has been given only three years to live by his doctors as his cancer rapidly worsens, a former Russian intelligence agent claims. 
Putin, 69, is allegedly losing his eyesight and constantly suffering from headaches and uncontrollable tremors due to his 'rapidly progressing cancer,' an FSB spy allegedly told defector Boris Karpichkov, as first reported by the Mirror UK. 
'[Putin] has a severe form of rapidly progressing cancer. He has no more than two to three years to stay alive,' the officer said.
