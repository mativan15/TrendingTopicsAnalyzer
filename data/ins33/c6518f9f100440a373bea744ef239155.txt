People with serious health conditions like cancer or epilepsy qualify for free prescriptions and will probably have received a medical exemption certificate.NHS prescriptions are also free for over-60s in England, however the Government is proposing to increase the age people receive them to 66-years-old.In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland prescriptions are free for everyone no matter what their age.Millions more people are exempt from paying NHS prescription charges because they depend on DWP benefits.
