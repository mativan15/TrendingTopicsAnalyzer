We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But no-one is immune from buying too high. For example, after five long years the Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) share price is a whole 61% lower. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 38%. The last week also saw the share price slip down another 23%.

Since Wynn Resorts has shed US$1.9b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics.
