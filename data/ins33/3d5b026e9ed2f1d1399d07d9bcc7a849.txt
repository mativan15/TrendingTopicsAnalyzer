Google Translate apparently works on bureaucratic jargon, too!
The world's leading search engine appears to have rejected Mayor Eric Adams' official name for his controversial migrant processing center on Randall's Island in favor of something a bit more descriptive.
Instead of labeling the site a 'Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center,' Google Maps simply calls it what it is: 'Adams Tent City.'
The term pops up next to the red locator pin for the Icahn Stadium parking lot, where City Hall plans to unveil the new facility Tuesday afternoon.
