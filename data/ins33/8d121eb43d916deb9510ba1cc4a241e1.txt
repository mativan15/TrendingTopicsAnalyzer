Details of the concrete block levy to help pay for the cost of fixing homes damaged by mica are likely to discussed by Ministers at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with sources indicating that the levy would be included in the Finance Bill but its implementation would likely be delayed.There has been strong opposition from Government backbenchers to the proposed levy, announced in the budget last month by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. The backbenchers argue it would push up house prices at a time of high inflation.
