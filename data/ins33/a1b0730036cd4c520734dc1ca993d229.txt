After a week of outrage over All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett, there was no option but to write a film room. From an argument about a play he had no shot at making on a touchdown run by Austin Ekeler, to blatantly false narratives that Garrett is a bad run defender, to cries that he has no impact on games, it all had to be dismantled.
The Chargers ran at Garrett 10 times on Sunday (either to his side or a cutback to his side), and there was not a single play to grade negatively of those 10 reps.
