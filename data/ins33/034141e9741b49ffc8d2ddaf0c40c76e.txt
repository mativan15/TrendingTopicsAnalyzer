Major policy changes are coming to schools across the state, including here in Central Florida.

State education leaders passed motions Wednesday amending rules in accordance with the Parental Rights in Education law, the biggest change being one that puts teacher licenses on the line.

In accordance with Wednesday's changes, parents will now have to be notified if their child is attending a school where bathrooms and locker rooms allow students to enter if it's not their biological sex at birth.
