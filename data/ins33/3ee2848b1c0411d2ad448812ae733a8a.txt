Russia made coupon payments on two outstanding Eurobonds in foreign currency on Friday, Reuters reported, citing a representative from Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).The coupons on Eurobonds maturing in 2026 and 2036 were due to be paid on May 27. The country forwarded the two payments to the depository last week in an effort to evade a technical default, which would ensue if the bond payments did not reach investors on time.The payment comes just days after the US decided not to extend a waiver that allows Russia to pay off its debt in foreign currency.
