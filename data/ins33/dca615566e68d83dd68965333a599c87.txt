Colorado Economic Development Commission members approved offering as much as $6.94 million to five companies to create 745 new jobs in the state in a meeting on Thursday, with the bulk of the potential jobs coming through a local electric aircraft company moving into production mode.

'Project Galvanic' — most companies applying for job-growth incentive tax credits do so under pseudonyms until they decide to accept the funding — is a startup electric aircraft firm that currently has nine employees, all of them in Colorado, but wants to add 433 more.
