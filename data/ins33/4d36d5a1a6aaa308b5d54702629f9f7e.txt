Since 2014, the Stellar network has been offering safe and cheap transactions. In the first quarter of 2022, it processed an average of $8.6 million a day in payments. Currently, it has also been one of the most chosen networks for payments, tokenization, and issuance of real assets.
"USDC on Stellar provides Mercado Bitcoin customers both valuable interoperability and a truly borderless digital dollar," said Denelle Dixon, CEO of Stellar Development Foundation.
