The Carolina Panthers' fire sale after firing former head coach Matt Rhule continues unabated. The team had already traded receiver Robby Anderson to the Arizona Cardinals, and now they've dealt running back Christian McCaffrey, the face of the offense when healthy, to the San Francisco 49ers for draft picks. ESPN's Adam Schefter was first with the report. Per Schefter, the 49ers are sending second-, third- and fourth-round picks in 2023 and a fifth-round pick in 2024 for McCaffrey.

Selected eighth overall by the Panthers out of Stanford in the 2017 draft, McCaffrey has been one of the league's most productive backs, both as a runner and as a receiver, when he's been able to get on the field.
