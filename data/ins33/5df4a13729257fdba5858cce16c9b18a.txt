Florida authorities Monday released the mugshot and arrest footage of a 10-year-old boy accused of threatening to shoot up his school, with the local sheriff calling the move just desserts for a suspected criminal.
'I did a campaign: Fake threat, real consequence,' Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno told W Radio in Colombia. 'While I understand the boy is 10 years old, his brain's not fully developed, he's a juvenile, I have to tell you: When a 10-year-old presses a trigger, the aftermath is the same regardless of the age.
