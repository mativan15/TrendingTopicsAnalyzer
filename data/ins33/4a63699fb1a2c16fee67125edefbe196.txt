Since Facebook's IPO in 2012, Sheryl Sandberg was named as a key person, alongside Mark Zuckerberg. A series of scandals at the company tarred her reputation. Sandberg departs as revenue slows dramatically, potentially even declining in the second quarter. When Facebook held its Nasdaq debut 10 years ago, the prospectus named six executive officers.

Sheryl Sandberg announced her departure from the company, now named Meta, on Wednesday, leaving behind a complicated 14-year legacy at the social media giant, a job that turned her into a billionaire and one of the most powerful women in the business world.
