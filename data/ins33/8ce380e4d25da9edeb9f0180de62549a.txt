The NFL trade deadline is Nov. 1, so teams have two weeks to decide if they want to add or subtract a player from their roster.

There's been plenty of speculation about the Chiefs' plans since the news Tuesday about tight end Travis Kelce's contract restructure.

The Chiefs gave Kelce the rest of his unpaid salary this season in one lump payment and freed up $3.45 million in salary-cap space, per ESPN's Field Yates. NFL reporter Josina Anderson reported the deal was done Saturday.

Chiefs fans are hopeful that means the team will be bringing in a new player via trade or free-agent signing.
