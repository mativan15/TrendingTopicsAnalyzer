Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, ten-year-old Agnessa Bezhenar and her family were forced to leave their home in Odesa. With no room to bring them along and uncertainty about where the family would end up, they had to leave behind their dogs and cats. The dogs were adopted and a family member who had to stay behind cared for the cats. After initially fleeing to Romania, the Bezhenars later resettled in San Francisco, but as time went on, Agnessa became increasingly concerned about her cat she'd left behind, Arsenii.
