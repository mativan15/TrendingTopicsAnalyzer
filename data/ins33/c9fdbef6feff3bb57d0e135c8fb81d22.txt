The Dallas Stars were too much for the Winnipeg Jets Monday night as they overcame a slow start en route to a 4-1 win.
The visitors wasted little time opening the scoring. Just 3:28 into the first period, Kyle Connor skated the puck into the Stars end and sent a perfect feed to Mark Scheifele, who blasted it past Jake Oettinger for his third goal of the young campaign.But just past the midway point of the frame, the Stars drew level. After a turnover in the Jets end, Ty Dellandrea found Tyler Seguin alone in front of Connor Hellebuyck, and the veteran made no mistake.
