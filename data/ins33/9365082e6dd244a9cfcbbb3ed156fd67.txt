Wealthy crypto investors are dumping a bunch of money into US politics, especially ahead of November's congressional elections. Over the past 15 or so months, crypto-affiliated donors have sent roughly $70 million to political causes - topping what traditional players like defense and big pharma are spending. One of the most prolific donors in the space is Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire co-founder of FTX. Bankman-Fried has said that he could spend up to $1 billion on the 2024 presidential election.
