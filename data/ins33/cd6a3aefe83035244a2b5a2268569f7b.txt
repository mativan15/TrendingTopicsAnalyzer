Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has defended his decision to work for Qatari state-owned beIN SPORTS at the World Cup. The Sky Sports pundit will be working for the broadcaster along with ITV, while his former United team-mate David Beckham has also come in for criticism for his staunch backing of the tournament being held controversially in Qatar.Neville was met with disapproval when news broke of his beIN SPORTS role, given his objections to injustices within British politics and the backlash Qatar has faced for its human rights issues, treatment of migrant workers and criminalisation of homosexuality.
