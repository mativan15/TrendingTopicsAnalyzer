Google said Thursday it has started rolling out My Ad Center, which enables people to turn off targeted advertising while still ensuring apps such as Maps, Search and Google Assistant work. My Ad Center, announced earlier this year at Google I/O, is a new hub where people can control the types of ads they see. When looking at an ad in YouTube, Search or Discover, they can tap or click on the three small dots next to the ad, taking them to My Ad Center. There, people can give feedback on the ad, whether they want to see more or less of an ad or if there are certain ads they'd like to not see at all.
