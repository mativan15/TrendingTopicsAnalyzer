The army's light tank programme has 'gone badly wrong' and must be fixed or scrapped before more money is wasted and there are further risks to national security, MPs have warned.A report by the public accounts committee (PAC) found that repeated failures over the £5.5 billion Ajax contract had put strain on older capabilities and 'directly' threatened the safety of troops, as well as the ability of the Ministry of Defence to protect the nation.'Enough is enough — the MoD must fix or fail this programme, before more risk to our national security and more billions of taxpayers' money are wasted,' Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, said.
