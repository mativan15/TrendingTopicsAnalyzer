Mercury ends its retrograde in Taurus at 4:00 AM, which can find us feeling less forgetful and annoyed, and more focused and present! Mercury retrograde is famous for misunderstandings and hold-ups, but things start to move forward now. The moon in Cancer connects with Neptune in Pisces at 5:05 AM, inspiring our imaginations, and we're in a chatty mood as the moon mingles with Mercury in Taurus at 6:44 AM. The moon opposes Pluto in Capricorn at 11:15 AM, which could stir up intense emotions, and we're connecting with our heart's desires as the moon enters Leo at 2:38 PM.
