Liz Truss' electoral base has considerably shrunk with Brexit voters defecting from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party, a professor of politics said, reducing the Conservatives' chances of winning the next General Election. Pr Eric Kaufmann from Birkbeck College said the Prime Minister focused too much attention on pleasing Tory MPs rather than Conservative voters during this summer's Tory leadership contest. As a result, she has created a gap between the interests of Tory MPs and the electoral base that Boris Johnson secured in 2019 when he won the General Election by a landslide.
