NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged and Treasury yields oscillated on Tuesday as better-than-expected earnings and robust factory data fueled investors' risk appetite.

Extending Monday's broad rally, all three major U.S. stock indexes were last up well over 1%, with gains across the board.

"The market was a bit oversold leading into Monday, and people were worried of what was going to happen over the weekend. People walked into the week feeling a little better," said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
