Red Bull's penalty for breaking budget cap rules needs to go 'well beyond a fine' to stop teams from breaching the cap on purpose, according to a rival team boss. Speaking to Sky Sports, the unidentified team principal said a financial penalty would ensure teams 'game the system' and break the rules next season.They warned failure for tough action would bring an end to the budget cap as all teams would then breach the allocation as a 'cost of business'.The team boss explained: 'The FIA should be left the freedom to do its own investigation and come up with the appropriate penalty, it should not be a case of teams pushing for this or that outcome.
