People are consuming food past its use-by date and putting themselves at risk of getting "food poisoning" by eating spoiled goods because they are switching off fridges and freezers to save money, a watchdog has warned.Households are taking risks with food safety because of the cost of living squeeze and rising energy bills, research by the Food Standards Agency suggests.
A third of consumers (32%) ate food past its use-by date - after which time the product can be unsafe to consume - at least once in the past month because they could not afford to shop for more, a survey by the food safety watchdog found.
