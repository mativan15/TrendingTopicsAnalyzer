Who got rich during the Giro d'Italia, and who left Italy as paupers?

The Giro's prize money purse isn't quite as big as that of the Tour de France, but at EUR1.5 million, it's still not a bad pay day for three weeks of work.

Race-winner Jai Hindley came away with the biggest paycheck at EUR265,000. Of course, that's typically shared out with riders and staff, but it's the largest individual check from the corsa rosa.

Richard Carapaz brought home EUR133,000 for second place, and Mikel Landa will receive a check for EUR68,000 for third place.
