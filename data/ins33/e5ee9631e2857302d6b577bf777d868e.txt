Kwarkot/iStock via Getty Images BofA Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein upgraded Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) to Buy from Neutral as he expects more defensive net lease REITs to outperform "given the market's focus on tightening monetary conditions and rising recession risks." Other factors in the stock's favor: Its recent equity raise reduces capital market risk and the stock screens well on a price/earnings-to-growth and dividend yield basis. The analyst estimates Agree's (ADC) leverage at 3.3x proforma for its equity raise and assuming full settlement of its forward equity offerings and estimates $645M of hedged capital through its unsettled forward equity.
