Lithium stocks crashed on Wednesday, with nearly every stock from the industry trading deep in the red by afternoon. Here's how much the worst-performing lithium stocks had fallen as of 12:50 p.m. ET Wednesday:

Albemarle (ALB -6.95%): Down 10.2%.
Livent (LTHM -14.53%): Down 15.6%.
Piedmont Lithium (PLL -12.41%): Down 16%.

You'd think lithium prices would be the culprit, but that's not the case. Lithium prices continue to hold up strong -- it's where lithium prices could head that's spooked the markets today.
