Biden suggests possible student loan forgivenessFacing pressure to offer debt relief to student loan borrowers, President Joe Biden promised a plan in the coming weeks.Anyone who borrowed money to attend a school owned by Corinthian Colleges - a for-profit institution with a long history of defrauding students before its sudden closure in 2015 - will have their federal student loans cancelled. The mass discharge is the largest amount of debt the federal government has erased in one action benefitting more than a half million borrowers to the tune of $5.
