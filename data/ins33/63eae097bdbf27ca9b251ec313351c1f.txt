A man has been arrested three weeks after a double shooting in Portsmouth that left a man dead and another seriously injured, police said.

Avery Peoples, 29, was taken into custody at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday at a business near the 4500 block of George Washington Highway. He faces a count of first-degree murder along with several other charges.

Peoples was named a person of interest last month in the shooting, which left 41-year-old Lamont Brown dead and another man critically injured in the 10th block of Carver Circle.
