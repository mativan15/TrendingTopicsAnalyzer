Everyone has a hobby, and for YouTube star Carter Sharer, it's collecting cool cars.

Amassing a collection of more than 10 vehicles requires a fair amount of dedication, not to mention a fair amount of cash. During a rapid-fire question round on the latest episode of E! News' digital series DRIVE!, the YouTuber revealed the surprising amount he's ever spent on one of his cars.

"$500,000," Carter told host Austin J. Mills while driving around in his pink Porsche Macan S, which is also the very first car he ever purchased.
