PTIKashmiri Pandits stage a protest. (File photo)A group of Kashmiri Pandit employees, who were given jobs under a prime minister's package for the community, Wednesday began preparations for "mass migration" out of Kashmir, protesting against a series of targeted killings of non-Muslim employees by terrorists. The group said they were meeting truck-owners Wednesday to negotiate a rate for transporting their goods. Hours after a female teacher was shot dead by terrorists in Kulgam district, an organisation of KP employees had threatened to leave the Valley if the government did not relocate them to safer places in 24 hours.
