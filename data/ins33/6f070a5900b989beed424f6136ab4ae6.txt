Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a key member of the January 6 committee investigating the Capitol attack, gives Inside the Hive an exclusive preview of next week's prime-time hearing. After nearly a year of investigating the insurrection, Raskin says the most surprising discovery has been 'the role that money played, and the role of a financial motive behind all these events to keep the money pouring in.' The committee, he promises, will also draw direct and indirect lines between 'the top of the Republican hierarchy' and the 'violent hooligans and street fascists' who overran the Capitol.
