Collider.com Emily Blunt (Jungle Cruise) has more than proven herself as one of the biggest names in the acting world today. Whether it be the time-loop science fiction of Edge of Tomorrow (2014), the silent horror of A Quiet Place (2018), or the thrilling intensity of Sicario (2015), she has consistently delivered performances that have led to a justifiably prestigious career. It's a successful run that's showing no signs of stopping, with Blunt set to be one of many massive names in Christopher Nolan's latest, Oppenheimer (2023).
