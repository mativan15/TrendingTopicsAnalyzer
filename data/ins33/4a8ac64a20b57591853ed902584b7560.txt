Cornerback J.C. Jackson was one of the biggest offseason acquisitions for the Chargers, but he wasn't on the field for much of Monday night's win over the Broncos.

Jackson was benched at halftime of the 19-16 overtime win and replaced by Mike Davis. Jackson was flagged for pass interference early in the first quarter and head coach Brandon Staley responsible for blown coverages on a touchdown pass to Broncos tight end Greg Dulcich and a long pickup by wide receiver KJ Hamler.
