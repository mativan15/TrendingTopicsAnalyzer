The labor market may be cooling off, but not by much, according to new data on job openings and turnover.

Employers had 11.4 million vacancies in April, according to the Labor Department, down from a revised total of nearly 11.9 million the previous month, which was a record.

The April vacancies represented 7 percent of the entire employment base, and left close to two available jobs for every person looking for work, reflecting continued high demand for labor even as the Federal Reserve begins to tamp it down.
