Oct. 21—In four years' time, Brennan Pugh has taken Vardaman football from the cellar to the cusp of a division title.

The Rams (7-1, 4-0) hit the road tonight to face Hamilton (8-4, 4-0) in what could be the de facto Division 3-1A championship game. It's a place far removed from Pugh's first season as head coach, when Vardaman went 0-11.

The Rams won three games each of the next two seasons, and now it's all clicked into place.

"It's a testament to the kids that we have," Pugh said. "Our seniors this year were ninth graders the year I was hired, and from them all the way down, they all have bought in and done everything that me and the other coaches have asked them to do.
