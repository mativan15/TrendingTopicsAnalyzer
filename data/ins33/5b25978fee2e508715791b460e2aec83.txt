Self-driving car and truck startups have lost a combined $40 billion in stock market valuation over the last two years, according to an analysis by Crunchbase, which keeps tabs on startup valuations. Overall, the cohort of autonomous vehicle startups that Crunchbase tracked has declined 81% in value, from just over $51 billion when each debuted on the stock market to a current book value of just $9.16 billion. That includes spectacular flame-outs like Quanergy Systems, a solid-state sensor company down 99% since IPO, Otomo, a cloud-based car connection solution that is down 97%, and Embark Technologies, a self-driving truck technology startup that is also down 97%.
