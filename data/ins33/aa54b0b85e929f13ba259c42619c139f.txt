Can you delay RMD if you're still working?

If you contribute to a tax-advantaged retirement account at work or a traditional IRA, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) are something you'll need to factor into your financial plan. These distributions are minimum amounts you're required to withdraw from your retirement accounts once you reach age 72. You might be wondering whether you have to take RMD if still working. The answer is usually yes, though there are some exceptions. For a full understanding of how this rule impacts your personal situation, you could speak with a financial advisor.
