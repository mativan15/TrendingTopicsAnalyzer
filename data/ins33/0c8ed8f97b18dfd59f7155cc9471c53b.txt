Nearly 200 veterans won major-party primaries this year and will vie for a seat in Congress in the midterm elections, making this the largest field of candidates with military experience in a decade.

But experts warn that the larger pool will not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of veterans in office, since many of the hopefuls are in districts that significantly favor their opponents' party.

'We definitely are seeing more veterans getting involved in congressional races,' said Seth Lynn, executive director of the Veterans Campaign, which tracks veterans' involvement in politics and helps advise members of the military community on careers in public office.
