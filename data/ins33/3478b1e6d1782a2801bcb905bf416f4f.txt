Convicted healthcare tech fraudster Elizabeth Holmes is asking a judge to overturn jurors' decision, arguing that there was "insufficient" evidence for them to reach their "guilty" verdicts, according to recent court papers.  Holmes, the 38-year-old founder and former CEO of Theranos, was convicted in January on three counts of wire fraud and one counts of conspiracy to commit fraud. But the jury's decision should be thrown out because "the evidence is insufficient to sustain the convictions," Holmes' attorneys argued in a motion on Friday.
