In South Austin, across the street from two different Starbucks Corp. locations, one can find coffee trucks serving drinks infused with cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive compound from the cannabis plant.

It's an intentional strategy for Roger Pilney, CEO and founder of Austin's Radix House Coffee Shop LLC. He said Radix is a local alternative for a caffeine fix, and sometimes that's enough to convert customers from the green mermaid logo to his green hemp logo.

It's just one facet of Pilney's marketing approach for his young but growing company.
