With a price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 27.8x Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.

Adobe could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth.
