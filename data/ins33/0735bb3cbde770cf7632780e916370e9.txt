Another antitrust lawsuit is being filed in Europe targeting Big Tech for hefty damages over claims of abusive self-preferencing.
This time ecommerce giant Amazon — and its nudge-tastic ‘Buy Box' — is in the frame for an incoming opt-out representative legal action that's been announced in the UK, seeking an estimated £900 million in damages to compensate tens of millions of consumers for alleged anti-competitive behavior.
The key accusation of 'The Amazon UK Buy Box Claim' — as the opt-out collective action suit is being styled — is that Amazon uses the Buy Box, a feature it displays on product pages encouraging shoppers to add a particular seller's item to their cart, to unlawfully favor its own product offers, obscuring better deals that could save shoppers money.
