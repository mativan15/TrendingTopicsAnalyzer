The top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee chided the Pentagon on Friday after it announced that it will help pay for troops' travel to obtain abortions.

Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama slammed a memo establishing the new policy, signed Thursday by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, as a political move ahead of the Nov. 8 elections and demanded answers on the memo's origin.

'I am deeply disappointed that the Department of Defense has allowed President Biden to blatantly misuse the United States Military for political purposes," Rogers said in a statement.
