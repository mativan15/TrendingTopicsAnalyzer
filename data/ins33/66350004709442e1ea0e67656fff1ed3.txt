Legendary talk-radio host Howard Stern – who is known for his Jewish origins – slammed Kanye West in Wednesday's episode of his SiriusXM radio show.

'This is so depressing. I mean, Kanye used to be fun crazy. Now he's like Hitler,' the controversial radio host declared, harkening back to West's recent antisemitic rants.

'I'm really tired of people excusing his behavior, by saying, ‘Well, he's just mentally ill… if he's so mentally ill, why don't they appoint a conservator over his money like they did with the poor Britney Spears?'

Stern, a prominent US radio voice since 1986, also responded to one of West's many antisemitic accusations – that the 'Jewish underground media mafia' refers to him as a rapper rather than a billionaire or tycoon out of spite.
