skynesher/E+ via Getty Images Malibu Boats, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBUU) is an established, profitable small-cap stock at $1.167 billion, that looks to be well positioned to continue delivering on a 5-year consistent 30% plus revenue CAGR for shareholders. With the company surpassing consensus EPS estimates four times over the last four quarters and recent vertical and horizontal acquisitions for which the expected full benefits are yet to be realised, I believe the company shows promise in continuing its revenue growth through a wider range of product offerings and improving its bottom line through greater control of its supply chain expenses with its vertical integration strategy.
