Andrzej Rostek/iStock via Getty Images Shares of growth factor signaling specialist Scholar Rock (NASDAQ:SRRK) have lost over 20% of their value during the past 3 years and are down 70% so far in 2022. In ROTY's portfolio, I sold the remainder of my position in June 2021 for a 40% loss after a "sell the news" reaction followed promising Cohort 3 data for apitegromab in SMA. While the company has certainly experienced its share of setbacks including 25% workforce reduction in May and key executive exits such as Chief Medical Officer leaving for "other career opportunities", not to mention failure to see meaningful efficacy signal for SRK-181 in solid tumor indications as of yet, a recent revisit led me to believe the story is ripe to turn around.
