As billionaire Elon Musk gets closer to becoming Twitter's new owner, one of the only things people inside the company and close to the deal seem to agree on is that his rule will be chaotic.Musk's $44 billion deal is headed toward a close at the end of next week, likely on Friday, two people familiar with the situation told Insider. Beyond that, it's unclear what's next, although Twitter will almost certainly see steep cuts to staff, including CEO Parag Agrawal and other top executives, sources said.
