Texas Tech again has a bunch of new players on its roster. This time, the newcomers are much younger.The 25th-ranked Red Raiders go into the second season for homegrown head coach Mark Adams with only three returning players. The 10 newcomers include five true freshmen and five transfers, only two of them seniors.'Our biggest challenge for our coaching staff is to get these guys thinking older and playing older, and playing with some maturity,' Adams said.Four of Texas Tech's primary starters through much of the Big 12 schedule last season were seniors in their first — and only season — in the program.
