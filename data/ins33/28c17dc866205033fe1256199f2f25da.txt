Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday said the speed at which the number of pending cases is rising in various courts of the country is a matter of concern. He also said the increase in pending cases does not mean that matters are not being heard or disposed of, rather it is because the number of fresh cases is double than cases being settled daily. He was addressing the inaugural function of the new office premises of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) Raipur bench in the Central Secretariat building, Nava Raipur Atal Nagar.
