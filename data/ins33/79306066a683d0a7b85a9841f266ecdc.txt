By Australian Associated Press Published: 16:56 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 16:56 EDT, 20 October 2022 The sudden resignation of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss won't affect Australia's relationship with Great Britain, federal MPs say. Ms Truss overnight resigned from the role just six weeks after taking over from Boris Johnson. Her tenure was the shortest of any prime minister in UK history. A Conservative Party leadership contest will be held in the next week to elect a new leader, with Ms Truss acting as interim leader in the meantime.
