Shifting your credit card balance from an account with a high interest rate to one with a long intro 0% APR period could help you pay down debt without racking up more interest. Before you pick a card to transfer that debt, however, make sure you check the balance transfer fees.Some credit card issuers will charge a fee -- usually 3% to 5% -- to accept balance transfers into the new account. If you're transferring $20,000 in debt, that's an extra $600 to $1,000 you'll have to cover. Other credit cards, however, waive balance transfer fees completely, making them attractive to cardholders who really don't want more of a cost burden.
