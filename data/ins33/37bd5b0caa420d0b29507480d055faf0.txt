It's time for the Astros League Championship … er, the American League Championship Series.
The Astros haven't obtained automatic entry into this portion of the postseason; it just feels that way now that they've advanced to the ALCS for the sixth straight year (the Braves of 1991-99 are the only other team to reach the LCS round at least six consecutive years).
But the other end of this ALCS is also familiar. Because, for the third time in this streak, the Astros will be pitted against a Yankees team that is hoping to reach the World Series for the first time since 2009.
