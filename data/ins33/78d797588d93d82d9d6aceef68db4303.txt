A plan to roll out facial recognition technology in every pub and club in New South Wales has been criticised by the Greens, who say the 'invasive' measure is an attempt to avoid further crackdowns on poker machines.The Australian Hotels Association NSW and ClubsNSW say they are developing a state-of-the-art system to be rolled out across all clubs and hotels next year to keep people who have self-imposed bans away from poker machines.Everyone in the gaming area will have their face scanned and the images will be cross-checked with people who have signed up for the self-exclusion system.
