Human Rights Commissioner Paul Hunt admits the commission has failed to hold successive Governments to account for their failures over housing, but says it is launching a big push now. Cameron Redley is one of those people Hunt thinks the system has failed. At 3am on Tuesday he is in his car outside a laundromat in Manurewa, Auckland waiting for his washing to finish its cycle. Redley recently found a private rental to move into, but before that, he and his son spent two years in emergency housing on a social housing wait-list.
