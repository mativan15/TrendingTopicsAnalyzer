The House of Bread in Dayton is working to try and help feed families as food insecurity continues to be a concern.

In Ohio, one in eight people are facing hunger, and one out of six kids are going without something substantial to eat, according to feedingamerica.org.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) formerly known as food stamps shows that more than 40% of its users have children.
