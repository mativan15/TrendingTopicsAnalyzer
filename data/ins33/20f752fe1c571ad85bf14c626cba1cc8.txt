By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:35 EDT, 5 June 2022 | Updated: 21:35 EDT, 5 June 2022 Richmond's Damien Hardwick has called for part of the salary of AFL senior coaches to be placed outside of the soft cap. Football departments were able to spend up to $9.7 million before COVID-19, but that figure was abruptly slashed to $6.7 million in March 2020 to deal with the unique challenges of the pandemic. That total includes the entire wage of a senior coach, with some leaders reportedly earning more than $1 million.
