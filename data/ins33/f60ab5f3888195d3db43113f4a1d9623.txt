Christchurch woman Natalie Harrison launched a business while struggling with chronic fatigue. When she launched Kiri10 in June 2020​ to produce supplement pills made from keratin extracted from New Zealand coarse wool, Covid-19 economic and social disruption was at its height. But Harrison was battling her own health troubles. Despite being fired with enthusiasm and the ambition to own her own socially-useful business, she was struggling to get through her days. 'I was getting up in the morning, going to the office, doing a bit of work, hitting a wall, sitting at the desk, not being able to concentrate, and going home and sleeping anywhere from three to five hours,' she said.
