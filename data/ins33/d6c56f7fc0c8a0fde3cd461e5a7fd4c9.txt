The province's lowest-paid workers will soon be seeing more money on their paycheques as British Columbia's minimum wage increases again. The minimum wage changes Wednesday in a scheduled and previously announced increase to $15.65 an hour. Workers previously made $15.20. This is the highest minimum wage of any Canadian province, the NDP government said in a news release reminding workers of the increase. And it's part of a five-year plan that began in 2018 to increase the wage up to, and then beyond, $15.
