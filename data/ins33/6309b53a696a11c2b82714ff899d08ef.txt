Mumbai The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has extended the deadline for setting up Marathi signboards in all the shops and establishments in Mumbai to June 30.Municipal commissioner, Iqbal Singh Chahal said that the deadline has been extended to June 30. 'Most of the shops and business owners don't have the infrastructure or financial viability to replace the existing signboards with new ones in such a short notice. There are more than five lakh shop owners in the city and most of them are small-scale business owners and taking rampant probationary action against them will only increase the burden on court and civic body,' Chahal told HT on Thursday.
