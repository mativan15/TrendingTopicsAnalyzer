Martin Lewis has called on the government to increase benefits in line with inflation after new chancellor Jeremy Hunt scrapped most of the government's mini-Budget.The personal finance guru and founder of MoneySavingExpert said that there are 'a lot of very desperate people' who 'will need reassurance' that they will be able to make ends meet during these tumultuous times.It comes after Mr Hunt announced his new measures days into his job as chancellor after Liz Truss sacked his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng after their financial plans tanked the pound and spooked the markets.
