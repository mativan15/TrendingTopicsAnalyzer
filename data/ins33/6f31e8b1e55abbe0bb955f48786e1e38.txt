W﻿e asked for your post-match reaction after Sunday's game at Villa Park.H﻿ere are some of your thoughts:A﻿ston Villa fans:S﻿hak: Mings can have a good spell but always seems to have a mistake in him. Villa played well enough up until the second goal but mistakes can be costly. Playing well against Manchester City and Chelsea means nothing with the performances and results in between. It's those games against sides like Leeds and Forest that we need to do better in. Brentford is big.J﻿on: Unfortunately this game is not representative of the types of games our strong squad should win.
