Throughout training camp and the preseason, the Orlando Magic emphasized focusing on their process and honing in on the details as the next steps in their rebuild.

The Magic's progress will get their first real test in season opener against the Pistons on Wednesday at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.

While they don't count in the standings, preseason games matter. They allow for data collection, lineup/rotation experimentation and players to get a better feel for their teammates.

They also help coaches and players see what else needs to be improved.
