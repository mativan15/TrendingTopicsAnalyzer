The University of Miami, already ailing with several injured players, is missing a few more Saturday against the Virginia Tech Hokies.

Henry Parrish Jr., Michael Redding III, Zion Nelson, Justice Oluwaseun, Waynmon Steed Jr. and Tyrique Stevenson all did not participate in warm-ups at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg, Virginia, and won't suit up for the Miami Hurricanes in their second Atlantic Coast Conference game.

Miami (2-3, 0-1) did not provide specifics for most of these injuries, but coach Mario Cristobal said both Nelson and Oluwaseun would be game-time decisions for this weekend.
