Variety - Film News Paul Dano has been acting since the early 2000s, but it took playing the Riddler opposite Robert Pattinson in 'The Batman' for the world to start noticing the 38-year-old in his every day life. As part of a new GQ cover story, Dano said he now gets recognized in public when he least expects it. One example: When he goes to get the mail. 'Like a mailman: ‘Oh, shit!! Riddler!!' the actor said.'When it was said I was going to do that part, I never received that many texts, phone calls, emails,' Dano added later in the interview, noting the production went to extreme lengths to ensure none of Dano's Riddler production materials would get lost or leaked.
