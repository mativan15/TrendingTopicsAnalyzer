The government will frame new rules, along with a legal framework, to prevent restaurants from levying service charge on diners, which is an 'unfair trade practice', consumer affairs secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said on Thursday.Consumers often mix up 'service charge' imposed by eateries with service tax, which is a statutory levy under the Goods and Services Tax or GST, Singh said, following a meeting of the department of consumer affairs with restaurant associations and consumer-rights organisations on the issue of service charge.
