AgenciesWatch these films to rediscover what made him an icon.Jean-Luc Godard has died at 91. One of the pioneers of the French New Wave, Godard and his movie-mad contemporaries rebelled against the square cinematic conventions of the 1950s. They redefined the canon to include then-disreputable American genre pictures, created characters who articulated their own passions and opinions, and illustrated that the tried-and-true techniques of professional filmmaking were stifling and unnecessary. Between 1960 and 1967, the prolific Godard made more than a dozen feature films in a multiplicity of styles - presented with exuberance and wit - creating a body of work that later directors would draw on for inspiration.
