Mironmax Studio/iStock via Getty Images MP Materials (NYSE:MP) is a basic materials company focused on rare earth metals, with its primary asset being the Mountain Pass mine in California. Mountain Pass has been in operation for decades. It was also the main holding of Molycorp, which was a hot stock for a few years in the early 2010s but later fell into bankruptcy when the price of rare earth metals declined. A financial group acquired the mine out of bankruptcy. Following a 2020 SPAC deal, the mine is a publicly-traded asset once again, now under the MP Materials banner.
