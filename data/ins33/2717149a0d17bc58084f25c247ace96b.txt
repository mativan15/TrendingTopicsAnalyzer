Graham Potter has revealed that Reece James will spend the next four weeks with a brace on his injured knee – placing even further doubt on the right-back's desperate bid to convince Gareth Southgate to take him to the World Cup.

England manager Southgate was at Villa Park on Sunday to watch Chelsea beat the hosts 2-0, courtesy of goals from Mason Mount, without James.
