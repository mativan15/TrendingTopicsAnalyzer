Days after the Union Environment Ministry announced a scheme to incentivise entrepreneurs to manufacture pellets from paddy stubble, beneficiaries say that the scheme does not account for the actual costs of manufacturing and is unlikely to help with reducing pollution from stubble burning.Pellets are manufactured out of agriculture biomass and are often produced from a variety of sources, including groundnut shells, coconut husk, mustard and coffee shells, sugarcane, sawdust and pine needles. The carbon that remains in the biomass when dried and compressed together can be made into a variety of shapes — such as larger, elephant-foot-sized briquettes or smaller cylindrical pellets.
