TWO YEARS and a change in government later, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which had given a clean chit to NCP leader Ajit Pawar and over 70 others in 2020, told a special court last week that it was continuing its investigation into the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) alleged fraud case.
In October 2020, when the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was in power and Pawar was the deputy chief minister, the EOW had filed a 70,000-page closure report in the case, stating that it had found no irregularities.
