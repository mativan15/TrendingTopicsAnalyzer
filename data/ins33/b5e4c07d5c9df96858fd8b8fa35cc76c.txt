One challenge brands face when targeting their audience is making their products or services accessible across a variety of channels. This can help companies gain mass exposure, but pitching your solutions on social media, a website and a mobile app can be prohibitively expensive.
If your site is already up and running, AppMySite can transform it into an app that fans can download from the App Store and Google Play, so you won't need to hire programmers or an agency to do the work for you. AppMySite Pro Plans are on sale now for just $50.
