Spencer Platt/Getty Images News Stock index futures point to a higher open Monday, bouncing back from the selloff in the previous session as focus turns to corporate earnings. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) +1.5%, S&P futures (SPX) +1.3% and Dow futures (INDU) +1.2% are higher. Bank of America is gaining after reporting results that beat on the top and bottom lines. Overall for banks, "FICC revenues have held up given the heightened volatility, and net interest income improved with the blistering pace of Fed rate hikes, while deal making revenue has slowed given the gloomy economic outlook," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.
