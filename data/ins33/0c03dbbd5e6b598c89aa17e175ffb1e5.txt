Property investors who require mortgages to purchase their next property are the least active they have been in 20 years, CoreLogic data shows. CoreLogic head of research Nick Goodall said of all the properties sold in September, finance-dependent investors only bought 20% of them, the lowest proportion since data collection began in 2003. In September the year before, this investor group made up 23% of purchases, and during the heat of the Covid market in the early months of 2021, the group made up nearly 30% of purchases.
