Mumbai | Bengaluru | Kolkata: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's top information technology company, wants the government to directly allocate 5G spectrum to private enterprises, as recommended by the regulator. It ruled out participating in the upcoming 5G auction as rollout obligations make buying airwaves directly financially unviable.'Private networks for enterprises will enable organisations to accelerate their IoT (internet of things) and digitalisation agenda,' TCS chief operating officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam told ET.
