PARIS (AP) — Victor Wembanyama scored his team's first points after just 54 seconds, then pumped his arms when he assisted on the last score of Friday night's game with a pass that traveled nearly the length of the court.

'Wembamania' is sweeping France and everyone is trying to get a look at the 18-year-old prodigy widely expected to become an NBA star.

Even 85-year-old former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who called the club's president to ask for a ticket. The Socialist Party politician watched as Wembanyama scored 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting for Paris-based Metropolitans 92 in a 113-88 win against Blois.
