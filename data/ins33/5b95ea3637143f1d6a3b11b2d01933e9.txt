Group of friends celebrating together the end of 2022 and the new beginning in 2023.

Things haven't been particularly pretty for the domestically-focused FTSE 250 in 2022, so far. Since January, the index has tumbled almost 30% in value as multiple economic issues have sent investors scrambling for the exits.

It's grim, to be sure. However, I'm not selling a single thing. In fact, I'm looking to top up on some quality stocks that now look even better value and could bounce back strongly in 2023.
