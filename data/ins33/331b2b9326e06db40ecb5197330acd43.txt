Dozens of prospective fossil fuel projects in the UK that qualify for Rishi Sunak's tax relief on oil and gas could together pump up to 899 million tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, analysis shows.The chancellor announced last week that energy firms would get a 91p tax saving for every £1 they invested in oil and gas extraction in the UK, to the end of 2025.Campaigners fear the move could cause companies to accelerate plans for projects that were already in the pipeline in order to benefit from the tax break.
