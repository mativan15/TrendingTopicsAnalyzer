Amid the growing confrontation between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit, the state government has decided not to send a communication to get the last Vidhan Sabha prorogued in order to bypass him if it wants to reconvene another session.
At the same time the government is internally discussing if it should go the way of West Bengal and remove the governor as the chancellor of state-run universities and make Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann the chancellor of all state universities.
