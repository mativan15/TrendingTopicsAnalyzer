In a video posted to the official TikTok account on Thursday, Rachel Zegler gives viewers a tour of the set of 'Hunger Games' prequel 'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.' The film, which is based on Suzanne Collins' book of the same name, stars Tom Blyth as a young Coriolanus Snow — who eventually grows up to become menacing antagonist President Snow in the original trilogy — who is chosen to mentor Zegler's Lucy Gray Baird during the tenth Hunger Games. Francis Lawrence ('The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,' 'Mockingjay — Part 1,' 'Mockingjay — Part 2') is set to direct.
