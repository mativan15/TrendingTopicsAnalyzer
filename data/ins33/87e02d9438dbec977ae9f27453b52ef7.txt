DOJ Steve Bannon is maintaining his defiant posture after being sentenced to prison for brushing off a subpoena, saying Republicans will retake the House and impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland for politicizing the Department of Justice.Bannon, an ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump, made the remarks Friday night during an appearance on Tucker Carlson's prime-time Fox News show. A federal judge had earlier in the day sentenced Bannon to four months in prison for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection.
