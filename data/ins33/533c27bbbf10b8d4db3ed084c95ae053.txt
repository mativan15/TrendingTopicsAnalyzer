A Mumbai resident and her father recently moved a PIL in the Bombay High Court seeking direction to the CBI and ED to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation against the alleged disproportionate assets of former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his family.
The plea came up for hearing before a division bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice R N Laddha Wednesday. The bench noticed certain objections were raised by the Registry in the Public Interest Litigation and gave two weeks to the petitioner to remove and correct them and posted the matter for further hearing on November 16.
