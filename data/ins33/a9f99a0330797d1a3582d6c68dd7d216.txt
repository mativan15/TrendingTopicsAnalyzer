IntegraFin Holdings plc (LON:IHP) will increase its dividend on the 30th of June to UK£0.032, which is 6.7% higher than last year. This takes the annual payment to 3.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.

While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. IntegraFin Holdings' stock price has reduced by 32% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield.
