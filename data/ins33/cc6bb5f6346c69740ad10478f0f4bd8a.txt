The U.S. government on Friday made thousands of Ethiopian immigrants in the country eligible for deportation protections and work permits, citing the civil war in Ethiopia, which has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said he would allow eligible Ethiopians who arrived in the U.S. on or before Oct. 20 to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), an immigration program that allows beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. legally for periods of time if their home countries have been beset by armed conflict, natural disasters or other dire humanitarian emergencies.
