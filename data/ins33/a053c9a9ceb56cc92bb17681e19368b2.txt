Though Halloween has yet to pass, it isn't too early to start thinking about holiday shopping. With Black Friday on the horizon, many retailers are already starting to offer deals: Amazon just hosted an October Prime Day event — the first time it's ever put on two Prime Day-esque events in one year — and other retailers like Target, Walmart, Overstock and Wayfair are starting to launch early holiday sales.In 2021, retailers hosted early deals events in October due to widespread shipping delays and supply chain concerns.
