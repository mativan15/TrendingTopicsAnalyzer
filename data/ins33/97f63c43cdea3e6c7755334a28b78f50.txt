Airport travelers move around the Nashville International Airport without face coverings Wednesday, April 20, 2022 in Nashville, Tenn. after a recent federal judge's decision to strike down a national mask mandate.

The latest low-cost carrier adding direct regional flights to BNA's ever-growing schedule caters to travelers going to cities without prior nonstop service in Nashville.

Breeze Airways was founded last year in Utah by airline tycoon David Neeleman, a veteran entrepreneur who uses consumer data and technology to offer cheap nonstop regional trips.
