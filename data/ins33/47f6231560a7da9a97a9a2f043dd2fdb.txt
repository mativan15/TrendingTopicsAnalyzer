The previous hydrometallurgical flowsheet that was included in the PEA (preliminary economic assessment[1]) was based on a more costly and complex gangue-leach – caustic-crack process. Upon joining the team, Defense Metals' lead metallurgical consultant, John Goode, P.Eng., recommended investigation of the acid-bake process for the Wicheeda ore, and the preliminary results show that the acid-bake process is more efficient, yielding >95% recovery of neodymium and praseodymium from flotation concentrate into a leach solution (Figure 1).
