Attane Inc.'s leadership team continues to evolve, with Scott Kokotan trading his CFO role for CEO.

Kokotan succeeds Chris Egan, who left the Kansas City-based marketing agency in the summer to become executive chairman of Synetic Technologies, according to his LinkedIn profile. The North Kansas City-based tech company helps businesses securely and ethically dispose of IT assets at the end of their life cycle.

Kokotan joined the marketing agency for the senior living and care industries in 2019 after a nationwide search conducted by Kansas City-based Fenaroli & Associates.
