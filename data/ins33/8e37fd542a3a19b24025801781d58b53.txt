Crypto exchange Binance denied allegations of misusing its users' token holdings to exercise voting power on the Uniswap decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

'Binance doesn't vote with user's tokens. In this case, there has been a misunderstanding of what happened during the transfer of a large balance of UNI (around 4.6 million) between wallets,' a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk this morning.

'We're currently in discussions to improve the process to prevent any further misunderstandings from happening again,' they added.
