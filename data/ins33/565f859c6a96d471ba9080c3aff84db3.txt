Oct. 16—KENNESAW — Crowds of costumed kids collected candy in Kennesaw's Swift-Cantrell Park on Saturday for the city's annual "Fall-O-Ween."

"Fall-O-Ween is our celebration of Halloween and fall activities," said Brittani Farmer, the special event coordinator for Kennesaw's Parks and Recreation Department. "It allows people to come out for safe trick-or-treating as they prepare for Halloween."

Farmer said between 5,000 and 7,000 people attended Fall-O-Ween in recent years. A line of cars, all looking to park, backed up onto Old 41 Highway as this year's fest got underway.
