White Rock, British Columbia: Re 'Shooter had no criminal record, called troubled,' May 27: Salvador Ramos had been brutally bullied when he attended high school, in no small part due to a speech impediment. Although he is not said to have had autism spectrum disorder (ASD) issues, neurodevelopmental disorders among young people who commit school or mass shootings are not uncommon.It's no big secret that adverse childhood experience (ACE) abuse/trauma is often inflicted upon ASD and/or highly sensitive children and teens by their normal or neurotypical peers, so why not at least acknowledge it in some meaningful, constructive way? Neurodiversity could be taught in school to perhaps reduce the incidence of chronic bullying against such vulnerable students.
