INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — Detectives said a building contractor bilked property owners out of down payment money, then traveled across the country and overseas without completing work on several homes.

Dillon Slater, 30, the owner of Slater Construction, was charged Oct. 12 by the Indian River County Sheriff's Office with organized fraud of more than $50,000, scheme to defraud and stopping payment with intent to defraud. The latter charge is a federal offense.
