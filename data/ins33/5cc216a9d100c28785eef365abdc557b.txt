PRATTVILLE — Two co-defendants in a 2017 Autauga County murder case have been sentenced; a third may face trial if she is ever released from a state mental institution.

Melvin Perry, 40, was found shot to death in his yard in the 900 block of County Road 1 in the Statesville community on Oct. 1, 2017. Prosecutors and investigators early on thought robbery was the motive and arrested three people.

An Autauga County Grand Jury returned capital murder indictments against Kelton Sherrod Williams, 24, of Millbrook, Quindarius Rayshaun Terrance, 25, of Selma and Jeweline Monique Cozzadd, 27, of Autauga County.
