SAN FRANCISCO — Over the past five years, Andrey Doronichev has shared his four-story town house with nearly 100 entrepreneurs, investors and other aspiring technologists from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.
Because they spoke Russian, they thought they had a private key that could unlock resources most Silicon Valley technologists could not. As investors, they had the inside track on startups in Kyiv. As entrepreneurs, they could hire engineers in Moscow or raise money from a network of Russian-speaking investors across Asia, Europe and the United States.
