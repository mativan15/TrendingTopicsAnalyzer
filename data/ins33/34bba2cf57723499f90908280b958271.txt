Haas principal Guenther Steiner believes that rather than adding more grands prix, Formula 1 should make sprint races more frequent.

2021 was the first time that Formula 1 introduced sprint races into the race weekend format, adding a 100km race on a Saturday at three rounds of the season, forming the grid for Sunday's main grand prix. Traditional qualifying came forward to Friday to determine the sprint grid.
