Mr Kirk, who is responsible investment chief in HSBC's asset management division, made his comments on climate change in a speech at a Financial Times conference. The speech was titled "Why investors need not worry about climate risk".
He said in the presentation that 'there's always some nut job telling me about the end of the world' and argued that doom-laden climate predictions were using up resources and were unlikely to come true.
One slide in the presentation said: "Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong".
