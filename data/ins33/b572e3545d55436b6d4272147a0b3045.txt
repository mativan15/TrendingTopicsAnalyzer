Joseph Kosinski has quietly established himself as Hollywood's top director of sequels that were 30 years in the making. The success of 'Top Gun: Maverick' currently has him on top of the world, but it was not the first time he updated a 1980s classic for contemporary audiences. In 2010, Kosinski made his directorial debut with 'Tron: Legacy,' Disney's sequel to 1982's 'Tron.'

The film was polarizing, but its status among cinephiles has grown in recent years. Its dazzling special effects and unique creative choices (such as hiring Daft Punk to write the score), have turned the film into something of a cult classic.
