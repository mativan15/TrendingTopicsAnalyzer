HONOLULU — Toddi Nakagawa, who lives in a suburb of Honolulu, has spent years battling her family's high electricity bills, which once topped $500 a month, by gradually buying more solar panels. After accumulating more than 70 panels and three stacks of batteries, she has gotten her family's monthly bill down to just $26.

Nakagawa is not alone. Nearly one-third of Hawaii's single-family houses have rooftop solar panels — more than twice the percentage in California — and officials expect many more homes to add panels and batteries in the coming years.
