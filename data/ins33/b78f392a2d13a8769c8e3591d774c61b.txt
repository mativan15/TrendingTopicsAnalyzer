Published: 11:25 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 11:25 EDT, 16 October 2022 Two-time Australian Open champion Matt Jones has scoffed at suggestions LIV Golf is a series of "exhibition" tournaments after a hot, humid and "brutal" final round of the latest event in Saudi Arabia was won by Brooks Koepka. The 42-year old Jones has competed in all seven LIV Golf tournaments and following his final round at Royal Greens and Country Club on Sunday bemoaned the judgement of "keyboard warriors". "I would say don't speak until you've come out here and experienced it," Jones told AAP Sport.
