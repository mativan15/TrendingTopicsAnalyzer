(Bloomberg) With Liz Truss stepping down after a term in office that was shorter than her leadership campaign, the UK is once again in the market for a new prime minister.Truss said during her resignation speech on Thursday that the party aims to choose her successor within a week and that she will stay on as prime minister until then. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt became the first cabinet member to rule himself out of the contest. Truss's successor will be party's fifth premier in less than seven years and will have the unenviable task of trying to rebuild a political party that is currently languishing more than 30 points behind the opposition Labour Party in the polls.
