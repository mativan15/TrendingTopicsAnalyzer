Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale hailed its "outstanding" defence on Sunday as it kept host Leeds United at bay to secure a 1-0 win that kept it top of the Premier League.Bukayo Saka's 35th-minute goal proved the winner, with Arsenal marking its best start to a top-flight season with nine wins from 10 games."As a whole, we were outstanding defensively. A 1-0 win away from home at Leeds is a really tough ask and we've done that," Ramsdale said.
"Of course we want to win 3-0 each week, passing the ball, but we found a way to win today and that's the most important thing.
