It's been a strange week for the Yankees with an off day between Games 1 and 2 of the ALDS and a rainout that delayed Game 2 by another 24 hours. Now they're in Cleveland to face the Guardians with the series tied 1-1.

The Yankees and the Guardians somehow manage to end up facing one another in the postseason on a semi-regular basis. The two last met in the postseason in 2020, in 2017 and then a decade before that in the infamous midge series in 2007.

It's almost always a similar narrative: The dominant, historic team in pinstripes against the upstart team that no one thought would make it this far.
