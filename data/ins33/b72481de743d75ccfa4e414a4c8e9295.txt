brightstars/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesInvestors might want to consider investing in Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU) as a bargain opportunity. Based on fundamentals, there are no evident reasons why the stock should trade at a steep discount to book value of approximately 50%. In this article, I value SOHU based on a Residual Earnings framework. I apply analyst consensus estimates until 2025, a WACC of 9% and a terminal value growth rate equal to nominal GDP growth. My calculation implies that SOHU is currently >30% undervalued, based on a base-case target price of $19.
