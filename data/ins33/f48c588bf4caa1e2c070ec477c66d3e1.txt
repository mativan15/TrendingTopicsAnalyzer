Despite the sheer number of Southland war memorials Ann Robbie has already restored, she believes she will never run out of them. Her passion for restoration began in the 1970s when she was learning bagpipes. She would see the memorials in all sorts of places, like halls, and got intrigued about what they were. Then, in the 1990s, when she discovered none of them had been documented, she decided to do something about it. 'I got inquisitive – some were in disrepair, so I started to restore them.'
