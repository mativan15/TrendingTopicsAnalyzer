Riot-damaged corridors in Minneapolis, including Lake Street, will receive another $10 million infusion of grants to help rebuild the important commercial arteries.

With the announcement Thursday, grants and other economic aid for the arteries hit during the riots in the days following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020 totals about $100 million, about half of the uninsured losses.

The new Main Street revitalization grants, administered by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, will help 20 small businesses and nonprofits finish redevelopment projects.
