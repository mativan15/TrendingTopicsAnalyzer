HOUSTON — Josh Donaldson recorded his first extra-base hit of these playoffs on Thursday.
The remainder of his night looked more like the rest of his postseason.
Besides a double in his first at-bat, Donaldson had another tough night, striking out twice and walking in the ninth inning of the Yankees' 3-2 loss to the Astros in Game 2 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park.
In seven playoff games, Donaldson is now batting 5-for-22 with six walks and 11 strikeouts. Two of those hits came in Game 1 of the ALDS, but it has mostly been downhill since then for the veteran third baseman, including striking out multiple times in five straight games.
