If, like me, you're somebody that loves Halloween — then Xbox Game Pass has loads of new scary titles up for grabs. Plenty of non-spooky stuff as well for the cowards out there. Not that I'm passing judgment or anything!
Several more games will arrive on Xbox Game Pass over the next few weeks. Of course, you'll need an active membership to pick any of these up. I'll list the release dates and available platforms for every title below. All information comes directly from Xbox Wire. Oct. 20

Amnesia: Collection (console, cloud, and PC)
Amnesia: Rebirth (console, cloud, and PC)
Soma (console, cloud, and PC)
Phantom Abyss (preview) (cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S)
