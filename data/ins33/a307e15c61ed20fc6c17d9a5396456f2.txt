What I am looking at May 31, 2022 After stocks jumped more than 6% last week, we are 18 price to earnings. Bull in a bear market. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson stays bearish—hard to stop Fire and Ice. Higher inflation and slower growth. Earnings revisions on verge of going negative. Declines in forward EPS. Don't sound all-clear in stocks just yet. Oil and gas: U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude goes to $119 and stocks get clobbered. Natural gas at $9, up $6 from a year ago. Coal prices are even higher.
