WASHINGTON (HILL) — John Legend, 43, says he's 'frustrated' by Democrats who want to increase law enforcement funding, saying more money won't solve policing problems across the country. 'Spending more and more on police with no upper limit is not the solution,' the 'All of Me' singer said in an interview with The Guardian published Sunday. 'I'm frustrated by Democrats who believe that throwing more money at policing is going to solve these problems and are not looking at the root causes,' Legend, one of Hollywood's most outspoken Democratic supporters, said.
