Registered stock brokers can place bids on the request for quote (RFQ) debt trading platform on behalf of their clients from January 1, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular on Wednesday. RFQ is an electronic platform to enable sophisticated, multilateral negotiations to take place on a centralised online trading platform. In February 2020, the RFQ platform was introduced by stock exchanges as a ‘participant-based' model wherein all regulated entities, listed bodies corporate, institutional investors and all India financial institutions were eligible to register, access and transact.
