Oct. 18—LIVERMORE FALLS — Pat Knowlton started her wallpaper business in her basement nearly 50 years ago with just $50.

Now 79 years old, the Livermore Falls woman says she's retiring and closing the store at 50 Depot St. because no one seems interested in buying the business.

She started buying wallpaper from Liz Cloutier's store at Union and Church streets, using it in the apartments she and her husband, Wayne, owned. They had as many as 30 at one time, but that number is now down to seven, along with their residential and commercial buildings.
