By PA Media Published: 08:39 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 09:35 EDT, 18 October 2022 Workers at the Quorn factory on Teesside will begin all-out strike action this week in a row over pay. More than 60 staff at the meat-free paste production plant in Billingham are to walk out from Thursday, the Unite union said. A spokesman claimed the strikes are expected to lead to shortages of Quorn products in supermarkets. The workers have already taken nine days of strike action in October over a 4% pay offer plus a one-off payment.
