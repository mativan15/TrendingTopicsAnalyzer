Donald Trump 's political fundraising operation has been spending 91 cents on overhead expenses for every dollar it brings in, according to Federal Election Commission filings reported by Bloomberg.

Trump raised a fat $24 million in the third quarter — a 41% increase over the previous quarter — but spent $22 million to do so, the new figures show.

Raising the money apparently became far more difficult and expensive (or fundraisers were pocketing larger salaries) as troubles mount for Trump. The FBI confiscated several boxes of White House documents — including classified and top secret information — from Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound in August.
