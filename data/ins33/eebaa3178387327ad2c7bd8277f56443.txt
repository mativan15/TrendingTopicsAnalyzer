Activist investor Starboard Value announced this morning that it was taking a 'significant stake' in Salesforce, per CNBC. A presentation on Starboard's website confirmed the firm's interest in Salesforce, as well as Wix and Splunk.
The presentation looks at the company's financial situation and concludes that it could be giving investors a better return. On the positive side, Starboard likes the company's refreshed executive team with Bret Taylor as co-CEO.
It also likes Salesforce's ambitious $50 billion revenue target for fiscal year 2026, but Starboard was less pleased with Salesforce's combined growth and operating margin target of 42%.
