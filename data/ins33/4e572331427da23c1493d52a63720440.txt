While top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum boast prices of $19,000 and $1,300, respectively, you don't need to commit thousands of dollars to get started investing in crypto. In fact, there are a number of cryptos with prices below $1 that offer plenty of potential.
Bitcoin and Ethereum themselves were once less than $1, although to be clear, it's unlikely that their spectacular trajectories will be repeated anytime soon. It should be pointed out that cryptocurrencies in this price range are best suited for risk-tolerant investors and represent a high-risk, high-reward part of the market, but with that said, all three of these sub-$1 cryptos have a lot going for them and offer the potential for significant upside.
