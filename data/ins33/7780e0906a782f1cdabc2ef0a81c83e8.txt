Dhanteras holds a very special significance for all the Hindus around the world. It is celebrated two days before Diwali and people buy gold or any expensive metal on this day. Purchasing anything valuable on Dhanteras is considered to be auspicious and it is believed that Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Kuber shower more wealth upon those people who buy expensive jewellery or a gold or silver coin on this day. Dhanteras is one of the important days as, on this day, devotees seek blessings for wealth, prosperity, and longevity.
