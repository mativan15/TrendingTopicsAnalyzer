A top ally of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy loved "The Wire" so much that he gave the inspiring House Speaker an ornate silver bowl as an ode to a famous scene from the HBO show where one politician tells another that being in charge involves eating a lot of crap, according to a new book.Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry's gesture mostly missed the mark since McCarthy had never seen an episode of the acclaimed series that is often listed among the greatest TV series of all time. Nonetheless, McHenry continued to email the Republican clips of the scene that incredibly is a parable an actual politician used to tell.
