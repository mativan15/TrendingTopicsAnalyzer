Newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK Jeremy Hunt is touted to make an emergency statement to the House of Commons on Monday. The emergency statement comes as a bid to stabilize the worsening financial markets. After PM Liz Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng in her fight for survival, Jeremy Hunt was appointed as the new Chancellor. Following the announcement of the mini-budget last month, PM Liz Truss and the former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng had been under fire from the opposition and the Tories.
