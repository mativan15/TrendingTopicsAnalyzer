NEW YORK — With London's stages closed for much of the pandemic, Mark Rylance — one of the theater's most soulful actors and a leading interpreter of Shakespeare — made six films. They span a wide gamut. A tech billionaire in Adam McKay's apocalypse satire "Don't Look Up." Satan in Terrence Malick's upcoming "The Way of the Wind." Luca Guadagnino's "Bones & All." A tailor in the chamber-piece thriller "The Outfit." Rylance even acted for free in a student film. Rylance also starred in a quirky and charming sports movie: Craig Roberts' "The Phantom of the Open," which Sony Pictures Classics releases Friday in theaters.
