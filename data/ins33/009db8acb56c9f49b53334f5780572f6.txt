 RCMP are asking residents of the Kingman Estates area in Tofield, Alta., to shelter-in-place while they attend to an 'unfolding incident.'
Police were not able to provide more details on what is happening in the small town just south of Edmonton. However, they did say it is for the public's safety that those living in the neighborhood stay inside their homes, and for non-residents to stay clear of the area.
