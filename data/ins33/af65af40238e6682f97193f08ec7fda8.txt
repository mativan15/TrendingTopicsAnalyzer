In November last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk became the first person in history to obtain a $300 billion fortune. 
 A lot has happened since then. He's on the verge of buying Twitter after months of back-and-forth and reportedly plans to lay off 75% of its staff if the deal goes through. He had secret twins with one of his employees and was rumored to be having an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the soon-to-be ex-wife of Google cofounder Sergey Brin.
