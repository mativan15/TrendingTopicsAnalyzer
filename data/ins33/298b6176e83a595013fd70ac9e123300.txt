Jun. 4—Welcome Stadium's most significant renovation in nearly three-quarters of a century has already started, but the community is invited to the official groundbreaking on Wednesday where more information and renderings of the updated facility will be unveiled and shared.

The Welcome Stadium renovation project is an opportunity "that can really galvanize our community," said Will Smith, president of the Dayton Board of Education. "We want people to spend their money in Dayton, we want people to come visit Dayton, we want people to enjoy being in Dayton — but more importantly, we want to give our kids what they deserve.
