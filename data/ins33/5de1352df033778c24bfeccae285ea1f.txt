It was quite a showdown at Wednesday night's Game 2 of the National League Championship Series between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia Phillies.
 
Aaron and Austin Nola, brothers who play on different MLB teams, made history as the first pair of siblings to face off in a pitcher-batter matchup in a postseason game. Aaron is a pitcher for the Phillies and Austin plays catcher for the Padres.
 
The two have a long-standing rivalry, and this battle was no different. Though they've played each other previously in MLB games, this was the first time it happened in the postseason.
