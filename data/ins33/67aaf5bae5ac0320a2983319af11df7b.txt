NiseriN With two big debt underwriting banks posting Q3 results on Friday, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau looked at what that means for two publicly traded U.S. credit ratings firms — S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Moody's (NYSE:MCO). "After unpacking JPMorgan's (JPM) and Morgan Stanley's (MS) earnings results, we maintain our cautious view on Q322 Ratings revenues for SPGI and MCO," Lau wrote in a note. On a Y/Y basis, debt capital market revenue fell 40% at JPMorgan and 35% at Morgan Stanley. Oppenheimer's estimate for S&P Global's (SPGI) Ratings revenue was for a 32% decline, and for Moody's (MCO), a 30% drop.
