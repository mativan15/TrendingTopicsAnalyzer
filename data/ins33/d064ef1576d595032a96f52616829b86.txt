Software icon N R Narayana Murthy on Friday said IPOs have been taken as a 'surrogate' for new rounds of financing by entrepreneurs, and this approach is not a good thing.
The co-founder of IT major Infosys was speaking at the ‘India Global Innovation Connect', a global conference on startups.
'IPOs have somehow been taken as a surrogate for the next round of financing. I think that's not a good thing because an IPO comes with tremendous responsibility,' Murthy said.
