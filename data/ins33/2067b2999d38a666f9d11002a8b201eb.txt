Some of it is currently in stock for transport and more will be produced by the Australian company in the coming weeks and months, according to the FDA. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services allowed global farm commodities trader Cargill Inc to provide raw materials needed to maximize the production of infant formula by invoking the Defence Production Act.
