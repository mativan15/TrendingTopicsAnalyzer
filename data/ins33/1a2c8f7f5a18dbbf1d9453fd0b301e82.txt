It's hard to say which part of the Matt Murray's early-season sidelining is more alarming for the Maple Leafs.

Maybe it's that Murray, the goaltender brought aboard in the off-season despite a lengthy and varied history of injury, couldn't make it through the morning skate of what was to be his second start of the season Saturday, limping off the ice with a groin injury that will keep him out of the lineup at least 10 games.

Or maybe it's that Murray, even when he seemed perfectly healthy in Wednesday's season-opening loss in Montreal, looked less than impressive in his Leafs debut, and not only because he allowed four goals on 23 shots to the team that finished last in the league last season.
