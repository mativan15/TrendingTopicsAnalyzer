Pakistan batter Shan Masood has been taken to the hospital for scans after being hit on the head during their net session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).
Masood was hit on the right side of the head after he was struck by Mohammed Nawaz's shot. The southpaw was on the ground for a long time before he was taken to the hospital.
Shan Masood has performed in patches at No 3 since making his T20 debut at home against England last month. He was competing with Fakhar Zaman, who has recovered from knee injury, to be Pakistan' No 3.
