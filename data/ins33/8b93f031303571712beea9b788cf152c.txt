Vertigo3d In my opinion, The United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSEARCA:UNG) should only be held as a trade for short to medium time frames. Over the long run, the monthly rolling of futures has a large negative impact on the Fund's NAV. In terms of natural gas fundamentals, the upcoming restart of Freeport LNG could be the positive catalyst needed to spur a natural gas price rally. However, weather remains a wildcard, as September and October have been unseasonably warm. We will need to see weather patterns normalize into November to get bullish on UNG.
