Co-op customer director Ali Jones has left the convenience retailer, having held the position since January 2018.

Following her departure, Jones told Marketing Week that it was 'time for a new challenge', although is yet to say what this will be.

Speaking of her five years at Co-op, she said: 'It's been hugely exciting to broaden Co-op's appeal, bringing increased energy and relevance to our brand and especially in attracting more younger members to the business. With stores at music festivals, including Glastonbury, we've reimagined the Co-op.
