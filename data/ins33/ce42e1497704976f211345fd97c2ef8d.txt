Commencement season is underway, and many top business schools have held in-person graduation ceremonies for MBA students for the first time since the pandemic struck. But what's also worth celebrating is the great return on investment that these new grads are already seeing. The University of Virginia's Darden School of Business, which Fortune ranks as having the No. 14 full-time MBA program in the U.S., announced in May that its class of 2022 MBA graduates saw a 21% jump in their starting median base salaries compared with the 2021 class.
