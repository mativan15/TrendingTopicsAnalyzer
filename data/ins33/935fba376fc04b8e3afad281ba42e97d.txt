The Florida jury that awarded Hulk Hogan $140 million from Gawker for posting a tape of him having sex wanted to give him even more.
Florida is a funny place.
The six jurors involved in the case told ABC News on Thursday that it came down to Hogan, despite being a celebrity, was still a human being.
'If we were all in the same circumstance, how would we feel about it?' said Paula Eastman. 'And, emotionally, we would have all been pretty devastated.' Right. The lesson here is: when having sex with your best friends spouse, make sure no one is videotaping it.
