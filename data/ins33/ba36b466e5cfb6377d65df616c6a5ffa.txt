What qualifies you to hold this position? As a Realtor, small business owner, and a single mother for many years, I know what it takes to be successful: hard work, determination, compromise, effective communication, and commitment. With this, along with my education and political experience, I feel well-suited to become your next MN State Senator.

What would your top priorities be if elected? Minnesota deserves better. As your next State Senator, I will work to improve our economy by eliminating reckless spending and taxation, and will focus on safety, education and the well-being of our neighborhoods.
