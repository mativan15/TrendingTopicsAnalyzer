Oct. 21—SCRANTON — About 100 local high school and college students Thursday learned about the work the United Nations does to support peace, dignity, equality and a healthy planet.

The students participated in the annual United Nations Day program at St. Mary's Center sponsored by the Northeastern Pennsylvania Chapter of the United Nations Association and led by Elizabeth Bonczar.

Keynote speaker Michael Fairbanks, an international development specialist and University of Scranton alumnus who worked in several countries devastated by war and genocide, urged students to work to become strong leaders driven by a moral purpose.
