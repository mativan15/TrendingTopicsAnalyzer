enot-poloskun/iStock via Getty Images Incannex Healthcare (NASDAQ:IXHL), an Australia-based developer of medicinal cannabinoids, has surged ~20% in the pre-market Friday after the company announced favorable results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for IHL-42X, an experimental drug for obstructive sleep apnoea. The trial designed to evaluate IHL-42X versus placebo cut the primary endpoint apnoea hypopnea index (AHI) – a key measure to diagnose and monitor OSA – relative to baseline for all three doses, the company said.
