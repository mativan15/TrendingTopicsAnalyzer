Nature/iStock via Getty Images Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) shares jumped on Tuesday after investment firm Truist upgraded the satellite television company, noting that it has the potential to become a "nationwide" mobile carrier and compete with the likes of Verizon (VZ), AT&T (T) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Analyst Greg Miller upgraded DISH (DISH) shares to buy from neutral and boosted the per-share price target to $60 from $25, implying a more than 150% upside from current levels, noting that investors are starting to understand the company's plans despite the lack of detail provided at its investor day earlier this month.
