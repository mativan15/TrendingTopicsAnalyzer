Bollywood beauty Shilpa Shetty's husband Raj Kundra, who is currently out on bail in a porn-related case, has once again taken a dig at the 'trolls'. The businessman took to his social media handle and shared a tweet which read, 'Trolls, where are you all slowly vanishing, please don't leave me.' His tweet didn't get much reactions, but there were a few who trolled the actor for his tweet and left comments like, 'With only 20 likes i think it's pretty clear, it's not the trolls but the fame which is vanishing!!', 'why are you worried, don't you have your own porn collection.
