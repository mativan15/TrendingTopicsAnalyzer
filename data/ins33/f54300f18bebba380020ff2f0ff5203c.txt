'Everything we do has been approved by the Legislature,' Gov. Kathy Hochul dodged Saturday in 'answer' to The Post's front-page story exposing the near-$1 billion taxpayer-money slush fund at her sole disposal. 
She's using it to announce 'surprise' projects across the state in the runup to Election Day, winning happy local coverage without officially 'campaigning' and surrounded by smiling local pols who might otherwise avoid being seen with her.
Her growing shamelessness continues to astound. As we've already noted, getting the Legislature to OK the unprecedented, zero-oversight fund (in a shady 11th-hour addition to the state budget that hornswoggled even Albany insiders) required major horse-trading.
