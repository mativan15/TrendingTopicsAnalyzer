British inflation jumped back above 10 percent in September on soaring food prices, official data showed on Wednesday, with the country gripped by a cost-of-living crisis.
The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) accelerated to 10.1 percent on an annual basis, up from 9.9 percent in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.
The September rate matched the level in July and is the highest in 40 years also as a result of sky-high energy bills.
Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices were the biggest driver of inflation in September as they rose by 14.
