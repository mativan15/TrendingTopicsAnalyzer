By Australian Associated Press Published: 13:35 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 13:35 EDT, 30 May 2022 Lawyers assisting the NSW gambling regulator's inquiry into Star casino are to make their closing submissions after months of damning evidence. The probe examined allegations that Star enabled suspected money laundering, organised crime, fraud and foreign interference at its Sydney casino. It was told there was a culture that fostered illegal behaviour, including keeping executives in the dark about concerns inside the casino, hiding reports from the regulator and lying to banks.
