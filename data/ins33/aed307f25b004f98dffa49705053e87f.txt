sankai Markets were rather volatile last week. That's a wild understatement and what passes for sarcasm in the investment business. Stocks started the week waiting with bated (baited?) breath for the inflation reports of the week. It isn't surprising that the market is focused firmly on the rearview mirror for clues about the future since Jerome Powell has made it plain that is his plan.

A hotter-than-expected PPI didn't change things much on Wednesday because through hundreds of speeches about inflation over the summer, no one at the Fed has mentioned PPI.
