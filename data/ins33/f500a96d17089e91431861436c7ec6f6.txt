The US State Department is preparing to officially launch its online passport renewal system to all Americans. Before it goes full steam, the MyTravel.gov website is launching monthly pilot programs for people willing to test out the online renewal system.The pilot program for October is currently open, but you'll need to act soon -- the first testing period in August filled the available 25,000 slots in 10 days.

 The online passport renewal system stems from an executive order from President Joe Biden stating, "the Secretary of State shall design and deliver a new online passport renewal experience that does not require any physical documents to be mailed"The agency accepted 25,000 applications in both August and September, so it's likely that it will accept the same amount in October.
