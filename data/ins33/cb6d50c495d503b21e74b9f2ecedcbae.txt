Rising energy costs have prompted Revenue to give businesses an extra 16 months to pay off almost €2.6 billion in Covid-era debt.Businesses owe Revenue €2.58 billion in debt built up or 'warehoused' since 2020 under a scheme to aid them in weathering the pandemic storm.The State's tax collector said on Monday that it would extend the deadline for repayment of this money to May 1st 2024, from an original due date of January 1st next, or May next year for organisations already due extensions.This means that businesses now have until May 1st 2024 to pay off the warehoused taxes they owe or to agree a phased repayment deal with the State.
