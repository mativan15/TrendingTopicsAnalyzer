June 5th is World Environment Day, and Samsung invites people to continue making everyday changes that have a meaningful impact. This year, that means providing a #DramaFreeDropOff that lets people responsibly say goodbye to electronics they are no longer in love with. While it is difficult to part ways with your first phone or the controller you used to win your favorite game, we want to make it a little easier. Instead of haphazardly throwing these devices into the trash to go to the landfill, you can easily recycle them at over 1,700 Samsung drop-off locations across the country to contribute to a greener future.
