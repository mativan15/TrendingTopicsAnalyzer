Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said there was an environment of "indifference" towards the use of technology in governance before 2014 due to which the poor and the middle class suffered the most. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating India's biggest drone festival in Delhi, he said the enthusiasm being seen in India about drone technology is amazing and indicates possibilities of an emerging sector of employment generation.

He said eight years ago "we started implementing new mantras of good governance".
