Traditional fish and chip shops are looking to Norway to help them survive the threats to their business caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.They have warned that a third of chippies may have to close if sanctions on fish from Russia add to the the pressure they are under from shortages of sunflower oil, flour and potato fertiliser.About 40 per cent of the fish they use comes from Russian fleets but ministers are planning a 35 per cent tariff on white fish from Russia as part of the latest sanctions imposed on the Kremlin.
