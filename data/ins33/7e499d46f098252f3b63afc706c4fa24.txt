The New York Rangers have the Tampa Bay Lightning on the ropes. And unlike the first two rounds, in which the Blueshirts benefited from some puck luck and going up against suspect goaltending, the two wins over the Bolts were no-doubters. 
Through the first 14 games of the postseason, the Rangers struggled to keep up with their opponents at 5-on-5, relying on goalie Igor Shesterkin and their power play to keep them in contests. That hasn't been the case through the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals.
