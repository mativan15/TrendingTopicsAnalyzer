After a highly volatile May, the first trading day of June was dull. The blue-chip index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dipped 0.5% and the S&P 500 Index slid 0.8% on Jun 1. Moreover, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite Index started the month by losing 0.7%.

The market is worried about the U.S. economic health and the impact of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. According to Liz Young, SoFi's head of investment strategy, 'We probably see volatility for the first half of June, and maybe a decent portion of June, because we're not going to have any new information that calms us down before then,' as mentioned in a CNBC article.
