After the Miami Dolphins released undrafted rookie running back ZaQuandre White from the practice squad on Monday, the team had an open spot to fill.

On Tuesday, they elected to fill it with another running back, La'Mical Perine. The 24-year-old spent the first two seasons of his career with the New York Jets before joining the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad earlier this year.

Perine has appeared in 14 games in his NFL career, rushing for 263 and two touchdowns on 3.7 yards per attempt and adding another 63 yards on 11 receptions.
