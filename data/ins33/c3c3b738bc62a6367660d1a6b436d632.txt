Some may already have their eye on the exit. The Tesla chief executive´s intentions, conveyed in an internal email seen by Reuters, are rooted in what he described as his "super bad feeling" about the U.S. economy. Some of the nearly 100,000 people employed at the electric carmaker may already be considering their options after Musk issued them with a return-to-office ultimatum this week.
