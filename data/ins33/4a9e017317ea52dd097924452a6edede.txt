BENGALURU/MUMBAI,Oct 20 (Reuters) - A slate of flop Bollywood movies have hit India's top cinemas hard, leaving the industry to bank heavily on the current festive quarter to revive its fortunes

Inox and PVR, the top multiplex operators in the country who reported results this week, both blamed a lack of good content for lackluster second-quarter performance, and said they are betting on the third quarter to put them back on a growth track.

"Q3 is crucial (for the companies)," said Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital.
