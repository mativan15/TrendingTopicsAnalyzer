The Government is being forced to make difficult money-saving decisions, and has faced pressure over the state pension triple lock and state pension age. 
But no matter the outcome of these debates, the Government is obliged to give public sector pensioners – its own retired employees – a pension rise of 10.1pc next year. 
This is enshrined in employment contracts – the result of the continuation of the extraordinarily generous public sector pension system. 
These gold-plated, defined benefit pensions are now generally only available to public sector workers – at extraordinary cost and unfairness to taxpayers.
