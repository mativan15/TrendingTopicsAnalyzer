STATING that over 7,600 CCTVs will be installed in Pimpri-Chinchwad, primarily to keep an eye on 'anti-social activities', Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that if a 'goon does not show improvement in behaviour even after being externed', police would slap MCOCA charges on them in order to ensure law and order.
'Law and order should remain intact in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Citizens should be able to live safely in the city. If anyone is indulging in any act of goondaism or creating terror, we will not spare him even if he belongs to any political party.
