The Wisconsin Badgers play the Michigan State Spartans on Saturday afternoon, and if you're wondering how you can watch the action live, you've come to the right place.

The Badgers will hope to take down the Spartans on the road this weekend, after dominating the Northwestern Wildcats in a 42-7 victory last week. They were finally able to get their offense moving last week, and quarterback Graham Mertz had one of the best games of his career with five passing touchdowns. Wisconsin may look again to their passing game this week since the Spartans' secondary has been abysmal in their last four games.
