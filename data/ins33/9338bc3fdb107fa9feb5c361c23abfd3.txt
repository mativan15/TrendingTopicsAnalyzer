Pasmanda Muslim meeting: The BJP's minority wing is organising a meeting of 'intellectuals' from the Pasmanda Muslim community in Lucknow on Sunday. The meeting, which according to the BJP is the first such programme for Pasmanda Muslims to be organised by a political party in the country, will be attended by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak and Minister of State in the UP government Danish Azad Ansari, who belongs to the community.
The meeting comes three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the BJP to reach out to 'the deprived and downtrodden' sections among all communities at the BJP national executive meeting in Hyderabad.
