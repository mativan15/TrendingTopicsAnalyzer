Brandishing a shotgun and outfitted in camouflage, a juvenile shooter stalked a neighborhood and then fled into the woods, bringing terror to a suburban Raleigh neighborhood.

From the late afternoon into the night, a mass shooting unfolded at a residence and its nearby streets before it made its way onto a nearby trail.

It finally culminated in a shootout and a three-hour standoff a couple miles away from where it all began in Hedingham, a large residential area in northeastern Raleigh.

A new preliminary report, released by the city Thursday afternoon, is the first official accounting of what happened that night.
