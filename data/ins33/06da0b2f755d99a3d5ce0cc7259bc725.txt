'The economy is strong as hell!' exclaimed a smug President Biden jubilantly on Saturday as he guzzled a large chocolate chip ice cream.
The eye-boggling irony of this absurdly disingenuous statement wouldn't have been lost on America's ice cream vendors who are suffering a terrible year as the price of making it has soared by 13%, driven largely by higher milk costs caused by higher dairy farming costs.
And what's behind those higher dairy farming costs?
Inflation.
The worst inflation, at 8.2%, for 40 years.
