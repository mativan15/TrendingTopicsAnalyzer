The Barilla pasta brand has found itself in some hot water over the Italian staple's city of origin.

Two customers, Matthew Sinatro and Jessica Prost, filed a lawsuit against the company after purchasing several boxes of Barilla pasta under the impression it was made in Italy. However, despite the company's slogan as "Italy's No. 1 brand of pasta," its products are produced in Iowa and New York.

With its slogan and the Italian flag on its packaging, the customers accused the brand of misleading consumers with its marketing, stating Barilla is "further perpetuating the notion that the products are authentic pastas from Italy," according to the lawsuit.
