	Controversial rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, is acquiring right-wing social network Parler.

	The deal 'ensures Parler a future role in creating an uncancelable ecosystem where all voices are welcome,' the company said in an announcement.

	Parler is among a handful of right-leaning social platforms to enter the market during and after Donald Trump's presidency. After the assault on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when Trump and many of his supporters were banned by Twitter, Parler was scrutinized for its role in the events of the day.
