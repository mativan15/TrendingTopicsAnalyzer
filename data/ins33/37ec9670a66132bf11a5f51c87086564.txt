'I'd like to see us put games to bed earlier' - Lindsey reacts to win over U's

SWINDON Town head coach Scott Lindsey paid tribute to a fast start from his team which laid the foundations for a 1-0 victory at home to Colchester United on Saturday.

Substitute Tyrese Shade shinned the ball home for the only goal of the game in the second half after a promising opening 30 minutes failed to result in a reward for the hosts.

Post-match, Lindsey admitted his only criticism was that the hosts did not score a second to kill any likelihood of a Colchester comeback.
