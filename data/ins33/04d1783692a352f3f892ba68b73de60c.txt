Almost 65 percent of India's population that resides in rural India has access to only 30 percent of the total available health infrastructure. In India, while affordability has received policy focus, in the form of price controls; the availability of medicines, especially in rural areas, has remained a matter of grave concern. 'Physical reach' is a parameter used to evaluate access and is defined as 'the presence of a pharmacy within 5 km from the place of residence or work'. Using this definition, a study in 2012 found that, in rural areas of India, 63% of people were not able to access pharma facilities within a 5 km distance.
