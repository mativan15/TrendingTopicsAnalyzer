Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, said that if wealthy households do not need the Government's £400 energy bill grant they should donate it to charity - and that is what he will be doing. 
Mr Sunak was asked by Sky News presenter Niall Paterson why he will be receiving the money when he doesn't actually need it. 
The Chancellor said: "Because, when you are trying to help people on that scale when you need to get help to tens of millions of people, actually you have got a choice, how best can you deliver that and the reality is when you are talking about that number of people there really aren't many ways to do it and we wanted to make sure that this was as universal as possible.
