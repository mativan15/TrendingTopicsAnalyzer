James Corden has addressed his restaurant behaviour and insisted he did nothing wrong.
The Late Late Show host – who is expecting to talk about the controversy on Monday's episode of his programme in the US – was banned from a New York restaurant this week for allegedly being ‘nasty' to waiting staff.
Although the actor and presenter reportedly apologised to the owner after news of his behaviour went viral and has since been unbanned, fans online are still being critical of the Gavin and Stacey star.
