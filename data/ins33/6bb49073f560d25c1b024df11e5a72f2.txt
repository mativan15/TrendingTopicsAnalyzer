Beating inflation is the priority but we need a leader who embraces freedom and free enterprise

The leadership election must provide choice over our future. 
Are we to accept the gloomy advice of the establishment that we must go into recession to purge inflation, adopting new austerity policies, or can we find a way through that both brings price rises down and allows us to expand the economy? Shouldn't we be the party of greater prosperity, wider ownership and helping people live their dreams? 
Don't we still believe that people are best able to spend their own money, and to make good choices, without ministers controlling their every move and taxing their success? Can we offer and vote for hope, or is management of decline the best we can expect?
 I want to support a candidate who knows that more freedom, free enterprise, wider ownership, opportunity and rewarding work are the paths to prosperity.
