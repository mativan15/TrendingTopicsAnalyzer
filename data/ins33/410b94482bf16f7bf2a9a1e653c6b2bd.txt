Downtown Ward 13 -Toronto Centre is one of seven wards with no incumbents running, after longtime councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam resigned in the spring. The ward contains areas such as Regent Park, St. James Town, Cabbagetown, Church and Wellesley, Ryerson University, The Toronto Eaton Centre and part of the city's financial district (the east side of Bay Street). Wong-Tam left municipal politics in April to run as an NDP candidate in June's provincial election, and subsequently won the seat for Toronto Centre.
