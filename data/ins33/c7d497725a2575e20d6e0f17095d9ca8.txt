Published: 12:23 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 12:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 Eating a handful of prunes a day may help to prevent bone loss in later life, a study suggests.Researchers at Penn State University found that women in their 60s who ate at least four to six prunes per day experienced significantly less hip bone loss than others.Scientists said the prunes may have reduced inflammation in the body, a key driver of bone loss.Older women are at higher risk of weakened bones because the menopause can raise inflammation levels in the body, increasing the risk of weakened bones.
