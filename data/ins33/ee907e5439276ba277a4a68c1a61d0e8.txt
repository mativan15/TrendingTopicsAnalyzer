A prolonged backlog in processing green cards is hindering the ability of the U.S. to compete with other nations for top tech talent, according to one Google executive.

'The ability to attract and retain talent is absolutely critical to America's technology leadership. Companies like Google depend on having green cards and visas to be able to bring in the world's best computer scientists, the best software engineers,' said Karan Bhatia, vice president of public affairs and public policy, speaking to Yahoo Finance Live.
