Llanerch bridge linked the Denbighshire villages of Trefnant and Tremeirchion until an oak tree fell on it. Villagers have since faced a round trip diversion of five miles (8km). Denbighshire council said it "understands local frustrations" but was keeping residents up to date with developments through a newsletter.
