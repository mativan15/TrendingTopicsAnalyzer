Nobody moves to a new community or opens a business because they like a municipal logo.

But logos, signs and marketing campaigns do plant an impression in people's minds. When a family considers where they are going to live, having a pre-conceived notion about a town or region plays a large part on where they are going to start looking.

Southwest Middlesex has so far spent $28,505 to help paint the picture of what they want current and possible future residents to envision when they think of the area.
