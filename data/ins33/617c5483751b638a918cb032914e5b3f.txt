About a month after it released the draft industrial policy for suggestions, the Punjab government has set in motion the process to finalise the fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to be granted to industry under the proposed ‘Punjab Industrial and Business Development-2022'. The industries and commerce department has called a meeting of top officials of 15 departments and agencies on Wednesday to discuss and firm up the new industrial policy before it is put up to the state council of ministers for approval.
