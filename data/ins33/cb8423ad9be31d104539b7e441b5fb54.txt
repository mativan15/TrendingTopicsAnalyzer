SpVVK Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been fined $162M by the Competition Commission of India for anticompetitive practices on its Android platform. Google was found to have leveraged its dominant position on Android to protect its apps such as YouTube and Chrome on the app store and online search engine. It was ordered to remedy its approach on Android and restricted from certain revenue sharing agreements with smartphone makers. India's competition regulator said these revenue sharing agreements help Google secure exclusivity for its search engines to the "total exclusion" of competitors.
