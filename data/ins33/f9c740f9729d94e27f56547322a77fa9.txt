The women's 400m Individual medley event of the 36th National Games was a pointer to the future of Indian swimming. A new star was born as the 14-year-old Hashika Ramachandra of Karnataka blitzed the field, which included 39-year-old veteran Richa Mishra. The baton was quietly passed from Richa, who had ruled the pool for two-and-a-half decades, to Hashika who was later chosen as the best women athlete of the National Games.Hashika's accession as the new star was the highpoint of the National Games swimming at Sardar Patel Aquatic Complex where everything else followed the familiar script.
