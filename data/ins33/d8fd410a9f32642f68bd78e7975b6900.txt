Brooks Koepka once was the most feared golfer in the world. Realizing those days have passed, the Palm Beach County native joined the LIV Golf Series, where the purses are larger and the fields are less competitive.

The move is paying off. Koepka won this week's LIV event in Jeddah, defeating fellow Jupiter resident Peter Uihlein in the third playoff hole to pocket the $4 million first place prize money. In addition, Smash GC, captained by Koepka, won the team event, adding $750,00 to Koepka's earnings.
