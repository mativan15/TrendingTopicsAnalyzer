A 17-year-old restaurant worker thwarted a robbery when he tackled a man fleeing after demanding cash, Utah police reported.

Others, including a manager with a concealed carry permit, helped hold the man until officers arrived at Durango's Mexican restaurant after the 9:43 p.m. incident Friday, June 3, St. George police said in a news release.

The man entered the restaurant, 'referenced a weapon' and threatened to hurt workers before demanding cash, police said.

But when he tried to leave with the stolen money, the teenage employee tackled him at the door, the release said.
