A firm that was fined for passport hotline failures this summer has landed a £322m Universal Credit calls deal. Teleperformance was fined hundreds of thousands of pounds after it was blamed for this summer's passport shambles. The French firm was slammed after at its worst half of the calls were not answered and other people were kept on hold for five hours. But despite this pedigree, the firm has won a massive new deal to handle calls from benefits claimants. Universal Credit demand is forecast to escalate as thousands of families struggle for cash during the cost-of-living crisis.
