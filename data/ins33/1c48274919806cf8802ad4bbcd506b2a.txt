DUBLIN, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The "GPS Equipment Global Market Report 2022, By Product Type, End-Use, Industry, Application" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
The global GPS equipment market is expected to grow from $2.20 billion in 2021 to $2.38 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5%. The growth is mainly due to the companies resuming their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges.
