AvigatorPhotographer/iStock via Getty Images Note: I have covered Performance Shipping (NASDAQ:PSHG) previously, so investors should view this as an update to my earlier articles on the company. After a couple of very weak quarters, the fallout from the Russian assault on Ukraine has resulted in tanker charter rates increasing materially. Last month, small Greece-based Aframax tanker operator Performance Shipping managed to fix its vessel "Blue Moon" for up to six months at a gross charter rate of $37,750 per day, more than 300% above levels witnessed at the beginning of the year.
