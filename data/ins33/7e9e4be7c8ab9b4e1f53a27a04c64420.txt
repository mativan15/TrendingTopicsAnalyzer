GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Top-ranked North Carolina is the favorite to win the Atlantic Coast Conference, while Tar Heels big man Armando Bacot is the preseason pick for league player of the year.

The Tar Heels received 90 of 101 first-place votes in the poll released Tuesday from media members during last week's preseason league media day in Charlotte. Seventh-ranked Duke was second. The Tar Heels return four starters after reaching the NCAA championship game in coach Hubert Davis' debut season.

Bacot's 31 double-doubles last year tied the NCAA single-season record.
