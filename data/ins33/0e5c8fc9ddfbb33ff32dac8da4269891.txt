Inflation is generalised, and is here to stay, but the Reserve Bank of India will not use excessively harsh measures to restrain prices, said Governor Shaktikanta Das. The Monetary Policy Committee will increase interest rates to contain inflation, but the objective is to ensure that the market doesn't get any shocks and that growth revival is not derailed, he said. Further, rate hikes need not necessarily be endless as recent reduction in fuel taxes and ban on exports of some commodities may have a positive impact in bringing down price pressures and the geopolitical situation may also turn helpful.
