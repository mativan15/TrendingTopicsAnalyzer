Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and senior BJP leader Kuldeep Bishnoi have ruled out any strain in ties with alliance partner JJP and asserted that the state government was running smoothly. Days before BJP candidate Bhavya Bishnoi filed his nomination papers for the November 3 Adampur by-election, the JPP, which is led by former MP Ajay Singh Chautala, had expressed unhappiness over not finding any mention in the banners and posters put up as part of the campaigning. The BJP had maintained that the party at that time had not officially released any posters, banners or hoardings.
