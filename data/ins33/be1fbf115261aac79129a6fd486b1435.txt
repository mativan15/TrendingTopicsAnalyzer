Drew Angerer American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is taxiing for its earnings release on Thursday, following shortly after very positive prints from key peers Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Following those peer reports, investors will be keen to hear how the airline is able to sustain demand amid increasing macroeconomic pressures and surging airfares. This is especially the case after Delta CEO Ed Bastian touted the continued strength of consumers and increased appetite for experiences.
