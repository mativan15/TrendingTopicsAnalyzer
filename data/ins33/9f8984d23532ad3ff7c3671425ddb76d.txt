ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland and Labrador, June 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlas Salt (the 'Company' or 'Atlas' - TSXV: SALT) is pleased to report that additional results from its ground gravity survey have led to the modelling of a potential second salt dome just 3 km east of the large Fischell's Brook Salt Dome deposit (refer to May 26, 2022, news release). 'Fischell's Brook East' is consistent with the increasingly apparent district-scale salt potential of Atlas' nearly 200 sq. km land package in western Newfoundland, parts of which will form a strategic near-term 'spinout' aimed at unlocking additional shareholder value.
