There wouldn't be many who think AerSale Corporation's (NASDAQ:ASLE) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 16.5x is worth a mention when the median P/E in the United States is similar at about 15x. However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.

For example, consider that AerSale's financial performance has been poor lately as it's earnings have been in decline. It might be that many expect the company to put the disappointing earnings performance behind them over the coming period, which has kept the P/E from falling.
