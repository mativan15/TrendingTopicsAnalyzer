If you're looking for investment options that can help you retire a millionaire, it's going to be helpful if you're still more than 25 years away from signing off on your last day of employment. First, there's far more stress involved if you get a late start (64% of people start to save for retirement in their 20s or 30s). Second, that timeframe gives you plenty of time to strategize and put a retirement plan in place. 
When developing that retirement plan, most investors will be better off going with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as an alternative to picking individual stocks.
