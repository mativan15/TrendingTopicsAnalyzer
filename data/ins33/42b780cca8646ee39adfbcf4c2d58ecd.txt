For the first time, the series is promoting and selling tickets for a Grand Prix. After a 40-year absence, Las Vegas returns to the calendar in 2023. The November 16-18 event will have a unique Saturday night start, at 10, for 50 laps of a 3.8-mile (6.1km) circuit that includes the Strip. In May, Liberty Media Corporation, which owns F1, spent US$240 million ($424 million) on 39 acres to the east of the Strip to build a pit, paddock and hospitality complex.
