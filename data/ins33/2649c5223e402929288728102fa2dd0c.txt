​Jailed opposition politician Alexey Navalny said Russian authorities filed new charges against him for promoting 'terrorism and extremism', potentially leading to a prison term of 30 years – double his original sentence.
Navalny, the most prominent domestic critic of President Vladimir Putin, is already serving more than 11 years for fraud, contempt of court and parole violations, all of which he rejects as trumped-up charges intended to silence him.
'I received an official notification that a new criminal case has been initiated against me for propagating extremism, calling for terrorism, financing extremist activity and rehabilitating Nazism,' Navalny said on Thursday.
