New Zealand has bid its farewell to grandiloquent memos and sesquipedalian documents, passing a new law to banish jargon and complex language from its bureaucracy.The Plain Language Act, which requires officials to use plain, easily understood language when communicating with the public, passed its third reading on Wednesday night. The government says it will make for a more inclusive democracy, particularly for people who speak English as a second language, people with disabilities, and those with lower levels of education.
