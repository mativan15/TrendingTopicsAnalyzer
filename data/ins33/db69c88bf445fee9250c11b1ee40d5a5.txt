An affiliate of Piazza Management is proposing an expansive mixed-use development in King of Prussia that calls for hundreds of new apartments, a parking garage and tripling the size of an existing office building.

Late developer and car dealership owner Vince Piazza acquired the 18.14-acre property at 1100 First Ave. in 2016 under an entity called Royale Gardens. At the time, Piazza, who died last year at the age of 89, described the deal as a 'rare and unique opportunity" to find a developable site of that size in the "heart of King of Prussia.
