Things have just felt different at Colorado ever since interim head coach Mike Sanford took over for the excused Karl Dorrell.
Much like a heart defibrillator, Sanford's energy has shocked the out-of-rhythm Buffaloes into a newfound gear. It was exactly what the team needed and his impact was obvious in Saturday's 20-13 win over Cal. The Buffs waved rally towels on the sidelines, raced to the other end of the field during quarter changes and brought new life into Folsom Field.

Now, it's only been two weeks and a home win over Cal isn't exactly monumental, but something in my gut just tells me that Sanford is worth considering for the full-time head job.
