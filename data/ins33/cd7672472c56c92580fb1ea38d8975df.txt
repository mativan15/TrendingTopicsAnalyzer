Elon Musk has been called out over posting a screenshot of an article without crediting the source, leading to an online breakdown.
The world's richest man, Elon Musk, posted a snippet of a Zodiac Killer comedy article to his Twitter earlier this week, without saying where it came from – which has raised the question of properly crediting creators online.
After posting the tweet, the editor of the website it came from asked why any reference to the publication had been cut out of the headline. Musk retorted that it was a ‘6/10' joke and to ‘get off the high horse'.
