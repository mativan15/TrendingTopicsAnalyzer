Under the Friday night TV lights and locked in a tight political battle, Georgia's Senate candidates debated for the first, and likely, only time. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and former football star and Republican nominee Herschel Walker met in Savannah, Georgia, on Friday, just three days before the start of early in-person voting. The candidates sparred on the economy, abortion, and Herschel Walker got reprimanded by one of the moderators for using what she described as a "prop."
