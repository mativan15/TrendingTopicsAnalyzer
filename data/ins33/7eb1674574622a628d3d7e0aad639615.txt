The day is finally here. June 2. When the Raiders get the largest windfall in the NFL in terms of available money to spend under the 2022 salary cap.
The post-June 1 cut designations for Cory Littleton and Carl Nassib have landed some $19.75 in salary cap room for the Raiders that is now officially available to them as of today — June 2.
That money brought them from bottom three in the league among available cap money to top three…just like that.
With some $22.5 million in cap space now, the only two teams that currently have more cap space than the Raiders according to overthecap.
