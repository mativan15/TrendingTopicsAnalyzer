The number of students on the Calicut University campus will be raised to 5,000 in the next three years, Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj has said. Addressing a press conference on the campus on Wednesday, he said an International Centre for Academic Research and Collaboration would be set up to attract foreign students. Discussions are on with multinational companies to have a two-year M.S. (by research) course. One-year courses in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning will be launched next year in association with Tata Consultancy Services.
