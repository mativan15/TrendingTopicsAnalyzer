(Bloomberg) -- UK government bonds surged and the pound rallied on investors' expectations the government could further depart from the expansive fiscal strategy that plunged markets into turmoil.

The yield on 10-year gilts fell as much as 26 basis points to 4.07%, while pound traded 0.8% higher on the day against the dollar at $1.1261. Newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is set to give a statement Monday morning on measures to support fiscal sustainability, in advance of the medium-term fiscal plan slated for the end of the month.
