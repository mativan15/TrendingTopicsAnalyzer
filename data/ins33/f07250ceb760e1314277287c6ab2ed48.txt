Plans for a mayoral-led delegation to travel to Missoula and the Netherlands weeks after October's local body elections have been stymied by Palmerston North city councillors. They had been asked to approve travel overseas for the mayor, Grant Smith or whoever wins the election, but nine councillors voted against it. The majority said the mayor should be in the city so soon after the elections, setting up council committees, appointing a deputy mayor, and ensuring the new council team was up and running.
