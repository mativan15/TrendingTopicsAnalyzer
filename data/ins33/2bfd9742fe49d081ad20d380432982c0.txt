CLAIM: The United States military is invading Haiti.

AP'S ASSESSMENT: False. While the U.S. and Mexico said Monday that they are preparing a U.N. resolution that would authorize an international mission to help improve security in Haiti, no such deployment has happened. The U.S. and Canada have sent armored vehicles and other supplies to aid the Haitian police.

THE FACTS: Haiti has been gripped by rising food and fuel prices, issues that have been exacerbated by political instability and protests, with many calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry.
