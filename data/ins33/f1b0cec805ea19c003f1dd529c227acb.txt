Jun. 3—A Carthage man charged with murder in the shooting death of Jonathan Powell more than two years ago at a storage business in Joplin has been ordered to stand trial on a separate vehicle tampering charge.

Mason S. Roach, 26, was scheduled for a preliminary hearing in Jasper County Circuit Court on counts of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in connection with the slaying of Powell on Dec. 18, 2019, as well as on a stolen vehicle charge he picked up before his arrest in the slaying case.
