Stellantis NV 's Chinese partner says it was blindsided by the European automaker's suggestion that it may end manufacturing in the world's biggest car market.

Speaking at the Paris auto show earlier this week, Stellantis Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares said the producer of Peugeot and Citroën cars may implement an 'asset-light' strategy for those brands in China, repeating a phrase he used earlier in the year to describe his decision to pull out from the company's only Jeep plant in the country.
