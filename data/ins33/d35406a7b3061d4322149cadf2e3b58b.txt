A woman is fed up because her husband's dog has left them hungry and broke.

She told her story on Reddit's 'Am I the A******? (AITA)' forum. Four months ago, her mother-in-law bought her husband a $1,200 dog the couple could not afford. He refused to rehome the dog, despite its behavioral and medical issues.

Things escalated when he spent $650 and overdrew their account by $200 to take the dog to an emergency vet after she warned him not to. The dog was just 'high' from the husband's friend smoking cannabis nearby.
