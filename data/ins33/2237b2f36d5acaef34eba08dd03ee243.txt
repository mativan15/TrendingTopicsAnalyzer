Mumbai: The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court on Monday rejected the bail plea of Nihal Garware of Garware Industries, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) a few months ago. The case pertained to irregularities in a deal to purchase a property in Mumbai for the Jammu and Kashmir Bank. The detailed order will become available in due course. Garware was arrested by the ED on March 22 this year on charges of money-laundering, as the agency suspected that he was instrumental in buying a property for the bank in Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai in 2010 at an exorbitant price.
