Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has no plans to rest Bukayo Saka anytime soon as he looks to propel him among the world's 'top players'. Saka has played a pivotal role in Arsenal's stellar season so far, so much so that Arteta has started fielding questions about when he's going to get a day off.The 21-year-old winger has featured in all 14 games so far, scoring five goals and providing four assists. He's started all 10 Premier League outings, playing at least 80 minutes in each as Arsenal claimed 27 points from a possible 30 to sit four points clear of Manchester City at the summit.
