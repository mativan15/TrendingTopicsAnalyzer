Sydney — 
Australia has announced plans to fast-track multi-billion-dollar renewable energy projects in the states of Victoria and Tasmania. They include offshore wind farms and undersea transmission cables. Australia has for the first time a legislated target to cut greenhouse gas output that aims to reduce carbon emissions by 43% by 2030. 
Australia's center-left government has said its renewable power will help the 'rewiring the nation.'
The pledge includes the 'rapid' development of the offshore wind industry in the state of Victoria.
