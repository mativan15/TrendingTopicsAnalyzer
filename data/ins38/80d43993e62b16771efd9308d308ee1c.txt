Slowing the speed of traffic on McKinley Avenue is a concern as Milwaukee's downtown development spreads north, local government and business leaders agreed Tuesday at the Milwaukee Business Journal's Business of Growing Milwaukee event.

"It's a racetrack, for sure," Royal Capital Group CEO Kevin Newell said during a panel discussion facilitated by Milwaukee Business Journal editor-in-chief Mark Kass. Royal Capital's $110 million mixed-use ThriveOn King development is underway about a mile directly north of the busy street.
