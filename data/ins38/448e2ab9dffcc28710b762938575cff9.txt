(Bloomberg) -- Colombia's local bonds extended gains Tuesday after the government said it will trim planned public debt sales next year.The 2023 financial plan, to be published in December, will reduce the offering of local peso bonds known as TES, as the government seeks to become less dependent on borrowing to fund its spending, Public Credit Director Jose Roberto Acosta said in an interview. The exact amount hasn't been finalized, but will be lower than the 37.5 trillion pesos ($7.9 billion) in the government's 2022 plan, he said.
