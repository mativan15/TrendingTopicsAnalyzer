Top pros have given CNBC their tips for alternative investments as stock markets continue to be volatile and indexes are seeing losing streaks week after week . "Stocks are headed for a new regime of higher volatility and lower returns," according to Tapan Datta, head of asset allocation at Aon , in an email to CNBC. "This is regardless of how the current market cycle ends — whether into a full recessionary bear market slump that could be in the 30-50% range, or whether markets find their footing soon after the near 20% fall already seen," Datta added.
