New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs was defending his government's decision to focus inflation relief on low-income earners instead of the general population, one day after announcing a new rising cost-of-living program. Wednesday's announcement included $225 for low-income individuals and $450 to families already receiving provincial low-income or housing benefits. Higgs said more than 75,000 residents would be eligible for the program and money would be sent out before the end of the month. The official opposition said a 10 cent reduction in the provincial portion of its sales tax would've made a broader impact, following similar inflation relief methods in Alberta, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador.
