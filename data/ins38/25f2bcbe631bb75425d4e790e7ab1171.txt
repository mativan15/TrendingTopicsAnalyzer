May 31—MASSENA — Massena village trustees have approved modifying the Massena Joint Recreation Commission's budget to allow for the purchase and installation of new LED lights for Bushnell Field and security cameras for Alcoa Field.

The items were not originally included in the Recreation Commission's 2021-22 budget.

"He has listed these accounts of where he would like to move the money from within his budget to cover that," Treasurer Kevin M. Felt said.

Modifications totaling $86,488 were made to 10 line items in the department's budget — arena equipment, Alcoa Field equipment, general equipment, general contractual, contingency, arena contractual, Alcoa Field summer personal services, town beach lifeguard personal services, town beach gate personal services and general playground personal services

The money would come out of a joint budget approved by both the town and village.
