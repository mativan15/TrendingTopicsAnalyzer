WillSelarep/E+ via Getty Images Since I last recommended Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) to Seeking Alpha readers as an investment opportunity in July 2020, the Long Beach, California based company's share price has barely stopped growing - at the time of writing, current price of $355 means the stock is up >90% since my note. With ~5.1m members, Molina has a ~2% share of the US healthcare market. The company is looking up at the likes of CVS Health Corp. (CVS), which has a ~5% share, Health Care Services Corporation, ~6%, Humana (HUM), ~7%, Centene Corp.
