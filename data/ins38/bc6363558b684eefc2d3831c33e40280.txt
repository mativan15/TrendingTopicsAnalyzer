Wednesday marked an extraordinary night of television following the carnage in the House of Commons and fresh calls for Prime Minister Liz Truss to resign.
In politics, it all kicked off when Suella Braverman quit as Home Secretary after an embarrassing 43 days.
Two Tory whips were later said to have resigned from their positions amid claims of bullying as MPs voted on fracking, as Ms Truss admitted in a tumultuous Prime Minister's Questions that she had ‘made mistakes' and was ‘sorry'.
But television was just as much of a clusterf*ck, with C-bombs dropping all over the place and no-nonsense takes on the state of affairs.
