A University of South Florida alum has given $6 million to the university to boost biomedical engineering efforts.

This is the largest individual gift for the school's College of Engineering, which created the biomedical engineering program in 2019. The program stemmed from a partnership with the Morsani College of Medicine, allowing the medical and engineering teams to work together to address human health issues.

'USF is the reason I have the money to give,' the anonymous donor said in a statement.
