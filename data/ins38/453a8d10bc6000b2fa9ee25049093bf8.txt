The wheat procurement target has been revised downward to 195 lakh tonnes for the current year from the earlier 444 lakh tonnes due to a fall in wheat output and increased exports. The government has procured 184.58 lakh tonnes of wheat at a MSP value of Rs 37,192.07 crore so far in the ongoing 2022-23 rabi marketing year, benefitting 17.50 lakh farmers, the Food Ministry said on Monday. Total wheat purchases made by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies are, however, much lower than the year-ago period.
