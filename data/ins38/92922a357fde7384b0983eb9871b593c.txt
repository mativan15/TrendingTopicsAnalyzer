MPs erupted in laughter in the House of Commons after the home secretary blamed disruptive climate protests on 'Guardian-reading tofu-eating wokerati'.Suella Braverman made the unusual accusation as Just Stop Oil continued to cause travel chaos by blocking roads and a major bridge over the Thames. The group has promised to cause disruption every day this month in a call for an end to new oil and gas licences.On Tuesday, activists who had climbed to the top of the Queen Elizabeth II bridge at the Dartford Crossing continued to cause disruption until they were brought down in the afternoon.
