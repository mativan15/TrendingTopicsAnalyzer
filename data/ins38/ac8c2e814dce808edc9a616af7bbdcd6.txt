FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German online bank N26 said on Thursday it would begin allowing some customers in Austria to trade cryptocurrencies, in its first foray into the asset class.

N26 said it would expand the service to clients elsewhere in the coming months and eventually facilitate the trade of almost 200 cryptocurrencies.

The Berlin-based bank has teamed up with Austria's Bitpanda for the trades and custody of coins, but Bitpanda doesn't have a licence for Germany, a hurdle for N26 offering the service in its home market.
