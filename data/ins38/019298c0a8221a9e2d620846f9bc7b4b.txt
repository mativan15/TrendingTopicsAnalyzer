A young and popular model in Nepal was 16 years old when she was called to an after party of a beauty pageant, given a soft drink spiked with sedatives, raped allegedly by the organiser of the event, and filmed naked. She woke up with blood on herself and on the sheets. The six months that followed were a nightmare. 'I wanted to die,' the model says in a series of TikTok videos on 18 May, describing the months of trauma she endured in 2014 when the owner of an education consultancy allegedly spiked her lemonade, raped and injured her in a hotel room, took her nude photos and then went on to blackmail her into sex with him, and as well as with his friend as he watched.
