Families in the Greater Victoria School District (SD61) are celebrating after fundraising efforts saved the district's elementary school strings music program from being cut next year. With the school district facing a $7.2-million deficit in its upcoming budget, SD61 had planned to cut the program, but parents and community members raised the $208,000 required to save the program from being lost. The school board accepted the funds after much debate on Monday evening. "We're very excited," said Karin Kwan, chair of the group Advocacy for Music in Schools (AMIS).
