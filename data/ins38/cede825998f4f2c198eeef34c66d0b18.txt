PTISamajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav.The bypolls to two Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh -- Azamgarh and Rampur -- have put the Samajwadi Party in a tight spot. Samajwadi Pary had won both, Azamgarh and Rampur, seats in 2019. While Akhilesh Yadav won Azamgarh, Mohd Azam Khan won Rampur.

Both the leaders resigned from their parliamentary seats after winning the Assembly elections in March this year. In the upcoming by-elections, the BJP and BSP seem to have joined hands to make the SP bite dust in Azamgarh, which has a sizeable Muslim and Yadav population and is known as an SP stronghold.
