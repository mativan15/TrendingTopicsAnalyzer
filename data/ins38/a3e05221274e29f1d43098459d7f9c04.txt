Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said on Monday that it remains to be seen if quarterback Dak Prescott will return to action in this week's game against the Lions, but there are plenty of signs that this is the week his thumb is well enough for him to play.

Prescott said he expects to play and head coach Mike McCarthy said that the quarterback is going to receive his final medical clearance ahead of practice on Wednesday, which sets him up for a full week of work before Sunday.
