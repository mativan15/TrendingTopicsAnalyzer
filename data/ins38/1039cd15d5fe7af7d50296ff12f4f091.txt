Republican House candidates had gained an edge in the final weeks leading to the midterm election as economic worries overtook abortion rights as voters' top concern, according to a new poll.
The New York Times/Siena College survey released Monday found that 49% of likely voters indicated they would vote for a GOP congressional candidate compared to 45% who planned on pulling the lever for a Democrat — a three-point lead when adjusted for mathematical rounding.
The poll marked a distinct shift from the outlets' previous survey last month, which found that Democrats had a one-point advantage in the midterms as they looked to hold onto their control of the House.
