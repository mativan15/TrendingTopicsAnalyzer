Oct. 16—The Federal Reserve announced underwhelming September results from their efforts to combat inflation Thursday as Norman business owners continue to budget for increased costs.

Of the 550 small business owners surveyed by online finance company Kabbage in September, 75% say inflationary pressure has affected their bottom line this past year.

Business owners are seeing little relief from skyrocketing prices as inflation increased .4% in September, according to the latest consumer price index data released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
