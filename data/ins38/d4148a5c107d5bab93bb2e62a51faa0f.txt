The voice actress of Bayonetta, the namesake of the globally popular video game, has pleaded with fans to boycott the game after revealing they offered to pay her an 'insulting' amount.  Hellena Taylor, from the U.K., posted an emotional video to her social media account explaining that she would not be voicing the character in the third game in the series after she hit back when they offered her only $4,000 for the role.  'As an actor I trained for a total of seven-and-a-half years – three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts with voice coach Barbara Berkery, and four-and-a-half years with the legendary Larry Moss in Los Angeles,' she said.
