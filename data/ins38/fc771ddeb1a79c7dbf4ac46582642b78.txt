The city unveiled Mayor Eric Adams' controversial tent city on Tuesday — detailing how migrants staying there will be given three meals a day, fluff-and-fold laundry service and an array of entertainment including TV and video games.
'This is a place people can come, rest, relax and kick their feet up after the journey they have been on,' Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol told reporters at the facility on Randall's Island.
An initial wave of 500 single men is slated to start moving in on Wednesday after arriving from Texas at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.
