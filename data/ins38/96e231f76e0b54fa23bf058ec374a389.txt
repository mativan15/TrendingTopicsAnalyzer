RANCHI: The Jharkhand high court on Friday ruled that the two petitions seeking Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) inquiry against chief minister Hemant Soren in connection with the alleged irregularities in the grant of mining leases and transactions of some shell companies are maintainable and the bench will now proceed with hearings on the merit of the petitions. Two public interest litigations (PILs) have been filed against Soren and his family members. One pertains to stone mining lease granted by Soren to himself in 2021, which he surrendered in February 4 this year.
