Asset managers that were actively investing in cryptocurrency markets in the bull market of 2020/21 continue to invest in the sector and remained committed to digital assets, with some planning to allocate more capital, brokerage firm Bernstein said in a research report Monday.

Private market investors continue to look for opportunities in the space, 'albeit being way more valuation sensitive,' the report said. Therefore, 'crypto converts' remain active in the sector, but those investors who were ambivalent about digital assets in late 2021 have delayed their plans.
