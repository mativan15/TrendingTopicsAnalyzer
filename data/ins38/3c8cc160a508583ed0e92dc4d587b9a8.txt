It's been a wild day for fintech stocks. Shares of Upstart Holdings (UPST 0.04%), PayPal Holdings (PYPL 0.10%), and SoFi Technologies (SOFI 0.10%) started the trading day making significant gains, as a handful of banks released better-than-expected quarterly results this week. But investors reversed course by mid-afternoon and erased nearly all of the early gains the stocks had made after Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said that "we are going to keep raising rates for a while" to tamp down sky-high inflation.
