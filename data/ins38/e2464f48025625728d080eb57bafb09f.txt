Reba McEntire recently spoke out about why it was important for her to raise her son to grow up to be as humble as possible despite the wealthy lifestyle he grew up in and how she accomplished that goal.While McEntire is known worldwide as a country music legend, she made a concerted effort to make sure her son Shelby, whom she welcomed in 1990 with then-husband Narvel Blackstock, did not grow up to be unkind.
