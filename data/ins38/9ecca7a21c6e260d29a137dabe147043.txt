A former pupil of Fettes College has secured a settlement of £400,000 from the school after alleging he was abused by a teacher.In evidence to the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry, the man known as Frank claimed he was beaten and sexually abused at the Edinburgh school. Fettes has previously offered a "full and unreserved apology" to those who suffered abuse while at the school. Following the payment, the man said: "It has never been about the money". "Fettes had the opportunity back in 2005 to do the right thing but they tried to bury things rather than do right by the pupils who were in their care," he added.
