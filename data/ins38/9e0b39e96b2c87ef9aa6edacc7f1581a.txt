The State cannot be 'agnostic' on how much rent students are charged in any new accommodation built by universities with the help of public funding, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris has said.The Government was finalising plans to 'unstick' several student accommodation projects where universities had planning permission but work had not yet started, he told the Oireachtas committee on education on Wednesday.Mr Harris said the proposals would see the State contribute to the significant costs facing universities to build campus accommodation.
