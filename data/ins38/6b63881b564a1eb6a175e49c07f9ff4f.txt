NSW Labor leader Chris Minns will ban pork-barrelling if he wins the March state election in a bid to rebuild trust with voters who have increasingly turned their backs on the major parties.

Minns used his first speech as party leader to the NSW Labor state conference on Sunday to outline his election priorities, which include more permanent teachers, local manufacturing of trains and hundreds more paramedics for the regions.
