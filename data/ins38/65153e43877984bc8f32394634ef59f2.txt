May 31—Springfield officials are expected to vote in June on an economic incentive agreement that would stay the collection of new property taxes at the planned Sycamore Ridge housing development.

The incentive, known as Tax Incremental Funding, is aimed at attracting and subsidizing new investments. The idea is that a percentage of property tax under the agreement would go towards reimbursing certain projects.

The Sycamore Ridge development aims to construct 258 homes on 72 acres of land along East Leffel Lane and South Burnett Road.
