Ford said that it wants to restructure its dealership model to sell its EVs online only and at a non-negotiable price to match Tesla's profit margins.
'I feel like when that second quarter last year profit came out for Tesla and they showed like a $15,000 premium, it totally changed my world,' CEO Jim Farley said at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Wednesday. 'It was an epiphany. It was like the angel sung, it was like, oh! my god, we can make more money on EVs than our ICE.'
Farley's comments in a lengthy interview came one day before the automaker announced it would spend $3.
