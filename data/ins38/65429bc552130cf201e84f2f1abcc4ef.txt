CLEVELAND − On to Baltimore.

Pardon the paraphrasing of the head coach whose New England Patriots came into Cleveland on Sunday and rolled to a 38-15 win. However, there's truth in Bill Belichick's (paraphrased) words.

The Browns' pathway back toward any semblance of contention − be it for the AFC North or the AFC playoffs or, heck, even .500 − starts next Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. That would've been the case had they beaten the Patriots, as well.

They didn't, so the reality of their existence is even more crystalized.
