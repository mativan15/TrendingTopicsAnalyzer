In 2020, long-time Andreessen Horowitz general partner Peter Levine stepped back from the pace of his career as a venture capitalist after a terrifying bout with cancer left him rethinking his priorities.Flash forward to three-years after his surgery, Levine tells Insider that his recovery has been nothing short of a "miracle." He's now doing a little investing for A16Z again, in "selective" startups, he said. But more importantly, he's been inspired to focus on a new philanthropic project. The Levine Impact Lab has launched in partnership with the Honnold Foundation – a solar-technology non-profit founded by Levine's friend, renowned rock climber Alex Honnold.
