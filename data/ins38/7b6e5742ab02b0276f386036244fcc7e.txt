By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:25 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 00:25 EDT, 30 May 2022 Devin Haney says his quest to become undisputed world champion won't be derailed by the absence of his trainer father Bill. The American boxer arrived in Melbourne ahead of his lightweight title showdown with Australia's George Kambosos at Marvel Stadium on Sunday minus key members of his camp, with his father and his other lead trainer Ben Davison denied entry visas. Haney Snr reportedly has a 30-year-old drug conviction which was behind the government knockback.
