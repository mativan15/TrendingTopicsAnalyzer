Jeff Dunn Senior Commerce Writer

Jeff is Engadget's Senior Commerce Writer, which means he spends his days composing buying guides, deal roundups, and anything else that helps you more easily figure out which tech is worth your time. He's reviewed consumer electronics for more than a decade, a stretch that includes stints at Ars Technica and Business Insider. He's a retro game collector and a long-suffering fan of Everton Football Club, and while he works out of New York City, he'll always be a Bostonian at heart.
