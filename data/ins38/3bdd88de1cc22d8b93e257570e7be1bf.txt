Britain's new Treasury chief has insisted Prime Minister Liz Truss retains control of her government, despite having to roll back her signature economic policies weeks into her premiership. Jeremy Hunt was drafted in to lead the Treasury after Truss sacked Kwasi Kwarteng amid rising pressure following the turbulent market reaction to the new administration's 'mini-budget'. 'The prime minister's in charge,' Hunt, a former foreign and health secretary, told the BBC when he was asked whether he now held all the power at Downing Street.
