For four weeks, the streets of Iran have been ringing with cries of 'Women, Life, Freedom' – the slogan of a burgeoning revolution born of a desire for true liberty.

Through an internet connection becoming increasingly difficult to access, Iranian protester Vahid tells The Media Line that he and his compatriots are ready to put their lives on the line to crush the dictatorship that has ruled their country for more than four decades.

'We want the whole world to know that we don't want this regime, and we're going to fight until the last drop of our blood to get rid of this regime,' he says of the fight against a brutal rule more than ready to use immense force to quell its own population.
