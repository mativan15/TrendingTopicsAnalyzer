What qualifies you to hold this position? With 14 years on the Planning Commission and being a lifelong resident has given me a unique insight on how to help the city to better work with its residents. In my career, I've worked with major corporations to help grow and lead large facility operations by providing efficient and cost-effective solutions which I will bring to the City Council.

What would your top priorities be if elected? Strong support for police and fire. Fiscal responsibility ensures public safety, existing and new infrastructure is properly funded while not spending city funds on items that do not add value to the residents.
