"Prices have been increased by Rs 2 per litre for Amul Gold and buffalo milk due to increase in fat prices," Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) managing director R S Sodhi told PTI. Prices have been raised for all markets except Gujarat, he added. The Cooperative had last increased the milk prices on August 17 by Rs 2 per litre citing rise in milk procurement cost.
