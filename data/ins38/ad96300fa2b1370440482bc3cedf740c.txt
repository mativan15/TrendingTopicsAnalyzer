The outdoor pools are heated, too - meaning you won't have to worry even if the days are a bit chilly next summer. 
Different resorts will have different swimming pool facilities; for instance, Holywell Bay park features a 300ft flume, while the Vauxhall park features an outdoor splash zone and an indoor water world, with tipping buckets and more.
