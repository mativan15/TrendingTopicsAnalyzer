President Biden wants Americans to know: Curbing inflation is his top, top, top priority.
He recently penned an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal with this headline: 'My Plan for Fighting Inflation.' The plan didn't contain much new in the anti-inflation category, but it did contain a red alert, which may have been the point.
The piece prepared the public for an economic slowdown, the likely result of the Federal Reserve's commitment to reining in its reckless monetary policy. Biden warns that in coming months 'growth will look different' and forecasts that job gains will drop from recent monthly totals of 500,000 or so and head lower, to maybe about 150,000.
