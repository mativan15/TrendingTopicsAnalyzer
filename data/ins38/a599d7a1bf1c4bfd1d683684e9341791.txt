John Wick filmmaker Chad Stahelski has teamed up with Leigh Dana Jackson, a co-executive producer on super power series Raising Dion, to tackle Netflix's adaptation of Marc Olden's Black Samurai novels. Stahelski will direct, while Jackson is set to write. Stahelski will also produce along with Jason Spitz and Alex Young of his banner 87Eleven Entertainment. John Schoenfelder and Russell Ackerman of Addictive Pictures, who were instrumental in securing the rights, are also producing. Details on Netflix's take were as thin as the very best of katana blade, but Olden's eight blaxploitation books, published in the 1970s, centered on Robert Sand, an American soldier in Japan who learns the ways of the most powerful martial arts and becomes the Black Samurai.
