A look at the shareholders of Avista Corporation (NYSE:AVA) can tell us which group is most powerful. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

Avista has a market capitalization of US$3.2b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company.
