As a Black man from the South Side of Chicago like Ye, the man formerly known as Kanye West, Jeffrey McCune Jr. grew up with an appreciation for the rapper-turned-entrepreneur. Now, amid the recent controversies surrounding the rapper, this college professor sees value in launching another course on Ye.

McCune, an associate professor of African and African American studies at the University of Rochester, hopes to launch his third class on Ye focusing on the rapper's artistry, influence and political views as a way to teach complex topics to college students.
