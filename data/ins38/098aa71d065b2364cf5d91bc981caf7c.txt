After several years of disappointing March Madness appearances under Shaka Smart, the Longhorns exercised their demons and advanced to the second round under Chris Beard.

The former Texas Tech coach is looking to build on his success that he had in his first season as the Texas head coach, and he seems to be acquiring even more talent than he was last year. Prior to this past season, Beard was able to build up Texas' roster by bringing in elite transfers such as Timmy Allen and Marcus Carr.

This offseason, Beard not only brought in one of the top transfers in Tyrese Hunter, who won Big 12 Freshman of the Year, but was also able to bring in a strong recruiting class.
