A hospitality complex inside one of Christchurch's most iconic heritage buildings has hit a major funding goal and is on track to open in August. After a rollercoaster of failed fundraising plans and pandemic-induced delays, The Grand is set to be partially unveiled in the 140-year-old former Chief Post Office in late August. Opening in stages, it will initially offer an information centre, a bar and restaurant, a 24-hour deli, a florist and an ice cream parlour. On Wednesday, it reached its minimum fundraising goal of $150,000.
