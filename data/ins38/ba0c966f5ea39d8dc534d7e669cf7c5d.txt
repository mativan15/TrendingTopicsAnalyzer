Three players in the field at this week's Memorial Tournament have committed to compete in the first LIV Golf Invitational Series event.

Tour winners Matt Jones and Hudson Swafford, along with reigning U.S. Amateur champion James Piot, are signed up to play in London, June 9-11. For now, though, they are at Muirfield Village.

Golf Channel reporter Todd Lewis caught up with Jones on Wednesday to get his reasoning for competing in the rival-league tournament, despite the Tour not allowing a conflicting-event release for its players.
