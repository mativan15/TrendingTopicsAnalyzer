The test run of Netflix's new system for cracking down on people sharing their account password is not going well, according to new reports. Back in March, the streaming giant asked three small markets in Latin America to pay an extra $2 to $3 when sharing their log-in details outside their ‘household'. This was essentially an attempt by Netflix to tie an account to a physical location – but many users were left confused; what if they wanted to watch the service away from home? And what exactly is meant by ‘household'? Netflix officially defines a household as ‘exclusively people a subscriber lives with' - and not their immediate family.
