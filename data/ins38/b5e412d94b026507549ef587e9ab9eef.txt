Washington, DC – Americans will head to the polls on November 8 to vote in elections with enormous consequences for the country's future. Control for both chambers of the United States Congress will be in play.
There are 35 Senate races this year, but the winner is all but a foregone conclusion in most of the contests. Republicans are expected to retain their seats in conservative states like Alabama and Idaho, while Democratic candidates will most likely win in liberal states, including California and New York.
