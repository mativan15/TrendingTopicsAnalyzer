Two recent flights last month by PPG (PPG) executives to Philadelphia, Axalta's (AXTA) corporate headquarters, may be an indication of PPG's interest in Axalta, according to data from a flight tracking analytics company sent to investors and viewed by Seeking Alpha. The flights indicated a potential overnight stay by the PPG executives.
