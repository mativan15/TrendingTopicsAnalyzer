(Reuters) -U.S. stock index futures jumped on Tuesday, with strong quarterly sales from Johnson & Johnson lifting hopes that upbeat corporate reports could soothe markets worries of a potential recession due to rising inflation and interest rates.

Johnson & Johnson rose 1.5% in premarket trading after the healthcare conglomerate beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter sales, helped by strong demand for its cancer drug Darzalex and Crohn's disease drug Stelara.
