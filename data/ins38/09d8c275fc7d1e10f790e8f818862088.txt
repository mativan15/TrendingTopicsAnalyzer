LEESBURG, Va. – President Biden has not done enough to help the economy or improve everyday Americans' financial situations, locals from a Virginia town outside Washington, D.C., told Fox News. "Honestly, I can't pinpoint any one success that I can attribute to the White House, unfortunately," a woman who works in the area told Fox News. "I cannot say that Joe Biden has done anything to help small business that I have seen down here."The Biden administration is making a concerted effort to communicate the president's accomplishments on the economy throughout the month of June, a White House official told Fox News this week.
