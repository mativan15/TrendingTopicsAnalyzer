Everspin Technologies (NASDAQ:MRAM) has signed a contract to provide MRAM technology, design, and back end of line manufacturing services with QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) to support identified and future Department of Defense strategic and space system requirements.
The initial award is potentially valued at $2.8M, with subsequent options bringing the total to ~$8.7M.
The project is sponsored by DoD's Trusted and Assured Microelectronics ((T&AM)) Program. Everspin will extend its traditional market of discrete MRAM designs by collaborating with QuickLogic and integrating MRAM directly into the FPGA product.
