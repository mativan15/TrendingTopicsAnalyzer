Gangs of London actor Orli Shuka has revealed that he held his breath for 4 minutes in a brutal underwater scene.
The 46-year-old plays Albanian mob boss Luan in the Sky Atlantic drama, which was created by The Raid's Gareth Evans.
After season one broke records for being the most violent TV show, surpassing the body and torture count in Game of Thrones, it's not surprising season 2 is rammed full of gory sequences.
And Orli, who told Metro.co.uk he performs his own stunts, really got stuck into the action.
