Aiman Dairabaeva/iStock via Getty Images NewLake Capital Partners, Inc. (OTCQX:NLCP) is a small copycat REIT, modeled closely on Innovative Industrial Products (IIPR). It buys marijuana grow houses (and a few retail properties), and leases them back to the growers on a triple-net basis. NLCP's price performance since inception has been pretty much all downhill. After its IPO in late 2020, which initiated the share price at around $30, there was a brief run-up to $31.85 on October 2 of that year. That was the all-time high.
