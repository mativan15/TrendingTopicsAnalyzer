UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State College of the Liberal Arts alumna Jessica Glick, a 2002 psychology graduate with a double minor in labor relations and dispute management and resolution, has for the last decade been the owner of J. Rose Bartending, which provides services for public and private events. Glick said she feels that her Penn State degree has been essential in creating an authentic, 'people-first' business that prioritizes selling meaningful experiences rather than just products.
Back in high school, Glick did not imagine that bartending — let alone owning her own bartending business — would even be in the picture, she said.
