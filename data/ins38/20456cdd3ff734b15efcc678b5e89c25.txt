A custom-built home for Golden State Warriors player Steph Curry has just hit the market for $8.9 million. 
Located in Alamo, California, Curry, his wife, and three children lived in the six-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion from 2018 to 2019. 
They were forced to move after his team relocated to San Francisco's new arena from Oakland — and the commute was no longer ideal for the NBA star. 
Curry and and his wife, Ayesha — an author, chef, and entrepreneur —  were 'very involved in picking all the finishes and fixtures in the home, and almost everything is from Spain or Italy,' a rep for the listing told The Post.
