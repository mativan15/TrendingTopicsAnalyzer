Jeremy Hunt has suggested the triple lock on state pensions increases could be scrapped, as he refused to make any commitments on 'individual policy areas'.The Chancellor said decisions would be taken 'through the prism of what matters' to the most vulnerable but failed to guarantee the Government would maintain the triple lock, the policy commitment by which state pensions are uprated by whichever is highest of 2.5%, wages and inflation.At the end of September, his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng had said he and the Prime Minister were 'absolutely committed' to it.
