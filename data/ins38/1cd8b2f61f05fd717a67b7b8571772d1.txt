Several players returned to the court during NBA Opening Week.
The opening days of the season not only gave us a first look at this year's rookie class (which included a historic performance from No. 1 overall pick Paolo Banchero) and veterans making their debuts on new teams after moving via free agency or trade this offseason, but it also saw the return to the court for a handful of All-Stars that missed all (or most) of last season. 
Some players looked like they hadn't missed a beat, while others may need to get a few games under their belt to find their rhythm, shake off any residual rust from the long layoff and return to their pre-injury self.
