A Filipino senator faced online ridicule after he suggested imposing a ban on K-dramas in the Philippines.

Senator Jose Pimentel Ejercito Jr., who is better known as Jinggoy Estrada, gave his suggestion during the budget hearing of the Film Development Council of the Philippines on Tuesday.

'My observation is that when we continue showing Korean telenovelas, what Filipinos idolize are these Koreans and our Filipino artists lose jobs and income,' Estrada, a son of deposed Philippine president Joseph Estrada, reportedly said.
