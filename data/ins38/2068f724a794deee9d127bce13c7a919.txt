Prime Minister Narendra Modi today laid the foundation stone for Indian Air Force (IAF)'s new airbase at Deesa in Banaskantha district of Gujarat and described it as an effective center of India's security. He said the Deesa air base, mere 130 kilometers from the Indo-Pak border, will be able to give a better response to any threat coming from the western side.Although the land for Deesa airbase was allotted an in-principle approval given to Indian Air Force (IAF) by the Vajpayee government way back in 2000, the project was put on a back burner by the UPA government for the next 14 years.
