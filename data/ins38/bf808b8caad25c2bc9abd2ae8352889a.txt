Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorization for a product typically delivers a nice stock price boost for the affected company. This, however, wasn't the case with vaccine specialist Novavax (NVAX -3.71%) on Hump Day, as the latest FDA green light had the opposite effect, driving the shares down by almost 4% on the day.
