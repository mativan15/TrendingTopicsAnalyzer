European stocks declined on Wednesday as investors fretted about new inflation data, the prospect of further interest rate increases and a mixed batch of earnings reports.Euro zone consumer inflation for September was revised marginally lower to 9.9 per cent from 10 per cent, but was still at a record high, underlining market expectations of more interest rate rises before the end of the year.UK inflation, meanwhile, hit 10.1 per cent in September, matching the 40-year high touched in July and putting more pressure on the Bank of England to step up interest rate hikes to rein in surging prices.
