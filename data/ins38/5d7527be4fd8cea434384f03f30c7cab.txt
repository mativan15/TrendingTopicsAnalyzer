Boston Marathon winner Diana Kipyokei was suspended Friday after testing positive for doping at the 2021 race and could be stripped of her title.
The Athletics Integrity Unit announced that Kipyokei failed a drug test that was collected after she won the 2021 marathon. 
She tested positive for triamcinolone acetonide, a therapeutic drug prohibited in competition when administered via oral, rectal and all injectable routes because of clear evidence it acts as a performance enhancer, the AIU said.
Athletes are allowed to test positive for the drug if they prove it was administered through another route that was not orally, rectally or by injection.
