Two workers hailing from Odisha, who were employed in a prawn unit at Rameswaram, were arrested on Friday in connection with the rape and murder of a 45-year-old woman, whose partially burnt body was found on Tuesday. The police had initially detained six suspects, all migrant workers, who were beaten by a mob following the death of the woman, who had gone to collect seaweeds and deliver them at the prawn unit. During interrogation, two of them confessed to having raped and killed the victim. Police sources said the accused were likely to be produced before the jurisdictional judicial magistrate and remanded in custody.
