We have been pretty impressed with the performance at Korvest Ltd (ASX:KOV) recently and CEO Chris Hartwig deserves a mention for their role in it. The pleasing results would be something shareholders would keep in mind at the upcoming AGM on 21 October 2022. The focus will probably be on the future company strategy as shareholders cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. We think the CEO has done a pretty decent job and we discuss why the CEO compensation is appropriate.
