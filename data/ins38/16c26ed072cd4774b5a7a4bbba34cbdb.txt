Notable gainers include 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), Health Catalyst (HCAT), and American Well (AMWL), all of which have dropped more than 70% over the past 12 months, as shown in this graph. Investors flocked to telehealth providers during the pandemic as demand for their services surged while fears of a highly contagious virus kept patients indoors amid government-imposed social restrictions.
