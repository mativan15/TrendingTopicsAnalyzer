There's a reason so many consumers start their holiday shopping on Black Friday and make the bulk of their purchases between then and late December. The holiday season is when retailers tend to offer the most attractive discounts on everything from toys to apparel to electronics to home decor.And this year, the discounts might be even steeper than usual. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau,U.S. retailers had a record $732 billion of inventory as of July. That's a 21% uptick from last year.
