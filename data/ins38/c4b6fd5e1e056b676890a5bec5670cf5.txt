Boris Johnson's decision to suspend the government's graduate fast stream for at least a year amid deep civil service cuts has been labelled 'very foolish' by a former Tory cabinet minister.It comes after the government revealed plans earlier this month to cut the civil service headcount by 91,000 in a move that led to fury from unions and warnings of national strike action.The highly competitive graduate scheme — hiring around 1,000 people on an annual basis — will be the first casualty of the cut in 2023 despite criticism from some quarters, according to the Daily Telegraph.
