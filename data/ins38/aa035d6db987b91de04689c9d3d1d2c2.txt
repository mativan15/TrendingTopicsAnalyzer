The Bombay High Court while granting anticipatory bail to a man who runs an NGO that raises funds for needy patients, specifically young children, through a call centre, said the Maharashtra Government and the state police should 'recognise and uphold' services of such organisations. The high court also said, if possible, authorities should assist them in taking their ventures further as there are several areas where the state machinery is unable to reach, instead of ‘moving the needle of suspicion' against them.
