"Varney & Co." host Stuart Varney discussed the main political drivers for voters and the impact they could have on the Democrats for the midterms, arguing that he doesn't see how the Democrats will be able to "turn it around" during his "My Take," Tuesday. STUART VARNEY: You had to dig into The New York Times midterm poll to find a golden nugget. Here it is: In September, independent women voters favored Democrats by 14 points. By mid-October that same group favored Republicans by 18 points. That's a 32-point swing in a key voting group.
