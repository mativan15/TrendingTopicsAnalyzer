Things to watch during Week 8 of play in the Big Ten Conference:

GAME OF THE WEEK

Minnesota (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) at No. 16 Penn State (5-1, 2-1)

Minnesota has lost two straight to Big Ten West opponents and is desperate for a win in this crossover game. The Gophers are just as physical as Michigan, which hammered Penn State last week, and star RB Mohamed Ibrahim must be licking his chops knowing he'll go against a defense that allowed 418 yards rushing to the Wolverines.
