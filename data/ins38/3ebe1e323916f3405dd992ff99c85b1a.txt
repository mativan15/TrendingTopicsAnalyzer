Kentucky Employers' Mutual Insurance has raised the salary of its president by 50 percent over the past two years, following a 2019 state audit that sharply criticized the agency for spending excessively for insiders' personal benefit.

On Oct. 11, the KEMI Board of Directors boosted the salary of KEMI president Jon Stewart from $362,000 to $428,065. The board last year hiked Stewart's salary to $362,000 from the $286,100 set in his current five-year employment contract that he signed Oct. 13, 2020.
