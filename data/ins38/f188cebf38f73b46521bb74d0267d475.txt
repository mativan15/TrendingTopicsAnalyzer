The top seeds that played their NCAA baseball regional openers Friday went unbeaten, and most won easily. No. 1 Tennessee, No. 2 Stanford, No. 4 Virginia Tech, No. 7 Oklahoma State and No. 8 East Carolina each scored in double digits, and no margin of victory among the top eight seeds was less than five runs.

Vanderbilt, which reached the last two College World Series finals, continued its late-season swoon and will have to fight its way out of the loser's bracket to advance.
