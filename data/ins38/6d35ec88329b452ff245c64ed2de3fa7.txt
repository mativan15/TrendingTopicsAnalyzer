Has inflation started impacting the sachet economy? FMCG companies think so. A Rs 2 Horlicks sachet gives a consumer one cup, while a Re 1 Clinic Plus shampoo offers a lady a full hair wash. As inflation bites, it's becoming a challenge for FMCG makers to maintain these price points by reducing the quantity per pack — called grammage. 'You cannot go down beyond a point. If a Re 1 Clinic Plus shampoo volume falls below a certain threshold, it will not allow for a full hair wash. There are certain thresholds that we operate within, and we can't drop volume beyond that,' said Hindustan Unilever CFO Ritesh Tiwari.
