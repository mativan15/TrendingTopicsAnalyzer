With inflation and the higher costs of basic necessities like food, utilities, and housing, many US residents are being forced to make difficult financial trade-offs. This especially affects individuals with lower incomes, particularly older adults living on a tight budget and/or a low fixed income. This survey explored the attitudes and experiences related to food security for older adults whose household income is below 225% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The main focus of the survey was knowledge of, attitude about, and experiences with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
