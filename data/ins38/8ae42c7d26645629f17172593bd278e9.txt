Chargers cornerback J.C. Jackson started Monday night's game against the Broncos, but remaining in the starting lineup felt like less than a sure thing given the way things played out during the game.

Jackson was benched at halftime and head coach Brandon Staley said that his play was not 'good enough' in the first 30 minutes of the game. Jackson missed the first two games of the year after having ankle surgery and had not played as well as hoped upon his return, but he'll get another chance to make a positive impression against the Seahawks this weekend.
