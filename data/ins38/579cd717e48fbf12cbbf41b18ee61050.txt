Kenwood Country Club has created a program to pay local female golfers for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) in marketing campaigns.

Kenwood, home of this year's inaugural Kroger Queen City Championship presented by P&G on the LPGA Tour, has developed the campaign in an effort to recruit and retain employees.

Kenwood is working with five female golfers at the University of Cincinnati and Xavier University. It will pay them to serve as ambassadors for the club.

The players include Emma McMyler, a two-time Big East Player of the Year from Xavier University, who played in the LPGA's Kroger Queen City Championship under a sponsor's exemption.
