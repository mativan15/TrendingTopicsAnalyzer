Signature Bridge in Northeast Delhi, connecting Wazirabad to the Central part of the city across the Yamuna, has reported 53 road crashes and 17 fatal cases between 2018 and 2021, as per officials. In an attempt to resolve this and make the busy stretch safer for commuters, the Delhi government has launched a month-long ‘tactical urbanism trial' at the bridge under its ‘Delhi 2047' initiative.

According to officials, the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) has been working to reduce road crash fatalities and injuries on selected high-fatality intersections in Delhi by facilitating their adoption under tactical urbanism trials.
