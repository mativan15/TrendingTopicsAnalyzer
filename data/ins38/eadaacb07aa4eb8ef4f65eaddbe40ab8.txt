Amid the cost of living crisis, many will be looking to cut down the cost of their weekly food shop.
Inflation rose to 9% in May this year, and the price of everything from food to energy bills to putting petrol in the car has gone up.
For that reason, we've had a look at the prices of 10 common food and household products in nine of the UK's supermarkets: Tesco, Aldi, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Iceland and Amazon Fresh.
We searched for the lowest-price option of each particular product (including bread, milk, cheese and sugar), using each supermarket's grocery shopping website.
