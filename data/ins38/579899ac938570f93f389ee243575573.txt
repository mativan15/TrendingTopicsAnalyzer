Campaigning is in full gear in Nigeria as the the June 9 deadline nears for Nigeria's political parties to pick their presidential candidates for the 2023 polls. The main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party, or PDP, has already nominated a 75-year-old as its presidential candidate. Business tycoon Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president, has had five previous goes at winning the presidential ticket. Given his advanced age, many believe this could be his last shot.Abubakar is unlikely to be the only politician over 70 on the ballot paper.
