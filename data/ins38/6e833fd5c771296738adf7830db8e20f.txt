New Social Equity in Cannabis Technical Assistance Mentorship Program designed to help communities historically impacted by high poverty and enforcement of cannabis prohibitions
OLYMPIA, WA – In 2020, the Washington State Legislature determined that additional efforts are necessary to reduce barriers to entry to the cannabis industry for individuals and communities most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws. As a result, the Social Equity in Cannabis Task Force was formed, allowing approximately 41 additional cannabis retail licenses to be issued for social equity purposes.
