Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who is one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court against the release of the 11 rapists of Bilkis Bano, raised three points joining the chorus of the opposition -- after the Gujarat government informed the Supreme Court how the decision was taken. The Gujarat government said the Union home ministry approved the remission of the 11 convicts in July this year, while the proposal of their release was opposed by the CBI, the superintendent of Police, Special Crime Branch, Mumbai and the Special Civil Judge (CBI), City Civil and Sessions Court, Greater Bombay.
