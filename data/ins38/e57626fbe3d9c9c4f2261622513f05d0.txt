Workers from the unorganised sector under the banner of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) on Thursday resorted to a road roko on Ambour Salai demanding the government to disburse festival allowance of ₹3,500. The workers led by AITUC State general secretary Sethu Selvam took out a march from Mission Street and attempted to lay a siege to the office of Minister for Transport and Labour Chandira Priyanga at the Legislative Assembly here in support of their demand.
