In an NBA first, the Los Angeles Clippers are providing fans with a wide range of options for watching games without cable, several news outlets report.
The team's new OTT offering, ClipperVision, fulfills a long-time goal of owner Steve Ballmer and is a potential glimpse into the future of local sports media.
The localized streaming service will offer six different streams, including Spanish-language and Korean-language coverage of live games, the standard telecast, an augmented reality stream and BallerVision, akin to ManningCast, where former players will commentate.
