There are good 'a-ha' moments and there are bad ones, according to Simon Loong. Developing a virtual bank at the height of the pandemic was a good 'a-ha,' even though it entailed an uphill learning process for his Hong Kong startup WeLab, an online lender nearly a decade old. 'We see digital banking as the future of financial services,' says Loong, cofounder and CEO of WeLab, in an interview on the sidelines of the Forbes Global CEO conference held in Singapore. WeLab launched its eponymous banking app in Hong Kong during the summer of 2020.
