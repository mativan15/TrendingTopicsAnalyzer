Published: 03:10 EDT, 5 June 2022 | Updated: 03:10 EDT, 5 June 2022 American party-pooper Devin Haney says he should be considered among boxing's best after vanquishing George Kambosos Jnr in emphatic fashion on Sunday. Saul "Canelo" Alvarez is considered the top pound-for-pound boxer after becoming the first undisputed super middleweight titles champion in the four-belt era. But now that Haney has done the same in the lightweight division, with a unanimous victory at Melbourne's Marvel Stadium, he says he too should be rated among boxing's elite.
