This week, the US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) expanded its ever-growing list of vulnerability in industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure technology.
The latest warnings flag up severe flaws in products from Advantech and Hitachi Energy, which serve both consumer and commercial markets.
The twin advisories include alerts about security holes in Advantech's R-SeeNet that can be exploited by remote attackers to take control of this industrial network router monitoring software or to delete PDF files from the system.
