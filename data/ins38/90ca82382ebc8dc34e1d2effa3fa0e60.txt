GREEN BAY, Wis. — Aaron Rodgers believes a simpler approach can help Green Bay's offense get out of its funk.

The Packers certainly need to try something.

Rodgers hasn't come close to matching his production from the last two seasons — each of which resulted in MVP honors — and the Packers find their hopes of a fourth straight NFC North title in jeopardy.

The Packers dropped to .500 with a surprising 27-10 home loss to the New York Jets. That followed a 27-22 defeat against the New York Giants in London, a game in which Green Bay squandered a 14-point lead and didn't get any points from its offense after halftime.
