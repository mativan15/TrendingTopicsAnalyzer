The 2023 Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV looks about like we expected, blending the proportions of the EQB and EQS SUVs with the scale of the EQE Sedan. The SUV, surprisingly, has a smaller footprint and shorter wheelbase than the sedan upon which it its based. However, more torque and cargo capacity make it a more flexible hauler. The SUV will be offered in single- and dual-motor variants. The single-motor EQE350 Plus sends 288 horsepower to its rear wheels. The dual-motor EQE350 4Matic sticks with 288 total horsepower, while the EQE500 4Matic boosts to 536 hp.
