By Australian Associated Press Published: 20:40 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 21:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 Australia has reversed a controversial decision to recognise West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with the foreign minister labelling the coalition government change a political ploy. Foreign Minister Penny Wong says the conflict between Israel and Palestine should be resolved through peace negotiations between the two. Both Israel and Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital. Former prime minister Scott Morrison recognised West Jerusalm as Israel's capital in 2018, and said Australia would move its embassy there from Tel Aviv.
