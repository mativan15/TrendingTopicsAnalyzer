The UK's competition regulator has ordered Meta to sell the animated GIF platform, Giphy, after finding that the deal could harm social media users and UK advertisers.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that Meta's (META) takeover of Giphy could allow Meta to limit other social media platforms' access to GIFs, making those sites less attractive to users and less competitive.

The CMA also found that the deal between Meta and Giphy has removed the latter as a potential challenger in the UK display advertising market.
