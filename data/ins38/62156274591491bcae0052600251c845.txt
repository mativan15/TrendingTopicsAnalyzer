Lumsden & McCormick LLP recently appointed Sara Dayton as its first female managing partner.

She'll take over Jan. 1 for John Schiavone, who's been with the firm more than 30 years and in that role since 2010.

Dayton joined the firm in 1998, was named partner in 2012 and became a financial advisor in 2014. She currently leads the firm's auditing and accounting department and the governmental services group. She's the first female managing partner in the firm's 70-year history.

Dayton was in Buffalo Business First's 2015 class of 40 Under 40 and returned as a judge for later years.
