It's no secret that Sia is a diehard Survivor superfan, and on Tuesday (May 31), she put her money where her mouth is, surprising one Season 42 castaway with a gift of $100,000.
The moment was broadcast by the reality show's official social media accounts, which showed the singer calling in to talk to Drea Wheeler, who finished the most recent season of Survivor in seventh place.

'I just really thought you were amazing, you're an amazing woman. You played the game, like, so smooth and your fire got put out way too early for my liking,' Sia told an overwhelmed and emotional Wheeler.
