ROME (AP) — The European Union's executive branch reminded Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday that Russia 'illegitimately' invaded Ukraine, after the former Italian premier was recorded boasting that he had recently reconnected with Russian President Vladimir Putin and exchanged gifts of vodka, wine and 'sweet' notes over his birthday.The reaction from Brussels added to the upheaval that Berlusconi's comments had in Italy, where far-right leader Giorgia Meloni is putting together a Cabinet before an expected mandate to form Italy's next government.
