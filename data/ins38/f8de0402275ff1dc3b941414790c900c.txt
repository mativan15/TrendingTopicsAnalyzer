Punk rock band The Offspring is heading to Halifax in less than two weeks as part of a tour in support of their long awaited 10th studio album. Known as one of the best punk rock bands of all time, The Offspring first achieved worldwide success in the 90s with their album "Smash," which sold more than 11-million copies. "Dexter and I first played together in my parents living room in 1984 and I've been playing music with him ever since," said Noodles, the band's guitarist. Noodles says back then, he never expected to make a living off music.
