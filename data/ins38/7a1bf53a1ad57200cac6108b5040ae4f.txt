Flu season is already off to an early start in the United States, with multiple states including Georgia and Texas reporting an unusually high surge this early in the season.Influenza antivirals like Tamiflu have been gathering dust on the proverbial shelf for the last two years while the flu largely disappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, these are reportedly back in demand and at much higher levels than what was seen in October prior to 2020.While there are no confirmed shortages of these flu antivirals, some experts worry that an early surge in prescriptions for medications like Tamiflu could put stress on pharmacies that did not order enough stock to meet demand this early in the season.
