HP CEO Enrique Lores says nothing in his company's latest quarterly numbers suggest economic growth is poised to fall off a cliff this year.

HP beat analyst profit forecasts for its fiscal second quarter, powered by strong sales of commercial computers as customers continue to bring workers back to the office. HP said commercial computer sales rose 18% in its most recent quarter.

"What we are seeing today continues to be very strong demand from the commercial side," Lores told Yahoo Finance Live.
