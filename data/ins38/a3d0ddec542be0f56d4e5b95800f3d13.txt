Published: 08:04 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 08:05 EDT, 21 October 2022 Just Stop Oil protesters stopped traffic at a key junction near Holborn station in London on Friday morning. At 10.50am, 22 activists walked into the road at the junction between High Holborn and Kingsway. They sat on the road with banners while some glued themselves to the tarmac. Police confirmed an hour later that 16 protesters had been arrested and that the roads have since been reopened. I hope that my actions in support of Just Stop Oil will inspire other ordinary people like me to step forward and take a stand against this government's disastrous energy policies Just Stop Oil have demanded that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents.
