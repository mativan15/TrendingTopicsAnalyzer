In the UK, a television licence is required to watch programming as it is being broadcast or to stream live content. The levy is also needed to watch the BBC or watch content on BBC iPlayer with money from the fee going towards the public broadcaster. TV Licensing is responsible for managing the fee, however the Government is in charge of setting any discounts or concessions.As it stands, the current cost of a television licence is £159 per household which covers all devices.This means that if someone were to successfully apply for a refund they would get £159 back.
