May 28—NEWBURYPORT — Learning about science, technology, education, art and math in the classroom is one thing — applying it to the real world is another. That's where the Bresnahan Elementary STEAM exposition comes in handy. For hours Thursday morning, students in grades 1 through 3 took turns visiting the school's gymnasium where 16 exhibits were set up, each showcasing one of the five elements that makes up that acronym.

The exhibits, run by volunteers and Newburyport High School students, cover topics such as bridge design and construction, the science and art of felting, integrated circuits, chemistry, coding and robotics, and several more.
