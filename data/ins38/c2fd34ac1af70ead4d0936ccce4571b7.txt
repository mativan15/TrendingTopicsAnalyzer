Tech industry body, Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF), which has been focused on raising concerns over Big Tech firms' influence in India, is set to see a revamp in its executive council as one of its top executives - Sijo Kuruvilla George – has left the firm, sources aware of the matter said. George had joined the industry body as the executive director in April last year.

A few others from George's team members have also left the association following his exit, sources said. ADIF has previously filed complaints against Google with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) over its controversial Play Store billing policy.
