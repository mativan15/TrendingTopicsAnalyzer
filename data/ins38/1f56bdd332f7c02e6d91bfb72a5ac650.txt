Sutton's prediction: 2-0Brighton were unlucky to be beaten by Brentford on Friday. They played well and had opportunities, but they weren't ruthless enough.That defeat meant new Seagulls boss Roberto de Zerbi has taken only one point from his first three games, but his wait for a first win should end here.Forest don't just seem disjointed, they look like they are losing confidence and belief. Last season, they were always very well organised but also went after teams - they are not doing either at the moment.
