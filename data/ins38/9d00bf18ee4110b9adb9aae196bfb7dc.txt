If you are going to see one post-apocalyptic, low-tech French-Lithuanian-Belgian film in English this year with Eddie Marsan as the heavy, make sure it's this one. Co-written and directed by Kristina Buožytė and Bruno Samper, whose previous collaboration, sci-fi feature Vanishing Waves, was well-received critically but little seen beyond the Baltics and the festival circuit, Vesper plays like a cult film waiting to be discovered. It adeptly fuses a compelling YA-friendly story about a teenage girl's survival in a hostile environment with dense, thoughtful world-building, the sort required to draw in nerdy-minded viewers.
