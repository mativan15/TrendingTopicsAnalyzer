(Bloomberg) -- When world leaders arrive in Egypt next month for COP27, they'll be charged with navigating some of the weightiest challenges humanity has ever faced, from setting aggressive emissions-reduction targets to deciding if poor countries are owed reparations for the climate havoc wreaked by rich countries.
