New adult Happy Meal toys from McDonald's are ending up on eBay. The toys have sold out at many of the restaurants, so if you want one you'll have to pay up. One opportunist is trying to sell a pack of three unopened toys, which may include Grimace, the Hamburglar and Birdie, or the apparel brand Cactus Plant Flea Market's mascot Cactus Buddy, for 300-thousand dollars. So far, no one has placed a bid. Other sellers are getting some cash, however, with a box of 150 sealed toys going for 24-hundred dollars.
