Oct 18, 2022Goodbye, James Madison. You aren't the first to lose your way in Statesboro. We hardly knew ye, Coastal Carolina. (Actually, we know you pretty well by now, don't we?) Thought you had it, Oklahoma State. Never really thought you had it, Penn State. I never really did trust your defense, USC. Goodbye ... Alabama?Wait, hold on, Bama lost?Things got real in Week 7, as the roster of college football unbeatens was cut by 40% from a Fabulous 15 down to a Nasty Nine. And since the games only get harder from here (with the exception of Tennessee going from playing Bama to UT Martin, anyway), there are likely more losses on the near horizon.
