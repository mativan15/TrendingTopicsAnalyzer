Haiti is facing many crises converging all at once: crime, cholera and the breakdown of democratic institutions.But at the heart of the current emergency that recently led Canada and the U.S. to send secret military flights to the island is fuel: gasoline, diesel and kerosene.Although Haiti has tapped some of its hydroelectric potential, its abundant solar and wind power potential remains mostly unexploited.

And so Haiti generates about 80 per cent of its electricity from fossil fuels obtained from two oil terminals in Port-au-Prince.
