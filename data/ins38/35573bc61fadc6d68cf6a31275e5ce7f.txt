Jeremy Hunt has abandoned almost all of Liz Truss's tax cuts and severely cut back the planned energy price cap. The only major announcement from the mini-Budget just a few weeks ago to survive waas the reversal of the National Insurance rise which had already been legislated for.The Chancellor has been forced to perform another U-turn for Liz Truss' fledgeling government with an abandonment of her flagship policy of providing an energy price guarantee for two years.From April the guarantee will be means tested and targeted for the least well off.
