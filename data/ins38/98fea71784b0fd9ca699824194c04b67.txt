In the wake of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, Americans are grieving and looking for answers on how to stop gun violence from infiltrating more schools and communities.

It's been only 10 days since 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, in what officials described as a racially motivated attack that targeted Black people, and 10 years since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which killed 20 first-graders and six educators.
