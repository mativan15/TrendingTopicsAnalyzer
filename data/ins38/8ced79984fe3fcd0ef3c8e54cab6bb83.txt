The Park Ridge Planning and Zoning Committee last week continued its discussion of possible changes to Park Ridge's Uptown Plan, which has guided zoning in the city's downtown core since 2004.

Commissioners discussed possible additions of a heritage center, outdoor entertainment facilities, social clubs, hotels and university or college uses to the list of permitted buildings in Uptown, the commercial center of Park Ridge.

Commissioners began talking about an update to the Uptown Plan at an August meeting.
