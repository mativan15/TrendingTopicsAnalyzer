The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) is an autonomous panel but it needs more autonomy to function in a strengthened manner, said its chairperson Swati Maliwal on Saturday.
In an interview to The Hindu, Ms. Maliwal said the panel should be treated like a government department and be given adequate funds and resources to deal with the rising cases of crime against women and children. 'If more powers were given to the panel, where we could issue directions for implementing a certain rule, it would strengthen us,' she said.
