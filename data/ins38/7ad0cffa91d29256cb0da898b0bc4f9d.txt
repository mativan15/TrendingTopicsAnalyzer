AFTER SUELLA BRAVERMAN ended her bid for the Conservative Party leadership in July, she said she would back Liz Truss as leader because she would 'unleash the opportunities of Brexit'. It soon became clear that the two women had not discussed what that might involve. On October 19th, following a series of outbursts in which Ms Braverman contradicted her boss's stance on immigration, she resigned. Grant Shapps, formerly the transport secretary, will replace her.Ms Braverman admitted sending a document from her personal email to a parliamentary colleague.
