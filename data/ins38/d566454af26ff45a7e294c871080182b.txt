A man appointed by the Department of Veterans Affairs to manage veterans' benefits pleaded guilty to stealing over $300,000 from at least 10 of his clients, according to federal prosecutors

Raymond Huffman, 61, of Brunson, South Carolina, pleaded guilty to using his position as a fiduciary, in which he received payments on behalf of veterans who were unable to manage their benefits due to illness, disability or old age, to steal and misuse the funds, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Department of Justice.
