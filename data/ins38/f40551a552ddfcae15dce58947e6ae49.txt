Mark Cuban paid his way through college with a variety of side hustles.

On Friday's episode of ABC's "Shark Tank," a pair of founders who started a company from their dorm room that helps college kids make extra cash struck a nerve with Cuban — prompting the billionaire investor to offer them a $250,000 investment deal.

Sam Chason and Matt Gronberg are two former Wake Forest University classmates who founded their business, Storage Scholars, in 2017. It started as a way to make extra cash to pay down their college debts: They charged their classmates to pack up their belongings and store them between school years.
