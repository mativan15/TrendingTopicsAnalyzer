The Competition Commission's penalty amount of ₹1,337.68 crore imposed on Google is "provisional" as the regulator has asked the internet major to furnish requisite financial details since the data was not presented in a reliable manner. On Thursday, the watchdog penalised Google for abusing its dominant position in multiple markets in relation to Android mobile devices. The penalty translates to 10% of Google's average of relevant turnover for the last three preceding financial years.

According to the CCI, Google has made significant upward revisions in the financial data presented vide its submission dated October 11, 2022, vis-a-vis that of December 17, 2021.
