Olemedia/E+ via Getty Images Welcome to the May 2022 edition of the "junior" lithium miner news. We have categorized those lithium miners that won't likely be in production before 2023 as the juniors. Investors are reminded that many of the lithium juniors will most likely be needed in the mid and late 2020's to supply the booming electric vehicle [EV] and energy storage markets. This means investing in these companies requires a higher risk tolerance and a longer time frame. May saw very good progress for many of the lithium juniors as well as two major lithium players (MIN and LAC) buying into lithium juniors.
