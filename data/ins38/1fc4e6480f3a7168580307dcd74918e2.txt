Welcome to the Oregon FBI's Tech Tuesday segment. Today—Have you gotten a text from your own cell number? Don't fall for it, it's a scam.
Scammers spoof the caller ID to look like they are texting you from your own number. It's bound to get your attention and might even cause a panic.

They simply want you to click on their link and they've got you on the hook.
