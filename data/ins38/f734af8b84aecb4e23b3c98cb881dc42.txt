In September, Camp Margaritaville RV Resort and Lodge Pigeon Forge celebrated its grand opening.

When I visited the property, I was shocked by how peaceful yet fun the Lodge and RV park were.

The Margaritaville empire wants to open 30 to 50 more RV parks through the next five years.

For better or for worse, there are very few places in the US like Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.
