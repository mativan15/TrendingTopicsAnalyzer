Arena talks in Calgary are back on.The city and Calgary Flames owners confirmed Wednesday negotiations will begin again for a new sports, arts and entertainment building.Their previous deal agreed upon in 2019 collapsed late last year when the estimated cost of the project rose and the Flames withdrew.Shovels were scheduled to hit the ground this year for a 19,000-seat hockey arena and concert venue to replace the Saddledome, which has been the home of the Flames for 39 years.The initial estimate of a new arena was $550 million split between the two parties, but that figure increased to $634 million.
