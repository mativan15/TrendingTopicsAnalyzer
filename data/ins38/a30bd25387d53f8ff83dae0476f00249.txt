ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has named a retired federal judge to chair the State Election Board, filling a position that opened more than a year ago when Kemp signed a new election law that removed Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as a voting member of the five-person panel.Kemp on Friday announced William S. Duffey Jr. for the post, which is supposed to be nonpartisan under the 2021 law. The Republican Kemp held off for more than a year on making a pick and state lawmakers, who could have filled the vacancy during their 2022 session, also chose not to act.
