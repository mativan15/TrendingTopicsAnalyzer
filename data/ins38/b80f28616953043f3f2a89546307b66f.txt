Lehrmann has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting Higgins in Reynolds' office – where the pair both worked as advisers – after a night out drinking at Canberra bars with colleagues, and denies ever having sex with her.His barrister, Steven Whybrow, accused Higgins of being 'prepared to just say anything' and 'throwing other people under the bus' while highlighting what he said were inconsistencies in her evidence, adding Higgins told police she made doctors' appointments 'to make it sound more believable that she had been sexually assaulted'.
