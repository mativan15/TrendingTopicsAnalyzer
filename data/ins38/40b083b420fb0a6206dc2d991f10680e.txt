chaoss/iStock via Getty Images After observing the market's up-beat reaction to Pinduoduo's (NASDAQ:PDD) Q1 2022 earnings, I believe investors might have reason to believe that the stock's 15-month drawdown (-75% from ATH) could be coming to an end. Personally, I am bullish on Pinduoduo's pioneering business model and ongoing initiatives in agriculture technology, and thus I initiate my coverage on the stock with a Buy rating. I support my recommendation with a residual earnings framework based on analyst EPS consensus and set a base-case price target of $62.
