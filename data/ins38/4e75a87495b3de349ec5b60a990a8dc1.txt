The estimated project cost of the Executive Enclave which will house a new prime minister's office (PMO) has gone up by over Rs 100 crore to Rs 1,316 crore as the CPWD floated a fresh tender cancelling its earlier one, according to the agency's bid document. A Central Public Works Department official said the increased scope of work under the project, including additional information and communication technologies (ICT) components, has led to a marginal rise in the estimated cost. In its earlier tender, the CPWD had estimated the cost of construction and maintenance of the Executive Enclave at Rs 1,160.
