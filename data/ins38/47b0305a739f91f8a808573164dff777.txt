A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed on Monday before the Kerala High Court seeking a directive to the State government to take a decision on the recommendation of the State Law Reforms Commission for the enactment of Kerala Prevention of Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices, Sorcery, and Black Magic Bill. The petition filed by Kerala Yukthi Vadi Sanghom also sought a directive to the State government to constitute a special team to conduct a proper investigation or re-investigation into missing persons' cases reported during the last 50 years, against the backdrop of the double murders at Elanthoor.
