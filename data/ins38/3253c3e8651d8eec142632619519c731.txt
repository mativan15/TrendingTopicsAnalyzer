Shares of Allstate Corp. ALL, -11.45% tumbled Thursday, enough to pace the S&P 500 index's losers by a wide margin, after the insurer warned of a surprise third-quarter loss, amid weakness in its personal auto business. The company said late Wednesday that it expected a net loss of between $675 million and $725 million, and losses excluding nonrecurring items of between $400 million and $450 million. That compared with a the FactSet consensus of adjusted net income as of the end of September of $256.
