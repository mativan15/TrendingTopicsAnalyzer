Now he has to weigh up whether he can convince Britain's governing party he is the man to save it from chaos. The former finance minister was runner-up in the last contest to become Britain's prime minister which only concluded six weeks ago, despite being the most popular candidate amongst Conservative lawmakers in parliament.
