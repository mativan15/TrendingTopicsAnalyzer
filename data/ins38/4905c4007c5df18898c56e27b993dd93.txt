Frontier Airlines booked more than $900 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2022, about half of which came from fees. In its earnings report, it bragged about being able to squeeze out an extra $75 per passenger in 'ancillary' charges, a 33 percent increase from the same quarter pre-pandemic. Its net income was $13 million. Sit for a second on what that math means. 
'They'd be hugely unprofitable without the fees,' said George Ferguson, a senior aerospace, defense, and airline analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
