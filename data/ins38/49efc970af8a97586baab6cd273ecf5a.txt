WEST WARWICK – A special police task force seized an arsenal of guns and ammunition during raids this summer in West Warwick, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha.

The Urban Violent Crime Task Force's haul of more than three dozen firearms, including three fully automatic machine guns, led to the recent indictment of a West Warwick couple, Neronha said Tuesday morning.

The task force, he said, also seized five ghost guns, 23 kits for building ghost guns, a pistol with an obliterated serial number, 16 silencers and suppressors and 223 assorted magazines, including high-capacity drum-style magazines.
