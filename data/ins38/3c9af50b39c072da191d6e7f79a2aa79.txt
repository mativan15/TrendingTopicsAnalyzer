Heading into Monday night, NHL favorites that closed at -200 or higher were 12-1 to start the 2022-23 season. After Monday night, that record stands at 13-3. The New York Rangers took care of the Anaheim Ducks as -270 favorites, but the Penguins lost to the Canadiens after closing at -250, and the Leafs lost to the Coyotes, 4-2, despite going off at a ridiculous price of -550. Arizona's win was the third-biggest moneyline upset in the NHL since 2005-06.
Will we see more craziness on Tuesday night?
