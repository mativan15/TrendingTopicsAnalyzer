When an oil company invests in an expensive new drilling project today, it's taking a gamble. Even if the new well is a success, future government policies designed to slow climate change could make the project unprofitable or force it to shut down years earlier than planned.When that happens, the well and the oil become what's known as stranded assets. That might sound like the oil company's problem, but the company isn't the only one taking that risk.In a study published May 26, 2022, in the journal Nature Climate Change, we traced the ownership of over 43,000 oil and gas assets to reveal who ultimately loses from misguided investments that become stranded.
