Oct. 21—The Joni and Brandi show is coming to the Gorge.

The highlight of June's Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island was the "Joni Jam," which featured Joni Mitchell's first full set in more than 22 years.

Brandi Carlile helped put the surprise event together. The singer-songwriter, who hails from Western Washington, is assembling another Joni Jam for June 10 at the Gorge Amphitheatre. Carlile will open the show. She also will perform her annual Echoes Through the Canyon concert on June 9 with special guests to be named later.
