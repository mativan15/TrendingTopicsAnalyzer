"Owned and administered by CoinSwitch, CRE8 tracks the performance of eight crypto assets that represent over 85 per cent of the total market capitalisation of cryptos traded in Indian Rupee. The index is based on real trades on the CoinSwitch app, trusted by 18 million registered users," the company said.
