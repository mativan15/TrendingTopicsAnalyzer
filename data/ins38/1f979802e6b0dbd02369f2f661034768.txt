Kevin Spacey testified in his own defense on Monday, often crying on the stand as he vehemently disputed allegations he sexually assaulted actor Anthony Rapp four decades ago—while offering up a series of shocking claims about his past.

For starters, the House of Cards actor promptly told the jury that his father was a neo-Nazi.

'My father was a white supremacist and neo-Nazi,' Spacey said in Manhattan federal court, adding that he would listen to 'hours and hours' of his beliefs.
