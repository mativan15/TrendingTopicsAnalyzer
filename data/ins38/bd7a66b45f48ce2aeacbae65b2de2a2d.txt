There's also one other thing leading to where they were picked at SEC Media Days.

FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Arkansas coach Eric Musselman isn't getting too excited about the media picking them No. 2 at media days in Birmingham, Ala.

For a team with 11 newcomers to the Razorbacks it's not about what they've done.

"There's really great respect for our six freshmen and the transfers that have come in," Musselman said at the podium Wednesday afternoon.

After coaching the Hogs to back-to-back Elite Eight appearances, a lot of it has to do with respecting what he's built here in a short time.
