When people ask me why on earth I would spend £390 on Harry Styles tickets for his Wembley Arena shows in June, I fight the urge to tell them that they just couldn't possibly understand.After watching Styles through my phone and computer screens, with smashing performances at Coachella and Radio 1's Big Weekend in the last few weeks, I feel even more excited at finally seeing him live after all these years.If you dedicated many of your teenage years to One Direction like me, but missed out on the chance of going to their concert, then you might just know how I feel.
