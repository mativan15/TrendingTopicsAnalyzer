Anthony Martial will not be available for Manchester United's Premier League meeting with Tottenham Hotspur but Christian Eriksen could return to face his former club.

Martial has missed nine of United's 13 games this season through injury and is yet to recover from a back problem suffered during the recent win at Everton.

Erik ten Hag had hoped to welcome the 27-year-old back for Sunday's goalless draw with Newcastle but he is still recovering, having already struggled with hamstring and Achilles issues since the start of the campaign.
