Pennsylvania Crime Solvers and the Beaver County Crime Solvers are temporarily offering an increased reward in hopes of finding a local man who disappeared over a decade ago.

Investigators are offering a reward of $10,000 from Oct. 20-27 for information on the disappearance of Kenneth Williams, who has been missing since May 2011. Investigators believe Williams may have been the victim of foul play, but have not been able to determine what happened to him after his car was found out of state.

"Foul play is definitely expected in this case, just based on the information that we know," said Timmie Patrick, a detective with the Beaver County detectives working on Williams' case.
