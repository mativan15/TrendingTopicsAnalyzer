Once again, Herschel Walker's story regarding an abortion he allegedly paid for appears to be changing.
In an interview with NBC News, the Georgia senate candidate seemed to acknowledge that he did in fact send a $700 check to an ex-girlfriend that she used to reimburse the cost of the procedure. 'Yes, that's my check,' Walker said after being shown a copy of the document in question.

Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker sat down for an exclusive interview with @kwelkernbc and addressed allegations he paid for an ex-girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009.
