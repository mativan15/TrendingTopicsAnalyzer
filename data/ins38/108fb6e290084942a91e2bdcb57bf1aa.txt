MINNEAPOLIS — The Wild won't be the last team to win in the NHL this season.They avoided that distinction after rallying 4-3 in overtime against the Canucks on Thursday in front of 17,323 at Xcel Energy Center to snap their season-opening three-game losing streak.Kirill Kaprizov scored during a delayed penalty 3 minutes, 2 seconds into overtime to extend Vancouver's rut (0-3-2) and prevent coach Bruce Boudreau from snagging his 600th victory.After trailing or being tied in all three previous games, the Wild picked up their first lead 4:37 into the first period on a Mats Zuccarello shot, the exclamation point on a strong start by the Wild that saw them outshoot the Canucks 8-0.
