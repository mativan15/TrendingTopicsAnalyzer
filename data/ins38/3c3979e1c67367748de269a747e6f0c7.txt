Israel has not benefited from teaching core subjects such as math and English to Israeli youth in secular schools, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) chairman Yitzchak Goldknopf argued on Channel 12's Meet The Press program aired on Saturday evening.

In his interview, the new UTJ head claimed math and English studies had no effect on Israel's economy in an attempt to justify the lack of these subjects in haredi (ultra-Orthodox) schools across Israel.

" Haredi schools are denied their budgets by the government because they don't teach English and math.
