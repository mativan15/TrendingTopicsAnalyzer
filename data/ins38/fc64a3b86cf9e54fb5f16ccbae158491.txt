Published: 00:44 EDT, 27 May 2022 | Updated: 00:45 EDT, 27 May 2022 New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged Harvard graduates not to cancel people they disagree with in her commencement speech at the college.Speaking at the Massachusetts college Thursday, Ardern, 41, urged the Ivy League graduates to pursue 'genuine debate and dialogue' to keep conversations and 'solutions' going instead of ending in a dead-end. 'If we don't find, once again, our ability to argue our corners - yes, with the passion and fire that conviction brings, but without the vitriol, hate, and violence; if we don't find a way to ensure difference - that space where perspectives, experiences, and debate give rise to understanding and compromise - [and] doesn't instead become division,' she said on Thursday.
