(Bloomberg) -- N26 will start offering cryptocurrency trading to its customers via a partnership with Bitpanda GmbH following similar moves by the digital bank's peers. The product will be offered in Bitpanda's home market of Austria first and then rolled out more broadly in the next six months, the Berlin-based company said in a statement on Thursday. Customers will be able to trade 100 coins at the start, and N26 said it plans to have almost 200 available in the coming month. N26 is following rivals -- including Revolut Ltd.
