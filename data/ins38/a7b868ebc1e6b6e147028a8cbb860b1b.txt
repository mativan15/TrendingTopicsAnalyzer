'The R655 is the best TCL 6-Series TV yet.' Pros Punchy HDR brightness and color Minimal backlight blooming Good motion resolution Great viewing angles Intuitive Roku interface Cons Requires adjustment for best picture Struggles to clean up low-quality content Another year, another outstanding TCL 6-Series TV.
