Enraged over the killing of 48-year-old Puran Krishan Bhat in Shopian, the Kashmiri Pandit community has strongly criticised lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha and government for alleged 'laxity in checking targeted killings of Kashmiri Hindus in the valley.'In a fresh attack, terrorists on Saturday gunned down Bhat, who owned an apple orchard in the Shopian district.'If the Centre wants to initiate any measure for us, it should be a permanent settlement of the community and nothing else. To take us back to Kashmir and settle us in rural areas at the mercy of gun-trotting terrorists is impossible for us,' said a visibly angry relative of Bhat outside his Muthi residence on the outskirts of Jammu city on Sunday.
