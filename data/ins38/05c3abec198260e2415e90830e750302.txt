After wide receiver Julio Jones' money officially comes off the books on Thursday, the Tennessee Titans have approximately $13.5 million in cap space, per Over the Cap.

Not only did the Titans release Jones, but the organization parted ways with cornerback Janoris Jenkins and left guard Rodger Saffold, to name a few.

The moves allowed Tennessee to keep key players such as outside linebacker Harold Landry and center Ben Jones, and trade for wide receiver Robert Woods and sign tight end Austin Hooper.
