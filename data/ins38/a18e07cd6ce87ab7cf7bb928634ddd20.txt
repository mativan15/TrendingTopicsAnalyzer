Brooklyn Beckham was left with tears streaming down his face as he tried a new online challenge that some warn is ‘dangerous'.
The 23-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham has carved out an impressive social media following of his own as he dabbles in cooking and shares updates on his life with wife Nicola Peltz.
Having previously gone viral for showcasing his cooking skills with a pizza that left fans – especially those of Italian descent – unimpressed, Brooklyn has now tried his hand at a new challenge: eating an insanely hot potato chip.
