A 58-year-old man is facing a list of charges after he threatened staff at a Sault Ste. Marie business with a weapon and then got into a stand-off with police at his home Tuesday. "Around 1:20 p.m., the accused attended a business in the 600-block of Second Line West and threatened staff with what the victims described as a gun, then fled the area to his residence in the 800-block of Cooper Street," Sault police said in a news release Wednesday morning. The man did not comply with officers' demands to exit the home, so the emergency services unit (ESU) was brought in to contain the area.
