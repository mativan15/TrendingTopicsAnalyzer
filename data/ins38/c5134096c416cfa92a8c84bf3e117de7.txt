Centre County prosecutors dropped all charges Tuesday against an ex-Advance Auto Parts employee who was accused of threatening to kill his former coworkers and placing phone calls to prompt a police response.

Prosecutors abandoned the case against Leslie P. Scott, 40, eight days after he was arrested. He was released Tuesday from the Centre County Correctional Facility.

Scott, of Benner Township, maintained his innocence and passed a polygraph test Monday, Centre County First Assistant Public Defender Lora Rupert said Tuesday.
