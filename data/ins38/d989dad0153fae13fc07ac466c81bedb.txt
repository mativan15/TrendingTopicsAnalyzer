In a video posted on May 2 to her TikTok account, Addie Neri raved to her followers about Jones Road Beauty's What the Foundation tinted moisture balm. 'I will be posting about this every single day,' she told her followers. 'Love it even more than I did yesterday!'Neri's TikTok bio describes her as a newlywed and a dog mom, her interests: beauty, fashion, family. By the app's beauty influencer standards, Neri's 16.1K follower count is comparatively modest. Yet she was able to make upward of $560 with that video.
