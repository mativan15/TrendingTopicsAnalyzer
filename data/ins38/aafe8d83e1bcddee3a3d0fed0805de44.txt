A U.S. Army counter-intelligence officer named Huerta Huerta was the on-the-ground operative in San Antonio, Texas coordinating Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' migrant flights to various locations across the U.S., according to a new report from the Miami Herald.

Huerta allegedly recruited a migrant named Emmanuel (who did not reveal his last name) from a group of tents behind a San Antonio McDonald's near the city's main shelter for incoming migrants. According to the Herald's reporting, Huerta paid Emmanuel in cash to recruit fellow migrants to get on the planes chartered by Florida Gov.
