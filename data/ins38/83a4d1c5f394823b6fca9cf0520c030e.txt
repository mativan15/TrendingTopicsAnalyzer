With hours left to go before the end of the provincial election campaign, Ontario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner made a second and final stop in London on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to secure voters in hotly contested London North Centre.
London North Centre has emerged as a battleground riding in the province, and is expected to be a close race on Thursday. Ontario's four main political parties have all made the riding a main stop during the election campaign.Schreiner was joined early Wednesday afternoon by the party's four London-area candidates, including London North Centre's Carol Dyck, and other party supporters at the corner of Oxford Street and Wharncliffe Road for a brief campaign stop and media Q&A.
