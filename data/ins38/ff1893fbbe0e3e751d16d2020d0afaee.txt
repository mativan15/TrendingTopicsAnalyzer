By Xavier Fontdegloria Manufacturing activity in Texas contracted in May for the first time since July 2020 despite an acceleration in production, a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed Tuesday. The production index of the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey--a key measure of state manufacturing conditions--increased to 18.8 in May from 10.8 in April. The indicator signals that factory output grew, as a positive reading indicates expansion. However, manufacturing activity as a whole fell over the month.
