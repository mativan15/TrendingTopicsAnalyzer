As a reminder in the throws of football season, college basketball is just around the corner. In fact, the Associated Press preseason college basketball poll was released early this week and Ohio State will start the season in the 'others receiving votes' category.
On the outside looking in, it makes some sense for voters to be underwhelmed about what Buckeye hoops can be this season. The program lost a ton of talent with Malaki Branham and E.J. Liddell heading off to the NBA and many others either transferring or graduating, so the turnover leaves a lot of unanswered questions.
