The archbishop of Canterbury has delivered a critique of tax cuts for the wealthy saying he is 'deeply sceptical' of trickle-down economics and could see 'no moral case' for a government setting budgets that disproportionately affect the poor.In an interview with the Guardian while on his tour of Australia, Justin Welby said that although he did not wish to be party political he could not see why the rich should be given more money, as they were more likely to simply save rather than spend the extra pounds.
