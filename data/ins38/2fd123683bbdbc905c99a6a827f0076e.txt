President Joe Biden took off the gloves Friday in a speech pummeling Republican lawmakers who backed massive federal subsidies for business owners, including themselves, during COVID-19 but are now complaining about his student debt forgiveness program.

'Who in the hell do they think they are?' Biden asked to applause during an appearance at Delaware State University, where 75% of students are recipients of Pell Grants geared toward lower-income college applicants.

'I don't want to hear it from MAGA Republicans who had hundreds of thousands of dollars of debts, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief loans forgiven, who are now attacking me for helping working-class and middle-class Americans,' he railed.
