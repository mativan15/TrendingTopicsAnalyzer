After the dramatic collapse of its shares in late April, spurred by higher-than-expected losses, Teladoc Health (TDOC 4.25%) is down by more than 66% year to date. And with the pandemic no longer completely blocking people from getting in-person healthcare, it's reasonable to be worried about the ongoing appeal of telehealth services.
Likewise, Teladoc's latest earnings update is painting a picture of an increasingly unprofitable business, where growth is always just over the horizon. Is there any hope for shareholders, or are the company's issues just growing pains?
