Hitachi Rail, the global rail company contracted to build the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's next fleet of rail cars, wants to partner with local colleges and universities to produce the engineers, technicians and other talent it will need at its new manufacturing facility in Hagerstown.

Andrew Barr, the chief executive at London-based Hitachi Rail, said it's a strategy the company has employed at its manufacturing hubs in other parts of the world.

'It's certainly something that I very strongly believe in as CEO,' Barr said in an interview with the Washington Business Journal.
