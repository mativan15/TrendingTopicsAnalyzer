The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) is creating a permanent gallery to showcase the work of young artists. To date, the exhibition ‘Through the Eyes of a Child' has been an annual six-week event, showcasing some of the art created by the hundreds of young students who take classes at WAG studios. Now, the WAG is working to establish a permanent gallery that would feature up to 52 exhibits each year, with each exhibit created and curated by the kids. 'We pivoted to something we feel is going to have a larger impact and be able to incorporate more students into the process,' said Cara Mason, learning and programs coordinator for the WAG, in an interview on Thursday.
