Collider.com Relationships come and go, but brotherly friendships? That's a different story. Taking place on a peaceful, remote island off the coast of lively Ireland, The Banshees of Inisherin is a tale of two best friends whose lifelong friendship suddenly comes to an end. The worst part? There's no particular reason why. One half of the leading duo, Pádraic, is shocked to the bone when his ex-buddy Colm decides to end things between them. With the help of his sister Siobhan, and fellow island resident Dominic, Pádraic is about to have a shocking realization about his best friend.
