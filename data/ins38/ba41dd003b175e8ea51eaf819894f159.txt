STORY: An armed anti-junta group claimed responsibility for the attack at Insein Prison in a statement posted on social media, saying it was "retaliation against (junta chief) Min Aung Hlaing".

State-owned MRTV said the explosions were caused by "mines inside parcels" that killed three prison officers and five visitors and wounded 18 people. A wounded witness said gunfire also broke out after the bombs exploded at the parcel counter.

Myanmar has been in chaos since the military overthrew an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party, and launched a brutal crackdown on dissent.
