The National Health Authority (NHA) on Friday said the government's 'eSanjeevani' telemedicine service has been integrated with the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM). This integration allows the existing eSanjeevani users to easily create their Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) and use it to link and manage their existing health records, the NHA said. The users would also be able to share their health records with doctors on eSanjeevani leading to better clinical decision making and ensuring the continuum of care.
