 MINNEAPOLIS — Flooding in northern Minnesota is threatening a renowned environmentalist's retreat. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Thursday that flooding is threatening many properties in the Rainy River Basin. Rainy Lake just outside of International Falls is expected to rise another foot in the next few days and break a 1950 record. Resort, cabin and business owners across the region have been filling sandbags for days. One of the properties is environmentalist Ernest Oberholtzer's retreat on Mallard Island.
