Another day, another contentious debate in a battleground state — this time, Tuesday night's Florida Senate debate between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic Rep. Val Demings. As NBC News' Shaquille Brewster, Kailani Koenig and Zoë Richards reported, the two candidates repeatedly interrupted each other and landed personal attacks on a variety of issues, including the economy, immigration, their effectiveness as legislators and abortion. In one exchange that typified the night, Rubio blasted Demings as ineffective: 'She's never passed a single bill,' he said.
