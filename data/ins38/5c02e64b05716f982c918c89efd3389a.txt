AgenciesREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGEChina has asked its state-owned gas importers to stop reselling liquefied natural gas (LNG) to buyers in Europe and Asia as it seeks to ensure its own supply for the winter season, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. China's National Development and Reform Commission has asked PetroChina Co, Sinopec and Cnooc Ltd to keep winter cargoes for domestic use, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
 The commission could not be reached for comment. PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
