There are a million reasons trainer Richard Gibson hopes Navas Two can return to winning ways at Sha Tin on Sunday. The four-year-old, who runs in the Class Two Beas River Handicap (1,400m), will receive a HK$1 million high achievement bonus if he makes his way into the winner's enclosure this weekend. As a private purchase (previously raced galloper) who started his Hong Kong career on a rating of 74 or less, Navas Two is eligible for the bonus if he manages to win at Class Two level before reaching the age of five.
