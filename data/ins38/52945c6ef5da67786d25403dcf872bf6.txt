President Biden is set to announce a plan on Wednesday to sell off the last of the country's emergency oil stocks and refill reserves once prices drop. He desires to add enough to the supply to prevent a sharp spike in prices while also allowing the government to step in as a buyer if the market price falls too low.The Democrats are focused on keeping inflation low as the midterm elections are fast approaching.There is a risk that President Biden's party could lose control of Congress after votes are cast on November 8.
