Jun. 2—NORWICH — Is your dog sort of medium in size, tan and white, with a bulldog or boxer-type face, short ears and coat, and perhaps a brave heart?

Enter your dog in the Sgt. Stubby Look-Alike Contest at 10 a.m. Saturday at the Norwichtown Green for the chance to win approximately a year's worth of dog food and parade around the green wearing a replica of the World War I uniform jacket the real war dog hero Stubby wore in France during World War I.

The Norwich World War I Memorial Committee is hosting the contest as part of its effort to tell the lesser-known stories of the war and raise money for the restoration of Norwich's war prize: a captured German howitzer cannon.
