High constitutional functionaries, from the President of India to government Ministers, need not depend on the state machinery to prosecute his or her defamer, the Supreme Court held in a judgment on Monday. A constitutional functionary can choose to shed the identity of his high office and don the role of a private citizen to prosecute damaging comments made about his public functions in office.Justice V. Ramasubramanian, who authored the verdict, also said a political rival's challenge to a public office holder that he would 'expose' the latter's 'scam' would not amount to defamation.
