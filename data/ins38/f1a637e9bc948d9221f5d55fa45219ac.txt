The Porter County Council Tuesday night finished appropriating the American Rescue Plan Act grant money, making it part of the 2023 county budget and settling on a compromise that gives to nonprofits while still funding pay increases, infrastructure needs and the brunt of the renovation work at the Memorial Opera House.

In a bit of reverse order the $18.6 million in county projects not originally planned for the money will go before the Board of Commissioners at its next meeting for approval.

Nonprofits recommended by the commissioners for a portion of the ARPA money will still get sizable funding, though the amounts have been reduced.
