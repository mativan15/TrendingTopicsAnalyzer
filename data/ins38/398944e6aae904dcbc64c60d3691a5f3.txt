CHILD benefit is paid to anyone with kids until they are 16-years-old, or 20 if they stay in education.
Millions of parents get the benefit each year which can boost income by hundreds of pounds.

The benefit is worth £21.80 for the eldest child and £14.45 for subsequent children each week.
Child Benefit is usually paid every four weeks on a Monday or Tuesday.
But you can have the money paid weekly if you're a single parent or getting certain other benefits like Income Support.
