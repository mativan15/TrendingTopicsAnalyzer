BRIAN KENNY: The Barkley Hotel and Spa in Ohio is one of the most exclusive and luxurious hotels of its kind with reservations booked up to a year in advance.

That's right. The Barkley is a dog spa and its very existence is evidence that pet owners spare no expense when it comes to their furry friends.
