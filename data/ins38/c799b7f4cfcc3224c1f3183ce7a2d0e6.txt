REUTERS/Jeenah MoonOct 18 (Reuters) - Mobileye, Intel's (INTC.O) self-driving car unit, targets a valuation of nearly $16 billion in its initial public offering in the United States, a regulatory filing on Tuesday showed.Mobileye's initial public offering follows Porsche's (P911_p.DE) blockbuster debut in Europe and could be an early sign of improving investor sentiment.The move sets the stage for what is expected to be one of the biggest technology listings of this year amid a market rout that has sapped the appetite for deals, as companies struggle with rising interest rates and increased investor scrutiny on profitability after a stellar 2021.
