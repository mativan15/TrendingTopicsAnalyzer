BeReal is being overrun by major social media companies, and there is little it can do about it.

BeReal, a social media startup based in France, prompts users once each day to take photos of whatever they are doing using the front and back cameras of their phones.

It has around 10 million active users—the largest portion comes from the U.S.—and 130 employees according to its LinkedIn page.
