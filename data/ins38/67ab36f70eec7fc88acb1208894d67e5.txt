The country's biggest supermarket chain has raised the price for its popular lunchtime meal deal for the first time in more than a decade as costs soar.Tesco revealed that the package, typically a sandwich, packet of crisps and a soft drink, would rise from £3.50 to £3.90 for customers who are not Clubcard holders.
For Clubcard members, who account for 70% of meal deal customers, the price go up to £3.40 from £3.The change reflects the surging cost of ingredients, manufacturing and transport because of Russia's war in Ukraine, which forced up energy and many core commodity prices.
