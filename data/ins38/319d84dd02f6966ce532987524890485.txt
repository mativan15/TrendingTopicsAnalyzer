Nearly four decades after Buffalo Bill's Brewery debuted as one of the first brewpubs in America, the Bay Area business has closed its doors.  In a lengthy goodbye message posted on Instagram, owner and master brewer Geoff Harries announced on Thursday that the road he chose many years ago was coming to an end. He told SFGATE via email that closing Buffalo Bill's has been one of the most challenging decisions of his life. 'For 33 years I've risked everything to succeed and to preserve Buffalo Bill's, but this time was different,' Harries said.
