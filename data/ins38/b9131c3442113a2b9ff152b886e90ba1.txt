Donna and Ken Buskell are among residents of a seniors housing co-op reeling after a water pipe burst in the complex and forced them out with no return date in sight. It happened Tuesday afternoon. Residents were told a pipe in the building's sprinkler system burst after freezing overnight. 'There was insulation and ice cold water, about a foot, all over everywhere in the house,' Donna Buskell told CTV News Thursday. Many of the building's 36 suites were flooded, and the ceiling in Buskell's bedroom – where Ken was napping at the time – collapsed.
