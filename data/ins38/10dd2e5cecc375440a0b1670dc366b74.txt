Thanks to the Urus SUV, it's possible to tow a Lamborghini with another Lamborghini. That being said, the Lambo truck, put bluntly, is largely an Audi Q8 underneath. Yes, the Urus has a bunch of incredible upgrades that make it worthy of carrying the Lamborghini badge, but it uses the same basic chassis as the Audi crossover. YouTuber Alex Choi wanted to prove a point that yes, you can tow a Lamborghini with a real Lamborghini. And he used his personal Huracán to do it.
