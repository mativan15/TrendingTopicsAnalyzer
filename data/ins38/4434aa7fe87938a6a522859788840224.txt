(Bloomberg) -- One of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's longest-serving economic advisers said progressive governments need to reckon with the unequal impact of inflation, arguing it requires carefully-targeted spending.Tyler Meredith, who left government last month after nearly seven years, warned that Canada's 40-year-high inflation rate 'hurts, most importantly, the people at the bottom end of the income distribution.' It therefore risks undermining Trudeau policies that have sought to reduce wealth inequality.
