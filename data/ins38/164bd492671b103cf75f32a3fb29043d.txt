Electric commercial vehicle maker Altigreen is looking to raise Rs 800-1000 crore next year to fund its expansion plans in the local market. Altigreen, which raised Rs 300 crore from Reliance Industries and four venture capital funds earlier in February this year, will utilize the resources to build scale, develop charging infrastructure, increase product portfolio and supply chain over the next couple of years.

Altigreen cofounder Amitabh Saran told ET the company has partially deployed the resources raised earlier this year to increase production capacity.
