The recently concluded hit K-drama Little Women is a hard act to follow, but period drama Under the Queen's Umbrella – also showing on Netflix – has just launched in the former's slot on South Korean TV and achieved the highest ratings of any drama this year. That is testament to Kim Hye-soo's magnetism as one of the country's biggest stars. Kim plays Queen Im Hwa-ryeong, the mother of a crown prince during the rule of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) in Korea. When a sudden illness sidelines her son, a desperate race ensues among his fellow princes to become a cohort – and thereby second in line to the throne after the crown prince.
