GENEVA — 
U.N. human rights officials have condemned Iran's violent suppression of anti-government protests as a violation of international law and call on Iranian officials to end their deadly crackdown against peaceful demonstrators. A month has passed since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini sparked nationwide protests against the Iranian government. Amini was arrested by the so-called morality police for improper wearing of the hijab and died three days later on September 16 while in police custody.
