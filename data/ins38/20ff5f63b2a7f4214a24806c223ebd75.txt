'I want it all,' said Jaime Zehner, waiting for her car at the valet outside the Jenni Kayne Hillside Haven home tour in L.A.'s Brentwood neighborhood last week.

All — as in the whole seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom house decorated to showcase the Jenni Kayne brand's growing world, from the bestselling $4,295 Pacific beds upstairs to the $3,596 flax linen Miramar chaises in the basement screening room, the cashmere sweaters, slipdresses and knot leather mules in the walk-in closet and the brand's new Oak Essentials beauty products stocked in the bathrooms.
