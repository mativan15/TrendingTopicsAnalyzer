By Dean Seal The founder and former chief executive of SCWorx Corp. has been charged with securities fraud for allegedly misleading investors about the company's procurement of Covid-19 rapid test kits early in the pandemic. The U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday that Marc Schessel, 62, has been indicted for allegedly claiming in April 2020 that SCWorx would buy and resell at least 48 million tests despite the fact that the company had not secured a legitimate supplier or executed a purchase agreement.
