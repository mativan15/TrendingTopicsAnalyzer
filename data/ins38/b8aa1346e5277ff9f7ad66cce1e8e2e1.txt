Investors tend to overvalue novelty and undervalue durability, or so the esteemed American finance professor Jeremy Siegel argues. The scholar's thesis is one grasped by star stock picker Nick Train as manager of the Finsbury Growth & Income Trust — buy UK-listed companies with brands or franchises that have endured and hold them for the long-term in the hope of generating strong compound returns.The shift from tech stocks and companies with high leverage towards stronger cashflows, which has been precipitated as inflation and interest rates have risen, make the Finsbury approach even more pertinent to investors.
