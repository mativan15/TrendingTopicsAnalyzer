Ajmer, a construction labourer in Haryana's Jind, had applied for financial assistance for his daughter's wedding, under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board scheme, in July 2020. His daughter is now eight-month pregnant, but his wait for the aid seems endless.As per the last communication from the welfare board, his application was processed only 30%, said the 48-year-old. Sukhbir Singh, Bhawan Nirman Kamgaar Union president of Haryana unit, said the board had extended financial assistance to the construction workers under various schemes but the prolonged delays in processing the applications had defeated the purpose of these welfare schemes.
