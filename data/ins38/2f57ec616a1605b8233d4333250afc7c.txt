Bukayo Saka made it four goals in three games for Arsenal after netting the only goal in a 1-0 win over Leeds and he fits into the midfield three with Mount and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg after his "outrageous" finish at Elland Road, as described by Crooks.The one odd choice of the weekend is that Crooks chose Lisandro Martinez, who is going from strength to strength under Erik ten Hag at United, as a left-back.The Argentinian star has clearly been a fine performer despite United's disappointing goalless draw at home to Newcastle but only as a centre-back, so Crooks' inclusion suggests he had simply run out of room at this point.
