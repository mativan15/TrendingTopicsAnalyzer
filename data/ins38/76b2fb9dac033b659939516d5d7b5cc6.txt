Ofcom, the UK's soon-to-be social media harms watchdog under incoming Online Safety legislation, has warned tech platforms that they are failing to take women's safety seriously.

Publishing new research (PDF) into the nation's online habits today, Ofcom said it has found that female Internet users in the UK are less confident about their online safety than men, as well as being more affected by discriminatory, hateful and trolling content.

Its study, which involved the regulator polling some 6,000 Brits to understand their online experiences and habits, also indicates that women feel less able to have a voice and share their opinions on the web than male counterparts -- and that's despite another finding from the study that women tend to be more avid users of the Internet and major social media services.
