Bengaluru: Roll-up ecommerce firm Mensa Brands, founded by former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan, is expanding into international markets, including the United States, Middle East and Canada, after hitting a net revenue run rate of Rs 1,500 crore ($200 million) in its first year of operations. Net revenue run rate is the sale value of goods excluding returns and discounts. This comes at a time when the roll-up commerce sector is facing headwinds, with the likes of US-based Thrasio cutting costs amid a change of chief executive.
