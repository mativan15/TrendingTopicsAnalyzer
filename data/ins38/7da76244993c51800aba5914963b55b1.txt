Albemarle (ALB) closed -3.8% in Tuesday's trading but gained 35% for the month, according to Barron's, highlighted by the company's big guidance hike that came just three weeks since management issued previous guidance. Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) jumped 28.8% in May, and nearly 70% YTD, reaping big benefits from higher oil prices; the stock kept climbing last week even as some analysts said it had become a bit frothy (I, II).
