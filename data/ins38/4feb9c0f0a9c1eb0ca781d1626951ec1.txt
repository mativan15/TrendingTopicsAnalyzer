Kevin Spacey has said he plans to "voluntarily appear" before British courts after he was accused of a series of sexual assault offenses against three men in the U.K.The troubled actor, 62, has stated that he is "confident" that he can prove his innocence after he was last week charged with four counts of sexual assault, as well as another sexual offense. The charges against Spacey were authorized by prosecutors last week but he can only be formally charged after an arrest in England or Wales, the Washington Post reported.
