By Maria Martinez Material shortages in the German manufacturing sector could persist over a longer period of time than previously expected, the Ifo Institute said Tuesday. "To some extent, this reflects lasting developments that are the result of global changes in the structure of production, such as the increasing demand for semiconductors or industrial raw materials," Ifo's researcher Joachim Ragnitz said in a report. Only part of the shortages are due to a chain of crises that will hopefully ease in the coming months, as the pandemic or the war in Ukraine, he said.
