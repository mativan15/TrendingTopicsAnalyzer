AgenciesThe healthcare sector is exempt from GST. The tax authorities have also faced off with some other institutes that claim to provide wellness services.Health check-ups of employees organised by companies and conducted by doctors and nurses should be regarded as a medical service and should not face goods and services tax, an Appellate Authority of Advance Ruling (AAAR) has said. The ruling is set to benefit many companies and even associations that tie up or rope in hospitals and doctors for routine check-ups within or outside hospital premises.
