Chattrawutt/iStock via Getty Images Update & Thesis Back in June, I wrote a piece comparing Match Group (MTCH) and Spark Networks (NASDAQ:LOV). In summary, I gave Match a "hold" since I disliked the company but didn't have enough of a reason to initiate a bearish view. I gave Spark a "sell" based on their business models and income statements. Match is down 41% since the publication and Spark is down 45%. While both stocks have decreased in value, I will credit the bear market for the decline instead of my foresight.
