After all, they tend to be fairly low margin in nature and they are susceptible to significant amounts of competition. One player that has done surprisingly well recently, however, at least from a revenue and share price perspective, is Lancaster Colony Corporation (NASDAQ:LANC). This producer of frozen breads, refrigerated dressings, dips, croutons, and a variety of other offerings, has held up quite well in this environment.
