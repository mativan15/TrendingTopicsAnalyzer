Imagine walking up to your terrace, plucking a few tomatoes for  rasam, some ladies finger for  curry, a ridge gourd or two for  kootu and cooking your meal. That's what 39-year-old Thayumanavan Gunabalan has been at for years now. A professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Panruti, Mr. Gunabalan buys only onions and garlic from the market. From sweet potatoes to lemon grass and tomatoes to chillies, his terrace garden yields a terrific harvest almost throughout the year.When vegetable prices were soaring this month, some terrace gardeners barely felt the pinch as they could sustain pretty well without having to rely much on the market produce.
