One of few good news items in a very grim week was the rediscovery, in Lowestoft, of a vast treasure trove of 'lost gem' vintage radio recordings from the 1950s and 1960s. Chief among them was the long-missed episode The Marriage Bureau from the first season of Hancock's Half Hour, unheard since it aired in 1955. There was real excitement surrounding this find, long regarded as a 'Holy Grail' by the kind of modern-day knights errant who spend their leisure hours sifting through damp cardboard boxes of cassette tapes at car boot sales.
