By Kirsten Mitchell October 19, 2022 / 6:35 PM / CBS Minnesota MINNEAPOLIS – Wednesday marked three weeks since Hurricane Ian tore across Florida. The Category 4 storm made landfall with sustained winds of 150 mph, killing more than 100 people. The total cost of damage is still being added up, but officials say it will be in the billions and will take months, or years, for some places to recover."I keep telling people you can imagine your worst thing, make it worse, and it's still probably not right," said Bonita Beach resident Christine Warsop.
