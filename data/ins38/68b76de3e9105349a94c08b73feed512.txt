The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, a broader measure of inflation and the Fed's preferred target, rose by 6.2pc in the year to August.
Ms Mester added: "It's about balancing the two goals, but it's also about balancing over time. We're in a very, very high inflation environment. This is not even in a case where you could say: let's let inflation go a little bit higher because it might help you on the labour market. 
The longer inflation stays at these excessively high levels, the higher the chances that it actually becomes embedded in the psychology of people.
