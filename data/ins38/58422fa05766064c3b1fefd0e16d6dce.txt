Last week it appeared despite early turbulence, that everything was at least pointed in the right direction for Notre Dame, who had won three-straight games and had a favorable schedule coming up.

Then Stanford, who hadn't beaten an FBS opponent in over 12 full months, came to South Bend and handed the Irish one of their worst losses in recent memory.

Obviously things are not all OK after this for Notre Dame, who now sits at 3-3 overall and having trips to unbeaten Syracuse, and one-loss USC remaining while unbeaten Clemson is due in South Bend the first weekend of November.
