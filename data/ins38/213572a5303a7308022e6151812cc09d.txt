When Mark*, 32, first moved into supported accommodation in Birmingham, other tenants would steal his plates and cutlery from the kitchen, and people would knock on his door daily asking for drugs.'There was no support. Someone would come in but they did nothing. They didn't go into your cupboard and say ‘you've got nothing in here, we should help you',' he said. 'I was suicidal at that time, I had a lot going on in my life.'Others had it worse, he said. People who were new to the city and had no support network, of which there were many, were often picked on.
