Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a federal jury Thursday that Tom Barrack — a longtime friend of former President Donald Trump charged with acting as an undisclosed agent of the United Arab Emirates — had sided against his supposed patrons during the 2017 blockade of Qatar.The UAE, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries had severed diplomatic ties and cut off land, air and sea access to Qatar, after accusing the tiny Gulf state of supporting terrorism and Islamists in the region, and of cultivating close relations with Iran.
