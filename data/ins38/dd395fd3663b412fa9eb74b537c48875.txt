With star wide receiver Tyrese Chambers out due to injury, a young quarterback making just his fifth career start and a banged-up offensive line running extremely low on depth, it's no wonder the FIU Panthers were held down on Friday night.

Texas-San Antonio, the reigning Conference USA champions and winners of 20 of their past 25 games, defeated host FIU 30-10.

It was a 'moral victory' for the Panthers, who entered the game as 33-point underdogs. In fact, FIU played UTSA to a scoreless draw in the first quarter.
