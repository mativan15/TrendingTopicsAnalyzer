The numbers: A closely-watched barometer of business conditions at service-oriented companies such as banks, retailers and hospitals fell 1.2 percentage points to 55.9 in May, the Institute for Supply Management said Friday. This is the lowest reading since February 2021. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a reading of 56.7%. Numbers over 50% are viewed as positive for the economy and anything over 55% is considered exceptional. Key details: The decline was led by a decline in business activity and slowing supplier deliveries.
