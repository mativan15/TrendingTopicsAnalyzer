Sony's marketing arrangement with Activision, for Call Of Duty, will apparently keep it from Xbox Game Pass for several years.
If it's approved, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is not expected to go through until 2023 at the absolute earliest. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the company can start doing anything it wants with Activision's IPs, especially Call Of Duty.
You all know by now that Microsoft has to keep releasing future Call Of Duty titles for PlayStation consoles due to a contract between Sony and Activision.
