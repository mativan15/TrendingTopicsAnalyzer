The Department of Education (DepEd) said on Monday the country is ready for a full and nationwide implementation of the face-to-face classes next year, but the modalities may still vary depending on their locations. At the Laging Handa Public briefing, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said around 73.28 percent of the total number of public schools have already been deemed qualified for in-person learning. 'In the next academic school year, we're expecting that the face-to-face implementation will be fully 100 percent, but again, I just want to emphasize that the modalities of face-to-face vary in every situation in schools, depending on their local governments,' she said.
