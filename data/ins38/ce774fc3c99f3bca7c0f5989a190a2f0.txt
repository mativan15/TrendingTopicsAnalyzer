A recent analysis conducted by a Savannah nonprofit revealed bail reform in Chatham County won't happen unless there are changes to county ordinances. And while that may be useful, it will have little effect on people charged with nonviolent misdemeanor offenses who are also charged with violent offenses.

Criminal justice and youth nonprofit Deep Center conducted the analysis and released a report of its findings, examining the Chatham County Detention Center population, including charges by defendant and jail stay, with the hopes of assessing the feasibility of bail reform in the county.
