Dakar, Senegal — 
Senegal's president, Macky Sall, has fired the country's health minister after a blaze at a hospital Wednesday night killed at least 11 newborns. A series of recent, deadly tragedies at Senegal's hospitals and clinics has raised doubts about the country's health care system, which is considered one of the best in West Africa.
In April 2021, four newborns died in a fire at a hospital in the northern city of Linguère. The town's mayor said the blaze was sparked by an electrical malfunction of an air conditioning unit.
