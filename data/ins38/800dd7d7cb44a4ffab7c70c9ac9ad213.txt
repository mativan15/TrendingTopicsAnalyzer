The story of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy kidnapped and brutally murdered in Mississippi by two white men before they dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River in 1955, is not new. That level of racist vileness has been experienced by victims who came before and after the bright-eyed Chicago boy's time, echoing recently in the 2020 murder of Ahmaud Arbery.

Yet, in 'Till,' filmmaker Chinonye Chukwu offers viewers a different window into Emmett's life through the perspective of his poised and graceful mother, Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler).
