Bidding site eBay has intervened to clamp down on Jeffrey Dahmer inspired costumes for this Halloween.
Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer series became the second most watched English speaking show on Netflix ever last month, overtaking Bridgerton as millions binged the Ryan Murphy series based on the serial killer.
Subsequently, sick fans have been on the hunt to dress as Dahmer, who killed 17 victims between 1978 and 1991, usually drugging and raping them before mutilating their corpses and eating some of their remains.
