Many people are struggling to make ends meet these days. If you want evidence of this, look no further than Scarlett (Kia Pegg) and her father, Brian (Simon Lowe). For them, everyday existence has become a daily battle for survival.
This week, Brian heads off for a job interview while Scarlett attempts to get an advance on her pay. She lies, telling Bear (Dex Lee), that the money is needed for a holiday for Brian so he can go and see his sister. 
Later, Scarlett attempts to steal some toilet paper from The Mill for their home.
