The Energy Price Guarantee is changingEnergy help will be scaled back this winter, meaning households could be facing huge increases to their gas and electricity bill. The new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has confirmed the Energy Price Guarantee will be reduced from April, so it is no longer a universal scheme. Instead, the help will become targeted to those most in need - although the Government has yet to explain exactly who this will be. The Energy Price Guarantee has 'frozen' energy bills for the typical household at £2,500 a year.
