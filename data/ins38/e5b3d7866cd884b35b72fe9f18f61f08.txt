After nearly 12 years on the Novato City Council, Denise Athas says she will not seek reelection in November.
Athas, who was elected in 2009, said she decided to forgo a fourth term to spend more time with her husband George Athas, with whom she runs a downtown real estate business.
'He's been extremely patient in being very generous with my time and it's time for us to start to do other things,' Athas said. 'We still have our brokerage and are not retiring from real estate. We'll always stay engaged in the city.
