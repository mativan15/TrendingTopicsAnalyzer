Hemmed in by houses on one side and the Anchieta highway to the coast on the other, the Mercedes Benz factory in São Bernardo, a suburb of São Paulo, is the company's biggest assembly plant for trucks outside Germany. Founded in 1956, it is being modernised. As a result, it plans to almost halve its workforce of 7,400, mainly by outsourcing parts of its operations. For Mercedes, this is part of a global strategy. For São Bernardo, the heartland of Brazil's car industry, it is a body blow. In 2019 Ford shut its factory, next door to Mercedes, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.
