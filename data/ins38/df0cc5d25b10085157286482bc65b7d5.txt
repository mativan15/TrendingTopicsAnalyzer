Cornelius suffered the injury on Saturday in the team's 28-23 loss to the Toronto Argonauts. He was sent to the hospital that evening and remains there for observation.

The team says the Oklahoma State product is expected to make a full recovery.

Cornelius, 27, is in his second season with Edmonton, having signed a two-year contract extension with the team on Sept.
