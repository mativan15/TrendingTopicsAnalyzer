The Duke of Sussex's memoir was due to be released later this year, but the publication date is set to be pushed back. The depth of the contents within the book remains undisclosed but it is expected to be explosive. Speaking on the latest episode of The Royal Beat, royal historian Tessa Dunlop suggests that the Duke is faced with a "great conundrum" with how much "tell-all he really wants to do".Ms Dunlop said: "It can feel very very lonely if the institution shuts you out"."I think Harry more than anyone realises that he's walking on a tightrope.
