European equities dropped, paring weekly gains, as bond yields climbed while investors fretted about central banks' hawkish policies and monitored the political turmoil in the UK.

The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6% by the close in London as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury held at the highest level since 2007 and German bonds slumped to take equivalent yields above 2.5% for the first time since 2011. Investors also assessed an article from the Wall Street Journal, saying the Federal Reserve is set to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage points at its November meeting and then debate the size of future hikes.
