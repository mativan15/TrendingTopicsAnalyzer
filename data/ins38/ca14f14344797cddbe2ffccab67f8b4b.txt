A CHICKEN factory worker who bludgeoned his ex-girlfriend to death and cut her body into 15 pieces has been caged for 22 years.
Kamil Ranoszek, 42, spread Ilona Golabek's body parts around a country park after learning she had contacted a man on Tinder.

The monster then claimed 27-year-old Ilona "appeared to have vanished into thin air" as he reported her missing.
He pretended to help police with the disappearance until her body was discovered three months later.
