Though 'Don't Worry Darling' director and star Olivia Wilde may have been 'gobsmacked' to be honored as one of Elle's Women in Hollywood on Monday night, she used the opportunity to speak candidly about her experiences as headline fodder during the film's press tour and to urge women to 'keep fighting through the hellfire' of the patriarchy in the entertainment business and beyond. Before the crowd of about 200 guests seated for the open-air dinner held at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, Wilde began her biting, yet lighthearted speech with a joke about finding out there were seven other honorees — Ariana DeBose, Anne Hathaway, Issa Rae, Sydney Sweeney, Sigourney Weaver and Michelle Yeoh — also being recognized.
