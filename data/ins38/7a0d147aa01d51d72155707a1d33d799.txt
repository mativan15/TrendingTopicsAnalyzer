Nearly half of American couples go into debt to get married — but is it a good idea?

In The U.S., the average wedding costs just under $30,000, according to a 2021 study from wedding planning site The Knot. That's a pretty steep price tag, especially when those taking their first nuptials are an average of 34 years of age.

In 2021 the overall average guest count was 105 guests at an average cost per guest of $266.

On average, couples pay for roughly 48% of their wedding cost, with families typically covering the remainder of the bill (52%).
