As fans of local oysters already know, they are a delicacy that can be enjoyed year-round. That being said, it's a big time for the bivalves. We're in the middle of N.C. Oyster Week, and the official oyster season (which dictates the harvesting of wild oysters) begins Oct. 15 and ends in March.

Look around and you can find oyster events, oyster specials and even oyster collaborations, like an upcoming oyster beer from Wilmington's Mad Mole Brewing.
