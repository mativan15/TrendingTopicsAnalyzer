Netflix Inc. added more than 2 million subscribers in the third quarter after starting off 2022 with two consecutive quarterly declines, a rebound that sent shares more than 10% higher in after-hours trading Tuesday. Netflix  NFLX, -1.73% reported a net gain of 2.41 million subscribers in the third quarter, while analysts on average were forecasting 1.1 million net additions, according to FactSet. That follows a decline of roughly 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and nearly a million in the second quarter, which has led the company to plan massive changes, including a cheaper, ad-supported streaming tier set to arrive in the fourth quarter.
