The ruling party in Telangana petitioned the Election Commission of India (ECI) to remove symbols such as a road roller, camera, chapatti roller, television, ship, sewing machine, and soap dish, saying those symbols look like their car symbol on electronic voting machines. The TRS also moved the Telangana High Court, urging it to direct the ECI to delete eight symbols that look similar to its, but the court on Tuesday dismissed the petition saying it cannot interfere in the by-election since the ECI had set the process in motion.
