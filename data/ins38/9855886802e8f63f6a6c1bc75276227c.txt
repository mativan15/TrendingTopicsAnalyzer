Since then, the stock is down 2.8%, outperforming the market in an environment of supply chain problems, high inflation, growth fears, and a somewhat aggressive Federal Reserve. Given ongoing market uncertainty, it makes sense to discuss stocks to buy more aggressively when economic growth bottoms. One of these stocks is Howmet Aerospace. The company is doing a terrific job recovering from the pandemic as it sees strength across the board with strong pricing power when long haul demand is returning.
