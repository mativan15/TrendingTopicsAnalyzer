President Joe Biden vowed Tuesday to meet with lawmakers about gun-control legislation, while aides said the administration is currently researching additional executive actions he might take in the aftermath of last week's deadly massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.'I will meet with the Congress on guns, I promise you,' Biden said Tuesday as he welcomed New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to the White House. White House officials are examining what additional actions Biden could take unilaterally -- but fear he may have already exhausted all available options, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.
