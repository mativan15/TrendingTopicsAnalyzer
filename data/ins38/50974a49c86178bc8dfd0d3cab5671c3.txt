A federal jury has found the founder of eco-truck outfit Nikola, Trevor Milton, guilty of deceiving investors with exaggerated claims about how close his company was to producing working prototypes of zero-emission 18-wheelers.
Prosecutors say the exec lied about company tech on podcasts, TV, and Twitter as Nikola Corp prepared for its 2020 debut on the Nasdaq, making "deceptive, false, and misleading" claims that the company was much further along in the process of building zero-emission "Nikola One" semi-trucks than it actually was.
