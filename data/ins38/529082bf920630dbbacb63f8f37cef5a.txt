It's the evening before BravoCon 2022, and anticipation and excitement are in the air. I'm at a party at the Freehand hotel in New York City, and the 'Real Housewives'-inspired cocktail menu has drinks like 'The Dorit' and 'Reasonably Shady.' Napkins displayed all over the room don former housewife Sonja Morgan's famous tagline: 'I have a taste for luxury, and luxury has a taste for me.' A DJ is playing 'Housewives' hits like 'Feeling Jovani' and several people are taking photos with cutouts of housewives on sticks.
