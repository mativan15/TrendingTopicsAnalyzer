I want to take advantage of air and hotel rewards so that I can take my family on vacation without paying a ton of money and using points instead. We can be flexible with travel dates, but we do like 4-to 5-star properties and we'd ideally like to fly business class or premium economy. (Looking for a travel rewards card too?
