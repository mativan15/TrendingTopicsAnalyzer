LONDON, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to The Business Research Company's research report on the carbon capture, utilization, and storage market, carbon capture companies are focusing on the usage of direct air capture technology (DAC) to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere so that it can be permanently stored in deep geological formations or it can be utilized to achieve negative emissions. There are two types of technology approaches used: liquid and solid DAC. The solid DAC method uses solid absorbent filters that chemically bind CO2, and the concentrated CO2 is captured by using heat or by being placed in a vacuum to release CO2 from the absorbents.
