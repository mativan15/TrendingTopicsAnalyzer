WASHINGTON — House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy warned Tuesday that Republicans will not write a 'blank check' for Ukraine if they win back the House majority, reflecting his party's growing skepticism about financial support for Kyiv as it battles Russia's invasion.'I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,' McCarthy told Punchbowl News. 'They just won't do it. … It's not a free blank check.' The comments from McCarthy, who is in line to become speaker if Republicans win the House, raised fresh questions about the resiliency of America's support for Ukraine as a growing number of Republicans, particularly those aligned with Donald Trump's 'America First' approach, question the need for federal spending abroad at a time of record-high inflation at home.
