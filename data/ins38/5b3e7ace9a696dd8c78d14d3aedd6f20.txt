Rhea Ripley wrestled for the first time in 131 days over the weekend after a long spell ouot of action due to a nasty injury.
The WWE superstar hadn't had a match since winning a Number One Contender's match for the Raw Women's Title on June 6, but she accidentally kneed herself in the face during the bout.
She later told fans on social media she had suffered a ‘brain and teeth' injury without going into specifics, and at one point shared a selfie wearing a heart monitor while training during her recovery.
