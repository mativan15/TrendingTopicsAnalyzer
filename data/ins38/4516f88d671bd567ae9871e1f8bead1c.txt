Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio is once again vowing to cut any ties between his party and a controversial religious group. The group was previously known as the Unification Church. It is under significant scrutiny over its allegedly shady marketing practices and soliciting large sums of donations from its members. A lawmaker with the opposition Japanese Communist Party raised the issue during a Diet debate on Tuesday. He says a member of Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party won July's Upper House election with the support of the group.
