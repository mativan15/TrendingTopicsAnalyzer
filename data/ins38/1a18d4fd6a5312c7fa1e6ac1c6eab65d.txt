Adidas's next CEO is set to inherit an even tougher job.The company warned on Thursday that unsold goods are piling up as consumer demand weakens across China and western markets. That sent the German sport apparel maker's stock slumping as much as 10%. Problems are accumulating under outgoing CEO Kasper Rorsted, including a publicity crisis over an alliance with rapper and designer Kanye West. Whoever replaces Rorsted as CEO next year will need to come up with buzzy products as the future of the best-selling Yeezy line is in doubt.
