A group of Apple retail workers has coordinated the first nationwide strike in Australian history, their union told VICE World News, as workers turn the screw on the world's most valuable company for a better pay deal.

On Tuesday, more than 100 unionised Apple retail workers walked off the job for an hour in stores across Australia in protest of a new pay deal that has seen Apple refuse to offer its retail workforce minimum standards like weekends and set rosters, after months-long negotiations slowed to a standstill.
