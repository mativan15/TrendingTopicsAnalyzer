AdrianHancu/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) ended Friday at the top of the S&P 500 leadboard, +10.3% to $50.41 for its highest closing price in nearly four years, after reporting its best quarterly profit in seven years and raising guidance for the rest of 2022. The company said it expects Q4 sales will surge in the mid-20% range from the year-earlier quarter, slightly more bullish than the 19.3% growth expected by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with EBITDA margin growth of 200 bps from a year ago.
