Each year, the Jacksonville Business Journal looks to identify some of the men and women who are helping take the local economy to new heights as well as the company that are doing the most to grow.

To help us identify those leaders and their companies, we'd like your help.

The Business Journal is now accepting nominations for its 2023 awards programs, including 40 Under 40, Fast 50, Ultimate CEO and more.

The nomination period that will end the soonest is for Women of Influence, which closes at the end of this week.
