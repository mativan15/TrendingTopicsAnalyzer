Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle have dates for their co-headlining tour.

Set to take place across seven dates this December, the comedians will kick off their engagement on December 1 in San Diego and will appear in Phoenix, Anaheim, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento before closing it out in Thousand Palms on December 14. The tour will take place just shortly after Rock finishes his solo engagements, and a week or so before Chappelle begins his three-date shows in Hollywood, Florida from December 27 to December 29.
