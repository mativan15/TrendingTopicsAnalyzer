Atstock Productions/iStock via Getty Images On May 25, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) confirmed the acquisition of VMware (NYSE:VMW) rumored earlier and the announcement has created an attractive opportunity for investors. While promising it is rather complex, open-ended, and full of moving parts, does it make sense to act now, wait longer, or ignore it? Basic facts We will mostly follow Broadcom's 8-K filing of May 26 which, besides other things, contains the text of the Merger Agreement. Each share of VMW, at the election of the holder and subject to 50-50 proration, will be exchanged for either $142.
