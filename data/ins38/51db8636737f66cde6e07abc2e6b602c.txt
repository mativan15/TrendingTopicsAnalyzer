By Colin Kellaher Shares of Immunic Inc. lost nearly half of their value and hit a new all-time low on Thursday following the failure of the company's lead asset in a study for the chronic inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis. The San Diego clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company said a Phase 2 study of vidofludimus calcium missed the primary endpoint in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis due to unexpected treatment interference from the concurrent use of corticosteroids.
