The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed a petitioner to seek relief against his challenge to the Aadhar infrastructure contracts being issued to foreign companies. Since the petitioner, Colonel (retired) Mathew Thomas had already approached the Supreme Court earlier regarding privacy concerns of Aadhar, the HC division bench of Chief Justice Prasanna B Varale and Justice Ashok N Kinagi said it would be proper for him to place this issue before the apex court. The HC, however, said that the doors of the HC were open if the Supreme Court directed him to seek relief from it.
