Elkhophoto/iStock via Getty Images Main Thesis & Background The purpose of this article is to evaluate the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) as an investment option at its current market price. The fund's stated goal is "to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index". This is an ETF I have owned for a long time, although I cover it infrequently on Seeking Alpha. This is because it is widely written about, so I generally don't feel like I have much to add on it.
