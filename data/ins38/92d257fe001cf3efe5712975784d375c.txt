Published: 09:24 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 10:34 EDT, 20 October 2022 Scotland's First Minister has said a general election is a 'democratic imperative' after Liz Truss announced her resignation with another prime minister to be in place within a week. The Prime Minister announced on Thursday she would be standing down after less than two months in office, with a successor to be appointed in a week-long contest. Following the Downing Street statement from Ms Truss, Nicola Sturgeon said it would be 'ordinary people' who would be hit worst by the 'utter shambles' at Westminster.
