A contract manufacturer in Lackawanna is planning for growth with big contracts in the works.

Linita Design & Manufacturing Corp., which makes water control equipment, was in the middle of a big contract in New York City, when it landed another multi-year project down south.

'Based on new contracts coming in and ones that we're pursuing, we should be between 15% and 18% revenue growth, steadily, over the next three years,' said Sean Greenhouse, COO of Linita.

The company is building 12 heavy-steel floodgates for neighborhoods in Manhattan as part of a government-funded infrastructure project.
