The UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) will soon invite bids yet again—this time with relaxed and more attractive terms and conditions to select suitable private companies. The corporation has plans to develop 24 modern bus stations-cum commercial complexes in public private partnership (PPP) mode on the pattern of the one inaugurated in Lucknow (Alambagh) in June 2018. The decision comes after developers gave a cold shoulder to the bids that the corporation has invited at least four times since 2018.
