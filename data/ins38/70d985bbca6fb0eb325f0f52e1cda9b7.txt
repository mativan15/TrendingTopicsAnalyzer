Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric carmaker could grow to be the world's most valuable company.

'I see a potential path with Tesla worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,' Musk said during a call with investors on Oct. 19 following Tesla's third-quarter earnings release. Apple and Saudi Aramco are currently the world's two most valuable companies, worth $2.3 trillion and $2.1 trillion respectively. Per Musk's claim, Tesla could be worth more than $4.4 trillion one day, nearly seven times its current market cap.
