The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the alleged human sacrifice of two women in Kerala's Pathanamthitta plans to slap sexual assault charges on the accused and seek a fast-tracked trial, an official aware of the matter said. The official cited the probe so far and added the women were raped after they were tied to a cot before their killing 'to get the full effect of sacrifice.' Both were tied to the cot on the pretext of acting in porn films, he said. The official said a potency test was carried out on two of the accused in the case.
