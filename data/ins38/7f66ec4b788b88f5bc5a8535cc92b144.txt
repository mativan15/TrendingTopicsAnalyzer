Barack Obama, in Scotland and seated at the round table in the fight against global warming or global cooling or whatever the latest leftist fad is, says communication between the White House and Kremlin is the worst it's ever been. Joe Biden, off his bicycle and back in his basement in Delaware, says he won't meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia will discuss releasing basketball player Brittney Griner. With the world on the brink of world war (possibly with the use of nuclear weaponry), that's the total extent of his concern?

Where is the United Nations in all this, proving its pretend value by doing nonstop emergency meetings? Surprisingly, the west is only concerned with supplying more money and weapons to keep the war going.
