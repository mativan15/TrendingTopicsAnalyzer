A major donor to Nigel Farage's political party Reform UK has quickly built up a £150m stake in the Ministry of Defence research spin-off QinetiQ, becoming the third-biggest shareholder in less than a month.
Christopher Harborne, 59, a Thailand-based businessman who has given £13.7m to Reform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party, has quietly built up a 7.1pc holding in QinetiQ, which makes robots for the military and is developing top-secret laser weapons technology.
Mr Harborne hit the headlines during the 2019 election when it emerged that he has a Thai name, Chakrit Sakunkrit, under which he is listed on Companies House.
