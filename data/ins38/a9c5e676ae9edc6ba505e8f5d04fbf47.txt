Let's make this easy for the Columbia City Council members who are questioning a new proposal to create a gun violence prevention office.

How much money does it need? As much as it can get.

How many people need to work there? As many as its office can hold.

Can you waste more time in acting to reduce gun violence? No. Council members have had almost a year to ask questions about how federal dollars could be spent on gun violence prevention and a month to consider the proposal for a new office.
