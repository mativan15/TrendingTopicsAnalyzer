TONIGHT, Martin Lewis will host a special edition of his Money Show as millions of Brits fear rising energy bills.
This special episode of the MoneySavingExpert's show will air tonight at 8pm on ITV.
This comes as it was confirmed that the Energy Price Guarantee, which caps average bills at £2,500 per year, will only run until April, rather than the planned two years.
Martin said today that if the original price cap returns, the average household energy bill could rise by over 70% in the spring.
In fact, experts at Cornwall Insight suggest that bills will rise from £2,500 to £4,350 a year from April 2023 without the freeze in place.
