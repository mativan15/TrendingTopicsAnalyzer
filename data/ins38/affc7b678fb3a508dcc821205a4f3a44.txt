Liverpool icon Jamie Carragher's comments backfired on Sunday as Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga put in a stunning performance as Graham Potter's side defeated Aston Villa 2-0. The goalkeeper kept a clean sheet and made a string of important saves as Mason Mount capitalised on a Tyrone Mings error to score after six minutes, before he then fired a free-kick past Emiliano Martinez in the second half.Kepa made a triple save to keep Steven Gerrard's side at bay in the first half, before tipping Danny Ings' header over the bar from point-blank range in a stunning display, especially in the opening 45 minutes.
