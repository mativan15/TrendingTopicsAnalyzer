Alabama is investigating a claim that Crimson Tide wide receiver Jermaine Burton struck a female Tennessee fan following the Volunteers' win on Saturday.

"We are aware of the situation with Jermaine Burton as he was exiting the field Saturday," Alabama head coach Nick Saban said in a statement Wednesday. "We are currently working to gather more information."

After Tennessee defeated Alabama on a last-second field goal, Vols fans stormed the Neyland Stadium field in celebration of the victory.
