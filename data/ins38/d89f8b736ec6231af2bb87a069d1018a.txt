HARTFORD, Conn. — The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases - known as 'gifting' - could now carry a heavy price tag Connecticut. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year.
