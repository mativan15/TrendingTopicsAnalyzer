style-photography Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ:UNIT) is a real estate investment trust ('REIT') that is principally focused on the acquisition and construction of fiber optic, copper, and coaxial broadband networks and data centers. The business was formed via a spin-off from Windstream Holdings, Inc ('Windstream') in 2015. In connection with the spin-off, UNIT entered into a long-term exclusive master lease arrangement with Windstream. Following Windstream's emergence from bankruptcy in 2020, the master lease was bifurcated into two structurally similar leases.
