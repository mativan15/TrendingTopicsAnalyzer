The art and science of stock market investing requires a tolerance for losing money on some of the shares you buy. But it's not unreasonable to try to avoid truly shocking capital losses. We wouldn't blame OneConnect Financial Technology Co., Ltd. (NYSE:OCFT) shareholders if they were still in shock after the stock dropped like a lead balloon, down 90% in just one year. A loss like this is a stark reminder that portfolio diversification is important. OneConnect Financial Technology hasn't been listed for long, so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly, it may still prove itself with time.
