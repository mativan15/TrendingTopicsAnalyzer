After a loss like the one Penn State took on Saturday, it is incredibly difficult to find much of a silver lining. Penn State was dominated up front and all over the field on Saturday by Michigan in a 41-17 setback, Penn State's first of the season. And with two challenging games still in front of them, there was not a whole lot to feel good about afterward.
But it really is just one game for Penn State and the good news is they will return home next weekend against another team going through some things on their own.
