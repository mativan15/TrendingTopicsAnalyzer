Sony and Black Bear's GameStop doc, Dumb Money, just expanded its cast with the additions of Vincent D'Onofrio, Anthony Ramos, and Dane DeHaan Deadline reports. They join Paul Dano, Seth Rogen, Sebastian Stan, and Pete Davidson, with Craig Gillespie (Cruella, I, Tonya) directing.The film tells the story of fortunes won and lost practically overnight in the GameStop stock short squeeze that occurred last year. It was such big news that even WWE wrote a gimmick for a character around it. What happened was that GameStop's share price exploded due in part to investors on Reddit's Wall Street Bets subreddit and other forums taking aim at the institutional investors who were "shorting" the stock based simply on a joke.
