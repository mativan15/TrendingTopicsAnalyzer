Venture debt provider Alteria Capital, which has backed Mensa Brands and Dunzo, has launched its third fund (Fund III) with a first close of Rs 1,000 crore, largely from domestic investors and soft commitments from institutions. Fund III's size is expected to be Rs 2,000 crore and will close over the next two-three quarters. The first close of Fund III comes exactly a year after it announced the final close of its second fund at Rs 1,820 crore. 'While there's a demand for venture debt, we do not see the market doubling or tripling.
