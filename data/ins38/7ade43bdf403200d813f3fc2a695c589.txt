It was overwhelming at times, especially during the four seasons that followed a stellar rookie year in which he caught 64 passes for 722 yards and six touchdowns. Engram never topped those 2017 numbers, and endured his share of criticism for dropped passes, injuries and all the losing the Giants endured during his tenure.
