DEAR DEIDRE: WHILE my ex-wife and I were together, I took out a loan for our new conservatory. But now we've divorced, she is refusing to help pay it off.
I'm 56, she is 54 and we have been separated for the last two years. 
I don't want to argue - I just want the loan paid off
For more Dear Deidre content, and to meet the team behind the infamous agony page, follow us on: 
We were together for 17 years but split during the pandemic.
It was pretty amicable until we got on to the conversation about money.
