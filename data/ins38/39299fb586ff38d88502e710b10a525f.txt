It is rare for any journalist to land an interview with President Biden, who has been historically hidden from the press in comparison to his predecessors. With just weeks left of 2022, the president has only given four televised sit-downs this year, most recently with CNN anchor Jake Tapper. Last week, The Washington Post reported that anonymous federal agents allege they have "sufficient evidence" to charge Biden's son Hunter with tax and gun crimes. During his interview with the president, Tapper allotted just one question about his embattled son in light of the latest developments.
