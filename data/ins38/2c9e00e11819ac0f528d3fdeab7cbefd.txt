E-scooters rolled into the Lethbridge transportation scene this spring. A recent survey shows the two-wheeled rides have been good for business.
'What we saw was an increase in local traffic, like that Main Street traffic,' said Cyndi Bester with the Lethbridge Chamber of Commerce. She added that they partnered with Neuron Mobility, the e-scooter provider in Lethbridge to gather some critical data,  putting a dollar value on each rental.'It was about $22 per ride that people invested in different businesses whether it was a restaurant or a local retail store or whatever so it did create some economic drive and ease of access,' said Bester.
