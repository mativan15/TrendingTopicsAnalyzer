It's the proverbial wet Wednesday, but Joe Duffy couldn't sound any brighter on even the sunniest day. 'There's thunder and lightning here in RTÉ,' Duffy jovially reports. 'That's outside the building. It's normally inside the building.' Ba-dum tish! Far from dampening his humour, the midweek downpours bring out Duffy's inner stand-up, as he showers Liveline (RTÉ Radio 1, weekdays) with the kind of permachuckling yet laugh-free bonhomie more associated with light-entertainment hosts.The show starts with Duffy chatting to Alan O'Reilly of the meteorology website Carlow Weather about the thunderstorms hitting the east coast, though the tone is jaunty when discussing the dangers of lightning.
