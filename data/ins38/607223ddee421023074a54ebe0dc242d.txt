I found the stock by using Barchart's powerful screening function to find the stocks with the highest Weighted Alpha and technical buy signals, then sorting that list by the most frequent number of new highs in the last month. I then used the Flipchart feature to review the charts for consistent price appreciation. DINO price vs daily moving averages (Barchart) HF Sinclair Corporation operates as an independent energy company.
