Editor's note: Jim Lanzone is the CEO of Yahoo Finance's parent company, Yahoo.

Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone has overseen his share of internet success stories in his nearly three-decade career. From steering the ship at Ask.com, to the launch of CBS Interactive, Lanzone has built his reputation around turnaround stories.

Yet, he credits his success to early failures with startup eTour, an internet search and navigation company he co-founded in 1998 at the height of the dotcom boom.

'We went up way up and way down,' Lanzone said at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit (video above), referring to eTour's crash during the dotcom bust.
