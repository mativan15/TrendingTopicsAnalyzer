By Paul Homewood No, it's not April Fool's Say! (Though there is one in the picture):  
Prince Charles as backed a mask device for cows that would capture their burps to tackle carbon emissions.
The device is worn around the animal's face and is designed to neutralise the methane they omit in real time.
He met with the contraption's designer during a climate change event, during which he aired concerns over the ‘urgency' with which it is being tackled.
Charles spoke with designers at a Royal College of Art event working on novel ways to bring down carbon emissions.
