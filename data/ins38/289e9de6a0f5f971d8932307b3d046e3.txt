Shareholders of Twilio (TWLO 3.07%) beat the market this week as the stock gained 12% through Thursday trading. That boost compared to a 2.3% rally in the S&P 500, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. It wasn't enough to erase much of the cloud software specialist's 2022 losses, though, and the stock is still down over 70% this year.
This week's rally was sparked by rising optimism about the economy, which might be reflected in Twilio's upcoming earnings report.
