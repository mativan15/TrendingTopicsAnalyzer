More than 20 eco-campaigners blocked one of the busiest routes into London by sitting down, some gluing themselves to the tarmac.One exasperated driver yelled: 'You lazy b******s - get a job!' The man caused laughter among stranded motorists saying: 'What kind of job allows you to sit around all day? I want to apply!'The activists blocked the A4 near the Hammersmith flyover in west London around 7.30am - a move timed to cause maximum traffic chaos.Police were quickly on the scene and issued a statement saying they were in the process of removing the protesters.
