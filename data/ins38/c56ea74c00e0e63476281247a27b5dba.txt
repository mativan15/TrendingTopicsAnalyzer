Ben Elton kicked off his Friday Night Live Channel 4 special with a savage dig at Liz Truss, after she announced her resignation as Prime Minister yesterday.
Ms Truss announced she was stepping down as Prime Minister, after holding the role for only 44 days, during which the economy crashed and both her Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary departed.
She was outlived by a lettuce, which broke the headlines, while her stint also managed to be shorter than a singular series of Love Island, shorter than Kim Kardashian's notoriously short-lived marriage to Kris Humphries, and even – would you believe it – shorter than Jedward lasted in the live shows of The X Factor.
