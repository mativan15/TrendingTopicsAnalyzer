Pinterest (PINS -3.29%) shareholders lost ground to the market on Friday, as shares fell 3% by 3 p.m. ET, compared with a 1.5% decline in the S&P 500. The downtick contributed to a wider decline for the digital media stock, which is down nearly 50% since the start of 2022.
Friday's slump arrived as investors worried about weakening conditions in the digital advertising space.
