Ottawa graduate student Daniel Boutin adopted Samwell the cat in 2019, hoping the formerly feral rescue animal could keep him company as he studied.

Samwell adapted well to his new life. But there were a few surprises.

In 2020, Boutin found out his new companion had a gum infection and needed some teeth removed. Then, Samwell was diagnosed with FIV, an immunodeficiency disease that likely caused the gum infection. Soon after, the cat underwent a second surgery to remove the rest of his teeth.

Boutin had pet insurance, but neither surgery was covered by his policy, instead costing him thousands of dollars.
