The Trump administration regularly interfered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) process for developing and issuing guidance about the coronavirus, changed scientific reports and undermined top public health officials, a congressional panel said Monday.

The House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis said interviews, emails and other documents obtained by the panel showed how political appointees in the Trump administration took control of CDC's public communications and overruled scientists in an effort to bend the agency to Trump's rosy outlook on the pandemic.
