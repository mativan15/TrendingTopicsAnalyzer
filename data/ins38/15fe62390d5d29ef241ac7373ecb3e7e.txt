ANIActress Urvashi Rautela has been in the news for her comments on cricketer Rishabh Pant. Now, dancer and social media influencer Dhanashree Verma added more fuel to the fire. Soon after actress Urvashi Rautela posted about her travels to Australia, Verma shared photos of herself from inside a plane as she left for Australia to join her cricketer-husband Yuzvendra Chahall at the T20 World Cup.

On her Instagram, Verma, who is also a choreographer, uploaded an in-flight picture of herself with a caption that her heart led to Australia and she's there to support her husband and India.
