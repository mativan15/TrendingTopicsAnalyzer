Future versions of the Apple Watch could allow wearers to take a photo from their wrists after a new patent was granted to the tech giant.

It comes three years after Apple first filed for a patent for a 'built-in rotatable camera' within its market-leading smartwatch. Other major wearable manufacturers are yet to release a wrist-worn camera.

'A camera can be mounted to the housing and configured to capture a picture of a scene through the back side of the housing,' states the patent, which was first spotted by the site Patently Apple.
