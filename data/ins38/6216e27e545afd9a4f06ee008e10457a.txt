Nalgonda MP and former TPCC President N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has opposed Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao's proposal to sell prime land across the State to private parties to raise funds.Speaking to media persons during his visit to various villages as part of the Rachabanda/Rythu Bharosa Yatra in Suryapet district, he said the government has directed the District Collectors to send details of leased government lands to the headquarters on a war footing thus beginning the process to sell thousands of acres of prime land in different districts to raise funds.
