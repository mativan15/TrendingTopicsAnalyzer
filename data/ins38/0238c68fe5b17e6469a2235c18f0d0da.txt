Charisse R. Lillie

Charisse R. Lillie came to Philadelphia in 1973 to attend Temple University's James E. Beasley School of Law. The Houston native has called the city home ever since and in the ensuing half century, Lillie has done practically everything a lawyer could do, trailblazing a unique path for women – particularly Black women – to follow.
