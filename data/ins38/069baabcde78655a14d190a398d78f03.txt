GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Jets have not won three games in a row since 2019. They have a chance to change that Sunday.
They come to Lambeau Field feeling good about themselves after back-to-back wins moved them to 3-2. All they have to do Sunday to make it three in a row is beat Aaron Rodgers and the angry Packers (3-2).
The Jets beat the Steelers and Dolphins to register consecutive wins for the first time since 2020. You have to go back to November of the previous year to find the last time they won three in a row.
