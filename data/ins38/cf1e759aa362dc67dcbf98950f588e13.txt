Families are facing average energy bills of up to £5,000 from April after Liz Truss was forced to rip up her government's entire economic strategy and issue a public apology to the nation.Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, said that the energy price guarantee which limits average energy bills to £2,500, will come to an end in April. Support will then be targeted at the most vulnerable in a move that could see bills for most families double.Hunt also reversed £32 billion worth of tax cuts from Truss's disastrous mini-budget in an attempt to reassure the markets, including the 1p cut in the basic rate of income tax, which has been shelved 'indefinitely'.
