Published: 07:44 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 07:44 EDT, 17 October 2022 The pound and UK government bonds have rallied further as the financial markets were initially placated by new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's emergency statement. Yields on 30-year government bonds, or gilts, eased back further by around 10% as Mr Hunt set out plans to shave off billions of Government debt. The interest on long-dated bonds hit a low of around 4.32% shortly after the first announcement. The gilt market has been closely monitored since yields spiked to more than 5% after Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his tax-cutting mini-budget back in late September, and the Bank of England was forced to intervene with an emergency bond-buying programme.
