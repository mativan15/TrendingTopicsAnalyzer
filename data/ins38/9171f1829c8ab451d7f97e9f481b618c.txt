Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai will soon leave for New Delhi to seek the party high command directions on the issue of Cabinet expansion. 'We will go ahead as soon as the party gives us permission to do so,'‘ he told journalists in Belagavi on Saturday. 'It could happen amidst the on going Jan Sankalp yatra party rallies,'‘ he said. Reacting to reports that Shiv Sena was opposing the construction of a Yatri Nivas by the Karnataka government in Kaneri Mutt in Kolhapur in Maharashtra, Mr. Bommai said it should not be an issue to anyone.
