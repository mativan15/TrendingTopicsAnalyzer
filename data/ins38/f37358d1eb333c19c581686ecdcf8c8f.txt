PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A jury in Portland has convicted a self-published romance novelist — who once wrote an essay titled 'How to Murder Your Husband' — of fatally shooting her husband four years ago. 
The jury of seven women and five men found Nancy Crampton Brophy, 71, guilty of second-degree murder Wednesday after deliberating over two days in chef Daniel Brophy's death, KOIN-TV reported.
Brophy, 63, was killed June 2, 2018, as he prepped for work at the Oregon Culinary Institute in Southwest Portland.
