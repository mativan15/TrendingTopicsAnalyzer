By Reuters Published: 12:43 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 12:43 EDT, 2 June 2022 WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday restored the right of states and tribes to block projects on environmental grounds through the federal clean water permitting process, reversing a Trump era effort to prevent them from doing so. The agency issued a proposed rule, first announced last May https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-epa-revise-trump-water-rule-boost-states-climate-fight-2021-05-27, to revise the 2020 Clean Water Act Section 401 certification rule by strengthening the authority of states, territories, and tribes to protect their water resources and the climate by blocking potentially harmful projects.
