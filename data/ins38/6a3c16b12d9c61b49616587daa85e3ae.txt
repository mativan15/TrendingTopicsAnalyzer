The documents set out the latest compromises among EU states on reforming the bloc's "MiFID" securities law to catch up with advances in trading technology and practices in markets. The documents also include an informal German proposal to scrap the European Commission's proposed ban on payment-for-order flow, or when brokers get commission for directing stock orders to a specific trading platform.
