The government must offer all children free school meals to address the country's 'profoundly disturbing' food poverty rates, the NHS' most senior paediatrician says.Camilla Kingdon, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warned the cost of living crisis was forcing struggling families to turn to unhealthy food and called on the government to act. She said it was often cheaper for parents to feed their children junk food, as food prices continue to soar, and this was impacting children's health, from poor growth rates to obesity.
