More than 2,000 industrial units including MSMEs spread across various industrial layouts on the outskirts of Mysuru have threatened to resist tax payment to local bodies on the grounds that the slab rates are disproportionately high and in violation of the government norms. The stakeholders have also reiterated their long pending demand seeking the constitution of the Mysuru Industrial Township Authority so that industries don't come under the administrative purview of the local bodies. If the township authority is constituted, the industries have to pay tax to the new township authority instead - and not the local CMC.
