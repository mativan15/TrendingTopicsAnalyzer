Love Is Blind star Raven Ross had a rather unusual response when Bartise Bowden opened up about the breakdown of his parents' relationship.
The pilates instructor and Bartise are looking for love in the Netflix series, which follows a group of singletons who get to know each other without seeing each other.
Couples will only meet for the first time if they decide to get married in what can only be described as a whirlwind romance before they go on a lavish honeymoon and move in together.
Raven and Bartise are among the contestants hoping to find The One on the third season of the dating reality series and were bonding in their respective pods in a recent episode.
