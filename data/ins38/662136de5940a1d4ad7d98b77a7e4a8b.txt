The £150 council tax rebate that was part of February's package to help with the cost of living crisis may not reach some people until September, the government has admitted, as local authorities grapple with the scheme's logistics.
The money for the payments, for which 80 per cent of British households are eligible, has been made available to councils since March 30 and was meant to reach people by the end of April. But some authorities have struggled to deliver it to households, especially to those that do not pay their council tax via direct debit.
