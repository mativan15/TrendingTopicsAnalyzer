In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in DS Smith Plc (LON:SMDS), since the last five years saw the share price fall 30%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 26% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 13% in the last 90 days.
