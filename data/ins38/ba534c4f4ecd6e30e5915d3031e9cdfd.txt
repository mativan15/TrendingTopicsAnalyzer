Chinese stocks briefly rallied following a report that officials were considering relaxing quarantine rules, before resuming losses as analysts were quick to point to broader worries about a slowing economy.

Benchmark stock indexes in China and Hong Kong pared losses after the Bloomberg report, while the offshore yuan strengthened for the first time in three days. Airline stocks were the main beneficiaries as Chinese officials debated a cut in mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers.
