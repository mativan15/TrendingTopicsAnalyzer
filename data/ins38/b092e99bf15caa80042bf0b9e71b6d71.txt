The 25-year-old model - who is the son of the 'Terminator' actor - was eliminated from the show on Tuesday night (18.10.22) alongside his pro partner Daniella Karagach. While his famous father wasn't able to come to the studio during his stint on the show, Joseph told Extra: "He's always been rooting for me, ya know? I love him to death.
