The head of one of the largest for-profit universities in the country suddenly resigned months after taking the post.

George Burnett was appointed the president of the University of Phoenix in February, and at the time the university spoke highly of his 'deep understanding of our purpose of helping working adults acquire a higher education.'

But new documents obtained exclusively by USA TODAY show that Burnett's departure came after an inquiry by the Department of Education.

Specifically, the department had questioned Burnett's time overseeing Westwood College, a for-profit college based in Westminster, Colorado with run-ins with federal and state regulators over deceptive advertising among other concerns.
