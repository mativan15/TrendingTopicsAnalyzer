Of one thing you can be assured: whatever happens will be determined by money and who's getting most it.If Ukrainian legend Vasiliy Lomachenko returns from the frontline in the war against Russia, you can bet American promoters and broadcasters will push hard a fight against Haney in the US, no matter what the contract with Kambosos says.If the rematch against Haney does go ahead, though, the Kambosos camp should do everything in its powers to hold the fight in Sydney.He should also consider holding it in a venue smaller than Marvel Stadium, which lacked atmosphere despite hosting a crowd of 41,129 including a very large and vocal Greek supporter base cheering on their self-proclaimed 'Spartan warrior'.
