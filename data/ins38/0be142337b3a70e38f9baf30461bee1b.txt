The Maharashtra government will pay Rs 61.22 crore as arrears of two-and-a-half years to persons who were jailed for protesting against the Emergency in 1975-76.
The government led by Devendra Fadnavis had started the scheme to honour these individuals who fought to save democracy.
The scheme was embroiled in controversy even then, too, as several potential beneficiaries from the socialist and Left movements had refused to accept the honorarium.
After the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) – comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – came to power in 2019, it cancelled the scheme.
