The Housewives have officially gone international with Wednesday's premiere of The Real Housewives of Dubai, the first overseas iteration of the franchise to be produced by Bravo.

For those expecting a borderline offensive Sex and the City 2-style trainwreck, 1) I don't blame you and 2) this is decidedly not that. The problem with The Real Housewives of Dubai is not that it is problematic or whitewashed or tone-deaf—well, at least not any more than the other Housewives installments.

No, rather, the problem with the new reality series is that it is brutally, mind-numbingly boring.
