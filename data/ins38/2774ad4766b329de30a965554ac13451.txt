LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's ASOS, the one-time poster child for the shift to online fashion, vowed on Wednesday to overhaul its business model after the economic crunch combined with a string of operational problems to hammer its profits.

With its shares down 80% this year, new CEO José Antonio Ramos Calamonte said the firm would address unsatisfactory returns from its international operations, particularly from the United States.

He would also improve ASOS's "inefficient" supply chain, find a way to re-engage its 20-something customers, better leverage its data, cut costs and refresh the company's culture.
