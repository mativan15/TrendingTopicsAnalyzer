We're halfway into the college football season. By now, we are getting a clearer picture of which teams we could see battle in conference title games and which have a shot at walking away with national title glory. Until then, here's what I like for Saturday's college football slate for Week 8.

Kansas State +4.5 and +170 at TCU

I love K-State QB Adrian Martinez in this offense. Mix that with the Wildcats having a much stronger defense than what the Horned Frogs have faced as of late, and we may just see the upset.
