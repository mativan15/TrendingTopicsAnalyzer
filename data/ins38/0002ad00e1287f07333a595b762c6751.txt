Richarlison joined Spurs in a £60million deal last summer and in a recent interview revealed a reason for Everton exit was a perceived lack of ambition at Goodison Park.'I was happy at Everton and I'm grateful for everything I learned there,' said the Brazilian. 'It's a big club with a lot of history. However, perhaps they're suffering with a lack of ambition nowadays. You know, that eagerness to win matches and trophies.'But Lampard has hit back at Richarlison ahead of their reunion this weekend.
