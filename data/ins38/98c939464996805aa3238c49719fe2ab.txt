Jones has missed the last three games, but appears likely to return in Week 7.

Reports in recent days suggest that Mac Jones will not only return from his high ankle sprain injury on Monday night, but he'll also be starting at quarterback against the Bears.

If you ask Patriots coach Bill Belichick though, he won't share what the team's plan is at quarterback for the Week 7 matchup. He wouldn't say if a decision has been made at quarterback when asked on Friday.

'We're just taking it day-by-day,' Belichick said with a smile.
