The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has served eviction notices on 11 immovable properties linked to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse, his family members, and associates. The properties, which were provisionally attached by the ED in August 2021, include land parcels, bungalows, plots, and flats in Pune, Nashik, Lonavala, Jalgaon, and Mumbai. The properties are either owned by Khadse, his wife Mandakini, or by his associates. An ED officer said the eviction notices were issued after the provisional attachment of the properties was confirmed by the adjudicating authority under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
