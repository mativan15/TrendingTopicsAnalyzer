Wachiwit Background As part of my previous article, I noted the undervaluation of Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares, that were sold off to the range of $150-250 from the peak price of $700. Two weak reports in a row were the reasons for the stock price fall (Q4 2021 results in January 2022 and Q1 2022 results in April). Historically, the company's shares have traded at a premium to other major technology companies. That could be explained by stable double-digit revenue growth rates and annual margin improvement.
