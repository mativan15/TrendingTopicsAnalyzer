Digital currencies are here to stay. Whether decentralized like Bitcoin, managed by a private company like USDC, or controlled by a government such as the Bahamas' sand dollar, the only question is what will prove most popular—and longest lasting.

New survey data from business intelligence firm Morning Consult has found that consumers in emerging markets are more likely to support a government-controlled digital currency, or central bank digital currency (CBDC), than those in developed markets.

Contrary to framing by policymakers, the data also reveals that consumers around the world do not distinguish between CBDCs and private cryptocurrencies, with many showing support for both.
