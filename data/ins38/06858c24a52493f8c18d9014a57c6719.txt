This was meant to be an ascendant year for Hagen Danner. The catcher-turned-pitcher showed enough stuff in 2021 to get added to the Blue Jays' 40-man roster when he was Rule 5-eligible last offseason, and his upper-90s velocity meant he could push to Toronto quickly.
Then an elbow injury in late April with Double-A New Hampshire turned that fast lane into a slow crawl. Danner didn't appear in a regular-season game the rest of the way but has been offered an opportunity to ramp back up with his placement with Salt River in the Arizona Fall League.
