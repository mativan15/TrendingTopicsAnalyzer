The stock symbol {{StockChart.Ric}} does not exist See Full Stock Page » Tesla Inc. reported third-quarter sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, citing the U.S. dollar's growing strength, along with production and delivery bottlenecks. Revenue rose to US$21.5 billion, the company said in a shareholder letter Wednesday, compared with projections of US$22.1 billion. Profit excluding some items rose to US$1.05 a share, exceeding the US$1.01 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts are paying close attention to how quickly Tesla can increase output of its mass-market Model Y SUV from new factories in Austin and Berlin -- a key milestone for the pioneering EV maker.
