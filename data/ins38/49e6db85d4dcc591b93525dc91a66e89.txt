Japan's space agency says an attempted launch of its Epsilon-6 rocket failed on Wednesday morning. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, tried to launch the 30-meter rocket from the Uchinoura Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, southwestern Japan, at around 9:50 a.m. JAXA officials say the rocket encountered issues as it was ascending. After determining they could no longer safely navigate the rocket, they sent a command to self-destruct. The Epsilon-6 was carrying multiple satellites, including two for commercial use developed by a venture company from Fukuoka City in western Japan.
