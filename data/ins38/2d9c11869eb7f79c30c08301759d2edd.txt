PTIMumbai: Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis The BJP has fielded Union minister Piyush Goyal, as well as its senior leaders Anil Bonde and Dhananjay Mahadik for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections to six seats from Maharashtra, and senior party leader Devendra Fadnavis asserted that all of them will win. The three BJP leaders filed their nomination papers on Monday for the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled on June 10. The BJP has enough votes to win two seats on its own. Maharashtra's ruling alliance partners Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress have the votes to get one candidate each elected separately, but together they can get another candidate elected to the Upper House of Parliament.
