Disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti will be sentenced Thursday for stealing nearly $300,000 in book advance money from porn star Stormy Daniels. 
Avenatti, who is already serving time on a separate extortion rap, faces a minimum sentence of two years in prison and a maximum of more than 20 years behind bars. 
In a letter to Manhattan federal court Judge Jesse Furman, prosecutors sided with a recommendation from the probation department in requesting Avenatti be sentenced to a total of four years in prison, two years of which could be served concurrent to time in the extortion case.
