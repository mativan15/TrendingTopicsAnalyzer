ReutersThe infamous mystery of the disappearance around the Bermuda Triangle region, once again, has become the spotlight of the weekend. A US-based travel company claims that they will completely refund the passengers of the Bermuda-triangle cruise ship in case they disappear in the north Atlantic ocean region during the cruise. The offer is placed on a display advertisement on the Agency's website. It is mentioned to not worry about the travellers' disappearance on the curated Bermuda Triangle tour because such an incident is unlikely to happen, and in case it occurs, the money paid for such a cruise by passengers will be 100% refunded.
