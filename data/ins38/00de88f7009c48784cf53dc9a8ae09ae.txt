Mick Carter's (Danny Dyer) world comes crashing down in EastEnders next week, as he receives terrible news about soulmate Linda (Kellie Bright), who is involved in a devastating car crash.
Linda, intent on spilling the beans about Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) scheming, sets off on a trip to Watford with daughter Nancy (Maddy Hill). 
Nancy, however, get wind of the fact that Linda contemplated leaving the Square several weeks ago, and thus a confrontation ensues between she and her mum. 
Linda attempts to explain herself, but Nancy storms off, abandoning her mum and sister Annie by the side of the road.
