More than two million pensioners are living in poverty, according to the latest figures from Age UK.Despite this, the older generation is the age group which is most likely to be missing out on benefits from the DWP.Nearly three and a half (3.4) million pensioners are missing out on Attendance Allowance which is paid to state pensioners who have a disability or health condition.At the same time, 800 000 Britons are not claiming Pension Credit which not only tops up their pension, but also acts as a gateway to additional benefits and 'freebies'.
