By Yi Wei Wong Li Ning Co. is trading lower amid a broad selloff in Hong Kong and concerns about the Chinese sportswear company's sales outlook, but that hasn't prompted analysts to rescind their buy calls the stock. The Beijing-based company's shares fell as much as 8.3% to 48.55 Hong Kong dollars (US$6.18) in early trade Thursday. They were last down 4.1%, taking year-to-date losses to more than 40%, while the broader Hang Seng Index was down 2.1%. Li Ning said Wednesday that overall same-store sales registered a high, single-digit increase in the third quarter from a year earlier.
