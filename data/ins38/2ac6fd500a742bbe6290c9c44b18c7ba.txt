Detroit Red Wings forward Jakub Vrana has been placed in NHL/NHLPA player assistance program, the team and league revealed Wednesday.

Vrana had been excused from the Wings since Monday, for what head coach Derek Lalonde said were personal reasons. Vrana, 26, will be unavailable to the team "for an indefinite period while he receives care."

Detroit Red Wings left wing Jakub Vrana (15) takes a shot against Montreal Canadiens goaltender Jake Allen (34) during first period action at Little Caesars Arena Friday, October 14, 2022.
