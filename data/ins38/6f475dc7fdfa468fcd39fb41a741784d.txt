By Reuters Published: 11:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 Arizona Cardinals wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins returned from the suspended list Monday and could be back on the field Thursday night when the New Orleans Saints roll into town. And for 2-4 Arizona, the help couldn't be more timely. "He's gonna be anxious to get the ball in his hands and be super competitive. We need him to lift us up, there's no question, with how we're playing right now," Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury said.
