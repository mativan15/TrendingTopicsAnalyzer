Meta's flagship Metaverse app Horizon Worlds has been struggling to gain new users,  The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. The publication, which reviewed internal documents, reveal Meta had initially targeted 500,000 monthly active users by year's end, later it revised the goal to 280,000. The current figure is less than 200,000 now, according to the report. Horizon Worlds is a free virtual reality app created by Meta.
Horizon World's user base has steadily declined since spring. In fact, most users don't return after the first month.
