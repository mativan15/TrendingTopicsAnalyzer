U.S. factory production rose for a third month in September, suggesting firm growth in manufacturing that's underpinned by solid business investment and demand for consumer goods.
The 0.4 percent increase in output matched the upwardly revised August advance, Federal Reserve data showed Tuesday. Including mining and utilities, total industrial production also rose 0.4 percent in September.
While domestic demand for merchandise has generally softened amid both shifting consumer preferences and relentless inflation, the report showed healthy demand for appliances, motor vehicles and clothing.
