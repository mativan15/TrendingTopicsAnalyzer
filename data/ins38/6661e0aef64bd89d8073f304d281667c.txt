The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council said enforcement action against a single offence can be initiated either by state or central tax authorities, a move aimed at preventing issuance of multiple show cause notices (SCNs) to businesses for the same offence. In an office memorandum dated October 19, the council said a taxpayer located within a state is open to enforcement action by both authorities, but all consequential action relating to the case, including appeal, review, adjudication, rectification and revision, will be taken by the authority that had initiated the enforcement action.
