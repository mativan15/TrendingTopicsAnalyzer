The tablecloth is laid down, the silver cutlery wrapped in a napkin placed before me. Then comes the main – a plate of succulent blackened chicken pieces, coated in spices. It's served in a puddle of tomato jam, with steamed rice, and garnished with crispy taro chips. It's followed by a bittersweet chocolate panna cotta, silky smooth, with tart berry coulis and a shard of dark chocolate. The only thing that gives away it's airplane food is the slight wobble when we hit a patch of turbulence. The dishes are the creations of Kiwi chef Richard Cross, the new executive chef for Fiji Airways.
