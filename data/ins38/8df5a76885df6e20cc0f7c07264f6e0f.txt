Felice Café has been open for just one month and local vendors are already seeing a boost in business because of it. Owner Michelle Brouwer left the medical field top open the café. 'We love good food, live music, supporting local and I just wound them all together in a café,' said Brouwer. 'There has been a lot of lessons to learn but so far it's been really great and positive.' She wanted to make a space where the focus of everything, from the food to the drinks and other products on the shelves, was supporting local.
