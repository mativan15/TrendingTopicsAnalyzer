State lawmakers are pushing a bill that would help pad the pockets of lawyers representing clients in medical malpractice lawsuits, The Post has learned.
The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Charles Lavine (D-Nassau) and state Sen. Jamaal Bailey (D-Bronx), would boost the sliding scale of contingency fees that attorneys can collect from clients in such cases, typically filed against hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities.
'The measure makes it easier for lawyers to take these cases on,' said Lavine, noting the suits are often complex and expensive to work on.
