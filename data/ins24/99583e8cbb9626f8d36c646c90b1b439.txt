Zoom (ZM 4.45%) was beating the market Thursday: Its shares were up by 6% as of 12:45 p.m. ET compared to a 0.1% drop in the S&P 500. That pop erased just a small portion of the video communications specialist's stock declines for this year. It remains down by 56% so far in 2022.
The day's gains came as investors' sentiment around tech stocks continued to swing, this time toward the positive.
So what
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up by 1.1% in early afternoon trading, and the broad factors driving its bounce were the same ones underpinning Zoom's move.
