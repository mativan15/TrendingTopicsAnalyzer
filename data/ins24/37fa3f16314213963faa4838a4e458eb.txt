Let's go out on an oh-what-the-heck-do-we-have-to-lose limb and offer up four upsets for Week 7.

The upstart fellas from New York both will win to stretch their combined victories to 11. They had eight all last year.

The Steelers will win at Miami because Mike Tomlin doesn't do losing seasons. And for the Upset Special, take Atlanta's Marcus Mariota to help beat Joe Burrow in Cincinnati to match what should be Tom Brady's 4-3 start in Tampa Bay.

Restless Vikings fans on their bye week will, of course, be rooting for another upset to come from Washington.
