Offshore worker Ross MacPhail clambered over a balcony as other guests gathered for breakfast at the Sleeperz Hotel in Dundee on 3 January. As he swung on the light fitting, he banged glass pendants together to smash them, and shards fell into the foyer. At Dundee Sheriff Court, he admitted wilfully or recklessly destroying or damaging property.
