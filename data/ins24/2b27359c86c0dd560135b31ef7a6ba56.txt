May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil and natural gas rigs this week for the first time in 31 weeks, but the rig count rose for a record 22nd month in a row even.Theweekly rig count decline comes as some U.S. publicly traded firms continue to focus more on returning money to shareholders and paying down debt rather than boosting output.The U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 727 in the week to May 27, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said in its closely followed report on Friday.
