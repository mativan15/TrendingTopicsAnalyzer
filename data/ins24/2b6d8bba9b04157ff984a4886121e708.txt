May 28—HIGH POINT — Justin Thompson bought a video camera while he was a college student, intending to shoot a few videos for fun on weekends.

"I thought it would just be a hobby," he said.

He saw a medical career in his future.

His future had different plans.

Nine years later, Thompson, 32, now manages two successful video-production businesses, has a branch office in Atlanta and has launched a related nonprofit organization that soon will begin production on a documentary about addiction and its effects on families.
