Jun. 2—SUFFIELD — A traffic and pedestrian safety study recently completed for the town recommends a number of improvements for local roads, including the realignment of intersections, installation of roundabouts, and the addition of stop signs, crosswalks, and crossing signals.

The study was completed over the past year with the use of traffic data from previous years, field observations at locations all over town, and comments from the public.

Having already completed the study gives the town an advantage in obtaining grant money for the recommended projects, Town Engineer Karen Isherwood said.
