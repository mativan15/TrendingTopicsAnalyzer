PHILADELPHIA — As rookie Spencer Strider took the mound for the first time in almost a month, the Atlanta Braves mapped out a "best-case scenario" for the young fireballer.

This wasn't it.

After mowing down the Phillies early in Game 3 of the NL Division Series on Friday, a four-pitch walk to lead off the third inning and a subsequent wild pickoff throw seemed to change everything for Strider.

Pretty soon, he was back on bench, shaking his head in a shaking Citizens Bank Park moments after Rhys Hoskins hammered a three-run homer into the left-field seats.
