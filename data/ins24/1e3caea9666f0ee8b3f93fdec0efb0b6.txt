Published: 21:23 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 21:23 EDT, 4 June 2022 Iggy Azalea has made an impressive profit after flipping her fancy home in the Hidden Hills area of Los Angeles.After splashing $7.15million estate for a five-bedroom house just last year, the rapper has now sold it for an eye-watering $8million, pocketing a tidy $750,000 for the star. Spread over 4289-square-metres of prime real estate in the glitterati-laden enclave that is Hidden Hills, the 31-year-old only owned the house for barely 365 days, buying the property in June last year.
