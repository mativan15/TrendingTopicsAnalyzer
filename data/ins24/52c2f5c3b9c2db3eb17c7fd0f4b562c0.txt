President Biden warned Friday that if Republicans seize the congressional majority in next month's midterm elections, they will "crash the economy" by holding up the debt limit to extract spending cuts while targeting the two main entitlement programs - Medicare and Social Security.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who could become speaker if the GOP wins the House, suggested this week that his party would be willing to use an increase in the debt limit to force policy changes. McCarthy also did not rule out including Medicare and Social Security in the calculation as Republicans look to reduce government spending.
