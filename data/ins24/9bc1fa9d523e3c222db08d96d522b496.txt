Kanye West labelled Piers Morgan a 'Karen' during his interview on Morgan's TalkTV show on Wednesday (19 October).

West appeared on the show after facing backlash over antisemitic comments he made on the Drink Champs podcast last week.

'You don't hold accountability to my pain, you're being a Karen,' West told the presenter in a snippet from the interview, which will air in full later this week.

A 'Karen' is a pejorative term for a white woman who is seen as demanding or unreasonable and tries to use her white privilege to get her own way.
