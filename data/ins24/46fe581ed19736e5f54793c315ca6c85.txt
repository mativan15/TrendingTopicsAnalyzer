The festival of Diwali brings along a lot of cheer and like every business, even the film industry waits for a dhamaka with their festive releases. The past few months have not been great for Hindi movies and given the fact that none of the festive releases this year, be it Heropanti 2, Runway 34, or Laal Singh Chaddha, Rakshabandhan, have performed upto the mark. All eyes are now on the two Diwali releases - Ajay Devgn, Siddharth Malhotra and Rakul Preet starrer Thank God, and Akshay Kumar, Jacqueline Fernandes and Nushrratt Bharuccha starrer Ram Setu - to work their magic at the ticket windows.
