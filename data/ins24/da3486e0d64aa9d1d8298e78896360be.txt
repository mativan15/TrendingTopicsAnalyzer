Christina Aguilera is reflecting on her Stripped era — and the gender politics that came with it.

The "Beautiful" singer, 41, sat down with Vogue for its "Life in Looks" series, where she gave her thoughts on some of her most iconic outfits and moments over her long career. When she got to the cover art for 2002's Stripped, which included a photo of Aguilera topless with her long hair covering her chest, she recalled how she wanted the album to "embrace every different part of being a woman." That included "feeling empowered and strong" as well as "owning" her sexuality.
