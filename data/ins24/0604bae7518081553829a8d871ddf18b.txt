From familiar faces to fresh ones, one candidate will elevate to the city's top elected position on Election Day this coming Monday. Two-term incumbent mayor Drew Dilkens is running on his track record of holding the line on taxes, economic development and building infrastructure and amenities. "We will continue to make smart and calculated decisions without being dangerous and risky in the process," said Dilkens. "This is what leadership that delivers is all about." The strongest challenge coming from two-term councillor, Chris Holt.
