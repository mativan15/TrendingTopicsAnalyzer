The authorities in EU member states aren't showing enough of an appetite to claw back the tens of billions in funds lost to fraud each year, according to the head of the EU's financial crime agency.Laura Kövesi, chief prosecutor at the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), told Euronews that EU tax authorities are failing to collect an estimated €130 billion in VAT each year, with between €30 billion and €60 billion of that lost to fraud or 'simply stolen' from the country's coffers.'If I were a finance minister, I would probably be losing sleep over it,' she said.
