Britain's four biggest banks are set to report combined annual profits of about £33 billion this year thanks to rising interest rates as speculation mounts that Jeremy Hunt will raise taxes on the industry to repair the public finances.Third-quarter results next week from HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest and Barclays are expected to show they are on course for a strong year. The scale of their profits, based on analysts' predictions, could bolster the case for Hunt, the new chancellor, to hit the industry with higher taxes.
