A father and son from Monroe were sentenced to federal prison on Tuesday on drug and money laundering charges.

Kenneth John Rhule, 47, and Kenneth Warren Rhule, 28, were both sentenced to five years in prison for their operation of an illegal marijuana business, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in a press release. The younger Rhule was also engaged in unlicensed cryptocurrency exchange activity.

The duo manufactured and distributed marijuana products out of a facility in Monroe, selling products to consumers across the country for cash or cryptocurrency.
