Stefano Guidi | Getty Images News | Getty Images Stellantis' electric vehicle plans put it in competition with firms such as Elon Musk's Tesla as well as companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM. According to the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales are on course to hit an all-time high this year. The CEO of Stellantis told CNBC Monday that the company would use its own sites to generate half the energy it needs for manufacturing by the middle of this decade. "We have decided the appropriate investments for Stellantis to be able, from a manufacturing standpoint, in 2025 to produce 50% of our energy needs within our own sites," Carlos Tavares, who was speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed at Paris Motor Show, said.
