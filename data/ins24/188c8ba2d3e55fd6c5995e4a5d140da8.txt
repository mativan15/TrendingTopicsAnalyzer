Kevin de León never lacked for ambition.

He ignored long odds and waged an uphill bid to dislodge fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from the U.S. Senate.

He barely warmed his seat on the Los Angeles City Council before throwing himself into the race for mayor.

Both efforts proved unavailing. But until De León was caught yukking it up on a recording filled with racist, homophobic, cruel and cutting remarks, neither setback seemed to have done him any great harm.

Few — much less De León — viewed the council as the zenith of his public career.
