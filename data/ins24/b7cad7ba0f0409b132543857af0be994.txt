Warning: This article contains spoilers from Wednesday's episode of The Masked Singer.

The Mermaid is no longer part of the Masked Singer world.

The enchanting costume was sent home second on the Andrew Lloyd Webber-themed night of the show, after the Maize mask was first sent packing. That glam ear of corn was revealed to be Sex and the City actor and comedian Mario Cantone.

This meant that Robo Girl and Mermaid were sent to this week's Battle Royale, which featured their unique takes on Evita's infamous ballad, "Don't Cry for Me Argentina.
