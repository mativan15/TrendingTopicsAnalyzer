A 'large number' of police have descended on the main street of a south Auckland town. Businesses located near Papakura's courthouse have said an incident occurred at the building some time after 12.30pm on Friday. Ambulance and police were called, and a person on a stretcher was carried off. A local business near the courthouse said they heard sirens and the police helicopter at roughly 12.30pm, the manager said the road outside the courthouse has since been blocked off. 'We saw somebody go out on a stretcher, but I wasn't sure about their condition or anything,' the manager said.
