It is possible that no one apart from a few teenagers will notice its passing. And yet, it is far from alone. The once booming British fast fashion industry is in big trouble. Boohoo, one of its leaders, stumbles from crisis-to-crisis. Its shares are down by 73pc in the last year as it struggles to maintain sales and deals with criticism of conditions at its factories. The Hut Group, with a vast range of online offerings, is down by 73pc over the past year. Asos, the market leader, is down by 69pc since last May: a company that was doing well enough to buy the Topshop brand is now in steep decline.
