Rob Key believes The Hundred will be the financial lifeline that ultimately saves county cricket.
The ECB's divisive two-year-old competition has been one of the most controversial elements of the recent high-performance review, with the governing body considering it locked into the prime month of August until 2028.
Key believes the competition will end up being profitable – perhaps especially if private investment is introduced in the manner seen in T20 tournaments in the UAE and South Africa – and due to the ECB's constitution, that money will flow down to the counties.
