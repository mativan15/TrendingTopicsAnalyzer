In most cases, accident victims don't really understand the details of subrogation or the subrogation meaning because most of this process just happens automatically behind the scenes.
Victims will make a claim to their insurer who will pay compensation based on their policy terms. The insurer will then aim to recover the money from the at-fault party's insurance company. If there is a dispute over who was at fault or how much compensation should have been paid out, this can be resolved through a mediation process between the insurance companies or, if necessary, in court.
