Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term CareTrust REIT, Inc. (NYSE:CTRE) shareholders, since the share price is down 25% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 44%. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.7% in the last thirty days.

While the last three years has been tough for CareTrust REIT shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise.
