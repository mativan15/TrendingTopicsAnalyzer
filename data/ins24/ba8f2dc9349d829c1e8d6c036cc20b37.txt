The Telangana High Court on Wednesday instructed the State government to explain within a month what steps it had initiated to comply with the Supreme Court directions with regard to transgenders and their welfare. A bench of Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice C.V. Bhaskar Reddy gave this direction while hearing a PIL petition filed during the COVID-19 pandemic seeking measures to protect the lives of transgenders getting starved during COIVD-19. Advocate Jayna Kothari said before the bench that the government was required to initiate more measures for the welfare of transgenders.
