(Reuters) - Investors pulled an estimated $26 billion from hedge funds during the third quarter, according to data provider HFR, jarred by a global stock market plunge, soaring bond yields and geopolitical tensions.

That comes on top of a $27.5 billion outflow in the second quarter, the first time that hedge funds have seen consistant outflows from one quarter to the next since the height of the COVID pandemic in 2020, HFR numbers showed.

According to the data provider, the outflows were driven by a $12.
