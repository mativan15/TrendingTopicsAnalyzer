Paladin, which pitches itself as an innovator in the emerging field of "justice tech," has a pro bono management platform that it hopes will revolutionize how law firms and corporate legal departments engage with legal-services groups.Pro bono tasks and allocations are still frequently handled through spreadsheets, emails, phone calls, and sticky notes, said Kristen Sonday, the cofounder and chief executive of Paladin. For instance, legal-services organizations email long case lists to the firms and corporate law departments they work with, she said.
