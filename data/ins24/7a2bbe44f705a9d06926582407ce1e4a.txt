While there weren't any stairs involved in this year's annual stairclimb event, featuring Calgary's first responders, there were plenty of donations to a worthy cause anyway. Beginning at 8 a.m., Calgary Fire Chief Steve Dongworth and Calgary Police Chief Mark Neufeld were joined by other firefighters and civilians at Canada Olympic Park. Once there, they put on 60 pounds of firefighting gear and climbed 390 feet in elevation for a total distance of three kilometres. It was the first time the annual Wellspring Stairclimb Challenge was held in-person in approximately two years.
