The construction materials market is fragmented, according to GlobalFair CEO Shaily Garg, because it involves layers of both supply chain and logistics complexities. In a 2021 survey for the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo, the vast majority of builders said that the time it takes to obtain materials — and the cost of materials — continue to be the top issues they face.
Garg posits that technology can help, which is why she launched GlobalFair in 2020 with Ashish Chandra. A business-to-business startup, GlobalFair aims to simplify the procurement of 'ready-to-install' materials such as countertops, quartz countertops, cabinets, natural stones and tiles with a digital marketplace for U.
