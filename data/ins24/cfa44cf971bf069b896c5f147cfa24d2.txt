AgenciesJada Pinkett Smith acknowledged that she began dating Will Smith "too soon" following his 1995 divorce from Sheree Zampino. The most recent Red Table Talk episode, which featured Zampino and was focused on the subject of "toxic forgiveness," featured her expanding on the confession. While the two have built a very pleasant sisterhood over the years, Jada Smith stated on the Facebook Watch programme that it hadn't been easy along the road because the two "were both pretty fiery." Zampino described a specific incident in which Jada Smith expressed regret for rushing into a relationship with Smith and the child he shared with Zampino before the two divorced.
