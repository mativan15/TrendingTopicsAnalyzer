Gangs of London executive producer Jane Featherstone has admitted that even she gave feedback about the Sky Atlantic drama's violence.
The explosive first series followed Sean Wallace (Joe Cole) as he sought to avenge his father Finn's (Colm Meaney) murder taking out anyone he thought could be the suspect.
With 113 deaths and 96 shootings, the nine-parter smashed records for being the most violent show on TV, beating Game of Thrones, while director Corin Hardy said he wants Gangs of London to be the ‘most dangous programme' on the small screen.
