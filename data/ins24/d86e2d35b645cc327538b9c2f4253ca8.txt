TAMPA, Fla.

The four kids from Tampa had a bone to pick.

When the Chillura siblings — three brothers and a sister, ages 4 to 12 — visited their grandparents in Ohio, a highlight was getting rich scoops of ice cream from the beloved Graeter's shop.

But back at home in South Tampa just north of Gandy Boulevard? Nada.

'Down in our neighborhood, we never had a real homemade ice cream shop,' said Max Chillura, now 27. So they agreed that when they grew up, they'd open one.

Fast-forward, and Chill Bros.
