While most municipalities are fighting voter apathy about next week's elections, Richmond Hill voters are so upset with their elected officials they've actually taken to the streets.

Over the past two weekends, a group called A Better Richmond Hill has held two rallies to encourage residents to vote out three councillors the group says have repeatedly disrupted council business, creating a 'toxic environment' at city hall and making residents 'embarrassed' to live here.

The rallies — both disrupted by counter rallies by supporters of the same three councillors — are symbolic of the divisiveness and mayhem that has taken over local politics this term.
