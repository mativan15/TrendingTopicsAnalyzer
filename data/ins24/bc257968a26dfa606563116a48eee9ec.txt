A re-elected Victorian Labor government would build 4.5 gigawatts of publicly owned renewable energy generation, with a renewable energy target of 95 per cent by 2035.  The election promise also includes an emissions reduction target of 75 to 80 per cent by 2035, and net-zero emissions by 2045 — five years ahead of the government's previous commitments. The deadline of the targets aligns with the new closure date of Victoria's biggest coal-fired power station, Loy Yang A.    Premier Daniel Andrews said as part of the promise, the government would spend at least $20 million dollars to revive the State Electricity Commission (SEC), which has been a shell of its former status since the end of the 20th century.
