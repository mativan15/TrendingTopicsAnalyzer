TikTok creators will soon be handed a fresh set of tools to soundtrack their videos and potentially make hit songs when a new in-app platform created by Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment company, in partnership with Universal Music Group and Samsung, launches on the platform later this month.   Called StemDrop, the initiative will provide TikTok's more than 1 billion monthly users with access to music 'stems' (the isolated components of a song, such as drum tracks or individual vocal parts) from an exclusive new track composed by hit songwriters Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ali Payami entitled 'Red Lights,' which creators can then use to record and share their own versions.
