(RTTNews) - Ahead of Wednesday's holiday for Election Day, the South Korea stock market had finished higher in three straight sessions, collecting more than 70 points or 2.8 percent along the way. The KOSPI now rests just above the 2,685-point plateau although they're likely to run out of steam on Thursday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft thanks to rising bond yields and soft economic data. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow that lead.
