Asian migrant small business owners in Auckland and Wellington allege an accountant pursued a campaign of intimidation after they tried to switch accountants. Actions taken by the accountant allegedly included invoicing clients for costs they didn't owe, using debt collectors as an intimidation tactic, altering a tax return without permission and making accusations against two accountants her former clients tried to hire to replace her. One of the accountant's clients wrote a letter to the professional conduct committee of the Chartered Accountants Association of Australia and New Zealand (Caanz) and accused the accountant of 'harassing me at midnight and early morning to express her unhappiness'.
