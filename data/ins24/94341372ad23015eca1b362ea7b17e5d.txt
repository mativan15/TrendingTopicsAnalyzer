Over on the other side of our New York football town, Brian Daboll has been celebrated for the job he's done with the Giants and their mercurial and miraculous turnaround this season.
And justifiably so: The Giants first-year head coach is the hands-down early favorite as NFL Coach of the Year with the roster-depleted Giants 5-1 through six weeks after winning a total of 22 games in the previous five seasons.
But as Daboll has been deified six games into his Giants career, it's time, too, that we salute Robert Saleh and the job he's steadily done with the Jets, who are 4-2 and very relevant after Sunday's resounding, eye-opening 27-10 domination of the Packers at Lambeau Field.
