Jun. 01, 2022 2:39 PM ETGDRXBy: Pranav Ghumatkar, SA News Editor Baird analyst Vikram Kesavabhotla downgraded GoodRx Holdings (GDRX -5.3%) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $7, down from $10. The company's Q1 report highlighted disruption associated with a specific grocer, now "well understood" to be Kroger, and his latest proprietary analysis of pricing across several platforms leaves him incrementally concerned about the company's ability to recover this volume and alleviate this type of risk with other partners.
