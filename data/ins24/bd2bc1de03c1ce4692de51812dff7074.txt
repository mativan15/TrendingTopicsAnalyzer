If ever there was a pyrrhic victory – a win that comes at enormous cost– this is it. Yes, Johnny Depp won all three of his defamation claims against Amber Heard, while she won only one.  And quantitatively, he was awarded more money: $10 million to her $2 million.But in the end, they both destroyed each other.  They came across as miserable, insufferable, and vindictive people who hated each other so much that they decided to exploit the justice system to exact revenge. A screenshot of Johnny Depp laughing and chatting with his lawyer, Ben Chew, while Ellen Barkin's pre-recorded deposition was played for jurors at his defamation trial against Amber Heard.
