Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday issued a warning to the Bharatiya Janata Party - "We're in power here (in Maharashtra)... they shouldn't forget". Raut's comment comes as his party and the BJP prep for battle over the one (as yet) undecided Rajya Sabha seat from the state, amid allegations the BJP is 'spending crores on horse-trading', or buying votes.The Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) - which make up the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) - have put up four candidates, including Raut, and the BJP three.
