Published: 15:38 EDT, 27 May 2022 | Updated: 15:38 EDT, 27 May 2022 A 26-year-old graduate who died from 'catastrophic' blood clots on his brain two weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine was given out-of-date information about blood clot risks, an inquest has heard.   Jack Hurn, from Redditch, died in June last year, less than two weeks after receiving the jab at a Dudley vaccine centre. A week-long inquest at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard that a GP informed Mr Hurn the risk of blood clots on the brain for his age group was one in 250,000, when the latest NHS guidance estimated it to be one in 50,000.
