Liverpool could make their first major signing of the summer transfer window in Barcelona's Gavi, according to reports. With their financial power being much greater than that of the Blaugrana, the Catalan club could be helpless to see the midfield prodigy depart for pastures new.With James Milner set to depart on a free transfer and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain likely to seek an exit, midfield reinforcements are needed at Anfield. A move for Aurelien Tchouameni now looks dead in the water with multiple reports suggesting Real Madrid are frontrunners for his signature, leading the Reds to pursue other targets.
