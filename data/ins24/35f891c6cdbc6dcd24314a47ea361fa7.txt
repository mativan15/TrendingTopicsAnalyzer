ssuaphoto/iStock via Getty Images Investors seem ready to starting buying energy stocks (NYSEARCA:XLE) again as earnings start rolling in, looking to boost their weightings in the sector given healthy free cash flows, Truist analyst Neal Dingmann said Monday, favoring the sector because it remains cheap and has positive earnings revision trends. Following talks with a number of E&P companies as well as several investors, Dingmann said he believes "demand for energy stocks is about to dramatically increase" as earnings reports come in.
