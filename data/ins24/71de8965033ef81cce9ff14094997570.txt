Taylor Swift is on a tear.

On Friday, the pop superstar is set to release her new album, 'Midnights,' which she's described as 'a journey through terrors and sweet dreams' that features 13 tracks including a duet with Lana Del Rey. The LP will be the fourth set of new songs she's dropped since 2019, when 'Lover' came out and was quickly followed by a pair of 2020 albums, 'Folklore' and 'Evermore,' that the singer recorded during the COVID pandemic; last year she added to the pile with the first two installments, 'Fearless (Taylor's Version)' and 'Red (Taylor's Version),' in her plan to re-record the six albums that partially slipped out of her control when her old record label changed hands.
