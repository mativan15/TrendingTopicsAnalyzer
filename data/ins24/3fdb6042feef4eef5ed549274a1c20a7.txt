Online pensions platform PensionBee has seen a surge in customers over the past year as it capitalises on 'careful money management' during turbulent times.The pensions challenger, set up to help people who have had several jobs consolidate retirement pots, said it had 956,000 customers at the end of September, up from 602,000 a year earlier.It also reported a 24 per cent increase in the assets under management by the platform, which totalled £2.79 billion in the nine months to September 30.But the London-listed fintech firm added in its third-quarter trading update that it still expects its full-year revenues to be within previous guidance, of about £17 million to £18 million, 'given that markets are likely to remain subdued'.
