In the current market downturn, it's been challenging to find growth stocks capitalizing on large opportunities and also achieving profitability. This combination is the holy grail for growth investors. It generally indicates a company with a profitable business model that can flourish because it's taking market share in a lucrative industry. 
As rare as these stocks are, Adyen (ADYE.Y 8.49%) and PubMatic (PUBM 6.36%) are two hidden gems that managed to achieve this balance. I say hidden because both stocks are currently trading down over 51% year-to-date.
