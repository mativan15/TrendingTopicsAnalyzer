Instagram said that the refresh is designed to help create "more immersive and inclusive experiences" for users.
Among the changes introduced on May 23 is a new, brighter icon that sports the app's enlivened "colour gradient".
It's effectively the same icon as before but illuminated, a change that's reflected across the app's design.
