A New York jury on Thursday concluded that Kevin Spacey should not be held liable for allegedly sexually assaulting a then-adolescent actor, bringing a close to a $40 million civil lawsuit and marking the end, for now, of any legal threat to the A-lister on American soil.Taking about an hour to deliberate, the jury dismissed the battery claim at the core of a lawsuit filed by Anthony Rapp after nine days of testimony in Manhattan federal court. Rapp and Spacey both took the stand to tell their respective versions of an encounter Rapp says took place when he was 14 years old.
