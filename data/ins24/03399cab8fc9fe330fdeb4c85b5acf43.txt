Air New Zealand passengers who have booked trips to Western Australia this summer are going to have a rather different experience than usual, one with a Spanish flavour. The national carrier is chartering a plane from Madrid-based Wamos Air from November 15 to February 17 next year. It follows Air New Zealand CEO Greg Foran's announcement last week that the national carrier was looking at leasing aircraft and crew from overseas to get it through the summer period off the back of heavy domestic bookings.
