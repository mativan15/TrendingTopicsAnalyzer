After spending an 'enormous amount of money' trying to find qualified workers through Facebook advertisements and job boards, the owner of a Texas pet resort continued to be disappointed by the applicants.

Many of those applicants would agree to an interview but never show up — known as 'ghosting' — and one worker who he did recently hire was fired three days later.

So Walter Parsons, owner of Pets Gone Wild Resort in Pasadena, took matters into his own hands.

'I figured I'll put up a sign and I'll see what happens with local people that are just driving by,' he told McClatchy News in a phone interview.
