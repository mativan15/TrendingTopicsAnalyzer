Hobson was detained in February 2020 and was facing deportation under the Migration Act because, according to Federal Court documents, 'the minister has identified that Mr Hobson does not pass the character test'.That was because 'the minister reasonably suspects that Mr Hobson has been or is a member of a group or organisation, or has had or has an association with a group, organisation or person that has been or is involved in criminal conduct within the meaning of s 501(6)(b) of the Migration Act'.
