Former Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone denied on Friday he had been arrested in Brazil and said an illegal gun found in his luggage before boarding a flight was never used and had no ammunition.The 91-year-old Briton, now in Portugal, told Reuters a 'silly, tiny little incident' had caused a lot of aggravation as he and his family tried to leave Sao Paulo by private plane on Wednesday night.'I haven't had any publicity lately and I thought I ought to do something to get some,' he joked in a telephone conversation.
