Published: 20:36 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 20:36 EDT, 19 October 2022 West Australian police will launch a month of industrial action over a pay and conditions claim, saying officers have been let down after doing their part to protect the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The action will include disconnecting from work-related calls and emails while off duty, working to the award, working strictly to rostered hours, and refusing voluntary recalls. In an open letter to Premier Mark McGowan, WA Police Union president Mick Kelly said the force went "above and beyond" what was expected of them during the pandemic, protecting the state's borders and airports and policing quarantine hotels.
