The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the West Bengal School Service Commission (WBSSC) recruitment irregularities scam, has cast doubts over the number of irregular appointments to be much higher than what was initially perceived. According to CBI sources, the actual figure of the appointments will surely be much higher than the figure quoted by the Calcutta High Court-appointed judicial probe committee headed by retired Justice Ranjit Kumar Bag.

The committee's report was the basis on which the Calcutta High Court ordered the CBI to investigate the scam.
