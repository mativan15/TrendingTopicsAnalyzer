The pound and government bonds rallied in response to Jeremy Hunt reversing the bulk of the tax cuts in the mini-budget but UK assets have not yet recovered the losses suffered since Liz Truss became prime minister.The pound rose 2.2 per cent against the dollar on Monday to $1.14 and government borrowing costs, as reflected in the ten-year gilt yield, dropped by 3.5 percentage points to the lowest in three weeks at circa 3.9 per cent. Bond yields fall when the price rises.Relative calm has returned to the financial markets after the government began a series of U-turns on its tax policy last week, culminating in the chancellor announcing that he would reverse two thirds of the measures in the mini-budget.
