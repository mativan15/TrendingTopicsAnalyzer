The digital landscape is evolving so fast that one's four-year degree can hardly keep up with the myriad platforms and APIs emerging every day. That's why Skills Union wants to connect tech startup workers looking to level up with an array of field-specific experts over live video.

Online professional training isn't new; It's not uncommon to see medium-sized startups allocate several thousand dollars to individual employees each year to further their "personal development." But the existing options for acquiring professional skills just aren't very effective, argues Colin Mansell, founder and CEO of Skills Union.
