Published: 17:55 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 18:17 EDT, 17 October 2022 Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles has denied claims that Tom Brady's Saturday appearance at New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft's wedding in New York had an impact on the team's 20-18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.  Bowles was also quick to reject reports that Brady receives preferential treatment after letting him attend Friday's wedding, just a day before the team's walk-through. Brady, 45, has already missed a few practices this season, once taking 11-days off during the team's training camp to allegedly resolve personal issues related to his ongoing feud with his estranged wife, Gisele Bundchen.
