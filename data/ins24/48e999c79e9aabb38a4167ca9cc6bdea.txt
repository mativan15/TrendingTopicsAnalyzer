This year, Memorial Day lands on May 30, but the deals are already available right now. The overwhelming majority of Memorial Day sales tend to lean on non-tech deals like large and small appliances, clothing, kitchen, and sporting goods. For the tech savvy deal hunter, however, this is one of the best times of year to score deals on PCs (laptops and desktops), especially from OEM manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP. Generally, you won't find better prices on these categories until Black Friday.
