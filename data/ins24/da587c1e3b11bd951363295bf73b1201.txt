The Mumbai police arrested an assistant police sub-inspector and a constable from the Sir JJ Marg police station Saturday after they allegedly extorted Rs 10,000 from a diamond merchant and booked the two lower-rung policemen. However, an IPS officer involved in a similar offence registered eight months ago remains untraced.
The LT Marg police on February 19 registered an FIR in connection with the angadia extortion case, in which four policemen, including the 2010 batch IPS officer Saurabh Tripathi were named as accused.
