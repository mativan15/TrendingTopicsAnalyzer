Chairman and founder Don Vultaggio said that the company has no plans on raising the price and would keep the price at 99¢ 'for as long as we can.' AriZona Iced Tea is a billion-dollar, family-owned company and has maintained their 99¢ price for 30 years. The reason they are able to keep the price low is because they do not spend money on advertising. Instead, they rely on word of mouth.
