A mum is worried her daughter might be teased at school after her sister pointed out the unfortunate word her two names create when pronounced together. She says her and her husband welcomed their first child nine weeks ago and decided to call her Elizabeth. They wanted to give her the middle name Jane, with the intention of calling her EJ, but during the pregnancy her partner's mum passed away from breast cancer. Her name was Anya and the mum offered to change their daughter's middle name as a tribute, which the family loved - so her middle names became Anya Jane.
