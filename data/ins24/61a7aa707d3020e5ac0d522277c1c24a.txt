The Green Bay Packers are still deciding if veteran receiver Sammy Watkins will be activated from injured reserve and play on Sunday against the Washington Commanders.

Coach Matt LaFleur said the Packers want to see how Watkins feels after practicing all three days this week before making a decision on his playing status for Sunday.

'It's kind of the up in the air right now, I'd say,' LaFleur said Friday. 'He's gotten through practice the last couple days. We'll see how he responds. Certainly, I think we'd like to get him out there, but at the same time, you don't want to put a guy at further risk.
