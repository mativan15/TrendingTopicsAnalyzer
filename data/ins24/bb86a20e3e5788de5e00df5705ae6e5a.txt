MILAN, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust watchdog has opened an inquiry into Autostrade per l'Italia over whether the motorway group had abused its dominant position in electronic toll collections, thus hampering holding group Unipol's entry in that lucrative market.

The probe follows a complaint by UnipolTech, a unit of Unipol, which alleged that Autostrade, through its role as part of the AISCAT association of Italian toll concession companies, may have used its dominant position to make it more difficult for new entrants to secure access to contracts.
