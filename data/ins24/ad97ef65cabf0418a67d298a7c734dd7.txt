Millions of bank customers across the country now have access to their paychecks 48 hours early.

'It would help a lot,' said DeAntre Marshall, a customer at Regions Bank. 'Sometimes you have bills that you have to pay.'

Marshall is between jobs, but he said he will gladly take his first paycheck on a Wednesday instead of a Friday.

'It's good,' said Ripley Shotwell, another Regions Bank customer. 'It will help.'

Locally, Regions Bank offers the service along with Wells Fargo. A number of online banks like Chime also offer early direct deposit.
