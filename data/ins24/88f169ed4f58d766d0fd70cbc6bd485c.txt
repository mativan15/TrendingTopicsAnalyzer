Rather than fix Ahwahnee Hotel, Park Service should let Yosemite return to nature

The National Park Service plans to spend $32 million to make structural repairs and upgrades to the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.

But, why spend that kind of money to upgrade accommodations for the rich and famous when the typical park visitors can't afford the $500-a-night room? Or even to obtain a campsite when the veteran campers know how to 'game' the campground reservation system?

I know the historic hotel is a status symbol and money maker and won't be removed, as some critics suggest.
