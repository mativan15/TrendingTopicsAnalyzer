MUMBAI - Indian equities are likely to stand out in the months ahead, though they may not decouple from other markets globally, but the rupee's steep fall could limit foreign investors' gains, the top executive at Avendus Capital told Trading India on Thursday. While India's NSE share index has risen only about 1% so far this year, that is much better than the 9% slide in the emerging market index and a near 30% tumble in the MSCI Asia, ex-Japan, index.

 "Yes, it's been quite remarkable," said Andrew Holland, CEO of hedge fund Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies.
