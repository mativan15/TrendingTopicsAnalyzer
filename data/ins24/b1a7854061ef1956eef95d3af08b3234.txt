bit245/iStock via Getty Images Investment thesis Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) is a historical company that has been in business for more than a century. Its profitability is not exciting as its operating costs grow considerably as revenues increase; therefore, net income is flat year after year. Net debt has increased from 10 years ago and free cash flow is beginning to be fully covered by the growing dividend. The main market in which this company operates shows very low growth, with the only exception being gluten-free products.
