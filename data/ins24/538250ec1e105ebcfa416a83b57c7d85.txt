The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has removed Pakistan from a list of countries under 'increased monitoring' for terror financing. The global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog said, "Pakistan is no longer subject to FATF's increased monitoring process; to continue to work with APG (Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering) to further improve its AML/CFT (anti-money laundering & counter-terrorist financing) system."
