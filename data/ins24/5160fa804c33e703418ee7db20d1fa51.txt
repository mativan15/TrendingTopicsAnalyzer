(CNN) — Hong Kong is widely considered one of the most challenging cities in the world to operate a restaurant -- a roiling cauldron of changing tastes, cleaver-sharp competition and unsavory economics.

Right at the heart of its culinary world, with connections to at least half of its hottest tables, is publicist Geoffrey Wu.

Wu and his 10-year-old consultancy firm The Forks and Spoons work with some of the most decorated restaurants and bars in town, such as the two-Michelin starred TATE Dining Room and Ando, one of the most sought-after reservations in town.
