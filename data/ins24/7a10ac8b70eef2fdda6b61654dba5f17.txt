Aaron Donald and the Los Angeles Rams are currently engaged in a financial standoff. It's not contentious or problematic right now, but there's very clearly a disagreement about the defensive tackle's contract.
Donald wants a new deal that will pay him more than the $14.2 million he's set to earn in 2022, and he deserves a raise given the way he's played since signing his extension in 2018. The Rams have engaged in talks with Donald's representation, attempting to work toward a solution to ensure No.
