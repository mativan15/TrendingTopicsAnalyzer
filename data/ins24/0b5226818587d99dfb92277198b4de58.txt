Published: 17:08 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 17:08 EDT, 16 October 2022 Roy Keane has suggested Liverpool's win over Manchester City could ignite their season after a slow start that sees them 14 points off the pace. Jurgen Klopp's side recorded their finest afternoon of the season to date as they beat City 1-0 in front of a feverish Anfield that appeared to revel in the underdog mentality fostered by the manager during the week. Speaking after the game, the Sky Sports pundits were all full of praise for Liverpool with Micah Richards, Jamie Carragher and Keane all suggesting that the victory could yet prove more significant than merely three points.
