A hefty dividend cannot hide AT&T's big problem -- the failure to create any Economic Value Added (EVA) for its capital holders.Economists and financial professionals are using EVA or economic profit to measure how effectively corporations invest other people's money -- the money of stockholders and debt holders.EVA is usually measured as the difference between Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).A positive EVA over a substantial period indicates that the management of these companies creates value for their stakeholders above the capital markets, while a negative EVA suggests that management destroys value—capital holders should look for better opportunities in other companies.
