AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC -6.39%) has had a volatile few years. The pandemic forced it to close its theaters temporarily, and since that's how the company generates nearly all its revenue, the closures were devastating. 
Thankfully for shareholders, the company has reopened its theaters, showing blockbuster films on the big screen again. However, the steps that management was forced to take during the initial stages of the pandemic have burdened the company with high-cost debt that will be difficult to pay off.
