A majority of Spirit Airlines shareholders have approved a takeover by JetBlue Airways, ending a six-month battle to create the country's fifth-largest carrier.

Spirit announced the results of the vote after a special shareholder meeting on Wednesday. In April, JetBlue made a $3.8 billion all-cash offer for Spirit, derailing Spirit's plan for a cash-and-stock deal to merge with Frontier Airlines.

The airlines now must convince federal regulators that that agreement won't harm competition and drive up fares for consumers, a major hurdle in getting the takeover approved.
