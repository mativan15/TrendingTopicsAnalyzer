A difficult task has just become slightly easier for the Bank of England, following Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak's 15 billion-pound ($19 billion) relief package announced Thursday. The measures, including energy bill subsidies for every UK household plus one-off grants to pensioners and welfare recipients, mark a spectacular U-turn by the government as the cost-of living crisis worsens. But the arrival of the fiscal cavalry eases the potential impact on growth, freeing the central bank to focus on curbing a surge in consumer prices that threatens to savage the financial health of the most needy.
