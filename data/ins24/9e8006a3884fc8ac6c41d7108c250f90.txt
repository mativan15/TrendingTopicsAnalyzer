Video footage has been circulating online of a Russian military tank being engulfed by thick smoke and flames after running over a Ukrainian laid mine. In the past few weeks, Ukraine has been upping its war efforts in order to hold off from Russian advancement in key parts of the country. NATO-aligned countries have been supplying Ukrainian forces with anti-tank weapons and ammunition in order to fight the Russian onslaught. The video footage shows the complete destruction of the Russian tank, with no survivors escaping unscathed.
