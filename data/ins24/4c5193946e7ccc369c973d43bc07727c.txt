(Jessica Singer/CBC)Volunteers at the Hindu Temple in St. John's spent their Saturday preparing meals and serving them to hundreds of Newfoundlanders.Many volunteers began their day in the kitchen at 5 a.m. But knowing all of the proceeds from their meals would go toward helping the people of Port aux Basques made the busy day more than worthwhile."It makes me emotional," said Aruna Ralhan, the temple's chairperson, with tears in her eyes.
