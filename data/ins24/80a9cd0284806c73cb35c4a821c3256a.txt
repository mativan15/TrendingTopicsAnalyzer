ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Tech is basing its hopes for a winning season on a large cast of returning players, even if there are no likely all-star candidates in the group.

There's no established big name among the eight returning players, so coach Josh Pastner says 'The star of our team is our team.'

Seniors Rodney Howard and Kyle Sturdivant are the top returning scorers.

Sturdivant, a point guard, started all 32 games last season and averaged 7.6 points per game. Howard, a 6-foot-11 center, averaged 6.
