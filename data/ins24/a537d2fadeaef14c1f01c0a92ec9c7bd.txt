PHILADELPHIA -- It's hard to blame Phillies fans if they shuddered a bit when Ranger Suárez got the hook after throwing just 68 pitches in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series on Friday night at Citizens Bank Park.
That's the same number of pitches Aaron Nola had thrown through 5 1/3 innings on Opening Day in 2018 in Atlanta before Gabe Kapler -- making his managerial debut -- infamously went to the bullpen with the Phillies leading by five in the sixth inning. The Braves scored eight unanswered runs to win the game.
