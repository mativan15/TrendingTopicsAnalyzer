This national champion mentality and motto "The oil belongs to all Brazilians" has led to plenty of volatility, financial risk, and an undervalued equity. However, a miracle occurred in the last three years, Petrobras sold assets, cut capex, improved production, reduced debt and paid out massive dividends.
