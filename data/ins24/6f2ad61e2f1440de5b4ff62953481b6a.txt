The killing of a 12-year-old girl whose body was found inside a plastic trunk has left France 'profoundly shaken' and led to accusations that far-right lawmakers have politicized her death to attack the government's immigration policies.  The girl, identified by authorities only as Lola, was last seen alive on surveillance camera footage in her apartment building in northeast Paris at 3:15 p.m. local time (9:15 a.m. ET) on Friday, the Paris state prosecutor said in a statement Monday.The numbers 0 and 1 were written in red ink on the bottom of each of the victim's feet — a macabre detail in a case that has left France 'profoundly shaken, faced with the horror and the pain,' government spokesman Olivier Véran told reporters Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.
