It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in ADS-TEC Energy PLC (NASDAQ:ADSE) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 41%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 25%. Because ADS-TEC Energy hasn't been listed for many years, the market is still learning about how the business performs. Even worse, it's down 30% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.
