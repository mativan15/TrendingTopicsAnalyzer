The team of the upcoming Diwali release Thank God, including actors Ajay Devgn, Rakul Preet Singh, Sidharth Malhotra, and director Indra Kumar, visited the set of The Kapil Sharma Show to promote their film. On the show, comedian Kapil Sharma was in his element as he pulled Devgn's leg for delivering two kinds of films every year — one that makes him win the National Award and another which increases his bank balance. Devgn recently won a National Award for his film Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.
A promo of the show has Sharma asking Devgn if Thank God has been done by him for an award or to buy a new floor in a building.
