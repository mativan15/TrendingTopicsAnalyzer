The next Apple iPhone SE model will be based on the iPhone XR from the early notch era.
 While there has been much talk that the next iPhone SE model will be based on the iPhone XR from the early notch era, new leaks for the upcoming smartphone back the claim.According to GSM Arena, leakster Jon Prosser has backed this claim with info from an anonymous source. That info was used by Ian Zelbo to create 3D renders of the phone. The SE series moves several years behind the premium models. The phone will see the return of the notch and that too the original one, the narrower notch arrived only last year with the iPhone 13 series.
