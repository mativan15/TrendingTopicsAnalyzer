June 1 (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust regulator has ordered CHC Group to sell the helicopter services business it bought from Babcock International (BAB.L) in September as the deal reduces competition in the sector.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday it found that CHC and Babcock were two of just four suppliers of oil and gas offshore helicopter services in the UK."Offshore oil and gas are important industries for the UK, and helicopter companies play a vital role in transporting workers safely to and from oil rigs," said Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group.
