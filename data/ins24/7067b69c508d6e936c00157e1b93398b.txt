Bridie Witton is a Stuff political reporter. ANALYSIS: If there is one thing Labour and National will not agree on, it is whether the economy is good or bad at the moment. The battle lines were drawn in the House this week. National, led by finance spokesperson Nicola Willis, continued to paint a picture of dark economic disarray, with average mortgage repayments hiked up by hundreds of dollars. Finance Minister Grant Roberston was able to point to low unemployment, high wage growth, and Government support through fuel tax cuts, and half-price public transport fares.
