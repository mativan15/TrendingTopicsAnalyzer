In April, Andreessen Horowitz partners Ben Horowitz, Anthony Albanese, and Chris Dixon threw a fundraiser for Bronx congressman Ritchie Torres at the New York nightclub Zero Bond. They encouraged guests to donate between $500 and $5,800 in U.S. dollars or Ether to support Torres' congressional run for New York's 15th district. In the days leading up to the event, the partners themselves had contributed $17,000. Just a few months later, Torres Zoomed into a panel hosted by Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company Flowcarbon, throwing his political support behind the fledgling cryptocurrency startup, which has been called a 'hammer in search of a nail' and 'scam' by critics.
