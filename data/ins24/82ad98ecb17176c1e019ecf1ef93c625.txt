Despite the waning readership of printed newspapers due to the almost instant availability of news on numerous Internet sites, the power of the press remains strong and influential.

The majority of newspaper publishing media groups in Israel are holding pre-election conferences featuring leaders and prominent members of political parties. Such conferences are held in person, but are also streamed on social media platforms, to bring information to as wide an audience as possible.

The Jerusalem Post Group is no exception in this quest, and following a recent conference in New York, the Post, together with Maariv and Walla, which are both part of The Jerusalem Post Group, will hold a leadership summit on Monday, October 24 at the Conference Center of the Israel Stock Exchange.
