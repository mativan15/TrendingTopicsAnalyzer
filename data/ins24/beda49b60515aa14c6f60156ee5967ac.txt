Hello, neighbors! Karena Garrity here with your fresh copy of the Mooresville Daily, filled with all the things you need to know about what's happening locally. First, today's weather: Mostly cloudy and not as warm. High: 81 Low: 60. 📢 I'm looking for business owners and marketers in Mooresville who want to build awareness, connect with customers and increase sales. I have a limited number of sponsorships available to introduce our Mooresville Daily readers to local businesses they need to know about.
