Luna-Terra fiasco has raised several questions about the future of algorithmically designed stablecoins. The Terra-Luna crash could be the end of the algo stablecoins, according to Tether cofounder Reeve Collins.
There are three types of stablecoins: crypto-backed, where the token is collateralised by cryptocurrencies; fiat-backed, in which the token is pegged to either USD or Euro; and algorithmic coins that rely on algorithms to maintain their supply and demand, and maintain their price to a dollar.
