John Deaton, the founder of Crypto Law, a legal and regulatory news site for digital assets in the U.S., has warned Tesla CEO Elon Musk that his tweets about Dogecoin (DOGE) might get him in legal trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Musk is a crypto advocate that many investors look up to because his tweets can pump the price of a particular asset or send it plummeting. His recent tweet about Starlink accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment soon led to a surge in DOGE price, which has not seen a significant price hike over the past months.
