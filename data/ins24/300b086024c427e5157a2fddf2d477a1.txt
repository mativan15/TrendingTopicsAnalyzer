If October 17, 1972 marked a turning point in politics in Tamil Nadu after founding of the AIADMK by M G Ramachandran, the celebration in 2022 was punctuated by divisions in the party. The partymen were in no mood to celebrate the year of completion of the golden jubilee together. The day was observed separately by the factions - one led by former Chief Minister and AIADMK interim general secretary K Palaniswami; the other by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam; and yet another by expelled interim general secretary V K Sasikala.
