Key Points

Social Security beneficiaries stand to get the biggest cost-of-living adjustment in 40 years in 2023.
Experts say that calls for some strategic tax planning.

Retirees who rely on Social Security benefits for income will get some relief from record high inflation when an 8.7% cost-of-living adjustment kicks in next year.

But two factors — the size of Medicare Part B premiums and taxes on benefits — may offset just how much bigger those monthly checks will be in 2023.

The good news is that the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient and medical coverage, is set to go down by 3% next year, to $164.
