The long-awaited verdict is in, with Johnny Depp coming out on top, but neither of them unsullied in the process. The jury found that Heard defamed Depp, and awarded him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Depp's $5 million in punitive damages were cut to $350,000 under the Virginia state law cap on punitive damages. But Heard won something too, as the jury also found that Depp defamed Heard with one statement his attorney made. For that, Heard was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages.
