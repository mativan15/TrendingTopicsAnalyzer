North Carolina Democrats are making their pitch to the Republican-controlled state legislature to offer a summer tax break.

Senate Democrats want to use 20% of the $6.5 billion budget surplus to give North Carolinians age 18 and older who are licensed drivers a $200 tax rebate.

Republicans in both the Senate and House have told reporters that they would prefer longer-range tax cuts, like speeding up those passed in the 2021 budget, to spending one-time money.

Democrats are more focused on immediate relief.
