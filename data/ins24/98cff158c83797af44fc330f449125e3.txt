Ottawa's city manager told the inquiry into the federal government's use of the Emergencies Act that police were in charge of the response to the "Freedom Convoy," and the city followed the force's lead.

Steve Kanellakos said Monday the city was only expecting protesters to stay for a short period of time when they arrived in late January, based on information it was getting from Ottawa police.

But the inquiry was also shown an email on Monday from the "Canada United Truckers Convoy," which was forwarded to top city officials and Mayor Jim Watson on Jan.
