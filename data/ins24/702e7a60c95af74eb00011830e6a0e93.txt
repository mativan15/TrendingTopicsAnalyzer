Steelers linebackers coach Brian Flores will be back at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday night for the first time since the Dolphins fired him as their head coach earlier this year and his acrimonious departure from the team has made that return an angle this week.

Flores was fired after back-to-back winning seasons and subsequently sued the Steelers, three other teams and the NFL for discriminating against minority coaching candidates.
