France manager Didier Deschamps said he was not worried about disappointing results over the last few months as "Les Bleus" only have won one of their last six games.
Deschamps' squad ended up third in League A Group 1 of the Nations League after losses at home to Denmark and Croatia and a draw with Austria."We're the defending world champions. When you're at the very top, it's difficult to do any better," Deschamps told the FIFA website.
"It's perfectly normal for a team to go on slightly less successful runs, but France remains a really competitive force and are among the top teams in Europe and the world.
