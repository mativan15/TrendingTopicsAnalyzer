Published: 22:04 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 22:04 EDT, 19 October 2022 The Los Angeles Chargers are starting to build some momentum. They hope to keep that going when they play host to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Chargers (4-2) have won three games in a row, including a 19-16 overtime victory against Denver on Monday night, to move into a tie with Kansas City atop the AFC West. "We work hard during the week to come out with the W, so for us to be on a three-game winning streak, it's amazing," Chargers wide receiver Mike Williams said.
