Smartphone shipments fell 6% year-on-year in the July-September quarter, dragged by a lacklustre low-end segment hurt by inflationary pressures, with Xiaomi and Samsung retaining the top two slots, according to a report by Canalys. The market tracker cautioned that the ongoing quarter will see headwinds from a steady depreciation of the rupee, which hit a record low of Rs 83.03 against the US dollar on October 20. This will put operational pressures on companies, especially with rising costs of imported components.
