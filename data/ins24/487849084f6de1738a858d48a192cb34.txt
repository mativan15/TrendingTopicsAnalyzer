April may be the cruellest month, but autumn is the most overrated season. If you live in the US where 'fall' has become something of a religion, this may seem a shocking thing to say. I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but fall has been commercialised to an extent I don't think any other season has. People looooove talking about how much they love fall: how they adore apple-picking and leaf-peeping and pumpkin patches. The season even has its own influencers; just Google 'Christian Girl Autumn'.
