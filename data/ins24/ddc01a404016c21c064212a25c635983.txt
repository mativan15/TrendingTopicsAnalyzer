NEW DELHI: The divergent views of telecom operators and technology companies on spectrum for setting up captive private wireless networks is likely to further delay the 5G spectrum auction, BusinessLine reported citing industry sources. Allocation of spectrum to private networks users has been ruled out from the upcoming auction, but the technology companies have made representations to the government through their industry bodies arguing that the move could 'damage the process of digitisation of the economy and the prospect of making Indian products competitive in the global market', the report added.
