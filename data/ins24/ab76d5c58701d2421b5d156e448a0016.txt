Don WalkerBy Don WalkerMay 28, 2022Scientists at the University of Cambridge have figured out a way to get electricity from pond scum. The tech is about the size of a AA battery and puts out enough electricity to power a low-energy computer chip like the ones found in small devices. Don't get too excited yet, though. It's constructed out of cheap, mostly recyclable materials, and could be used to power the devices that make up the 'Internet of Things,' but not much more. It would reportedly take about 333 million of the algae batteries to run an average desktop computer.
