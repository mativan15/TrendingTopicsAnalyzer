Premier Doug Ford's government will override local municipal zoning to allow duplexes and triplexes across Ontario as part of sweeping new housing legislation, the Star has learned.

The Progressive Conservatives want to 'remove rules that prevent missing middle' housing — multi-dwelling units curbed by local zoning laws favouring single-family homes.

In legislation to be tabled when the house resumes Tuesday, the Tories will 'accelerate planning' in a number of potentially controversial ways.

They will limit the role of conservation authorities to 'commenting agencies' focused on preventing floods and other natural hazards rather than panels that residents have used to stall development.
