Domestic abuse victims will face increased harm or even death during the cost of living crisis as they cannot afford to flee dangerous partners, campaigners have warned.Surviving Economic Abuse and Money Advice Plus, two charities who issued the warning, predicted a 'tsunami' of need from domestic abuse victims accessing their services this coming winter.Domestic abuse victims routinely face economic abuse from their partner, which involves being denied access to money or a bank account, as well as having debt placed in their name.
