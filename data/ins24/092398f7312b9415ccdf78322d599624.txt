Pregnant Kaley Cuoco was feeling all the feels during Selma Blair's emotional exit from Dancing With The Stars.
The Cruel Intentions actress revealed in 2018 that she'd been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and earlier this week she made the devastating decision to leave the hit dance competition due to health concerns.
Breaking the news to professional partner Sasha Ferber, she said: ‘You know I've been monitored and in touch with my doctors this whole process.
‘I had these MRIs and when the results came back, it just all adds up to I can't.
