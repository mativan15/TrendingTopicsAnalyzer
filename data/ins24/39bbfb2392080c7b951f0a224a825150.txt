Nine dolphins at Miami Seaquarium were underfed as a form of punishment, causing unhealthy weight loss and dangerous aggressive behavior, according to a critical inspection by the federal agency that oversees animal attractions.

Friday's report marked the second time in 13 months that U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors gave a negative assessment of treatment of animals at the marine park in Virginia Key.

Lolita the killer whale, Seaquarium's star attraction for 50 years, was one of the subjects of the USDA's 2021 report, which also cited inadequate nutrition for animals as well as poor water quality and maintenance and ordered Lolita's cramped tank closed for repairs.
