Former president Donald Trump attacked American Jews in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, complaining that Jews in the United States must "get their act together" and show more appreciation for the state of Israel "before it is too late."

American Jews have long been accused of holding secret loyalty to Israel rather than the United States, and Trump's post leaned on that antisemitic trope, suggesting that by virtue of their religion, American Jews should show more appreciation to Israel.
