The Rams' offensive line cannot catch a break.

A unit that has been decimated by injuries now has another season-ender. Per Lindsey Thiry of ESPN, left tackle Joe Noteboom did in fact tear his Achilles during Sunday's victory over the Panthers and will be out for the rest of 2022.

Head coach Sean McVay said postgame that the team feared that injury was the case but more tests were needed to confirm the diagnosis.
