Chinese President Xi Jinping again defended his signature COVID-zero policy, while avoiding setting a timeline on when the strategy that's become a source of growing frustration for the public will be changed.

'We have put people first and put lives first, and upheld ‘dynamic COVID zero' without wavering,' he said Sunday in a speech at the opening of the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress in Beijing.

He said the government had 'protected people's safety and health as much as possible, and achieved great results by balancing virus measures, and economic and social development.
