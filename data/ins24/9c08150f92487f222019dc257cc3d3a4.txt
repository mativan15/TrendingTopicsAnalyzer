Harvey Weinstein's lawyer plans to argue that the imprisoned producer did not sexually assault Jennifer Siebel Newsom nearly 20 years ago but instead had 'consensual sex' with California's now-First Partner. In a motions hearing Monday in downtown Los Angeles ahead of Weinstein's criminal trial, lawyers for the defense and the L.A. County District Attorney's office were at loggerheads over the inclusion of a 2007 correspondence between Newsom and Weinstein over revelations of an affair Gavin Newsom had with an aide while mayor of San Francisco.
