Jewellers are expecting the footfalls to increase during Dhanteras, spread over two days of the weekend, with consumers getting in to markets. Dhanteras, which marks the first day of Diwali in India, is considered an auspicious occasion to buy gold and silver as part of Hindu festivities. "Since the day has just begun, the footfalls are just trickling in. As this year Dhanteras is spread over the weekend, we expect the momentum to increase towards the afternoon and evening and tomorrow. "Mainly, since morning people who had pre-booked, are coming to pick up the items to avoid the crowd," PTI quoted All India Gem And Jewellery Domestic Council chairman Ashish Pethe as saying.
