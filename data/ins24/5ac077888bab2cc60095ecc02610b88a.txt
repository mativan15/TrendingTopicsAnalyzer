The Albanese government is facing a growing employer revolt over its bill for pay deals covering multiple businesses, after consultations confirmed the reform will not be limited to low-paid workers.On Thursday the employment department revealed details of the industrial relations bill in confidential consultations with peak union and employer bodies.The bill, to be introduced in the budget sitting of parliament next week, enacts several election commitments to improve gender pay equity and multi-employer bargaining, a union proposal Labor signed up to at its September jobs and skills summit.
