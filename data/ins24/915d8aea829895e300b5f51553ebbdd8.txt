A new ed was the fourth since I'd been booted upstairs a decade ago. A churn to compete with Tory prime ministers but – unlike our whiplashing politics – The Lady magazine, founded as 'a journal for gentlewomen', was not supposed to be tumultuous. It was supposed to be sedate and serenely read by upstairs and downstairs alike, not to rattle teacups in the home counties or be picked up by the national press for its goings-on.
Well, it didn't work out like that. When I took the job, my mission impossible was to halve the average age of the reader, which was 78 (average age 78, let that sink in) and to double the circulation, at a time when the magazine was almost exclusively bought for its small ads for nannies and, increasingly, carers.
