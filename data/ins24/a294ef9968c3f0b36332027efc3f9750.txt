For the first time since losing opening weekend, the Dallas Cowboys will be heading into a matchup with a foul taste in their mouths. Losing to a rival hurts, but the show must go on and that means preparing for the Detroit Lions in Week 7. It's also the first time the Cowboys will be playing a team coming off of a bye week. After a divisional matchup on Sunday night on the road, the Lions will surely be the fresher team heading into the game.

Dallas is likely going to be getting a return from starting quarterback Dak Prescott, so there are no excuses.
