Jayden King withdrew from the match just days before the contest was scheduled to take place at Sheffield's Utilita Arena on October 15, forcing the match's cancellation. It comes after a significant altercation between the two during a news appearance earlier this week. At the conference on Thursday, Jayden was blasted with water by Zanetti's 16-year-old son. When Zanetti rose to protect his son, the two aspiring boxers fought brutally.

Later, Jayden King announced via Instagram that he would not be fighting, along with a caption wondering how Tom would avenge his son's dignity.
