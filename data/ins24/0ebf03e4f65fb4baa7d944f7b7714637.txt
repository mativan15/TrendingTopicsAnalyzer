'CNG continues to be very strong. We have a large weighting in CNG vehicles. In fact, out of those 295,000 pending bookings, about 130,000 are CNG vehicles and the demand has been increasing. Last year, we did about 235,000 sales for CNG, the previous year was 162,000,' says Shashank Srivastava, ED, 
 
The May sales were certainly positive. What is the visibility in the near term? In June, can you expect a further improvement from what you saw in May?Much of the demand is reflected in enquiries and the bookings have remained stable in the last few months.
