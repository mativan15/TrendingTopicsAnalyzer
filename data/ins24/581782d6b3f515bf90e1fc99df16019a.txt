Married at First Sight UK stars Jordan Emmett Connelly and Chanita Stephenson are still going through their own ‘little rollercoaster' as they rekindle their romance, even though it was previously revealed that he dumped her over FaceTime.
Chanita and Jordan stunned viewers during the reunion episode when they walked into the dinner party alone, and tearfully shared that they were no longer together.
The couple had been one of the strongest this series, with all of us voting in their favour, including their fellow contestants and the experts.
