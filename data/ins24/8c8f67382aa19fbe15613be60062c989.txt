The Queen's platinum jubilee is upon us, with a four-day bank holiday weekend of festivities set to begin on Thursday.

The public holiday is in celebration of the monarch's historic reign as she marks 70 years on the throne.

Events organised by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Buckingham Palace include the Trooping the Colour ceremony on Thursday and a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday.
