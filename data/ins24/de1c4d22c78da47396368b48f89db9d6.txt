The race to build 6G is on — or, at least, the race to start selling the idea to Washington.If you have a 5G phone (or even if you don't!) you could be forgiven for wondering why we need to worry about 6G already.The 5G network is still being rolled out, and is still only used by about a tenth of mobile phone users around the world (U.S. figures are comparable).
