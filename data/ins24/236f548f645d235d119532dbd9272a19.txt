Tom Emberton, a former Kentucky appeals court judge and Republican gubernatorial candidate, died in an early Thursday morning house fire after helping his wife to safety, the Associated Press reports.

Emberton, 90, got his wife safely away from the flames before reentering the burning home. He never made it back out.

"He heroically rescued his wife and got her to safety. Then he went back in to save his home and lost his life," Edmonton Mayor Doug Smith, who was longtime friends with the former judge, told affiliate WBKO.
