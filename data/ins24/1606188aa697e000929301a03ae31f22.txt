Even as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday stressed that peace and tranquillity in the border areas clearly remains the basis for normal relations with China, he pointed out that it would be fair to state that India has essentially taken a determinedly bilateral approach to China. He seemed to indicate that New Delhi is not seeking to build any formal alliance to counter China. Jaishankar's remarks were made while delivering an address on the theme "China's foreign policy and international relations in the new era" at a conference organised by the MEA's Center for Contemporary China Studies.
