Rep. Carolyn Maloney on Thursday demanded that former first son-in-law Jared Kushner hand over records of his communications with Saudi Arabia about a $2 billion investment in Kushner's investment fund Affinity Partners.
The New York Democrat, chairwoman of the House oversight committee, wrote in an eight-page letter that she wants to determine if new laws are needed to restrict the actions of former US officials, but she didn't allege possible violations of existing laws.
Maloney faces a tough primary election Aug.
