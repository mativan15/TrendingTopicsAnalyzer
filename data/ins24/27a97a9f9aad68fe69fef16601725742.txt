The Detroit Tigers were just too darn good last summer.

After years of losing and picking in the top five for four straight MLB drafts, the Tigers played winning baseball after May last season and rose closer to the middle of the league standings.

Instead of having a shot at Druw Jones and Jackson Holliday — the highly touted sons of former major league All-Stars — the Tigers will pick No. 12 in the 2022 MLB draft on July 17.

This year's class, according to Kiley McDaniel, is short on the star-level college hitters and pitchers featured in recent drafts.
