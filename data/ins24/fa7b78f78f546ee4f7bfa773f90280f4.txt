Millions more Californians will begin getting direct cash deposits from the state starting next week as officials with the Franchise Tax Board continue to dole out inflation relief payments meant to help residents offset the rising costs of goods such as food and gas.

The state estimates that 23 million Californians — more than half of the state — are eligible for such payments. To qualify, residents must have completed a 2020 California tax return and make no more than $250,000 individually or $500,000 if filing jointly.
