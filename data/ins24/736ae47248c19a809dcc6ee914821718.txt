Robbins is getting a $4 million low-interest state loan to replace hundreds of lead water lines serving homes, according to the village and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

While the south suburb will have to repay interest, it won't have to pay the loan's principal, according to the agency.

The money will pay to replace lead service lines at 450 homes, mainly in the older areas of Robbins, where homes are likely to have lead lines due to their age, said Mayor Darren Bryant and Bernard Ward, an adviser to the village on water infrastructure.
