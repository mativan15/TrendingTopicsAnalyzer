Julie Andrews has overcome her financial troubles and now enjoys time with her seven grandchildren

When her 16-year-old daughter called "petrified" that bailiffs in full body armour were banging on the door, Julie Andrews realised she needed help.

The carer was £28,000 in debt for not paying gas, electric and council tax bills and had payday loans so she could buy her three children school uniform.

"There were times I thought I wasn't going to manage and there were times I tried to take my life," said Julie, 57.
