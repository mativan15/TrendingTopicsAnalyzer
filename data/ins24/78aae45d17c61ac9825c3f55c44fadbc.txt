A South Carolina businessman bribed an engineer at a Kentucky steel plant to help him get a $14.9 million contract, a federal grand jury has charged.

The grand jury indicted Tony Berenyi Thursday on a charge of conspiracy; 14 charges of wire fraud; five charges of money laundering; and five counts of engaging in transactions involving money obtained illegally.

Berenyi allegedly paid more than $450,000 in kickbacks in 2018 and 2019 to Jaymin G. Vinson, an engineer at the Nucor Steel Gallatin LLC plant in Northern Kentucky, according to court documents.
