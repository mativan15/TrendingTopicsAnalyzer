BalkansCat/iStock Editorial via Getty Images HP (NYSE:HPQ) shares rose slightly on Wednesday after the PC and printer maker posted second-quarter results that topped estimates and raised the low-end of its full-year earnings guidance, but some worried about a potential market share loss to Dell (NYSE:DELL). Citi analyst Jim Suva, who rates HP (HPQ) shares neutral and boosted the per-share price target to $40 from $38, noted that the results were "good," but in light of Dell's (DELL) stronger results last week, there is the potential for market share shifts.
