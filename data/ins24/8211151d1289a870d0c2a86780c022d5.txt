The Atlanta Hawks made a bold move in June by acquiring All-Star guard Dejounte Murray from the San Antonio Spurs.

The Hawks paid a hefty price -- three first-round selections, a pick swap and Danilo Gallinari -- to acquire Murray, but Atlanta is banking on the 26-year-old offering an immediate return on their investment.

The first opportunity comes Wednesday night when Atlanta hosts the Houston Rockets in the season opener for both teams.

Murray had a breakout season in 2021-22 that resulted in his first All-Star nod.
