(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is confident Vietnam's growth will exceed expectations this year, and retain the title of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economy through next year, as it emerges from the pandemic.He expects gross domestic product to rise 8% in 2022 -- faster than the median 7.3% pace estimated in a Bloomberg survey -- and expand 6.5% in the following year.  In a speech to the National Assembly's fall session, Chinh described the 2023 projection as 'reasonable' given the many challenges and difficulties facing the economy amid a worsening global outlook.
