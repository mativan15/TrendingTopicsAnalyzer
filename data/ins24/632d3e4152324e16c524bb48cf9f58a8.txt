However this is the reality many are facing since the #LoyaltyTest trend went viral on TikTok.
Under this latest hashtag influencers – now turned honey trappers – are exposing cheating online, often at the request of concerned partners wishing to have their fears confirmed.
It's a craze that has amassed over 1.5 billion TikTok views so far, with comment sections filled with those looking for a front row seat to the latest online drama.
