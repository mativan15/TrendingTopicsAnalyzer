'We expect that these divestitures will address the strategy we announced in September to bring our U.S. farms to cash flow positive much faster than anticipated while reducing capital requirements for all Kalera holdings. These transactions align with our capital light business model we discussed in our analyst and investor event last month. It will allow us to stay laser focused on bringing our U.S. farms to cash flow positive faster while reducing our capital requirements,' said Jim Leighton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kalera.
