GOCMEN Summary I recommend a BUY rating on Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM). RUM is a platform that gives unrestricted access to users to share, watch, like, upload, and comment on videos. The platform also enables users to subscribe to the channels of their favorite content creators, live stream content, and video-on-demand [VOD]. RUM's platform can be used on the web, on mobile apps, on connected TV, and in videos that are embedded on websites. According to consensus estimates, RUM could be worth 2.6x more than it is now by FY25.
