The presence of all the top archers barring Deepika Kumari, who is expecting her first child with archer husband Atanu Das, made the National Games at the Sanskardham Complex in Ahmedabad a competitive event. Most of the international-level stars, however, fell prior to the semifinals in both men's and women's sections of the compound and recurve divisions.The lopsided draw spoiled the charm in the recurve men's individual competition: four Olympians, including top-ranked Jayanta Talukdar, Atanu, Tarundeep Rai and Pravin Jadhav, were clubbed in one half based on their performances in the ranking round.
