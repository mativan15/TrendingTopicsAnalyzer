New Zealand's Joelle King has fallen at the semfinal stage of the US Open in Philadelphia, losing in straight games to Egyptian Nour El Sherbini. World No 5 King had earned her place in the last four with an impressive quarterfinal win over home hope Sabrina Sobhy, but second seed El Sherbini – a six-time world champion – proved a step too far as the 26-year-old from Cairo ran out a convincing 11-8 11-8 11-5 winner inside 35 minutes. Playing her 400th match on the PSA Tour, El Sherbini was quick to pounce on any mistake from King and moved the ball into the front corners with ease to drag the Kiwi up the court.
