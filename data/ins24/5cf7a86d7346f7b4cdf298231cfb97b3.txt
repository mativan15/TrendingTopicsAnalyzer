The British pound sank against the dollar on Friday following political uncertainty after the resignation of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, while weak economic data added to the turmoil.

The dollar strengthened also on expectations that the US Federal Reserve would press ahead with its program of bumper interest rate hikes to target decades-high inflation.

European stock markets fell heavily, mirroring losses in Asia and on Wall Street, as investors fretted that rising global interest rates could tip the world economy into recession.
