LOS ANGELES — Days before Los Angeles' first open mayoral primary in nearly a decade, U.S. Rep. Karen Bass and Rick Caruso, the billionaire developer, appear headed toward a November runoff, with Bass building a small edge as the campaign moves toward a close.Bass is benefiting from strong support among women, who make up a majority of the voters likely to cast ballots, and white liberals, according to a new University of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times.
