Steven Spielberg's 'The Fabelmans' will open the 44th edition of the Cairo Film Festival, the Arab world's venerable cinematic showcase, which takes place Nov. 13 – 22. The Oscar-winning director's semi-autobiographical film, which follows the formative years of a young man who discovers movies as a means to help him see the truth about others and himself, earned a standing ovation following its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. This year's event in the Egyptian capital, which takes place as most film festivals and industry events have returned to business as usual after two years of pandemic cancellations and disruptions, nevertheless unfolds against a backdrop of global uncertainty.
