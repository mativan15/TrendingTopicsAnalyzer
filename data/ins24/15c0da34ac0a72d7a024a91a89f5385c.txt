Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood will stay in custody on Sunday evening before appearing in Manchester Magistrates' Court on Monday. On Saturday, Greenwood was charged with trial for rape, engaging in controlling and coercive behavior, and assault causing actual bodily injury. All three counts are about the same person. The Manchester United striker is also under investigation for allegedly violating his release restrictions by contacting the alleged victim. Greater Manchester Police charged the footballer after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised the case to proceed.
