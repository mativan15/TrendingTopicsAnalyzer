What's the key to a long, happy life? Hot dogs and chicken fingers. 
Elaine Terry celebrated her 104th birthday Wednesday on the Upper East Side surrounded by friends and family. 
As one of New York's oldest residents, Terry attributes her long and healthy life to hot dogs, chicken fingers and love. 
'My secret to living a long life is loving everyone. When I was younger, I went to churches, synagogues and mosques to learn about the different religions. It does not matter your race or religion, just love everyone,' she told The Post.
