SummaryLaw firmsRelated documents(Reuters) - Sonos Inc will not seek to disqualify San Francisco U.S. District Judge William Alsup or one of his law clerks in its patent dispute with Google LLC, the company said Friday, despite sounding alarms about the clerk's ties to Google and its law firm.Alsup's disclosure that one of his clerks previously worked for Google and still owns Google stock has created a "vexing situation" for Sonos, the company said in a court filing. It said it also believes the unnamed clerk worked for the law firm that represents Google, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, while the dispute was pending.
