Just Stop Oil protesters blocked traffic outside the Victoria and Albert and Natural History museums in London's South Kensington on Wednesday morning. Around 25 supporters sat on Cromwell Road, at the junction with Exhibition Road at 9.40am, holding banners. Some glued themselves together. It's the latest in a series of disruptive protests by the coalition of groups, which is demanding that the Government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents.
