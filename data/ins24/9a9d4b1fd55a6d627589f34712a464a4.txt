Games Workshop is an outlier on British high streets. Amid the carcasses of failed retailers, its 400 branches stand out for being stuffed with thousands of minuscule painted warriors; still more strikingly, they are generally packed with customers, too.At its Nottingham factories, the 47-year-old firm makes wildly popular fantasy figurines including cult tabletop game Warhammer, selling £353 million worth in 2021. It has also made its investors a lot of money: at £72.25, the shares today are worth 60 times what they listed for in 1994, and have almost tripled since 2018.
