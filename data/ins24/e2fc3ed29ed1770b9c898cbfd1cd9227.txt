DENVER (CBS4) – Colorado state leaders say they're fighting against what they call a terrible enemy and deadly poison, and will persistently work to combat the fentanyl crisis.
'It is quite literally in every community and neighborhood around the state. If you are addicted to fentanyl or drugs, you have no more wiggle room. The time to act is now. This is an urgent issue, and you need to act today,' said Colonel Matthew Packard with Colorado State Patrol.
A drug crisis is currently plaguing the United States, with 107,000 lives lost in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
