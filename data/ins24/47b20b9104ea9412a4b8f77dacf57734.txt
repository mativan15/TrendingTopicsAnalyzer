Prince William is now the Duke of Cornwall following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, his grandmother. He inherited this title from his father, King Charles III. Prince William had meetings with some chief figures in the Duchy last week. Among them was the Secretary and Keeper of the Records for the Duchy of Cornwall, Alastair Martin. The estate is worth around £1 billion, which last year brought an income of over £20 million to the then Prince Charles. According to PEOPLE magazine, a royal source said that the Prince is "fully immersing" himself in the estate and is much more likely to "take an active role" in it.
