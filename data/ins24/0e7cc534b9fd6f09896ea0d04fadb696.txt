In a twist of fate bound to infuriate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), the migrants he had flown to Martha's Vineyard are now on track for special visas that will allow them to stay in the U.S.

Forty-nine people were lured into boarding flights from Texas to the Massachusetts vacation island last month in a Republican political stunt devised by DeSantis.

Bexar County Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar announced Thursday that he has filed federal paperwork to have the migrants certified as victims (or witnesses) of a crime, The Texas Tribune reported.
