Petroleum dealers across Telangana, like their counterparts in several States across the country, went ahead with a ‘No Purchase' protest on Tuesday in support of their demand for an increase in commission.They are also seeking a mechanism that ensures against losses, on sale of petrol and diesel on hand, whenever excise duty on fuel is reduced. The immediate trigger for this demand is the ‘huge' losses dealers, across the country, were left to incur when Centre slashed excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹ 8 and ₹6 per litre respectively on May 21.
