Runners and walkers hit the streets of the Town of Mount Royal on a beautiful fall Sunday afternoon. More than 350 participants took part in the 7th annual Cedars Run for ovarian cancer to raise money to fight the disease referred to as a silent killer.
In the case of Dominique Dagenais, she isn't letting a recent surgery stop her from cheering on runners crossing the finish line. She founded the event seven years ago and is an ovarian cancer survivor.'I'm so happy to see the people here. And it shows me that I didn't do this for nothing,' said Dagenais, who organized the event.
