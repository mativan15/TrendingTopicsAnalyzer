By Ian Walker Dunelm Group PLC on Thursday reported an 8% fall in first-quarter sales against a strong comparative period, and backed its full year guidance as provided for last month. The U.K. home furnishings retailer generated total sales for the 13 weeks ended Oct. 1 of 357 million pounds ($400.5 million). This is up 36% compared with the same period in fiscal 2020, it said. "Whilst exchange rate movements have been particularly volatile in recent weeks, we are very well hedged for the remainder of FY23," Chief Executive Nick Wilkinson said.
