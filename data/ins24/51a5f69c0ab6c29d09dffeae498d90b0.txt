Jetlinerimages/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images General Electric (NYSE:GE) reported mixed results for Q1 2022. On the positive side, total orders reported a solid 13% growth, and organic revenue also grew by 1% amid supply change disruptions, travel recovery, and COVID lockdown in China. Its aviation segment is the bright spot. Both civilian and military sales are strong. Military sales should be a top-line driver going forward, against the backdrop of defense budget increases around the globe and its progress to supply its XA100 adaptive cycle engine to both the F-35A and F-35C jet fighters.
