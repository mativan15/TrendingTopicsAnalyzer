Johnny Depp has won his multimillion-dollar US lawsuit against former wife Amber Heard after a Virginia jury ruled a 2018 article published in The Washington Post was defamatory.He was awarded $15m by the court.
Amber Heard was awarded $2m in her counter-suit against Depp.Depp had sued Heard for $50m (£38.2m) over a first-person article published in The Washington Post in December 2018, in which she referred to herself as "a public figure representing domestic abuse".Heard's column did not mention Depp by name, but he argued it was an example of "defamation by implication" because parts of the column referred to allegations of abuse she made against him following their break-up in 2016.
