Square Enix has profiled two key characters from Final Fantasy 16, and shown off the game's world of Valisthea in new screenshots.Following on from its gameplay trailer reveal and release window announcement in the PlayStation State of Play yesterday (June 2), Square Enix shared even more from the game in a blog post.Unlike protagonist Clive Rosfield - firstborn son of the Archduke of Rosaria - the first new character introduced doesn't have quite as fancy a title. Hugo Kupka is a "permanent economic adviser", but thankfully for players is also host to the Eikon (the game's name for summons) Titan to keep things interesting.
