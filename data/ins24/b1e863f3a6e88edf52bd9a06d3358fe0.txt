The takeover of the Jus-Rol brand by a French-owned rival pastry maker could harm competition, resulting in higher prices and lower-quality products for customers, a UK watchdog has warned.The Competition and Markets Authority said it was particularly concerned about potential price rises for Jus-Rol items – which include dough for puff and shortcrust pastry, pizza, and pain au chocolat – given how stretched household budgets were because of the cost of living crisis.Cérélia, which is the largest producer of bake-at-home products in the UK, agreed to buy the brand from General Mills for an undisclosed sum in November.
