'I want to roam around the city, visit parks and sit there on my own and go to temples,' said 40-year-old Kajal Sharma who was denied permission to buy a 'commercial' vehicle by a car dealer in Delhi. 
According to Kajal's brother Parul, when the family recently went to purchase a vehicle that could be made wheelchair accessible (Tata Winger), the dealer informed them that it could not be bought for personal use. 'The car dealer company said the vehicle is not for private use, stating that the car is of a large size, citing a government mandate that allows its sale only for commercial purposes,' he said.
