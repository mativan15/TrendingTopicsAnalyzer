If I was part of any DAO, I would want it to be 'Friends With Benefits.' It is just so darn cool. As a vortex of creative energy and cultural innovation, the purpose of its existence seems to be to have fun. FWB is a curated decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) filled with DJs, artists and musicians with banging distribution channels for writing, non-fungible token (NFT) art and more.

FWB's vision is to equip cultural creators with 'the community and Web3 tools they need gain agency over their production' by:

Making the concepts and tools of Web3 more accessible

Building diverse spaces and experiences that creatively empower participants

Developing tools, artwork and products that showcase Web3's potential

The DAO has already made significant progress towards this mission, with some of its members finding major success in the art world.
