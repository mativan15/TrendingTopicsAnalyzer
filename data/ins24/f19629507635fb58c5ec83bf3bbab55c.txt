 A boil water advisory issued for parts of Brandon following a power outage at the city's water treatment facility earlier this week has been lifted.
The advisory was issued Wednesday after the city said there had been a loss of water pressure in the western portion of the Brandon distribution system, affecting homes and businesses south of the Assiniboine River to Richmond Avenue, west of 18th Street.
