Nat Dykeman started the Lake County Film Festival in 2004 for a simple reason — there wasn't a way for Lake County residents to see independent films without leaving the county.

'This was the DVD era, and I'd get people telling me about a great movie, but I'd never heard of it. It had never been shown in the theater here,' he said. 'There were no independent theaters in Lake County when I started.

'I decided I would try to change that. I wanted a way for people to see these films that they otherwise wouldn't get a chance to see — or they'd have to drive into Chicago to see them.
