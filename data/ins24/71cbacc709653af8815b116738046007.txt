A man who used an exotic fish business in Middletown as a front to distribute as much as 4.5 kilos of methamphetamine and 13 kilos of marijuana blamed his drug dealing on post-traumatic stress disorder he said was triggered by a 2017 robbery, according to court documents.

Because of that robbery at his Middletown home, Timothy Ray Adkins said he owed "a drug debt to his Chicago source of supply," the documents say. Adkins, 36, claimed the debt forced him to sell more drugs, according to prosecutors.
