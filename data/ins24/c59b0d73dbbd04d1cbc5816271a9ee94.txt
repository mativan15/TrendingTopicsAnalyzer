A rough first quarter for Gap could be just the start of a longer down period for the company, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Kimberly Greenberger downgraded Gap to underweight from neutral, saying that Thursday's disappointing quarterly report showed a company with internal issues and a difficult consumer environment. "The 1Q22 EPS miss materialized, & updated FY guidance proves the downside EPS risk we've highlighted YTD has been well-founded. Consistent mis-execution & a likely decelerating macro/industry headwinds leaves room for further negative revision," Greenberger wrote.
