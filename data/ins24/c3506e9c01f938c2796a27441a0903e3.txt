Hidden within the Notes app on my phone is a calendar log I keep of the first spring sightings – produce at the farmers' market, trees and flowers in Central Park (a block from my apartment) and the giant cherry blossom tree across the road, which I can see from my bedroom window. This year the pointy green buds started to pop during the very first days of April. Then they unfurled to reveal tiny light-pink confetti. I took note. By the middle of the month there was a pink cloud outside of my bedroom window, which later in the month became a carpet that engulfed the sidewalk.
