Indian news outlet The Wire has backed down from and will review its coverage of Meta that the tech conglomerate decried as outright false. The Wire initially cited internal Meta documents to claim the company gave India's governing party the ability to remove Instagram posts it did not like through its XCheck program—an accusation Meta's spokesperson denied in multiple tweets, further alleging that the the purported corroborative documents were fabricated. The Wire stuck to its guns, however, writing a series of follow-up stories that included alleged internal emails from Meta spokesman Andy Stone and another where experts authenticated the documents.
