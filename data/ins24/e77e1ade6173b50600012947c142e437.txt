Oct 20 (Reuters) - Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc on Thursday reported a 71.7% fall in third-quarter profit as recession fears and COVID-19 lockdowns in China hit the red metal's prices.

LME copper has given up 30% since touching a record peak in March, largely holding in a range between $7,200 and $8,000 since end-August, pressured by COVID-19 flare-ups in China, the world's biggest metal consumer.

The Phoenix-based mining giant said average realized price for copper was $3.
