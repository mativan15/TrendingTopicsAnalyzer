Oct. 18—State's top passer making waves in national ranks

Vista Ridge senior Brayden Dorman is playing free, and it's putting him ahead of the state's top passers — by a wide margin.

He tossed another 508 yards and eight touchdowns in a 59-7 win over Cheyenne Mountain last Friday and now leads the state in passing yards by nearly 500 over second-place Ryland Reetz of Estes Park.

Nationwide, he sits seventh with 2,992 yards through the air — averaging more yards per game than three of the passers ahead of him.
