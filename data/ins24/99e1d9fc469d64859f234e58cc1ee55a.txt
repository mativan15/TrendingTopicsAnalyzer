Joe Lacob's seen his Warriors squad reach the NBA Finals six times since he became their owner in 2010. The 2022 NBA Finals will have a different meaning for him, though. The Warriors' majority owner will see his squad go up against the Celtics, a team he held a minority stake in for four years before he bought the Warriors. Lacob, who is a native of New Bedford, became a part-owner of the Celtics in January 2006 when he became a co-investor with H. Irving Grousbeck, working with Wyc Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca during his time in Boston.
