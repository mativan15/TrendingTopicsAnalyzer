Christian Horner has been met with fierce resistance from three teams after telling the FIA they need to increase the budget cap in the wake of spiralling prices. Horner has been vocal with his view that teams on the grid will need to spend more money than the cap allows if they want to race at every Grand Prix this season.According to Auto, Motor und Sport, Alpine, Alfa Romeo and Williams are all against a budget increase and think teams approaching the limit should simply stop development. 'Just turn off the wind tunnel,' said Alfa Romeo chief Frederic Vasseur.
