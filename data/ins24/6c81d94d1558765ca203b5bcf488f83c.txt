Agitated over unfulfilled promises and reeling under crises, a joint body of surrendered militants in Tripura has declared to indefinitely blockade National Highway-8, the state's sole road connectivity with Assam and the rest of the country via Siliguri chicken neck of West Bengal, from November 5.
The Deprived Returnees Movement Committee (DRMC) is a joint body of surrendered militants in Tripura, including ultras of the banned All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), which no longer exists, and the outlawed National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), of which a few cadres and leaders are lurking in hideouts across the international border, according to security agencies.
