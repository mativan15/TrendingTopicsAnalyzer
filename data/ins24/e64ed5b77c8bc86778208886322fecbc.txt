When Zehrs cashier Brenda Bot-Drake visited Kincardine, Ont. almost two years ago and noticed the small municipality of less than 12,000 people celebrating Pride, she asked herself one question. Why can't LaSalle — which has a population of about 30,000 people — do the same? That's when Bot-Drake started the work of bringing a progressive crosswalk to LaSalle, Ont. Almost two years later, the symbol of inclusion was unveiled Saturday in front of the Zehrs store on Malden Road. It's considered to be the only known Pride crosswalk in front of a Canadian grocery store entrance.
