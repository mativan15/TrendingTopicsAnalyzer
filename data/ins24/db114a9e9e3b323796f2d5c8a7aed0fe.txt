The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai, has allowed two pleas filed by Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) Ltd. seeking to file additional documents in an insolvency case filed against it by South India Corporation Pvt. Ltd., an operational creditor. In its pleas, Tangedco said it seeks to file additional documents as per order of the Madras High Court of November 8, 2011. The court had ruled that it is certainly within the domain of NCLT to adjudicate upon any dispute raised by a debtor in any insolvency proceedings brought by a creditor.
