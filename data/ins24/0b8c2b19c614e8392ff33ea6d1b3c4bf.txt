Early contenders

We all know the Mountain West has been all over the place this year with teams that are usually bad but are now good and vice versa. With league play full in place, we will take a look at who has a path to win their divisions.

The game of the week that is basically all but an elimination game is Wyoming vs. Utah State. Both teams have one loss each and the loser obviously will have a second one be behind the eight-ball.
