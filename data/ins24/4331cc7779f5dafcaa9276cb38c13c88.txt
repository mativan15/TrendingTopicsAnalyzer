After 24 years in municipal politics, Douro-Dummer Township mayor and Peterborough County warden J. Murray Jones is retiring.
Jones tells Global News Peterborough that it was time to 'hang it up.''I began this little political career with no great thing in mind, but I would do it in 1998. I was warden for 11 years, which is a county record. It's the fact that I think everyone realizes when it's time. A little internal voice kicks in,' Jones said.'After 24 years, it's time for me to sit back and de-stress a little bit.
