Nova Scotia's opposition parties were able to delay the installation of three more deputy Speakers to the roster at Province House, despite the Houston government extending the sitting hours until midnight Tuesday.Deputy Speakers preside over debates in the chamber or act in the Speaker's stead when the Speaker of the House is unavailable or they need a break. The government is attempting to add three members of its caucus to the slate, joining the two already ratified by all MLAs who represent each of the opposition parties.
