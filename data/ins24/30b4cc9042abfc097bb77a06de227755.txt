As one Arizona Cardinals receiver returns to the fold, one landed on the injured reserve Thursday. The Cardinals placed Marquise "Hollywood" Brown on IR after he injured his foot in the team's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Brown will miss at least four games now with this designation. Brown was the top target for quarterback Kyler Murray with DeAndre Hopkins suspended for violating the league's performance-enhancing drugs policy. Hopkins missed the first six games of the season but is returning Thursday night against the New Orleans Saints for his season debut.
