Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Sunday insisted that inflation will come down but avoided addressing the notion that she was wrong to have called it 'temporary' nearly one year ago.

When asked by CNN 'State of the Union' co-anchor Jake Tapper why the Biden administration appears to have been 'flat footed' in addressing inflation earlier, Raimondo pointed to job growth and wage increases since President Biden took office.

'Why does it seem the Biden administration is consistently playing clean-up on these problems that are playing out exactly as many experts forecast they would, instead of heading them off before they become a crisis?' Tapper asked.
