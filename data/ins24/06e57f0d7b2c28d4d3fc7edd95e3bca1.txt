The exchange traded fund industry is getting an injection of new, or old, blood as some of the world's biggest money managers see opportunity in the quickly expanding ETF universe.

For instance, investment houses Neuberger Berman, Morgan Stanley, SEI, and Matthews Asia, which together represent $3 trillion in assets under management, have jumped onto the ETF bandwagon, signaling the launch or their intention to debut their first ETF offering, the Financial Times reported.

More recently, Putnam Investments also planned to add its first fully transparent ETF alongside its existing non-transparent ETF offerings, according to a separate Financial Times report.
