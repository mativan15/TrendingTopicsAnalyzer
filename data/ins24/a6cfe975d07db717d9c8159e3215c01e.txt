PARIS - The slaying of a 12-year-old girl whose body was found inside a plastic box in a Paris building courtyard has left France "profoundly shaken," the French government said Wednesday. A 24-year-old woman who was arrested Saturday in a northeastern suburb of the capital is in custody on charges of murder and rape of a minor, torture, acts of barbarity and concealment of a corpse, the Paris state prosecutor said Monday. A 43-year-old man is also in custody, charged with helping to hide the girl's body, according to a prosecutors' statement.
