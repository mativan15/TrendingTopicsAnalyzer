You've heard of Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio. But what about TikTok's wealthiest animals?
All About Cats released the earnings of the app's animal accounts Friday, and it's quite paw-sible that some of its most popular petfluencers make more money than your average bear. 
At the top of the leaderboard is ThatLittlePuff, a furry gray kitty estimated to earn over $26,400 per post. 
With 27.6 million followers and over 590 million likes, the cat — with the help of crafty edits by humans — tests recipes and life hacks posted by other users.
