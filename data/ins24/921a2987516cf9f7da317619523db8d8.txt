Amy Winehouse's stellar career and ‘troubled' personal life is set to be explored in an eight-part drama.
Winehouse died 10 years ago today on July 23, 2011 as the result of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27.
The series will be based on the book ‘Saving Amy' by Daphne Barak, and the rights have been bought by Halcyon Studio, and its chief executive David Ellender branded the project as an ‘honour.'
‘Although her career was cut far too short, Amy was the voice of a generation and we look forward to telling her story in the most poignant way possible,' he said.
