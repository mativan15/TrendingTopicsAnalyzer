To the editor: Letters editor Paul Thornton effectively articulated the dread and apprehension — not the joyous anticipation — with which so many Dodger fans greet October now that the team has reached the playoffs 10 consecutive years and left without a World Series title nine times.

I no longer enjoy April through September, and I don't sleep in October. Regardless of how the Dodgers have gotten better and better since their run began in 2013, I am reduced to hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
