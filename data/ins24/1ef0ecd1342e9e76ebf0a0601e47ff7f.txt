The developer of The Boro, a big ongoing mixed-use development in Tysons, wants the option to replace an approved residential building with office — despite considerable uncertainty about the future of office demand and considerable certainty about a continued high demand for housing.

The Boro comprises several blocks east of Route 7 in the vicinity of Westpark Drive, adjacent to the expanding Silver Line's Greensboro station. Its first phase of construction delivered 1.7 million square feet, including a flagship Whole Foods market, an office tower and multiple multifamily buildings.
