ThiruvananthapuramAt least three recent incidents of alleged official misconduct have cast the State police in a poor light. The latest was in Kilikollur police station in Kollam. A road rage incident between an officer and two youths, one a defence personnel, resulted in their 'illegal detention and torture' at the police station later. The youths, who are siblings, were treated at a local hospital for injuries after their release. Their mother told a television news channel that the 'false arrest' had imperilled her son's chance to gain government employment.
