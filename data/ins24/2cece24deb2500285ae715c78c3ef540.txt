Scott StevensBy Scott StevensJun 3, 2022 People always fall asleep on long overseas flights, but usually it's the passengers and not the pilots. Two ITA Airways pilots reportedly fell asleep while flying from New York to Rome last month with 250 passengers on board. Investigators say one of the pilots was on his sleep break and left the controls in the usually-capable hands of his co-pilot. Unfortunately, he also fell asleep while the plane was 38,000 feet over France. Air traffic controllers grew concerned after they lost contact with the cockpit for 10 minutes.
