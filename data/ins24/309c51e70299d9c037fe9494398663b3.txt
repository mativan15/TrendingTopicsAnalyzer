TAYLOR, Ariz. (PRWEB) October 20, 2022 Marion Dees, a married father, grandfather, and construction professional who discovered writing while recovering from serious heart issues, has completed his new book 'Plumber's Gap: The Lost Gold Shipment of 1882': a gripping work of historical fiction inspired by his love for the state of South Dakota. In 1875, gold was discovered in French Creek, near what is now known as Custer, South Dakota. But larger amounts of gold were found in the Deadwood and Whitewood Creeks the same year.
