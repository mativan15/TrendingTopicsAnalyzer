Orlando Magic fans throughout Central Florida and North Florida will have another option to tune into games this season.

Bally Sports and Bally Sports Florida, the network home of the Magic, have launched Bally Sports+, a direct-to-consumer streaming service that'll give in-market fans a chance to watch the Magic via Bally Sports Florida without a cable subscription.

Bally Sports Florida plans to televise 81 of the Magic's regular-seasons games during the 2022-23 season. One Orlando game is designated as a national exclusive — at Oklahoma City Thunder on Nov.
