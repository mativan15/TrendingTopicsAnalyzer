LEWIS GELFAN, whose first novel, The Embroidered City, aopeared this year, is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin who, after varied experiences in the Air Force and as a vice-consul in our foreign Service, came back to Nantucket to do his serious writing. In recent months he has been journeying about Europe mostly by bicycle, putting together material for a book concerned with Americans abroad. 'Eventually,' he says, I would like to return to the States, buy a ranch in Idaho, and get a play produced in New York.
