Harini Logan, of San Antonio, has won the 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee after a first-ever 'spell-off' was required for a champion to emerge in the extremely close competition.
Logan, 14, takes home $50,000 from Scripps, plus further money prizes and reference works from Merriam-Webster and Encyclopedia Britannica.
She beat Vikram Raju, 12, of Denver on Thursday after their neck-and-neck competition required a 'spell-off' to decide the winner. The second-place prize is $25,000.

Our 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion #Speller231 Harini Logan draws inspiration from VP @KamalaHarris.
