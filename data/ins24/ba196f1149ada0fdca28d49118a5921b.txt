By Stephen Nakrosis Moody's Investors Service said Friday it was downgrading Nigeria's local currency and foreign currency long-term issuer ratings to B3 from B2, and placing them on review for downgrade. Moody's also lowered its rating on the country's foreign currency senior unsecured debt ratings to B3 from B2, similarly placing them on review for downgrade. The rating downgrade is driven by significant deterioration in government finances and its external position, Moody's said. Nigeria, a member of the Organization of the Oil Producing Countries, or OPEC, has been unable to benefit from a strong increase in international crude-oil prices, Moody's said.
