ANNAPOLIS, Md. — The nation's first tax on digital advertising was struck down as unconstitutional by a Maryland judge on Monday. It's a law that attorneys for Big Tech have contended unfairly targets companies like Facebook META, +5.74%, Google GOOGL, +3.53% and Amazon AMZN, +6.45% in a separate federal case against the same law. Judge Alison Asti of Anne Arundel County Circuit Court said the Maryland law violates the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on state interference with interstate commerce.
