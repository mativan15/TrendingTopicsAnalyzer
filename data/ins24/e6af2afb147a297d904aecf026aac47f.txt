The Government should be taking more responsibility and using its power to 'dictate the future of accessible housing stock in Aotearoa', says a first home buyer. But the Government hasn't prioritised people with accessibility, disability or mobility needs through the current KiwiBuild ballot system. Aych McArdle​ lives with the impacts of a traumatic brain injury. Although they​ and their​ partner don't require mobility accessibility at this stage in their lives, 'it was absolutely front of mind in our dreams, so that all our friends and family could visit', they said.
