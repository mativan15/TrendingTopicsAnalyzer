Chandigarh: The security cover of 424 VVIPs will be restored on June 7, the Punjab government said on Thursday, days after Congress leader and singer Sidhu Moose Wala – who was among those whose security cover was curtailed – was shot dead. Moose Wala was shot dead on May 29 by unidentified assailants in Mansa district. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led state government, which has come under immense criticism over downgrading or withdrawing the security cover, told the Punjab and Haryana high court that it was temporarily withdrawn or pruned and is to be automatically restored on June 7.
