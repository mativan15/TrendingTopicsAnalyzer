Fed Chair Jerome Powell was frank with reporters last month: The U.S. housing market, he said, was in a 'difficult correction.' This housing correction—which started months ago—has only picked up steam in the weeks since Powell made the statement. As of Wednesday, mortgage purchase applications are down 38.4% on a year-over-year basis. Historically speaking, these so-called housing corrections usually see housing activity, like home sales, plummet long before home prices begin to correct. That historical fact explains why so many industry insiders are puzzled at the moment: Even though the housing correction started just months ago, we're already seeing sharp home price declines in many markets.
