The European Commission on Friday announced the introduction of an anonymous online platform for people to report any violations of sanctions on Russia and Belarus.'Aware of anyone violating EU sanctions on Russia or Belarus? We have created an online tool for whistleblowers to contact us and report violations of EU sanctions,' the EC tweeted.The commission also said on its website that 'sharing first-hand information' can be a powerful tool to help uncover cases of violations, including evasion and circumvention.
