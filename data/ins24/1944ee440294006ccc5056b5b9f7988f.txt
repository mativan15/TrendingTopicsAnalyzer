The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History will present 'Cellphone: Unseen Connections,' a new exhibition exploring the technological, environmental and cultural impact of cellphones. Through an impressive array of objects, personal profiles and interactive displays, 'Cellphone' will offer visitors a chance to explore the many ways that cellular phones bring us closer to one another, often in ways we never realized. The multi-faceted, first-of-its-kind exhibition will debut June 23, 2023.
