Prime Medicine Inc., the gene-editing startup co-founded by the scientist behind Editas Medicine Inc. and Beam Therapeutics, has gone public in a $175 million IPO.

Prime began trading on the Nasdaq Thursday under the ticker symbol "PRME." It priced at $17 a share, the midpoint of its range. The offering is $75 million more than Prime initially filed for, although some analysts speculated at the time that the $100 million in Prime's IPO paperwork was merely a placeholder — and that the startup was worth much more.
