[Photo/Agencies] Although US-listed Chinese companies have rallied amid positive first-quarter results, investors should prepare for uncertainties as the US market regulator is further tightening its grip on such companies, industry experts and insiders said on Monday. In a speech delivered on May 24, Y.J.
