Black Adam is the latest release in the DC Comics Universe, with Dwayne ‘The Rock' Johnson starring as the titular superhero.
The film is a spin-off from the 2019 DCU movie Shazam!, which starred Zachary Levi as Billy Batson, who can turn into the film's eponymous superhero at will.
Also starring Pierce Brosnan and Straight Outta Compton's Aldis Hodge, Black Adam has been eagerly anticipated throughout its long production cycle.
The character was first created back in 1945 and appeared regularly in Shazam! comics and TV shows throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
