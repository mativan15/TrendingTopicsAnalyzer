The trash talk continues to escalate surrounding the participants of ‘The Match' charity golf event next week in Las Vegas.
Chiefs All-Pro Patrick Mahomes will team up with Josh Allen against fellow quarterbacks Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers on the golf course with the mission to raise money for a great cause and settle some competitive scores. Mahomes was receiving some playful jokes about his golf game last Sunday from Rodgers and had the opportunity to respond publicly for the first time on Thursday during his OTA's press conference.
