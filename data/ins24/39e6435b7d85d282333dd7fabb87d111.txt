Republican Rep. Chris Jacobs announced Friday that he will not run for another term in Congress amid backlash over his support for new gun control measures.Jacobs, who represents parts of western New York, including suburban Buffalo, told reporters he has decided to retire instead of facing what he said would be "an incredibly divisive election." "I truly believe I could win this election, but it would be an incredibly divisive election for the Republican party and the people of the 23rd District… the last thing we need is an incredibly negative, half-truth filled media attack funded by millions of special interest money coming into our community around this issue of gun violence and gun control," Jacobs said at a presser Thursday.
