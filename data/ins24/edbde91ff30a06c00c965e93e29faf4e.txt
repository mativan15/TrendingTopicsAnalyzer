Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against 'continuous efforts to promote Hindi in the name of one nation', as he strongly opposed a purported suggestion of a Parliamentary panel to prioritise the language in public offices and central educational institutions.The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief also said attempts to 'impose Hindi are divisive in character' and said it would be unacceptable not only to Tamil Nadu 'but also to any state that respects and values their mother tongue'.
