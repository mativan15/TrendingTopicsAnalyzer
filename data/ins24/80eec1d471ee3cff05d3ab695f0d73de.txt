Ford Motor Co.'s third-quarter earnings report shouldn't be too dramatic since the company already warned about rising costs and inventory problems, but General Motors Co.'s report could be a different story as Wall Street analysts have boosted their estimates at a time of growing worries of weakening demand.GM GM, +4.67% is slated to report third-quarter results on Oct. 25, before the opening bell, while Ford F, +3.57% is scheduled to report the next day, after the closing bell. Ford is expected to report earnings per share of 27 cents a share, according to a FactSet survey of analysts, which is down from 51 cents a share in the same period a year ago.
