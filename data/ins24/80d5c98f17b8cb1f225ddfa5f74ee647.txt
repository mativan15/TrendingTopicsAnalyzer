OLDWICK, N.J., June 03, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best is of the view that despite property insurance reform recently enacted in Florida, property insurers will continue to face financial hardships in the near term. Given that reinsurance companies have become reluctant to take on Florida exposures, many primary carriers who depend on reinsurance still face an existential challenge.

In its Best's Commentary, "Despite New Reform Law, Florida Property Insurers to Face Continued Financial Pressures," AM Best also points out that the $2 billion reinsurance program created for insurers to help insulate themselves from risk does not apply to secondary perils, or events less severe than hurricanes, which have been problematic in Florida.
