An attorney says he is now representing 12 women who are making accusations against Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson for sexual misconduct. Tony Buzbee says the women all work in the massage industry and details will be given to the Houston police department. Buzbee told reporters this afternoon each case was vetted and they weren't about money or fame, but about female empowerment. He says ten other women have come forward with allegations which are also being reviewed and more suits may be filed.
