Canada's supreme court has declined to hear an appeal brought by a group of Indigenous residential school survivors, dealing a major blow to their decade-long fight against federal government over thousands of unreleased documents.Survivors of St Anne's Indian Residential School had hoped the country's top court would take their case, which alleges Canada's federal government withheld key evidence in determining compensation for victims of abuse at the school in northern Ontario.The court did not say why it declined to hear the case, as is standard practice.
