Netflix has announced it will be soon adding a new feature to the platform called ‘Profile Transfer'. For those unaware, the video streaming service has been testing the feature for quite some time now.
According to the streaming giant, the Profile Transfer feature allows users to transfer their ‘personalized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games, and other settings' from one account to another.
This is particularly helpful for those who want to switch to another account and don't want to start from scratch.
