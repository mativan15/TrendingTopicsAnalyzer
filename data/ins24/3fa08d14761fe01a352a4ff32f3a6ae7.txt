The hashtag #CarrieAntoinette, which compares prime minister Boris Johnson's wife Carrie Johnson to the French queen Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), has been criticized as sexist. Commentators feel it relies on gender stereotypes and distracts from unfolding political events.
Those events include the recent fines issued by the Metropolitan police to those who attended illegal Downing Street parties during the pandemic, including Johnson and his wife. Focusing on Carrie distracts from Boris's actions, which have made him the first prime minister to break the law.
