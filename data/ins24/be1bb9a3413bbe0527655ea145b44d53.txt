Britons are cutting out meals and reducing energy use as soaring food and energy bills and plummeting real wages squeeze family budgets, a new poll shows.

The poll – carried out for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) by Opinium – shows that 1 in 7 (14%) people across the UK are having to skip meals or go without food to make ends meet.

But in 47 parliamentary constituencies this number rises to 20% or above, and the proportion of people across the UK skipping meals is the same for people in work and people out of work (14%).
