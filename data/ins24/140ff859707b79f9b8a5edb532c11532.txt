The 37-year-old made his feelings clear about his current situation at United as he walked down the tunnel in the 90th minute with injury time still to play and Ten Hag still having three substitutions available.
Earlier this week, Ronaldo's sister, Elma Aveiro, took aim at Ten Hag for substituting her brother in United's goalless draw with Newcastle United last Sunday.
