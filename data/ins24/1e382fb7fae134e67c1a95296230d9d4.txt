Olivier Le Moal Enochian BioSciences (NASDAQ:ENOB) stock rose ~5% on Monday after the company said that it received a U.S. patent for its proprietary cancer treatment platform which could potentially be used to induce life-long remission. Preclinical animal and laboratory studies of the company's product candidate to treat pancreatic cancer in humanized mice model of hu-BLT (ENOB-DC-11) have shown positive results, the company added. "We are incredibly excited to have been awarded this patent for Enochian's allogeneic cell and gene therapy cancer treatment platform, especially following promising early study results," said Enochian's CEO Mark Dybul.
