An improved frame rate on Pilotwings 64 is causing problems on Nintendo Switch.The classic flight sim came to Nintendo Switch Online via the Expansion Pak earlier this month, boasting an improved frame rate compared to its original N64 release. Unfortunately, it's making certain parts of the game unplayable.'I thought I was doing something wrong or the buttons were mapped weirdly,' said IGN's Peer Schneider who has been playing Pilotwings 64. 'They have to patch it. It's just not fun this way.'Although most of the game is unaffected, problems arise during the Birdman bonus stage.
