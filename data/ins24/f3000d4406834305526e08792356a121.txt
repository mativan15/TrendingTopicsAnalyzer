Joe Raedle Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) stock slid to a new 52-week low on Wednesday after a report from Ally Financial (ALLY) aroused yet more concerns on auto sales. The auto finance leader saw loan auto loan applications fall by 200K since the second quarter and Pre-tax income of $488M in the auto finance unit reflected a $337M decline from the prior year and consumer auto originations of $12.3B were down by $1B in the same span. The latter figure missed analyst expectations of $12.85B by a wide margin.
