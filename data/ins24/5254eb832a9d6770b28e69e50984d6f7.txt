Three senior ministers on Friday threw their weight behind Boris Johnson to return as British prime minister after Liz Truss's resignation triggered a contest to quickly replace her as Conservative Party leader.

Former defense minister Penny Mordaunt became the first candidate to officially declare, but Johnson and Rishi Sunak, once his finance minister, led potential contenders as candidates canvassed support ahead of voting next week.

With the Conservatives holding a large majority in parliament and able to ignore calls for a general election for another two years, the new party leader will become prime minister - Britain's fifth in six years.
