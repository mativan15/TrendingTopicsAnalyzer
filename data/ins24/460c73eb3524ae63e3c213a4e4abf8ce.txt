Sir Keir Starmer called for a general election within hours of Prime Minister Liz Truss stepping down on Thursday. The Labour Party leader insisted they are ready to contest a vote and an election manifesto is ready to be released as he said his MPs have been put on "general election footing" over the summer. But he was left squirming when Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid asked for the specifics of his funding plans after suggesting he would need to push for tax hikes to deliver on his pledges.
