Rasi Bhadramani/iStock via Getty Images Aurora Spine (OTCQB: ASAPF) is a recession-proof business offering solutions for some of the 80% of Americans who will suffer from back pain at some point in their lives. The company has transitioned from a third-party reseller to a developer and manufacturer of its own minimally invasive spinal implant products. While most microcap companies offer just one product, Aurora offers three major product lines; DEXA, SILO, and ZIP, that are transforming Aurora from a story stock to real success.
