Fitbit Sense 2, €300Meet the Fitbit Sense 2, which bears more than a passing resemblance to its predecessor, on the surface at least.The company, now owned by Google, has clearly decided not to mess with a winning formula. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from the original is the physical button added to help people interact with the watch.The watch has a 1.58-inch touchscreen, same as the original Sense, and is more or less the same size case. You get automatic exercise tracking and an ECG app that monitors for irregular heart rhythm, plus some decent sleep monitoring.
