Newcastle United have been warned against signing the likes of Paul Pogba and Neymar this summer as 'they will go for the money and not the project'.

The club's Saudi-led takeover was completed last year. This enabled them to spend around £90m on new players in January.

The likes of Bruno Guimaraes, Chris Wood and Kieran Trippier joined as Newcastle finished eleventh in the Premier League.
