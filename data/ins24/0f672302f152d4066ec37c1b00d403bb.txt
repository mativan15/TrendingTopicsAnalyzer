George Kambosos is an underdog again but at this stage of his career, it should come as no surprise. The unified lightweight champion was a 6-1 underdog when he fought Teofimo Lopez last year, but won the title via a split decision.

He's now an underdog to Devin Haney when they meet on Saturday (Sunday in Australia) for the undisputed lightweight title at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia.

Haney is a -190 favorite at BetMGM, while Kambosos is +135 in his first title defense.

The bout will come down to how Haney handles Kambosos' pressure.
