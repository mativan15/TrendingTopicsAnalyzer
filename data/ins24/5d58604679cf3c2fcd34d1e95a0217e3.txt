By Matt Zahn October 18, 2022 / 4:48 PM / CBS Chicago CHICAGO (CBS) – Before the team's extended break this week, Chicago Bears head coach Matt Eberflus said basically everything was on the table when it came to evaluating the roster after a 2-4 start.That included getting rid of one of their wide receivers who, it could be argued, cost the Bears a shot for at least one more win.The Bears released wide receiver Ihmir Smith-Marsette, who made two costly mistakes against the Minnesota Vikings, including a fumble on the final drive when he should've gone out of bounds.
