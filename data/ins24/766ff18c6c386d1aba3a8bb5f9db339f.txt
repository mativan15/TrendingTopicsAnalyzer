Published: 10:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 10:05 EDT, 17 October 2022 The Irish Government now agrees that there is 'no quick fix' to the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said. Speaking after a meeting with Taoiseach Micheal Martin in Belfast, the DUP leader also said it is the 'Government's call' on whether fresh Stormont elections are called later this month. But Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said a winter election will be inevitable if the DUP continues to 'dig in' and refuses to rejoin the power-sharing institutions.
