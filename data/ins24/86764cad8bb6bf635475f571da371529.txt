The state of New York has taken a step closer to becoming the first in the United States to effectively institute a moratorium on Bitcoin mining. 
New York state senators passed a law late Thursday that would freeze cryptocurrency mining statewide for two years. The law takes aim at the proof-of-work authentication that undergirds much of the blockchain infrastructure behind Bitcoin, but which produces an excess amount of carbon emissions because of the massive processing power it requires.
The law also includes several other measures that are unpopular with the crypto community.
