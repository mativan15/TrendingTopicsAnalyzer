The iconic Google Doodle has celebrated Andrew Watson, considered the first Black international football player. Andrew Watson was also the first Black football player to captain Scotland's team. Besides, he became the first Black football administrator in history. October 18 is historic because it was when Andrew Watson played for the Scottish football team Queen's Park for the first time in 1884 at the new Hampden Park stadium. Director of the Scottish Football Museum, Ged O'Brien, said that the findings, which date back to the 1870s and 1880s, suggest that Andrew Watson was the first Black British footballer who played for Queens Park and Scotland.
