A 25-year-old man was beaten to death by three men in Avadi as he delayed repayment of ₹10,000 to one of them. The victim has been identified as M. Manoj, a tractor driver and resident of Gowripettai near Avadi. Manoj borrowed ₹10,000 from his friend G. Prabhu, 33, of Pudhu Nagar, who is a water lorry driver, about six months ago and failed to repay the same. Prabhu demanded the money immediately. According to the police, Manoj allegedly threatened to kill Prabhu last week. Prabhu, along with his associates, went to the parking space on Friday morning.
