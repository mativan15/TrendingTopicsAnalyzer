James Corden seems to have upset restaurateur Keith McNally. McNally, 71, took to Instagram on Monday and shared that Corden has been banned from his upscale New York City eatery, Balthazar."James Corden is a Hugely gifted comedian, but a tiny Cretin of a man," his caption alongside an image of the British comedian read. "And the most abusive customer to my Balthazar servers since the restaurant opened 25 years ago. I don't often 86 a customer, to today I 86'd Corden. It did not make me laugh." McNally claimed that Corden acted similarly at his other restaurant, Café Luxembourg, a few years ago.
