The Washington Commanders have signed former Georgia Bulldogs quarterback Jake Fromm. Fromm previously had workouts for the Miami Dolphins and New York Giants.
Washington's starting quarterback, Carson Wentz, is out for several weeks with a finger injury. Washington's second-string quarterback, Taylor Heinicke, is projected to start for the next few weeks. Rookie quarterback Sam Howell is expected to back-up Heinicke.

Washington is signing Fromm to its practice squad. Fromm will have a chance to impress coaches there and is an option as a back-up quarterback if the Commanders sustain more injuries at the position.
