The boss and co-founder of Ocado has admitted that the online grocer's growth has been slower than was envisaged when the company was launched.Ocado was founded in 2000 by three former Goldman Sachs bankers, floated in 2010 and is valued today at about £3.8 billion on the London Stock Exchange. However, online orders still account for only 12 per cent of total grocery spending in the UK and the company's market share across the industry is 1.6 per cent, compared with 27 per cent for Tesco, the market leader.
