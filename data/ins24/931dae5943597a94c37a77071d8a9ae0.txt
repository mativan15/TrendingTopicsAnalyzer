SAN MARCOS — Texas State's baseball team was set to make its Sun Belt Tournament debut Wednesday night in Montgomery, Ala., but bad weather forced all four scheduled games to be postponed.

And with more rain in the Thursday forecast, Sun Belt officials announced Wednesday night that the tournament would shift from a double-elimination format to a single elimination, with games resuming Friday.

The 11th-ranked Bobcats (44-11, 26-4 Sun Belt) won the regular-season championship and are the top seed in the conference tournament.
