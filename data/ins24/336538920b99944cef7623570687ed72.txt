The hundreds of Irish Life staff who took part in a series of races the group sponsors in Dublin over the summer have dwindled to a hardy bunch of about 50 prepared to tackle the Dublin City Marathon, which returns next weekend after a two-year pandemic hiatus.Declan Bolger, the fit-looking 47-year-old chief executive of Irish Life, isn't among them.'My wife is doing it, though,' the Wexford native says of the race that Irish Life has agreed to back for three years, after the previous patron, KBC Bank Ireland, put itself into wind-down mode.
