Bitcoin has jumped above $32,000 Tuesday to the highest level since May 10, while U.S. stocks indexes traded mostly lower, though the two assets have been often trading in tandem during the past few months. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $32,071, up 4.5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Still, bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.45% is down more than 50% from its all-time high in November, amid broad risk asset selloffs. Despite lower prices, the bitcoin market has yet to attract many new investors to 'buy the dip,' according to a Tuesday note by Glassnode.
