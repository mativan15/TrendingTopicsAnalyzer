APChinese President Xi Jinping President Xi Jinping hailed China's rise as a global power and demanded unity around his leadership on Sunday, launching a Communist Party Congress that is set to rubber stamp his bid to rule for a historic third term. In an opening address to 2,300 delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Xi promoted and defended a range of signature policies - including zero-Covid and his anti-corruption drive that has taken down rivals in the party. "Unity is strength, and victory requires unity," Xi said after walking onstage to a thunderous reception from the hand-picked attendees who will vote during the week-long Congress on the party leadership for the next five years.
