Russia's state-backed energy giant Gazprom has warned that any plans to impose a price on Russian gas exports, echoing a similar threat made by Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year. This renewed threat to freeze Europe comes as draft proposals show that the European Commission is set to introduce a last-resort "dynamic" price cap for natural gas, in a bid to cut slash energy bills. Over the past year, Russia has been squeezing gas supplies flowing to Europe, in retaliation to Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.
