IN 1806, a farmer brought butter and eggs to the general store at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and traded them for iron on practically an even basis — nine cents a pound for iron, eight cents a dozen for eggs. These prices and many others, culled from the store ledger, may be found in Storey's History of Cambria County. The contrast with present prices reveals at a glance the contribution of capitalism in raising living standards for workers.Johnstown was then a frontier village. Now it sends iron and steel products to all parts of the earth; but in 1806 the only iron it saw came by pack horse over the mountains from the Juniata Valley.
