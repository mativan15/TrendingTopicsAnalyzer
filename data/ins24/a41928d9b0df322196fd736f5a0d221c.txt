This week in Home and Away, Leah (Ada Nicodemou) is disgusted to learn that Dimitri (Salvatore Coco) has beaten up Justin (James Stewart) and left him unconscious on the floor of the garage. Justin doesn't want to involve the cops when they show up in hospital to take a statement, but Leah decides enough is enough and heads down to the station to ensure her brother takes responsibility for his actions.
Meanwhile, Mackenzie (Emily Weir) is facing mounting pressure over her financial troubles and poker nights as John (Shane Withington) begins to hassle her over not paying the rent and poker player Nathan (Ryan Panizza) begins asking her to host more events.
