Strictly Come Dancing 2022 star Helen Skelton has opened up on her decision to take part in the show so soon after the breakdown of her marriage.
On this year's series of the BBC competition, the Countryfile presenter has been delighting the judges with her routines alongside professional dance partner Gorka Márquez.
In April, Helen, 39, shared in a statement that she and rugby star Richie Myler, 32, had split four months after welcoming their third child together and nine years after exchanging their vows.
