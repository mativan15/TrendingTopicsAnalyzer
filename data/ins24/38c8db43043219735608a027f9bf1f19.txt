In a crucial meeting for tackling the climate crisis, almost 200 countries will come together in Egypt at the start of November for a 'Conference of the Parties', or COP27.
You may remember hearing about COP26 in Glasgow about this time last year. It was often hailed as our 'last best chance' to keep global warming under 1.5℃ this century.
Since then, emissions have reached record levels after the pandemic downturn. And this year alone, we've seen dozens of catastrophic disasters ranging from drought in the Horn of Africa to floods in Pakistan, South Africa and Australia, and wildfires and heatwaves in Europe, the United States, Mongolia and South America, among others.
