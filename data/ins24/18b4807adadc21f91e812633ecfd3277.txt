Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Lynch Group Holdings Limited (ASX:LGL) share price is down 39% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 5.2%. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Lynch Group Holdings because we don't have a long term history to look at. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 27% in the last three months.
