A town in western Japan has decided to discipline its mayor and others over an incident in which state cash allowances for local families worth 46.3 million yen, or about 362,000 dollars, were mistakenly transferred to a resident's bank account. The incident occurred last month in Yamaguchi Prefecture's Abu Town. The resident refused to pay back the money. He argued that he had spent all the funds gambling online, and that he had already transferred the money to payment service agencies. But the town says it used legal procedures to recover some of the money from those agencies.
