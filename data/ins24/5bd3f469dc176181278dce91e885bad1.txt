An inflation gauge closely tracked by the Federal Reserve rose 6.3% in April from a year earlier, just below a four-decade high set in March and the first slowdown since November 2020.Called the personal consumption expenditures price index, the inflation measure differs in some ways from the Consumer Price Index that help explain why it shows a lower inflation level than the CPI does.
