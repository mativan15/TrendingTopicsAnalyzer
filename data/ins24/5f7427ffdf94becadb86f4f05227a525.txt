LeBron James won't be playing in the NBA Finals this year, but he has still captured a new title: billionaire. The 37-year-old Los Angeles Lakers star has officially joined the three-comma club, according to Forbes, after earning another $121.2 million over the past year. He is the first-ever active NBA player to reach billionaire status. The only other NBA star to become a billionaire is Michael Jordan, who didn't attain the status until 2014, more than a decade after he retired as a player. James, who just finished up a two-year, $85 million deal with the Lakers, has earned $387 million in salary during his playing career, according to Spotrac.
