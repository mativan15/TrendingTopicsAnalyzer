The Seattle Seahawks had the worst offseason in the NFL, according to Bill Barnwell at ESPN.

Among the things that Barnwell lists Seattle got wrong were Will Dissly's incomprehensible new contract, using an early-round draft pick on a running back and trading the best player in the history of their franchise.

'You've probably heard about the Russell Wilson trade by now. One week after Pete Carroll publicly said that the Seahawks had 'no intention' of trading Wilson, the Seahawks sent their franchise quarterback to the Broncos for Drew Lock, Shelby Harris, Noah Fant and five draft picks, including two first-rounders.
