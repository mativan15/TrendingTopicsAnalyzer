Marlon Wayans recalled why he took a 20-year break from stand-up comedy following an incident with Chris Rock.

Rock reportedly heckled Wayans as a teenager while performing his set onstage. The event involved Rock laughing and making rude comments about Wayans' act and his lack of jokes. Wayans, who has been a part of the entertainment industry for over three decades, revealed during an Oct. 18 interview on 'Sway's Universe,' that despite the success he obtained in his career overall, it took time to perfect his skills in stand-up comedy.
