A look at the shareholders of Galileo Mining Ltd (ASX:GAL) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes "a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people." So it's nice to see some insider ownership, because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Galileo Mining is a smaller company with a market capitalization of AU$291m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
