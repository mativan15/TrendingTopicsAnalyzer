One of the few things guaranteed to get even the most hardened Londoner to crack a smile is the sight of a hot air balloon floating across the city. If you go into a nostalgic daydream when you spot one drifting through the sky, you're going to absolutely lose it when you find out what's in store for London next month.  If all goes well with the weather, up to 50 giant balloons will be launched heavenwards as part of the Lord Mayor's Hot Air Balloon Regatta on Saturday June 5 as part of the celebrations for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend.
