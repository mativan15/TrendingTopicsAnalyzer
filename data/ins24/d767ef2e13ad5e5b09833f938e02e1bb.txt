NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said making the electricity prices flexible like that of petrol and diesel would prove harmful for people and that power tariffs would never come under control.He added that if electricity rates fluctuate on the basis of prices of other commodities in the market, all the burden would come on the common people.'The main goal of the governments should be to ensure 24 hours power supply at affordable rates or for free to poor people,' Sisodia said while speaking at a meeting of energy and power ministers of all states in Udaipur.
