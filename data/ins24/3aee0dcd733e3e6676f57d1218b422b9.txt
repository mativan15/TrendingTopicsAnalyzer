Got an email from 'Gemini' saying my resume was accepted we can move on to the interview stage, is anyone familiar with this company?

When I Google it, I believe it's a crypto-related company. I don't remember applying because honestly I've just been spraying applications all over the place. The email came from someone at 'bamboohr.com'. Just wondering if im possibly being scammed or not lol
