Last week, while passing its order in the 30-year-old matter of BPL Ltd vs DCIT over gift tax in a share transaction, the Supreme Court ruled that shares within the lock-in-period are not ‘quoted shares', and thus they need to be valued as ‘unquoted shares' to determine the gift tax liability.
The matter related to the transfer of shares of a listed company held as part of the promoter's quota that was subject to a lock-in period of three years. Experts said that the order in a way clarifies the legal position on such share transfers, and will ease transactions of this type in the future without attracting legal troubles.
