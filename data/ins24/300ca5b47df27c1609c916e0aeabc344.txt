Since the start of last year, more than 46,000 consumers have reported losing a total of $1 billion in cryptocurrency to scammers, the Federal Trade Commission said in a new report Friday. The median reported loss from an individual scam was $2,600. The data are based on fraud reports made directly to the FTC, and therefore they likely underestimate the total impact of crypto scams on American consumers, given that many victims do not report their experiences to the government. 'Crypto has several features that are attractive to scammers, which may help explain why the reported losses in 2021 were nearly sixty times what they were in 2018,' wrote Emma Fletcher, a senior researcher at the FTC in a blog post.
