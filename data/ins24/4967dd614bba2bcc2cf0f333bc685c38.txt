Business groups have implored Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union to negotiate to avert further strike action, which they warned would be a 'body blow' to small companies.Royal Mail workers are due to walk out today amid a long-running dispute over pay and working conditions, part of plans for 19 days of strikes this month and next.In a letter to The Times, the Federation of Small Businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce and eBay, the online commerce group, called on 'both sides in this dispute to get back round the table and look at alternatives for resolving, or delaying, this industrial action'.
