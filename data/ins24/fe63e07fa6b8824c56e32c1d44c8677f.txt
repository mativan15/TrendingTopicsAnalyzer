Harini Logan has been declared the winner of the 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee in a historic spell-off, after several rounds left two spellers tied. It was her fourth time competing in the bee.

"Honestly, so surreal," she said of her win, calling it "a dream."

In the final rounds, both Vikram Raju, 12, and 14-year-old Logan first missed words back to back — tripped up by "Senijextee," meaning "a Salishan people of the Columbian River Valley in Washington and British Columbia" and "Powys," a Welsh geographic name, respectively.
