Piper Sandler chief global economist Nancy Lazar said on Tuesday that she would characterize the economic backdrop over the past year as "a whipsaw" given the trajectory of the economy.  "We went up very, very fast and now we're coming down, relatively quickly, not too quickly, but we are indeed slowing sharply," the economist told "Mornings with Maria" on Tuesday.She explained one reason for the moves is "this fiscal cliff" that is now taking place.Lazar noted that "increasingly consumers are depleting their savings," pointing to the personal savings rate, as a percentage of disposable income, which fell to 4.
