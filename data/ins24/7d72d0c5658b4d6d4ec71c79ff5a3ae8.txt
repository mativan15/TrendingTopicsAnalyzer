Richard Lawson has been struggling with a knee injury

PIRATES star Richard Lawson will continue to battle on, despite an MRI scan revealing he has likely suffered knee ligament damage.

The 36-year-old has been struggling with the injury in recent weeks, but has still been piling in the points for Poole.

Lawson, who also competes for King's Lynn Stars in the Premiership and has been busy with other guest bookings, scored 10 points from five rides as Pirates battled to a 49-41 win over Edinburgh Monarchs on Wednesday night.
