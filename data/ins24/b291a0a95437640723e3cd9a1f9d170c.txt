A self-proclaimed psychic healer was arrested in connection to defrauding a couple out of $70,000, and police in Georgia don't think they're the only victims.

Jackson William Ramirez-Reyes faces six counts of theft by deception after representing himself as a psychic healer and made promises he 'very well knew he could not uphold,' the Gainesville Police Department said in a Oct. 21 news release on Facebook.

Ramirez-Reyes, who lives in Braselton, advertised his services on Hispanic radio stations, according to the release.
