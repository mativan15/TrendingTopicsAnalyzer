A change is coming to Wimbledon. 
The board commemorating women's champions previously listed them as 'Miss' or 'Mrs.' followed by their last names; now, female winners of the tournament will be listed with their first initial followed by their last name, as is the case with men.
For example, Novak Djokovic is listed as 'N. Djokovic' on the men's board. Previously, Serena Williams was listed as 'Miss S. Williams'. If the women tennis players were married, they were listed in accordance with their husbands' names.
