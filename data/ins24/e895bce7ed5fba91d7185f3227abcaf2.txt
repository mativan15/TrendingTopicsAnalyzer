Police are looking for a man who robbed the Jersey Mike's Subs shop Wednesday near Spring Hill Mall in Carpentersville.

A masked man armed with a handgun entered the 123 S. Western Ave. store about 5:15 p.m. and demanded money from the staff, Carpentersville police said. There were four employees and no customers in the business at the time and no one was injured.

The suspect fled in a dark blue Dodge Caravan with a rear dent and license plate number CJ48012, police said. The vehicle had been reported stolen Tuesday, police said, and was last seen after the robbery near the intersection of routes 31 and 72 in West Dundee.
