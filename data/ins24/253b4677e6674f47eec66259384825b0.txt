If you were hoping to buy an official docking station for the Steam Deck, you will need to wait a little bit longer, as Valve announced today that it has delayed the release of the accessory. In a new blog post, Valve confirmed that it has delayed the release of the docking station due to a shortage of parts as well as COVID-related closures at its manufacturing facilities.
