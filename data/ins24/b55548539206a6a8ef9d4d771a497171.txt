The pinnacle of the National Basketball Association has arrived. The NBA Finals will pit the Golden State Warriors, starring Steph Curry, against the Boston Celtics, starring Jayson Tatum. The highly anticipated matchup started Thursday, June 2, and will be watched by millions of people.
Some of those people are likely to place wagers on the game's outcome on mobile sportsbooks like DraftKings (DKNG -7.33%). That has some investors understandably asking if they should buy DraftKings stock now in anticipation of the boost in betting.
