Lebanon has agreed to amend sections of its abortion ban ordinance and not to enforce parts of the ban, a Thursday court filing shows.

The city north of Cincinnati has agreed not to enforce the sections of the ordinance that prohibit providing transportation, instructions or money for an abortion, a "stipulation" filed in federal court Thursday shows. The city also will not enforce the section that makes it illegal to provide 'abortion doula' services.

The Enquirer called and left a message for Lebanon's city attorney, but did not immediately receive a response.
