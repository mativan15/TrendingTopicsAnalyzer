You'd think the man considered the world's best bowler in T20 cricket would have the game on a loop. Josh Hazlewood, world No 1 in T20s told Guardian's Simon Burnton he prefers footy and rugby league on the tube, or golf maybe. As for his bread and butter sport, cricket, the fun is in the crunching of the toast. 'I like playing it,' he told Guardian.
In an interview ahead of the World Cup, Hazlewood said: 'I don't watch much cricket in general, to be honest. If we're coming up against Sri Lanka down the track I might watch a little bit of their games but usually there's enough footage to watch in bowling meetings.
