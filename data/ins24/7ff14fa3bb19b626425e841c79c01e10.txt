Conte takes his side to Old Trafford on Wednesday night knowing that victory would close the gap on leaders Arsenal to a single point, with Spurs enjoying their best ever start to a Premier League season. Things are yet to click, however, for new manager Erik ten Hag in the United dugout, his men currently sat in fifth, seven points behind Spurs as they seek a return to the Champions League following last season's sixth-placed finish.Next May will mark a decade since United's last Premier League title and they have gone five seasons in a row without silverware of any kind but Conte believes their recruitment in recent years is proof that the club's stature and potential has not been harmed by the drought.
