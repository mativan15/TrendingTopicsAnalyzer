Stocks are down significantly this year, but certain names have seen earnings increase and look attractive at current levels, according to Credit Suisse. The stock market is struggling this year as investors eye inflation, the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking cycle, the war in Ukraine and other headwinds. The S & P 500 is off about 14% from its high, and the Nasdaq Composite is off by 25.2%. As of Tuesday, the median S & P 500 company has seen its stock price fall 24.4% from its high, while the median price-to-earnings multiple fell 27.
