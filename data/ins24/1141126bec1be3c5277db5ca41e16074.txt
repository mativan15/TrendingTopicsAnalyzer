Germany got into nuclear energy 52 years ago and, as part of a shift to renewables, has spent the last 21 years trying to get out again.In the latest plot twist, chancellor Olaf Scholz issued a written executive order this week − in three, terse paragraphs – for Germany's three remaining nuclear power plants to remain open and generating electricity beyond a December 31st deadline to go offline.Together the plants contribute 6 per cent of Germany's electricity, more than all its offshore wind farms put together, and they will be vital to plug the energy gap left by missing Russian gas imports.
