After another underwhelming start to the year, clean energy stocks have lately been showing signs of sizzle thanks to the unveiling of the European Union's multibillion euro plan to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

According to the new RepowerEU plan, the European Commission has set a goal to have half the EU's energy coming from renewable sources by 2030--effectively more than double the current levels, with total costs to be offset by €84B in annual savings on imported fuel. RepowerEU says full implementation of its proposals would cut gas consumption 30% by 2030.
