June 01, 2022 03:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time HOBBS, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Victoria Piñon became a homeowner at the young age of just 26, thanks in part to the Homebuyer Equity Leverage Partnership (HELP), a program of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (FHLB Dallas) in which its financial institution members provide subsidies to help first-time homebuyers with down payment and closing costs.



Ms. Piñon, a Bank Secrecy Act analyst for Lea County State Bank, said she had been working in the fast-food industry before joining Lea County State Bank in customer service when she heard about, applied for and was awarded a HELP subsidy.
