Let's start with Resident Evil Village Gold Edition. The first thing we want to share about Resident Evil Village Gold Edition is the demo version that will be available today. This trial version allows you to try out 60 minutes of gameplay in the new Third Person Mode! (You can also play the demo in First Person Mode, as well.) We hope that those of you who are new to Village as well as those who have already played the game will try this fresh new experience. The game can also be switched back and forth between third-person and first-person perspectives, so we recommend that you compare each viewpoint.
