Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu has announced she and Davide Sanclimenti are taking the next step in their relationship and moving in together.
The pair won hearts during their time in the villa, with their relationship being pretty explosive at first (and Davide famously labelling Ekin-Su a ‘liar' and an ‘actress' in one argument).
But the Love Island 2022 winners are now stronger than ever, with the Turkish soap star, 28, revealing that the Italian Stallion, 27, popped the question over a romantic meal.
‘Davide just surprised me! It's official we are moving in' she wrote on Twitter, along with a picture of ‘Moving In?' written out in chocolate sauce next to a tiramisu.
