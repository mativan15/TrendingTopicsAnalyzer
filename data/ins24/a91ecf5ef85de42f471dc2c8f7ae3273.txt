When Knives Out was unsheathed in 2019, the movie whodunnit wasn't merely out of style. It was as good as knocked out cold with a candlestick in the billiard room, where give or take the odd notable groan – Memento, Gosford Park, another Murder on the Orient Express – it had been languishing undiscovered since the mid-1980s.
Three years later, thanks in no small part to Rian Johnson's film, the genre is well and truly back from the dead. Cinemas are screening See How They Run and Bodies, Bodies, Bodies.
