NEW YORK -

Inter Miami opens the MLS playoffs Monday night on the road against defending league champion New York City FC. The team hotel is smack in the middle of the Theater District, which is befitting for a drama-filled season that saw Miami rise from the Eastern Conference basement to sixth place.

Now that they reached the postseason, the Men in Pink are determined to extend their run on the soccer stage.

'For the team to be able to achieve its first run in playoffs is a tremendous step forward for the club,' midfielder Bryce Duke said at the hotel Sunday afternoon before the team headed to training.
