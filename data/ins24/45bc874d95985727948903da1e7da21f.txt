She promised to cut corporation tax. She wanted to get fracking started. She was insistent on establishing real investment zones, with genuinely lower taxes and relaxed planning regulations, unlike the false 'free ports' we were previously sold.
Liz Truss might well be forgotten in the long book of British political history, but she can be proud of this: her campaign and short tenure have significantly changed the way we talk about economics in this country, for the better. Whoever succeeds her, if they wish to have support among Conservatives, will now have to focus on how the UK breaks out of the low-growth, high-tax, cheap-money doom loop it has been trapped in.
