Police believe a 21-year-old man was over the legal alcohol limit and driving at a dangerous speed when he allegedly struck and killed a pedestrian in central Wellington in February. The Wainuiomata resident was granted name suppression after appearing in Wellington District Court on Monday morning in relation to the death of Irish National Declan Curley, 37, on Dixon St in the early hours of February 12. He was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to two charges, one of driving at a dangerous speed causing the death of Curley, and another of driving with a breath alcohol reading of 516 mcg.
