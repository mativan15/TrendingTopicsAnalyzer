Published: 07:11 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 07:41 EDT, 2 June 2022 Police have arrested several protesters who entered the ceremonial route on The Mall before Trooping the Colour. A group of demonstrators were dragged by police out of the path of a military band as they marched along at around 10.10am. Pro-vegan climate and animal rights campaign group Animal Rebellion said 25 of its supporters were involved in the disruption 'due to the Crown's inaction on the climate emergency and their continued support for meat, fishing, and dairy, a leading contributor to climate breakdown'.
