I was sitting across from a client at brunch and asked if she'd worked with a financial advisor before."I have," she said."What was your experience?""Well, he looked over my budget and noticed I was sending money to my brother regularly. He said if I just stopped sending money to him, I could save. It took me two years to try seeing one again."I've told this story in multiple workshops and in almost every one, someone chimes in and says this has happened to them too. Most financial planning doesn't address the multigenerational needs of people of color.
