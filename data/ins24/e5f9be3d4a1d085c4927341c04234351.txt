Jahmyr Gibbs transferred to Alabama with hopes of boosting his stats and improving his draft stock. In turn, he hopes to provide Alabama with a boost in the run game.
Gibbs is one of three offensive weapons that transferred into the program for the 2022 cycle. Out of those three players, Gibbs is considered to be the 'key newcomer' from the transfer portal, according to On3's Mike Huguenin.
Despite having a stacked running back room for the 2022 season, Huguenin feels that Gibbs will make an impact in his own way this season for Alabama:
Gibbs was solid for poor Georgia Tech offenses the past two seasons, rushing for a combined 1,206 yards and eight touchdowns and averaging 5.
