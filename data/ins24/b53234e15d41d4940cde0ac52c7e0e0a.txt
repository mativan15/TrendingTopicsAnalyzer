The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday announced the appointment of experienced Englishman Trevor Kettle as Chief Refereeing Officer (CRO) to oversee all refereeing matters of the organisation.
The implementation of the Elite Refereeing Development Plan (ERDP), developing and identifying refereeing talent from the grassroots, and professionalising those operating at the elite level will fall within Kettle's remit.
This will require close collaboration with many stakeholders across the country and Kettle will work in conjunction with the newly-elected AIFF Referees Committee, the federation said in a release.
