Dear Editor
I share Marmot's concern that the UK Government shows a ‘complete lack of concern either for the health of the planet or for a fair distribution of health and wellbeing in the population'.[1] Back at the start of this century, when there was a Government that aimed to tackle health inequalities, we recognised the need for policy-makers to develop, collectively, an Inequalities Imagination. In 2022 however, the language of inequalities has shrunk to just ‘disparities' and the promised White Paper to reduce disparities has been shelved.
