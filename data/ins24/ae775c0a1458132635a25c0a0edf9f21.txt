Two of the jurors who acquitted a former Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer dismissed the case brought by special counsel John Durham as no big deal after delivering Tuesday's not-guilty verdict in the nation's Democrat-heavy capital.
'There are bigger things that affect the nation than a possible lie to the FBI,' the jury forewoman said, according to The Washington Times.
The leader of the anonymous jury, who declined to give her name, also said that the government 'could have spent our time more wisely,' according to The Washington Post.
