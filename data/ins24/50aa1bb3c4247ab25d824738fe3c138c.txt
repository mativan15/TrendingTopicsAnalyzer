WAYZATA, Minn. — Here in light-blue Minnesota, where I'm traveling this week, there's a race that offers a pure test of which issue is likely to be more politically decisive: abortion rights or crime.

Keith Ellison, the incumbent attorney general and a Democrat, insists that his bid for re-election will hinge on abortion, which remains legal in Minnesota.

But his Republican challenger, Jim Schultz, says the contest is about public safety and what he argues are 'extreme' policies that Ellison endorsed after the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis — the aftermath of which Minnesota is still wrestling with.
