GREENSBORO, Ga, (AP) — The University of Georgia will not sell beer and alcohol to most football fans at Sanford Stadium again in 2022. The Athens Banner-Herald reports that UGA Athletic Director Josh Brooks made the comments Thursday after Georgia's athletic board meeting at Lake Oconee. The school began selling beer and alcoholic seltzer this past season for men's and women's basketball games in Stegeman Coliseum and at baseball games at Foley Field and softball games. Brooks, though, says UGA wants to move slowly on alcohol sales.
