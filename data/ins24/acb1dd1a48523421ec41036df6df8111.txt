President Joe Biden will announce the release of 15 million more barrels from the US strategic petroleum reserves to continue stabilising oil prices ahead of the colder winter months.

A senior administration official said Mr Biden will announce that release of reserves — completing the 180 million barrel release announced earlier this year — and other actions were meant to 'promote market stability and down prices and encourage near-term production'.

The official said Mr Biden is prepared to authorise 'significant' future releases from the strategic reserve if needed 'due to Russian or other actions disrupting global markets'.
