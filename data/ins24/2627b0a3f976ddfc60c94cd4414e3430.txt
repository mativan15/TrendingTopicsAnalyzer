DuPage County Animal Services plans to spend $10.9 million to expand and update its facility to catch up with the growing demand for animal care. As part of that plan, the DuPage County Board this week approved a $4.5 million loan for the animal control agency that will be paid back through a fundraising campaign.The department says its live release rate has increased from about 50% to 89% over about the past dozen years. 'That's pretty amazing for a municipal shelter,' Dr. Barbara Hanek, veterinarian administrator with DuPage County Animal Services, said at an April board meeting.
