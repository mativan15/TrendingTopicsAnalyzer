Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced a new version of the 'American Innovation and Choice Online Act' (S. 2992) late Wednesday night, the culmination of months of behind-the-scenes machinations to try to reach the 60-vote Senate threshold. 
But the latest draft is riddled with problems, and senators are focused on pocketbook issues instead of Klobuchar's pet project. At its core, the legislation remains a massive government power grab that will give the Biden administration vast new regulatory authority to reshape the economy.
