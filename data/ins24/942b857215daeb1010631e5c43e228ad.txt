Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GILD) price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 20x might make it look like a sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.

Gilead Sciences hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average.
