The Chinese Communist party is using social media influencers from troubled regions like Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia to whitewash human rights abuses through an increasingly sophisticated propaganda campaign, a report has claimed.The report published on Thursday by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), described the videos by 'frontier influencers' as a growing part of Beijing's 'propaganda arsenal'.Under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Xi Jinping, the CCP's oppression of ethnic minorities has worsened, with major crackdowns in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia.
