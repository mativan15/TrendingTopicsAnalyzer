After Gov. Kim Reynolds' Condition of the State address in January, I told Iowans "it takes one look at Washington D.C., or just about any other state in the country, to realize the fields of opportunity Iowa has to offer."

Now that this year's legislative session has ended, the results only further prove my prior claim.

Joe Biden and Democrats have left us, everyday Americans, in the dust. We face rising inflation, a crisis at our Southern border, record spending, and chaos abroad. Our standing as a nation has suffered.
