Former Vice President Mike Pence suggested Wednesday he might not vote for Donald Trump if his ex-boss were to run for president in 2024.

When Pence was questioned about the issue at a Georgetown University event, he gave a long pause.

"Well, there might be somebody else I'd prefer more," he said.

Trump has not formally announced a presidential bid for 2024, but he has strongly hinted he might run. Pence is also considering a run, according to several of his confidants.
