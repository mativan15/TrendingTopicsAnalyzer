This November, voters in Jefferson County will have to decide if they want to allow the sale and production of retail and medical marijuana in unincorporated areas of the county. There are three ballot measures voters will have to make decisions on, two of which have to do with marijuana sales and revenue in unincorporated Jefferson County, which County Commissioner Tracy Kraft-Tharp, broke down in a post on Wednesday:  CBS 1B: Unincorporated Jefferson County is not open to manufacturing, retail, or medical marijuana sales.
