Oct. 17—HENDERSON — A couple of hours into the car show Saturday morning, Ken Stegall of the Corbitt Preservation Association said of the sunny, 70-degree weather, "If it don't happen today, it ain't gonna happen."

"This is all driven by the weather," Stegall's Corbitt comrade Tom Burleson chimed in, "and this is going to be a spectacular day."

The Corbitt guys were right. By late morning, Garnett Street was packed sidewalk to sidewalk for the 20th annual Show, Shine, Shag and Dine Car Show, which kicked off on Friday before concluding the following day.
