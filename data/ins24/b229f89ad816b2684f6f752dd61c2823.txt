Energy companies attempting to tap a £40bn government scheme to protect them from volatile prices will be blocked from paying bonuses to executives and dividends to shareholders.The energy markets financing scheme (EMFS), devised by the Treasury and the Bank of England, is intended to offer a safety net to help energy firms facing short-term financing problems.The government is concerned that unpredictable conditions in the wholesale gas market, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, could leave energy suppliers exposed.
