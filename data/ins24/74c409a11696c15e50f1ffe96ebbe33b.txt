Australia's gaming industry once more showed itself too big to fail as Star Entertainment Group Ltd.'s flagship Sydney casino escaped shutdown in the face of a damning regulatory report that found it faked documents, misled authorities and ignored money-laundering risks.

The report's revelations mean Star's waterfront casino isn't fit to hold a gaming license, the New South Wales state regulator said Monday. Even so, the casino will keep operating under a 'suspended' license with a government-appointed manager while it attempts to address its shortcomings.
