Sunny Deol who turns 65 today, has had emotional and financially crippling fallouts with many major filmmakers. Among them, there are Rahul Rawail, Raj Kumar Santoshi, Suneel Darshan and Yash Chopra. Darr, the 1993 Yash Chopra blockbuster, which took Shah Rukh Khan's stardom higher by at least eight notches, created a permanent rift between Chopra and his real-life neighbour Sunny Deol. The thing is, Yash Chopra loved Shah Rukh Khan like a son from the time he first worked with him in Darr.
 There were huge showdowns and fights throughout the making of Darr.
