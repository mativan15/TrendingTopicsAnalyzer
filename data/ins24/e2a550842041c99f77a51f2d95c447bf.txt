Bryan Bulaga, who played under Matt LaFleur and Adam Stenavich in Green Bay during the 2019 season, has an idea for helping fix the Packers offensive line moving forward: move Elgton Jenkins back to left guard.
Bulaga provided his opinion on the situation during an appearance on ESPN's 'Wilde and Tausch' show.

'If it's me, I'm looking to move Elgton right back next to Dave (Bakhtiari), where he's had his most success at left guard,' Bulaga said. 'Then probably move (Jon) Runyan out to right guard, then who you put at right tackle, whether it's Yosh (Nijman) or rookie Zach Tom.
