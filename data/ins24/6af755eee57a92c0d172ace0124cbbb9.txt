'It is ... imperative that the government of Ethiopia assumes immediate control of all airports, other federal facilities and installations in the (Tigray) region,' the statement said. 'This will enable the government to expedite humanitarian aid to the people in need.'

Hostile foreign powers were violating the country's airspace before the latest round of war ignited on Aug. 24, the statement said, without giving details of the outside powers.

Ethiopia is under pressure to begin the peace talks that were set to kick off this month in South Africa.
