Due to the link between operating earnings and equity markets, fund managers such as BEN and JHG can be expected to underperform materially during periods of equity market weakness - and so the analysis set out in Table 1 below should come as no surprise, with both companies significantly lagging the S&P500. In addition to the market leverage effect, JHG's performance has been negatively impacted by a disappointing 1Q22 result, which I covered in a recent Seeking Alpha publication - 'Janus Henderson: Strategy Reset Ahead - Buy Retained'.
