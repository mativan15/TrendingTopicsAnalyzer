F1 introduced new budget cap rules from last season with teams only allowed to spend a maximum of £115million ($145m).However, costs have increased compared to previous seasons as travel and electricity bills soar. Ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix, Horner suggested at least seven teams may miss the last four traces of the season to ensure they don't breach the budgeting rules.
