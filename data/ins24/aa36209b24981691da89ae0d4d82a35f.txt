Not the low viewership budget show giving us more opulence and luxury than fucking RHOBH and RHOScottsdale -- Jesus Jerome Christ! Some episode highlights:- we all loved how light and friendly the girls were and then this episode, but would it be Bravo without conflict?- Margaux Slip Dress, LLC. gives us some Poor Little Rich Girl. On sense I get the parental control with finances, but on the other, she has money and connections that she could at least try her hand at a real job and learn and has the immense privilege that if she doesn't like it, she can at least still have support.
