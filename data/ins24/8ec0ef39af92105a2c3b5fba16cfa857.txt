When a K-pop group hits the seven-year mark, it traditionally marks a decisive and sometimes challenging moment for an act to decide whether or not its members would like to renew their contracts and move forward together. Luckily for TWICE, their upcoming seventh anniversary on Oct. 20 can be a day of pure celebration for the group and their fans as all nine members of the K-pop super group renewed their contracts with longtime label JYP Entertainment in July. 'Ahead of the expiration of their exclusive contracts this fall, all members of TWICE completed renewing their contracts,' JYP Entertainment shared with the media.
