Video games can cause life-threatening irregular heart rhythms in susceptible children, according to a new study co-authored by UBC and BC Children's Hospital researcher Dr. Shubhayan Sanatani.
The study, published recently in the journal Heart Rhythm, is believed to be the first research into this subject. Dr. Sanatani, a professor in the department of pediatrics and head of cardiology at BC Children's Hospital, says the findings uncovered an uncommon, but distinct pattern among children who lose consciousness while playing video games.
