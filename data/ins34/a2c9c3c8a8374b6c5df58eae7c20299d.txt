Reliance Retail has started instant grocery delivery service through a new platform and app under the JioMart Express brand, with trials currently ongoing in Navi Mumbai. The company plans to expand it into over 200 cities and towns where JioMart is currently operational by this calendar year end, two industry executives said. With this, Reliance will compete against Tata-owned Big Basket, Zomato-funded Blinkit, Swiggy's Instamart, Walmart-owned Flipkart Quick and Zepto. Unlike few platforms like Blinkit and Zepto who are targeting ten-minute delivery of the order, JioMart Express is promising 90-minutes delivery and no minimum order value though free deliveries are only for orders above ₹199.
