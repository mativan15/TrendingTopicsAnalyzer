Lockie Ferguson's return to the bowling crease did not go as predicted. The Black Caps fast bowler was hammered to all parts of Allan Border Field in Brisbane on Monday by South African opener Rilee Rossouw as New Zealand were thumped by nine wickets in their warm-up game ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup. After a mixed showing in the tri-series against Bangladesh and Pakistan in Christchurch, last year's tournament runners-up failed with bat and ball against an opponent coming off a string of defeats in white-ball games in India and with a major concern over their captain.
