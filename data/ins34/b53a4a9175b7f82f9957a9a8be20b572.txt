A move to allow boxers to fight professionally is a big shift for Cuba's communist government.HAVANA — Fernando Galván charged forward and threw a looping right uppercut. Arlen López, the Cuban boxer who won the light-heavyweight gold medal at the Olympics last summer, took a half-step back and countered with a quick, clinical left hook.The punch landed on the corner of Galvan's chin, whiplashing the journeyman boxer's head, knocking him unconscious and dropping him face first to the canvas of a small boxing ring in the center of an auditorium in Aguascalientes, Mexico, this month.
