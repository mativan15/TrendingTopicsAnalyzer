Jun. 2—SOAP LAKE — The Soap Lake City Council filled its vacant seat at the end of its regular meeting on Wednesday night. Kat Sanderson will take the Soap Lake City Council position 6 seat.

"I'm honored that they chose me," said Sanderson.

After Soap Lake Mayor Alex Kovach resigned on May 4, the Mayor Pro-Tem, Michelle Agliano, was voted in as the new Mayor of Soap Lake by the council on May 20 after a misstep in the May 18 meeting to appoint her. The appointment of Agliano created the vacant City Council Position 6 seat.
