Mondays are washdays. In the kitchen, steam rises from the sink and my mother squeezes sopping wet clothes through the mangle. On the radio a man sings Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' from the musical Oklahoma. Later in my childhood other songs made their mark: Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better), Music, Music, Music, (How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?. But the opening number in Oklahoma is the first music I can remember and put a name to: a memory preserved, possibly, via the song's association with sunshine and sunshine's importance to washdays.
