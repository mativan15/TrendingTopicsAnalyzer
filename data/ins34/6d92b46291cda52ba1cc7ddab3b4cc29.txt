Frenkie de Jong will need to halt Manchester United's run of signing expensive flops if he joins the Red Devils in a reported £72million transfer. United have a dismal recent record of big-money signings, making a blockbuster move for De Jong a massive risk. De Jong is a trusted lieutenant of incoming United boss Erik ten hag having played under the 52-year-old at Ajax. He completed a move to Barcelona in 2019 and has now been linked to a reunion with Ten Hag. Barca are not keen on losing De Jong and several reports have suggested that United could need to pay at least £72m to prise the midfielder away from Nou Camp.
