She may have been a champion of working towards a ‘revenge body', but Khloe Kardashian says there is still one thing she wants to achieve—bigger boobs.
In this week's episode of The Kardashians, Khloe was chatting to her mum Kris Jenner when she spoke about her desire to have bigger breasts.
The conversation unfolded as Kris was resting in bed after undergoing hip-replacement surgery and Khloe said that she was ‘contemplating' getting her boobs done.
While Kris joked that they should ‘do it together', Khloe went on to confess that she was wearing a ‘latex top with like a bra top' to show off her assets.
