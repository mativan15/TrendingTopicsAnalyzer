Back pain is the leading cause of disability in the UK and affects approximately one in six adults. It's aggravated by our sedentary lifestyles and bad posture, both at our desks and while we sleep. While no mattress will be a magic fix, an unsupportive one can compound the problem.
"Typically inflammatory pain is worse in the morning because as we lie, our heart rate slows down, circulation slows and any inflammation stays pooled in the area. Sleep position is key," says Dave Gibson, osteopath, sleep coach and founder of The Sleep Site.
