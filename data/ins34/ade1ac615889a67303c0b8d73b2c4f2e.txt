IgorSPb Investment Thesis Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) is one the largest US publicly-traded companies with complete exposure to LNG production. However, the company isn't vertically integrated, but has long-term contracts to supply third-party dry gas. The company brought its ninth liquefaction train (the third train of the Corpus Christi growth project) to full capacity in 1Q 2022, which helped to boost LNG production capacity from 40 mln tons a year to 45 mln tons a year. Cheniere Energy will become a key beneficiary of the urgent EU program to replace Russian gas with LNG, which we are already seeing.
