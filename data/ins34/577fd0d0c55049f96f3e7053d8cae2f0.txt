A dad recently took to Reddit's AITA forum after a disagreement with his daughter over her bedroom door. The 15-year-old expressed that she wanted a lock on her door for privacy because her younger brothers keep coming in without knocking.

'I said OK and a couple days later I bought a lock similar to what you find on bathroom doors which can be opened with a coin or flathead from the outside,' he wrote. 'I installed it but my daughter said she didn't want a lock like that, she wanted a lock where only she had a key.
