Statements and remarks 18 October 2022 17:00 Ladies and Gentlemen, Director-General of the WHO, my dear friend Dr Tedros.
It is a great pleasure for me to be with you today, even if it is virtually.
First, I would like to pay tribute to all Ukrainian health professionals. You are working in absolutely horrific war conditions. You are working bravely to save lives and, as far as possible, to try to alleviate human suffering. I would like to say to you now that to us, you are heroes. Our respect for you is immense.
