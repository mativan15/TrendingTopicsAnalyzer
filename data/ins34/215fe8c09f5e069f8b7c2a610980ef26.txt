LSU made an aggressive move this offseason to go after Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly. In landing him, the Tigers brought one of the best and most proven coaches in college football to the bayou.
But they did so with hefty expectations. He's now the second-highest paid coach in college football, and he inherits a program where the last three coaches have won national titles. Kelly is the most accomplished of the three at the point they were hired in Baton Rouge, so no pressure.
In his breakdown of first-year coaches, CBS Sports' Chip Patterson said that Kelly has the shortest leash of the group, which is understandable given the standards.
