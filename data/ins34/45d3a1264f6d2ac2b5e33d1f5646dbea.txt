Galaxy coach Greg Vanney has been around MLS from the start, long enough to know the regular season and the postseason aren't the same thing. Few players on his team know that, however, so Vanney made a point of treating Saturday's playoff opener differently.

Although the team was playing at home, the Galaxy spent Friday night at the JW Marriott at LA Live, ate dinner and breakfast together, then bused to the stadium.
