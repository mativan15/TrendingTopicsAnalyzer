President Joe Biden's student debt relief plan is well on its way after the Supreme Court denied one of several applications filed to block the plan on Thursday.The White House passed the plan in August, eliminating up to $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. The relief is only available for those with federal loans rather than private loans, however some states are saying that any student loan debt relief could harm their incomes by eliminating profits from interest.
