Video of how Noida's Shrikant Tyagi, arrested on charges of abusing a woman, was welcomed to his housing society in Sector 93B emerged on social media. Flower petals were thrown at him and he was garlanded while his supporters raised slogans of 'Shrikant Tyagi zindabad' and 'Shrikant Bhaiya Zinadabad'. "It was obvious that I would get bail. I had to come home. If a fight is going on and someone has to go to jail, it is only natural that he will get bail. He won't remain in jail forever," Shrikant Tyagi said and thanked the Tyagi community.
