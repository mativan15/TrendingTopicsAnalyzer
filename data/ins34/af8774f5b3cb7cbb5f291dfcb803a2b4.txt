The US has announced it will be sending General Atomics 'Gray Eagle' drones – similar to the infamous 'Predator' drone – to Ukraine. However, the US is only initially sending 4 drones and the Gray Eagle is comparable to Ukraine's existing (or perhaps previously existing) Bayraktar TB2 drones produced by Turkey. The Gray Eagle drones will face the same limitations Ukraine's Bayraktar drones faced, providing no means to change the course of the conflict, but almost certainly making General Atomics money alongside other US arms manufacturers, namely Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.
