Another weekend, another roundup of the best tech deals from around the web by the Dealmaster. Our latest collection of discounts includes a $15 cut for Nintendo's Switch Pro Controller, bringing it down to $55 at Amazon. While this isn't the all-time lowest price we've tracked, it is the best we've seen this calendar year. The controller itself remains a significant comfort upgrade over the Switch's standard Joy-Cons, so if you've been waiting to take the plunge, this looks to be a good time to pounce.
