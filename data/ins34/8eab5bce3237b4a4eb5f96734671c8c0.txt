The Grell TWS/1 true wireless earbuds are the first product from the fledgling brand, named for its found, Axel Grell. People who take a proper interest in the headphones market (which means people like us, of course) have probably heard the name before, especially those of us who take Sennheiser as seriously as the brand deserves. Don't fret if you haven't heard the name before, though – it's enough to know Axel Grell knows exactly what he's doing.The score of this Grell Audio TWS/1 review is proof.
