Tzido/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) saw its shares soar more than 25% on the back of its Q1 2022 results. However, asides from the fact that its shares had been hit to a pulp in the past year, and the stock is priced at close to an all-time low, I'm struggling to find much to get positively enchanted by this stock. The one hope for shareholders is if Farfetch's guidance of improving EBITDA profitability is a sign of things to come. Because outside of that, there's not a lot to build a bull thesis on this name.
