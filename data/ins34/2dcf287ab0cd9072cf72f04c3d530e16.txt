A partnership between the provincial government and a nearby First Nation is taking a new approach to delivering healthcare in Saskatoon. Saskatchewan health minister Paul Merriman and Chief Larry Ahenakew of Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a new urgent care centre in Saskatoon. 'The UCC will offer Saskatoon residents an alternative to the emergency department for illness and injuries that are not life threatening, but need urgent attention,' said Merriman.
