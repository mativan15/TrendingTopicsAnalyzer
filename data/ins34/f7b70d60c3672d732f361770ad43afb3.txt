Engineers have unveiled the smallest remote-controlled walking robot ever created - even tinier than a flea.The tiny robotic crab can "walk, bend, twist, turn and jump" according to engineers from Northwestern University in the US. It could signal the beginning of a new era of microscale robotics.
The little machine isn't powered by miniaturised hardware and electronics, but instead by a shape-memory alloy material that transforms when it is heated. Image: The robot was given the shape of a crab because it amused students.
