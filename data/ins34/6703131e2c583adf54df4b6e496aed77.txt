The South Canterbury Rugby Football Union is looking for a new chief executive, as the man who has held the position for almost seven years stands down. Craig Calder is resigning after almost seven years in the role, going into his 'retirement years' to spend more time with his wife and family, and said some frustrations in the job had made his decision clearer. The job was advertised online on Friday, ahead of the semi-final of the Heartland Championship which South Canterbury won convincingly at Pleasant Point on Saturday.
