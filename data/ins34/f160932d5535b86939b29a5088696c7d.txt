By Jaime Llinares Taboada John Wood Group PLC said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell its Built Environment consulting business to Canadian firm WSP Global Inc. for $1.9 billion. The U.K. engineering and consulting business said that the sale delivers significant value for shareholders and enhances its financial flexibility. The primary and immediate use of the money will be to reduce net debt and strengthen the balance sheet, the company said. Wood had net debt of $1.4 billion as at Dec. 31. In addition, Wood said that it will consider capital allocation options including the settlement of liabilities, organic and inorganic investments and shareholder returns which may include the restoration of the ordinary dividend.
