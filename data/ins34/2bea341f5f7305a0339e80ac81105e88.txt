Sony is back on the scene with three new lenses for it E-mount camera system, a family of consumer cameras built around the APS-C sensor format. All cover wide angles of view—making the E 10-20mm F4 PZ G, E 11mm F1.8, and E 15mm F1.4 G good fits for vloggers using the company's most recent APS camera, the video-first ZV-E10.The E PZ 10-20mm F4 G is a slim power zoom with internal zoom, a big plus for use on gimbals. It's among the widest angles available for the system, but drops the optical stabilization feature included with the still-on-sale E 10-18mm F4 OSS in favor of a power zoom.
