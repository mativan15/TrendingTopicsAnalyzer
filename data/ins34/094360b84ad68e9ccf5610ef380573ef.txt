The city has been the target of an intensive Russian bombing campaign, and is one of the few remaining areas under Ukrainian control in Luhansk. Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said that "some 90 percent of buildings are damaged" in the city, and more than "two-thirds of the city's housing stock has been completely destroyed".A Ukrainian official had warned over the weekend that defending soldiers may need to abandon the city as they are increasingly 'surrounded' by Russian forces.Russia has previously said capturing the entirety of the Luhansk region is one of its main war goals.
