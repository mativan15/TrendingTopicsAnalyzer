Sir Keir Starmer said the Prime Minister must address parliament on Monday, calling her a ‘threat' to the UK. 
The Labour leader has accused Liz Truss of being ‘in office but not in power'.
He said: ‘Friday's press conference completely failed to answer any of the questions the public has.
‘Mortgages are rising and the cost-of-living crisis is being felt ever more acutely. The Conservative government is currently the biggest threat to the security and the finances of families across the country.
‘That's why the Prime Minister must come to Parliament on Monday, to explain what she plans to do to turn the situation around.
