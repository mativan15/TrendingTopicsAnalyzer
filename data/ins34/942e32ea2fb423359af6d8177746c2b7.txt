Democratic House candidates in competitive districts are falling behind their GOP rivals in fundraising battles as the midterms approach, forcing the party into tough decisions about which seats to throw their remaining resources behind.

"If Biden won by double digits, we ought to be able to either win or hold that district," Rep. Gerry Connolly D-Va., said of Democrats' fundraising struggles according to a Friday report in Politico. "But we gotta have the resources."

Connolly's comments come as Democrats have struggled to prioritize tough races across the country, with some candidates in winnable races not getting a funding boost from Democratic PACs who are falling behind in fundraising.
