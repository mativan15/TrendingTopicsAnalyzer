Published: 23:30 EDT, 14 October 2022 | Updated: 23:30 EDT, 14 October 2022 Two teams with Stanley Cup expectations clash Saturday night when the Tampa Bay Lightning visit the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Lightning has gone to the Stanley Cup Final three years in a row, winning the first two of those times before falling to Colorado this year. The Penguins have lost in the opening round of the playoffs four straight years, but they attribute that largely to key injuries and spotty goaltending. Of higher importance to them is the fact that their core three veterans, who each have three Cup rings, are back for their 17th season together and possibly another longer postseason run.
