The voice heard around the world trembles with pride, remembering home.

'You want to know what L.A. is?' Black Eyed Peas frontman William Adams asks.

It's not Hollywood, he explains. It's not the Lakers. Nor the Rams.

The heart of L.A., he proclaims, is east of Interstate 5.

'That's the real Angelenos,' Adams says.

He grew up there, in a housing project in Boyle Heights. In that community, one day in the year meant everything: the longtime East L.A. Classic rivalry game between Roosevelt and Garfield high schools, the football game that exploded with East Los Angeles culture.
