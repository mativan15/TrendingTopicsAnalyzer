Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have been busy celebrating their one year proposal anniversary (is it a thing? It is now) with Rebel Wilson on hand to capture the sweet moment.
A year ago, the couple announced that they were set to tie the knot with Blink-182 drummer Travis setting up mountains of roses in the shape of a heart on the beach at sunset in Montecito, California.
Now, they've recreated the adorable moment a year later to celebrate the special day.
