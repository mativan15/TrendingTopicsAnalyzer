MUMBAI: Government bond yields fell in early trades on Monday, as the minutes of the latest monetary policy meeting were interpreted to be softer in guidance, cooling fears of aggressive rate hikes.However, higher US Treasury yields prevented a steeper fall in yields.The benchmark 10-year government bond yield was at 7.4239% as of 0440 GMT. The yield ended at 7.4696% on Friday and had risen 30 basis points in last five weeks."The dovish turn from the external members will force the central bank officials to also consider that line of thinking when it meets next," a trader with a state-run bank said.
