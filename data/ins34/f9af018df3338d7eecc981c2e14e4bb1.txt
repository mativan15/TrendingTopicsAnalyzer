Cole Ballard tied the Class A Nebraska record for touchdowns in a game, but he didn't actually get the chance to break it — he put the Elkhorn South High School (Douglas County, Neb.) Storm up by so many points with his seven touchdowns in the first half that he didn't even play the second.

That's right. Ballard set up camp in the end zone and essentially returned there whenever he touched the ball. In those first two quarters, he reached the end zone seven times.

He had five rushing touchdowns, one receiving touchdown and took a punt return to the house.
