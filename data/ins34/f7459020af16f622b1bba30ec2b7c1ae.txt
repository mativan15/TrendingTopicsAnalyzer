Wall Street is poised to finish the week in positive territory for the first time in nearly two months, with the three major U.S. indexes all flashing green in premarket trading. Tech stocks led the gainers, sending Nasdaq futures up 1.1 percent just ahead of the Friday's opening bell. The Dow futures gained 0.3 percent while the S&P 500 was up 0.7 percent.

U.S. markets have had a mostly lousy year as soaring inflation, the war in Ukraine, and raising interest rates have weighed on investor sentiment and corporate bottom lines.
