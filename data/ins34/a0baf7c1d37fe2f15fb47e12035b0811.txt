IndiGo currently has a fleet of 275 aircraft and all of them are narrow-body planes such as A320neos and A321neos with just economy class seats.The Ministry of Civil Aviation should consider increasing the upper limits on domestic airfares as the rising fuel prices has become a "real problem", IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta has said. Moreover, India's largest airline IndiGo is likely to introduce a business class in certain international flights as it is looking to expand to regions like Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia, he said in an interview to PTI.
