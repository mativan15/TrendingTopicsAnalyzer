The renovation and mortgage scheme that left 75-year-old retired Toronto nurse Judy Allen in 'financial ruin' — owing $1.5 million and her bungalow in shambles — is being investigated by the Toronto Police fraud squad. Detectives this week executed a search warrant at the North Toronto home of Tony Sinopoli, the contractor who is one of the two men Allen says has caused her to lose the equity in her home of 35 years. Police from the Financial Crimes Major Fraud Section are probing a case featured in a recent Star story, which described how Allen hired Sinopoli to do renovations, he directed her to two mortgage lenders, and within a space of eight months $1.
