Boris Johnson is hoping to ease the cost of childcare by allowing parents to use £2,000 a year of government funding on football clubs and gymnastics classes.Parents can claim as much as £500 every three months towards the cost of holiday clubs, schemes that run before and after school, as well as childminders and nurseries.However, the money, up to a maximum of £2,000 a year, can only be used through approved providers.The prime minister suggested in an interview with Mumsnet that he would look to cut the red tape that prevents more types of childcare providers from signing up to the scheme.
