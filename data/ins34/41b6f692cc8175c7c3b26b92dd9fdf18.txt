The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike's (BBMP) Pourakarmika Trade Union on Monday demanded the state government to regularise the services of all pourakarmikas working with the BBMP instead of regularising it for just a few thousand pourakarmikas. Doctor Babu, general secretary of BBMP Pourakarmika Trade Union, said, 'The CM should regularise not only 3,793 pourakarmikas but also the remaining 23,329 pourakarmikas, drivers, assistants, loaders. I have already submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister and given 15 days' time to take a call,'' said Babu.
