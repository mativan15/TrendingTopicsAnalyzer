Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon's supernatural thriller Bhediya is one of the most anticipated films this year. While Varun's character poster was released on Monday, today morning, Kriti shared her look from the film, leaving fans spellbound.
In the poster, Kriti sports short hair with bangs and reminds you of Tokyo from Money Heist. With a lighter shade of eye colour and freckles, the actor looks very different from how she has been projected on the screen. Kriti is also seen holding an injection that's designed like a gun.
