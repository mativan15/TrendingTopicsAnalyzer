October 20, 2022 / 6:56 PM / CBS/AP The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it is investigating whether Mississippi state agencies discriminated against the state's majority-Black capital city by refusing to fund improvements for its failing water system. The announcement came days after leaders of two congressional committees said they were starting a joint investigation into a crisis that left most homes and businesses in Jackson without running water for several days in late August and early September after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems at Jackson's main water treatment facility and lead to a citywide drop in water pressure.
