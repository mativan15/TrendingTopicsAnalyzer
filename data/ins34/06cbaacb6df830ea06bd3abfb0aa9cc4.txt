'Long waits, limited services, and restricted hours' that is how Keremeos resident Shaun Adams described the current state of the health-care system in the village.
The South Similkameen Health Centre in the Okanagan village open Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. but it is closed overnight and on Sundays.'There are no doctors available, we cannot get a doctor's appointment in this town. And so, this place is not at all meeting the needs of the community,' said Adams.'And a one-month wait just to get into a lab for a blood test already – that's getting out there on inefficiency, which is no fault of the staff working hard already.
