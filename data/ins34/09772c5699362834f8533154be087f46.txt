Medibank, which has 3.7 million customers, said on Thursday the criminal had provided a sample of 100 customer policies from a purported haul of 200 gigabytes of stolen data.

Details included customer names, addresses, birth dates, national health care identification numbers and phone numbers.

Cybersecurity Minister Clare O'Neil said most concerning was that records of medical diagnoses and procedures had also been stolen.

'Financial crime is a terrible thing. But ultimately, a credit card can be replaced,' O'Neil told reporters.
