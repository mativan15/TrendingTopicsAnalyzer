The New Brunswick government says it will spend $8 million over the next three years to better support emergency shelters and help reduce chronic homelessness. With the new funding, the province says the budget for emergency shelters now exceeds $5 million annually, which is double the current amount. The spending is said to be based on services provided at shelters, such as meals, community space, and hours of operation. Shelters must have plans in place to increase the number of beds available during extreme weather.
