The Miami Dolphins are set to play what could be their final game without Tua Tagovailoa before the quarterback returns to their lineup. Tagovailoa was cleared Saturday under the NFL's concussion protocols and is eligible to play in next Sunday night's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Miami Gardens, Fla. But first, the Dolphins face the Minnesota Vikings at home without Tagovailoa, who was already ruled out.

Rookie Skylar Thompson is scheduled to make his first NFL start Sunday as the Dolphins attempt to end a two-game losing streak that has followed their 3-0 start to the season.
