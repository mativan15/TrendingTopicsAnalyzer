Once described as a "one-woman WikiLeaks", Ms Caruana Galizia was a vocal critic of the country's political elite in her blog, accusing them of cronyism and corruption.
She focused her reporting on nepotism, patronage, allegations of government money laundering, links between Malta's online gambling industry and organised crime.
"There are crooks everywhere you look now," she wrote, hours before the attack that killed her on October 16, 2017. "The situation is desperate."
The year Ms Caruana Galizia died, she effectively triggered an early election by publishing allegations linking Joseph Muscat, the then-prime minister, to the Panama Papers scandal, which exposed the use of tax havens by the rich.
