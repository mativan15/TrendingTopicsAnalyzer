Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said that achieving sustainable patterns of consumption and production is critical to resolving the crisis of climate change. Speaking at the launch of a global initiative, 'Lifestyle for the Environment (LiFE) Movement', the minister stressed that it is crucial that the world find ways to combat climate change not just through modern technologies but with the "wisdom of our collective culture and tradition and knowledge". 
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the movement, initiating the "LiFE Global Call for Papers" for inviting ideas and suggestions from academics, universities and research institutions etc to influence and persuade individuals, communities and organisations across the world to adopt an environment-conscious lifestyle.
