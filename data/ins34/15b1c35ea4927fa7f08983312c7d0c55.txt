STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. — Facing state demands to move forward, as well as public pressure after students produced a viral video showing widespread disrepair, a suburban Atlanta school board on Tuesday voted for a $50 million overhaul at an aging high school after previously voting three times against it. The DeKalb County school board voted unanimously to renovate Druid Hills High School, news outlets reported. "I am proud to say today that we're in unison, that we want what's good for this district," The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that board chair Vickie Turner said.
