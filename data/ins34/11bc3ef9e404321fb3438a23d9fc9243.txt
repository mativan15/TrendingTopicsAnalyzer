Jason Box waited for the skies to clear. The climatologist's team was already in southern Greenland to begin their research project, but he was stuck in Nuuk, the country's capital, because weather delayed his travels. Dark clouds loomed overhead, while the pitter patter of rain echoed loudly as it fell onto the ocean.

Unbeknown to him, this same weather system was causing a historic melt event 660 miles away at the summit of Greenland. On Aug. 14, 2021, the system drew exceptionally warm and moist air from southern latitudes northward, increasing temperatures around 32 degrees (18 Celsius) higher than normal.
