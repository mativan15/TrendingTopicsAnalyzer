The authors of the Global Hunger Index (GHI), released on October 15, write that 'the level of hunger in India is serious'. The country is ranked 107 of the 121 countries they studied. With a score of 29.1 (0 means no hunger), India is behind its South Asian neighbours — Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Close to 20 per cent of children in the country below the age of five suffer from the most visible and life-threatening form of malnutrition — wasting, or 'low weight-for-height'. About 35 per cent of such children are not as tall as they should be.
