The Houston Astros beat the Seattle Mariners 1-0 in 18 innings Saturday night in a six-hour, 22-minute marathon. That means the Seahawks-Cardinals game is not changing its start time as the Astros swept the best-of-five American League Division Series.

The kickoff of the NFL game will take place at 4:05 p.m. ET (1:05 p.m. PT) on Sunday as originally scheduled.

The NFL was going to shift kickoff time to 5:30 p.
