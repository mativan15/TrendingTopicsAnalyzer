Even better-than-expected earnings haven't been enough to stem this year's rout in software stocks, and now the sector is getting hit with another headwind: the stronger dollar.

Overall, 85% of software companies in the S&P 500 reported profits that beat expectations, versus just 79% for all tech companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Yet the group has experienced some of the sharpest selling among sectors because investors are looking ahead to even tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.
