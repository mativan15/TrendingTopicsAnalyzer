The rupee inched 2 paise higher to close at 77.59 (provisional) against U.S. dollar on Friday, supported by positive domestic equities and weakness of the American currency overseas. Forex traders said the rupee consolidated in a narrow range as elevated crude oil prices, fiscal deficit concerns and persistent FII outflows weighed on the local unit. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 77.60 against the greenback and moved in a range of 77.57 to 77.67 in the day's trade. The rupee finally ended at 77.
