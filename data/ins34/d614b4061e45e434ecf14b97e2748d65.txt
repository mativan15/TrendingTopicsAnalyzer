North Carolina will soon have a new 9-figure public company, and it's in Kinston.

FlyExclusive, a private jet operator, announced Monday plans to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, named EG Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: EGGF). The deal, expected to close in early 2023, values the combined company at $600 million. FlyExclusive expects to end 2022 earning about $360 million in revenue.

FlyExclusive, founded in 2015, is one of the five largest private jet operators in the country.
