Annual energy bills could reach £4,347 for an average household after the government announced the two-year price freeze will now run for just six months.New chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the universal energy price guarantee will finish next April, with a review being launched on how to then support bills after this period.
The government said its changed approach after April will "cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned" and will target those most in need of support.It also confirmed that the energy bill relief scheme for businesses, which will cap corporate energy bills, is also set to end in April.
