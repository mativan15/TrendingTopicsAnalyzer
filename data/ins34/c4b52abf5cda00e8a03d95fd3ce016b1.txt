(AP) - Bob Huggins looks over his revamped roster at West Virginia and already likes what he sees from some newcomers. "The ball goes in," Huggins said. "The ball actually goes in. It's great. It's more fun to watch that." West Virginia finished 16-17 last season and lost 10 players, mostly to the transfer portal, including the top four scorers. The Mountaineers were last in the Big 12 and had the league's worst shooting percentage, scoring defense and rebounding margin.
