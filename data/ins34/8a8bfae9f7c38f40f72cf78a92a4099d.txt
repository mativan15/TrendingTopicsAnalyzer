Saudi Arabia are expected to lead a three-country bid alongside Egypt and Greece to host the 2030 World Cup. It's believed the governments of each nation have approved the proposal. The Saudis will reportedly pay most of the costs for staging the tournament, which would need to be held in the European winter due to each country's soaring temperatures in June and July. If approved, it would be the second World Cup to be staged in the European winter in eight years after the Qatar World Cup, which starts on November 20.
