India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, which also happens to be the undisputed leader in the small car segment, has urged the Centre to rethink its proposal to make it mandatory to use 6 airbags in all cars. The proposal, which is yet to be transformed into a rule, aims to enhance safety for passengers on Indian roads.
