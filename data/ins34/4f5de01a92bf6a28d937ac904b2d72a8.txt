Lachlan Murdoch's application to have parts of Crikey's defence about Fox News' role in the 6 January riots dismissed has failed in a pre-trial hearing in the federal court.In August the co-chair of News Corp filed proceedings for defamation against the Australian independent news site over an article by politics editor, Bernard Keane, headlined 'Trump is a confirmed unhinged traitor. And Murdoch is his unindicted co-conspirator'.Keane argued former US president Richard Nixon was infamously the 'unindicted co-conspirator' in the Watergate scandal and drew an analogy that 'the Murdochs and their slew of poisonous Fox News commentators are the unindicted co-conspirators' in the events of 6 January.
