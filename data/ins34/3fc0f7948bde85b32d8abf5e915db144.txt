Model-politician Archana Gautam is making heads turn on Bigg Boss 16 with her personality, strong stance and witty one-liners. Before entering the house, the actor had said how she will be the ‘surprise package' of the season.
'It just happened very swiftly. Mujhe khud samjh nahi aaya (Even I could not understand). The way I was given ticket for election, similarly, the Bigg Boss 16 offer also came all of a sudden. However, I know I am going to leave my mark on the show,' Archana told indianexpress.
