UK property sellers boosted prices at the strongest pace in five months in October, led by a jump in the most expensive homes in London.The real-estate website Rightmove said asking prices rose 0.9% from September, and by 1.9% in London. Properties at the top of the ladder rose most sharply, with little change for those sought by first-time buyers.
