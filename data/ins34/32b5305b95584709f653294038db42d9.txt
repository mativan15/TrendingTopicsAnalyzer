All India Deep Sea Fishers' Association, has appealed to the State Fisheries Minister to instruct fisheries officers to come to the Kochi fisheries harbour rather than the Vypeen harbour for inspection of distant-water fishing boats for renewal of registration.In an appeal to the minister, the association put up a set of demands in view of the difficulties being faced by the more than 350 distant-water fishing boats that operate out of Kochi and now need to renew their licences. There are more than 600 such boats operating off the coast of Kerala and about half of them had completed the formalities, said association president Charles George on Monday.
