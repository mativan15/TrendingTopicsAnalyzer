By Australian Associated Press Published: 12:35 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 12:35 EDT, 17 October 2022 Residents in Victoria's north are building walls from sandbags to protect thousands of homes as the Murray River rises. Evacuation warnings are in place for people in Echuca and other towns along the river, with the Murray expected to peak from Wednesday. Emergency services are concerned the river levels could exceed the 94.77 metres recorded in Echuca during the 1993 floods. People in the northern Victorian town spent most of Monday building a makeshift sandbag levy in an effort to protect thousands of homes and businesses.
