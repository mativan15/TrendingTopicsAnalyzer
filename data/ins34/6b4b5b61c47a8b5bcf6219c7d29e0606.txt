The public has been asked for its take on Microsoft's record-breaking proposed takeover of the gaming giant Activision Blizzard.The $69bn (£61.8bn) deal was announced back in January, but has come under scrutiny around the world over concerns it would give the Xbox maker an unfair advantage over rivals such as Sony, which makes the PlayStation.
An investigation by the UK's Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) was announced in July, and last month the watchdog decided there were enough issues to move the inquiry into a second phase.
