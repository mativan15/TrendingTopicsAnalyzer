Amid economic and political turmoil, Cuba has received at least $322 million worth of oil from Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine as authorities struggle to offset diminished shipments from close ally Venezuela, according to estimates by oil industry experts.

The 4 million barrels of Urals crude oil received by Cuba 'is the largest quantity since the collapse of the Soviet Union,' said Jorge Piñón, a senior research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Center who closely tracks oil shipments to the island.
