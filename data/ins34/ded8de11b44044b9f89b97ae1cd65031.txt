Indiewire 'Schitt's Creek' may be over, but the partnership between Dan Levy and Netflix is just getting started. Levy is set to make his directorial debut on 'Good Grief,' a new original film produced by the streaming giant and Levy's Not a Real Production Company. The movie, which Levy also wrote, tells the story of a gay man working through his grief over the death of his mother. While this will be Levy's first feature film behind the camera, he's certainly no stranger to the art form, as he won Emmys for both his writing and directing on 'Schitt's Creek.
