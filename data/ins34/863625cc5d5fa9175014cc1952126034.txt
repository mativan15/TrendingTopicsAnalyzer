Jeremy Hunt, in his first full day as UK chancellor, confirmed that he will scrap most of the tax measures in the disastrous fiscal statement of September 23rd — apart from a £13 billion cut to national insurance and £1.5 billion in stamp duty changes.Corporation tax will rise from 19 per cent to 25 per cent and a cut to the lower rate of income tax of one percentage point April will be delayed indefinitely.And the future of the Government's landmark two-year energy price cap is uncertain beyond next April.
