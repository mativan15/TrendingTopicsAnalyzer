A Bachelor of Arts (BA) is one of the most common undergraduate degrees in the United States. Earning your BA typically takes about four to five years of full-time study, and you'll often study topics in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The broad subject matter you may be exposed to in a BA program can provide a good foundation for many career paths. Having a Bachelor of Arts degree can open opportunities that high school education alone generally cannot.  According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for bachelor's degree holders is consistently lower than for those with an associate degree or high school diploma [1].
