Recession fears fueled by runaway inflation and rising interest rates caused the stock market to plunge this year. The Nasdaq Composite is about 35% off its peak, which means the tech-heavy index has traveled deep into bear market territory. Many individual stocks have fallen much further. For instance, Shopify (SHOP -0.69%) and DigitalOcean Holdings (DOCN -3.34%) have lost roughly 85% and 74% of their value, respectively, putting both stocks near a 52-week low.
Losses of that magnitude can be terrifying, but the investment theses behind Shopify and DigitalOcean remain firmly intact.
