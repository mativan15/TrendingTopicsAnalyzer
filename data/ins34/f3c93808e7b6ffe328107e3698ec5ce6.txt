Daniel Patricio's Shopify store, Bull and Cleaver, generates about $30,000 a month in sales of biltong, a South African-style beef jerky. But the direct-to-consumer business has decidedly humble origins; it started as a side hustle while Patricio worked on the product team at Shopify. Patricio started his store in 2015, a couple of years into his eight-year tenure at Shopify. He worked on products like the company's buy button before spending four years as a product lead focused on marketing. By October 2021, Bull and Cleaver had grown to the point that he decided to quit Shopify and run the side hustle full time.
