Illustration: Rahul AwasthiBengaluru: Top Indian IT service providers have become the biggest poaching ground for the Big Four accounting and consultancy firms such as Deloitte and EY, fuelling the record attrition rates faced by the domestic firms, data exclusively sourced by ET showed. Over 15% of the net addition by the Big Four accounting firms - Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG - are from the top five IT companies in FY22.

Experts say better pay and the addition of global companies to their bio-data make employees opt for the Big Four, even as these firms expand their presence in the country to strengthen their tech offerings and platforms related to tax and accounting.
