Variety - Film News 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' is on pace to land one of the year's biggest opening weekends.Early tracking, released by Nrg, has the superhero sequel debuting to 175 million, but many rival studio executives believe that figure could grow after reviews hit and word-of-mouth builds. Disney and Marvel still haven't released the bulk of their marketing materials, which could also goose ticket sales.If that figure is accurate, it will be the second biggest debut of 2022, just below the 187.
