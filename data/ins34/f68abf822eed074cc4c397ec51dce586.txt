Ben Bell has won the Gore district mayoralty but the meeting where he was due to be sworn into the top job was postponed without him being told. The council was due to have its statutory meeting on October 25, when Bell and his fellow councillors would be sworn in. Bell, who is in Wellington for a Local Government NZ Akona Mayor Induction Hui, said he only contacted council staff about the postponement after being questioned about it by Stuff. 'They said it was an error on their part. People can read into that what they like,'' Bell said.
