Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney has admitted that he was 'gutted' to miss their win over Liverpool but he knows there is 'nothing he can say'.

The Scotland international has been enduring a difficult time at Arsenal. He hit the ground running at the club after signing from Celtic.

But the left-back missed much of last season through injury. He has also been a bit-part player this term as he has only started three times in the Premier League.
