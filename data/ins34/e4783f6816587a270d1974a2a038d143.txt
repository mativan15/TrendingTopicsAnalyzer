Senator Bernie Sanders is planning an eight-state blitz with at least 19 events over the final two weekends before the midterm elections, looking to rally young voters and progressives as Democrats confront daunting national headwinds.

Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who in many ways is the face of the American left, is beginning his push in Oregon on Oct. 27.

'It is about energizing our base and increasing voter turnout up and down the ballot,' Mr. Sanders said in an interview. 'I am a little bit concerned that the energy level for young people, working-class people,' is not as high as it should be, he said.
