Arrival, a British electric vehicle maker, delayed its Charlotte-area production timeline earlier this year as part of a business reorganization. The company now says it is refocusing its operations on the U.S. market, where Charlotte is the center of its business.

Arrival said in its announcement on Thursday that 'significant further investment' would be needed to scale its microfactory in the U.K., which had been expected to begin electric van production in the third quarter. The facility missed that target but produced its first 'production verification vehicle' last quarter.
