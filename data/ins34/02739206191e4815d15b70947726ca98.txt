A Russian national ballet company has performed in Tokyo. The tour has drawn mixed responses amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Igor Moiseyev State Academic Ensemble of Popular Dance began its Japan tour on Monday, as part of the Festival of Russian Culture. About 80 dancers performed a fusion of folk dance and classic ballet in an almost packed hall. The Japanese organizing committee says the ballet troupe of mostly Russian dancers was due to visit in 2020, but the coronavirus pandemic caused a postponement.
