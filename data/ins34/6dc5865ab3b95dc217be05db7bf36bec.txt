Edina coach Katie Aafedt preached patience to her inexperienced girls' soccer team all season long. It paid off.

The Hornets played their best soccer of the season in the Class 3A, Section 2 tournament, shutting out fourth-ranked Minnetonka 3-0 for the championship. They beat No. 9 Chanhassen 6-0 in the semifinals.

Seeding for the state tournaments is scheduled for Saturday, and quarterfinals can start as soon as Tuesday.

The Hornets (14-4-1) qualified against the odds. They were unranked in the Minnesota State High School Soccer Coaches Association's final poll.
