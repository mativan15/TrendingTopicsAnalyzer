Paul Pogba has been labelled a 'bang average' player after his Manchester United exit was confirmed this week - with former Arsenal star Ray Parlour also insisting that Sir Alex Ferguson made the right decision to let Pogba leave the club in the first place.Pogba first walked out on United as a youngster back in 2012 before he was lured back to Old Trafford in a club-record £89million transfer in the summer of 2016. However, his second stint in Manchester has been hugely underwhelming, with the French midfielder poised to leave the club for nothing again after running his deal down.
