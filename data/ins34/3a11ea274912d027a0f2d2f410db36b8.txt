LONDON: Liz Truss let go of the keys of Number 10 following the removal of her home secretary, the resignation of the chief and deputy chief whips, and several public outpourings of dismay from Conservative MPs.The appointment of a new Chancellor of the Exchequer and a U-Turn on the majority of her economic plans had provided respite following weeks of volatility in markets and politics. But not for long. Truss stepped down on Thursday, after a term in office that was shorter than her leadership campaign, leaving the UK once again in the market for a new prime minister.
