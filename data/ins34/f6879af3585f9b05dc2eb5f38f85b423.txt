Australia reported the first fatality from days of widespread flash flooding Saturday, despite heavy rains easing and flood levels topping out across much of the southeast.Hundreds of homeowners began a long clean-up after storm waters engulfed streets, houses and cars across three states, with Melbourne suburbs among the worst hit.Two very wet years have left much of eastern Australia sodden, and floods now frequently follow even moderate downpours."It was frighting. I've been here for the other floods but I've never seen anything like that," 61-year-old Antoinette Besalino told AFP.
