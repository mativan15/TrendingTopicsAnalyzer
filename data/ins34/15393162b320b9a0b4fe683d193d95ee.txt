Goldman Sachs's David Solomon is embarking on his third major reorganisation in just four years as CEO, undoing some of the signature moves he made as recently as 2020.The Wall Street giant plans to once again combine its expanded asset management and private wealth businesses into one unit run by Marc Nachmann, according to people familiar with the matter. Goldman will also fuse its investment-banking and trading operations under one group run by Dan Dees, Jim Esposito and Ashok Varadhan. The money-losing consumer unit will be broken up.
