Software company GitLab (GTLB 17.14%) went public on Oct. 14 and was embraced by a market of optimistic investors that traded the stock up more than 30% on its opening day, closing at more than $100 per share.
Times have changed, the optimism has turned to wariness, and investors are shunning the stock, which trades at around $45 these days. Rampant inflation and rising rates have sent investors running for more defensive investments.
But GitLab's business is performing well, making a falling share price a potential opportunity for investors with a long-term mindset.
