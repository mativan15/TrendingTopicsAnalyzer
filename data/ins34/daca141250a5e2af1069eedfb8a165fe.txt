Trubisky is in the game because rookie quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered a concussion and was forced out early in the second half. Trubisky started the first four games of the season but struggled before being replaced.
Claypool has had a strong performance this week with five catches for 53 yards and said touchdown so far.
