A pair of Central Division opponents coming off poor defensive efforts on Friday night will match up on Saturday.

The Indiana Pacers will be seeking their first victory in their third consecutive home game after falling to the San Antonio Spurs 137-134. The Detroit Pistons won their home opener before getting thumped on the road by the New York Knicks 130-106.

"It's a tough league," Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. "They're going to be playing their third in four nights, same as us. We're going to have to somehow take advantage of not traveling.
