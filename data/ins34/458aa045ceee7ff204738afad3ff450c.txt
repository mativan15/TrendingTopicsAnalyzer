Stocks were mostly lower to start off Wednesday as a two-day rally spurred by a better-than-feared start to earnings season lost momentum.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.2% after the index gained more than 4% in back-to-back winning days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 60 points, or 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off by 0.3%.

Netflix (NFLX) was in the spotlight following a big earnings beat Tuesday afternoon that included 2.41 million in new subscribers – a key metric watched by analysts – more than double Wall Street's estimate of 1 million additions.
