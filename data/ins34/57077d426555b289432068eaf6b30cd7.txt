by CAREY McWILLIAMS1THE first eccentric of Southern California was a Scotsman by the name of William Money, who arrived in Los Angeles around 1841. Married to a Mexican woman, Money was a quack doctor, an economic theorist, and the founder of the first cult in the region. Known to local residents as Professor Money,' ' Doctor Money,'and ' Bishop Money, he had been born, so he contended, with four teeth and 'the likeness of a rainbow in the eye.'The cult that he founded was called 'The Reformed New Testament Church of the Faith of Jesus Christ' and was pretty largely made up of 'native Californians.
