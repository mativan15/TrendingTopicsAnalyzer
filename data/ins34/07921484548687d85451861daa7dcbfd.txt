Academy product O'Brien, 23, was on Leeds' radar last summer.
However, they failed to come up with a decent offer despite lengthy inquiries.
Instead he stayed with Huddersfield and was rewarded with a rise.
O'Brien has torn up the Championship with his hard running and clever counter-attacking skills.
