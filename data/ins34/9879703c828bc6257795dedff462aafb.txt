Lost goat alert.

And we're not talking about a G.O.A.T., as in a megastar athlete like Michael Jordan or Tom Brady.

We're talking about an actual furball that was swiped over the weekend from HAPPI Farm in Davie.

Surveillance video captured around 1:30 a.m. Saturday caught two individuals walking around the property, then entering areas where the animals are held.

Then they are seen grabbing Tonka, a five month old goat — and walking out with her.

It appears as if the suspects were on a mission.
