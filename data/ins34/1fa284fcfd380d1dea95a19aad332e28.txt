The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned to November 29 the hearing of petitions challenging the Gujarat government's decision to grant early release to 11 convicts sentenced to life in 2008 for the gang-rape of Bilkis Bano and murder of seven of her family members.A bench of justices Ajay Rastogi and CT Ravikumar granted time to the petitioners to file their response to the Gujarat government's affidavit submitted a day ago, in which the state disclosed that remission of the convicts had the approval of the Union home ministry – though the Central Bureau of Investigation and the trial judge opposed their release – and that 'good behaviour' of the convicts was a key reason to grant them the benefit.
