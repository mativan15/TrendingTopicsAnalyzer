The SEC's attempt to inform the public about the potential pitfalls of investing in so-called 'meme stocks' infuriated some Redditors this week – with users on 'WallStreetBets' and other boards grumbling that the agency was hypocritical and out of touch.
The SEC's 30-second video titled 'Meme Stocks' features a comedic sketch based on a fictional game show. A contestant attempts to invest in meme stocks, only for their money to disappear and a pie to hit them in the face.
Another contestant says they're 'going to do some research first' before investing – prompting the first contestant to ask, 'We can do research?'
The video, which has been viewed nearly 200,000 times on YouTube, sparked a series of Reddit posts on WallStreetBets, a popular board for retail investors, and SuperStonk, a site focused on one of the original 'meme stocks,' GameStop.
