Carsten Koall/Getty Images News Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX) shares spiked in the morning hours Wednesday after the company announced that the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine for use as a booster shot in those aged 18 years and older. According to the company, the protein-based vaccine will be allowed as a booster dose at least six months after the primary vaccination with any FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. It can be used in situations where individuals cannot access mRNA bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines from Pfizer (PFE)/BioNTech (BNTX) and Moderna (MRNA) or for those the updated vaccines are not indicated, NVAX said.
