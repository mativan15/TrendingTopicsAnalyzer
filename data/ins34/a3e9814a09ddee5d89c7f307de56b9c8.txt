ANY Dream Team gaffer that claims they predicted Philip Billing's (£2.9m) early season success is a liar.
Don't get us wrong, the Denmark international is a very capable midfielder but considering he scored three goals in his first 77 Premier League appearances for Huddersfield and Bournemouth, he didn't look like the most viable option prior to 2022/23.
His goal output for the Cherries increased in the Championship but it looked for all the world the south coast club would spend most of the new campaign in a relegation scrap, where returns for the likes of Billing would be few and far between.
