The Wrap 'The School for Good and Evil' is now streaming on Netflix, and true to its fairytale roots, it has action, adventure, and a whole lot of magic. But it's not quite as fake as you might think — director Paul Feig was insistent upon it.That said, he also took on the project for the excitement of doing something with a lot of effects. 'The School for Good and Evil,' now streaming, follows Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso) and Agatha (Sofia Wylie) as they're plucked from their village and taken to schools for good and evil, which are responsible for training all the storied heroes and villains of the world.
