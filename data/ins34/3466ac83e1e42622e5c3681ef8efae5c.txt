Giancarlo Giorgetti, named Italy's new economy minister on Friday, is considered one of the more moderate, pro-Europe members of Matteo Salvini's League party.

He was a loyal supporter of outgoing prime minister Mario Draghi, serving as his minister of economic development.

The 55-year-old has spent most of his political career in the League, but does not hesitate in disagreeing with Salvini -- even if publicly, he denies any rift.

His political mentor was Umberto Bossi, who founded the party when it was the regionally focused Northern League.
