Boris Johnson is planning an unlikely comeback following Liz Truss's resignation and is sounding out Tory MPs for their support, according to reports. If he were to return as prime minister, he would be following in the footsteps of his hero Winston Churchill, who returned to No 10 in 1951 after a period in opposition following his 1945 election defeat. Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak are currently leading the polls as favourites to replace Ms Truss, who quit after just 44 days in Downing Street. Mr Johnson is flying back from his Caribbean holiday so that he can muster up the support he needs to reach the 100 MP threshold to join the leadership race.
