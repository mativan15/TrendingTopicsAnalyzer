Tesla's CFO told analysts that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act with its electric vehicle tax credits for consumers is "a significant boost towards accelerating our mission." To be eligible for the credit, the car's battery must meet a minimum threshold of parts sourced from the U.S. or countries with which it has a free trade agreement, a standard CEO Elon Musk said he fully expects to meet. "We believe Tesla is very well-positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles," Kirkhorn said.
