Good morning.
The pound neared a two week high after reports that the Bank of England will delay its plans to sell off gilts in a process known as quantitative tightening that will reduce the amount of money flowing around the financial system. Sterling went to highs of $1.1410 against the dollar, after the Financial Times broke the story on Tuesday morning. 
The Bank of England will delay selling billions of pounds of government bonds until markets are calmer. The FT reported that Bank officials have made the decision after assessing markets as being 'very distressed'.
