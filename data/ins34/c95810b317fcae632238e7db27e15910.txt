By Stephen Nakrosis Software company Akerna Corp. on Friday announced a restructuring it said would reduce workforce and operating costs. The company, which serves the cannabis, hemp, and CBD industry, said the move would "accelerate its path to profitability, and create stakeholder value." Jessica Billingsley, the company's chief executive, said "While we believe we can continue to grow revenue and continue to reduce expenses over time, we have made the decision to focus our initiatives on our enterprise business and new market expansion of our SMB business, at least until the market conditions and the regulatory environment are in more favorable territory.
