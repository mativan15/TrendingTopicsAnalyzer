Consol Energy Inc.'s newest mine has shipped its first train full of metallurgical coal.

Itmann No. 5, in southern West Virginia, loaded and shipped that first coal via Norfolk Southern on Oct. 12, several weeks after the Canonsburg-based company commissioned the preparation plant at the $100 million mine.

Itmann is an expansion for Consol (NYSE: CEIX) beyond its traditional production of coal for power plants, which is mined at its Bailey/Enlow Fork/Harvey mine complex underneath Greene and Washington counties.
