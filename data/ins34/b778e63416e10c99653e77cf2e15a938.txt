For the uninitiated, a warehouse retailer tracing its roots to 1970s sunny San Diego is hardly the picture of a staple for a community as diverse as Asian Americans. Yet it happens to be the case in 2022, when the group makes up 7% of the entire U.S. population but reportedly comprises 11% of Costco's shoppers.

Somehow, Asian American shoppers have made a home out of Costco, now headquartered in Issaquah, Washington state. At present, the wholesale club operates more than 800 outlets in 12 global markets, four of which are in Asian countries or territories.
