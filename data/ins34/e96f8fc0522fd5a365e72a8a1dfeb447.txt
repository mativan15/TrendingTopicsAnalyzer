Indiewire In the 'Knives Out' film series, James Bond star Daniel Craig plays a very different leading man in Benoit Blanc, a dandyish Southern gentleman detective with a passion for Stephen Sondheim's 'Follies' score. So, when director Rian Johnson was recently asked if the character was queer during a press conference with the cast at the London Film Festival, his answer was very blunt: 'Yes, he obviously is.'According to Insider, a brief scene in the second 'Knives Out' film 'Glass Onion' features Craig's Benoit Blanc living with a man during the Covid-19 pandemic.
