With dev kits for mid-generation console upgrades rumoured to be sent out by early next year, fans argue whether such upgrades are even worth it.
It seems safe to say that the current generation of gaming consoles has been pretty weird so far. While both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S have been financially successful for Sony and Microsoft, they haven't been the easiest for customers to get hold off.
Plus, many developers (including ones at Sony and Microsoft) intend on releasing new games for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for a few more years yet, with very few console exclusives for the newer consoles available now or in the future.
