Top Wall Street strategist Marko Kolanovic said he's staying optimistic amid the market volatility, calling for the S & P 500 to recoup this year's steep losses and finish 2022 unchanged. "We remain positive on risky assets due to near record-low positioning, bearish sentiment, and our view that there will be no recession given supports from US consumers, global post-COVID reopening, and China stimulus and recovery," JPMorgan's Kolanovic said in a note. The strategist believes the market has already priced in tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, adding that inflation may have peaked.
