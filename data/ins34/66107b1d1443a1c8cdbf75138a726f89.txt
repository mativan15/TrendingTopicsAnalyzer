On BBC Breakfast this morning, the Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves discussed Rishi Sunak's announcements yesterday, and what this could mean for Britons in the future. She mentioned a loophole in Rishi Sunak's energy bill help to benefit second home owners.She said: 'It's important that the money is targeted.'If you look through the detail, if you have a second or a third or a fourth home you're likely to get this £400 payment multiple times.'I don't think that is a good use of taxpayer money and as well as the money raised from North Sea oil and gas yesterday, it looks like the Government are going to be borrowing an additional £10billion.
