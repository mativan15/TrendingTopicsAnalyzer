On Wednesday (October 19), MPs voted on the Ban on Fracking for Shale Gas Bill, a vote which Conservative whips said was essentially a 'confidence motion in the Government' and Prime Minister Liz Truss's leadership.

Senior Tory MPs have been accused of bullying members into voting against the bill, forcing Deputy Prime Minister Therese Coffey to deny manhandling an MP into the division lobby.
