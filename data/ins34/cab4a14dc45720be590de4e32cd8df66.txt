Even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took a moral high ground while announcing the withdrawal of its candidate from Andheri (East) assembly bypoll claiming it was in accordance with Maharashtra political culture of not contesting against the kin of deceased MLA, the party in the past has chosen to fight byelections against the relatives of late MLAs.
Since the 2019 assembly polls in Maharashtra, the state has till now witnessed three bypolls in Pandharpur (Solapur district), Deglur (Nanded district), and Kolhapur north (Kolhapur district) and BJP had fielded candidates in all three byelections, and even won in Pandharpur.
