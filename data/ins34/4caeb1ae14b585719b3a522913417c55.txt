Simone Biles has a PSA for anyone dressing up this Halloween.

Ahead of the festive holiday, the gymnast sent a warning out to anyone who is considering wearing a costume in honor of the late serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer: Don't do it.

"im just gon go head and say it," Biles tweeted Oct. 18, "put the jeffrey dahmer costumes back in the closet. we ain't having it!!!!!!"

The four-time Olympic gold medalist's comments come more than a month after the release of Ryan Murphy's true crime drama series, Dahmer—Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which stars Evan Peters as the convicted murderer.
