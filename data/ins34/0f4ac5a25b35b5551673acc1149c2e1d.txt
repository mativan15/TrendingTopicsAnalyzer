Shares of athleisure style setter Lululemon Athletica (LULU 1.32%) dropped 18% in May according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Investor fears based on the poor performance of many retailers in the first quarter drove many retail stocks to fall, and it seems Lululemon wasn't spared.
So what
Lululemon has become a force in activewear due to its on-trend styles, ability to understand and connect with its customers, and proper management. It can command high prices, and it provides the quality and customer care that generate customer satisfaction, loyalty, and strong full-price sales.
