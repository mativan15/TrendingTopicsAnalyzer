bjdlzx/E+ via Getty Images The Chart of the Day belongs to the independent oil & gas company Earthstone Energy (ESTE). I found the stock by using Barchart's powerful screening function to find the stocks with the highest Weighted Alpha and technical buy signals then sorted that list by the most frequent number of new highs in the last month. I then used the Flipchart feature to review the charts for consistent price appreciation. Since the Trend Spotter signaled a buy on 5/17, the stock gained 25.
