ROME — Italy's president gave the go-ahead on Friday for Giorgia Meloni to be the country's first female prime minister, leading the most right-wing government since World War II amid doubts about its commitment to European unity as economic and political pressures mount from Russia's war in Ukraine.

'We are ready,' Ms. Meloni said on Friday.

Ms. Meloni, leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy, a party descended from the ashes of Italy's failed experience with Fascism, emerged from last month's election as the clear leader of the country's victorious right-wing coalition.
