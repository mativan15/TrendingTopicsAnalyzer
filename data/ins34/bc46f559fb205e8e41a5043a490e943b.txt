The Competition Commission on Wednesday slapped penalties totalling more than Rs 392 crore on online travel firms MakeMyTrip, Goibibo and hospitality services provider OYO for unfair business practices.
MakeMyTrip and Goibibo (MMT-Go) have been asked by the regulator to ensure fair and transparent access to hotels as well as to comply with various directions.
The 131-page order comes after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) found the two platforms and OYO to have indulged in unfair business practices by way of anti-competitive agreements.
