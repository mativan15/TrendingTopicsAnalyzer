Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsCSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is about to report earnings, so I thought it'd be worthwhile to determine whether or not it makes sense to buy prior to earnings yet again. I did this previously, and it worked out very well, so I thought I'd see if I could have a repeat performance. I'm going to try to forecast the upcoming earnings by looking at the traffic figures to date, the elevated cost of rail transportation, and reviewing those against the performance in 2021. I'm going to take this forecast and then try to determine whether or not the share price is compelling.
