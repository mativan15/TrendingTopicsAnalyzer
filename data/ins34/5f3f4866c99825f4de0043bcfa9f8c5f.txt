Shiver me timbers.
Replicas of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow costume from the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise may be this year's hottest Halloween costume. 
The swash-buckling costume of the Disney character has seen a 90 percent increase in sales this Halloween, according to Halloweencostumes.com.
Depp — who has regained the spotlight since he won his defamation trial against Amber Heard in June — was forced by Disney to walk the plank and quit the 'Pirates' franchise. 
Basic costumes run from $85 to $95 while higher-quality costumes run from $245 to $299.
