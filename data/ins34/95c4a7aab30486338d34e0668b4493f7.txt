U.S. mortgage demand has fallen to a three-year low, owing to concerns about the U.S. entering a recession as well as the Federal Reserve's determination to continue to raise interest rates to battle inflation.
On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) released its latest data showing mortgage applications decreased 2.3% from last week, a slight drop as more buyers hold off on purchases. However, when compared to the same time last year, the number of applications overall are 75% lower.
