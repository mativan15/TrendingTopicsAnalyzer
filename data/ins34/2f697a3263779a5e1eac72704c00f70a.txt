Greenville, Ohio — Steaks are sizzling on a grill outdoors as Republican Senate candidate JD Vance takes the stage at the Darke County fairground, on a wagon decorated with hay bales and pumpkins, and outfitted with a lectern draped in an Ohio state flag.

"I don't like Joe Biden, but I've been shocked by how much damage they've been able to cause in just 18 months," Vance, the Trump-backed venture capitalist and author of "Hillbilly Elegy," tells the crowd gathered at the fairground. Some voters are wearing flannel, others in sweaters and scarves on this sunny but chilly day in western Ohio.
