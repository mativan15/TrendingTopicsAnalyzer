One Reddit user believes that his Apple Watch saved his life after a car crash.The man from Indianapolis explained in a Reddit post over the weekend how he had hit a telephone pole after his tire blew out while driving. Hitting the pole left him with his head on the steering wheel as smoke came out of the car, but a new safety feature on his watch meant that without even moving, authorities were notified about his accident and came to help."I was traveling a road I've known my whole life, a road I've driven on thousands upon thousands of times.
