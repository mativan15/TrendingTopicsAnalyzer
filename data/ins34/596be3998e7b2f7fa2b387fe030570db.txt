Catching a fly ball isn't always as easy as it looks.
That was at least the case for Wake Forest center fielder Pierce Bennett, who misplayed one in a game against Connecticut badly enough that it bonked him in the head during Friday's opening round of the College Park (Md.) NCAA regional. Bennett, who was trying to catch a warning track shot from the Huskies' Erik Stock, backed up to the wall before the ball hit him in the head in the top of the seventh.
The ball hit Bennett hard enough it knocked off his sunglasses.
