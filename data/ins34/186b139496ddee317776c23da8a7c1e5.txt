KSI has revealed his fight with Jake Paul is still up in the air unless his fellow YouTuber ‘decides to get his s**t together'.
The content creator and rapper, 29, is hoping to take on Jake, 25, in the ring next year, provided both parties can agree on a suitable contract.
He revealed to Men's Health UK: ‘The plan is, it's still on. But it's not going to be as easy as everyone thinks it is. There's going to be a lot of back and forth, a lot of negotiations.
‘I'm not holding my breath. I don't want to be in a situation where I'm just waiting for him.
