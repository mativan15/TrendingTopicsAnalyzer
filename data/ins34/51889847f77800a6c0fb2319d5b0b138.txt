Last week, when Mulayam Singh Yadav died, India's polity lost one of the politicians who, in the turbulent decade of the 1990s, helped open it up into a wider arena, a more interesting place.
Yadav became the face of the Mandal revolution in Uttar Pradesh, which did not just pose a counterpoint to Mandir, the other big political movement of the '90s, but which together with it, challenged the already fraying consensus of the Congress-led one-party dominant system.
Most obituaries have spoken of how he did this while keeping his feet planted firmly on the ground and nurturing a wide range of relationships till the very end.
