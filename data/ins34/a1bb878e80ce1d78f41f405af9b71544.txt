Kirkland-based point-of-sale startup Cheq Lifestyle Technology Inc. has raised $13.3 million, the company reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week.

Cheq co-founder and CEO Thomas Lapham said the money consists of an $8 million seed round, while the rest of the funding is in the form of future equity notes. The company has 18 full-time employees right now, he said, and plans to double its headcount by the end of next year.

"We've proven, I think, that we've got technology that people love," Lapham said.
