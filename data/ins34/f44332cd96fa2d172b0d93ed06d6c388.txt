Only two new processing licences for snow crab were approved by Fisheries Minister Derrick Bragg earlier this week. ( Fish, Food and Allied Workers)The chair of Newfoundland and Labrador's Fish Processing Licensing Board is speaking out after Fisheries Minister Derrick Bragg overruled the board and denied coveted crab licences for plants in two communities. Reg Anstey said the board's recommendations on snow crab licences were made over more than a year of research and meetings with scientists in the fishery, adding the independent board's mandate is to assess the entire industry without a political lens.
