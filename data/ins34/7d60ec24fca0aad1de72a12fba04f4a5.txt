If you work for a small business in California, time is running out for your employer to set up a retirement savings plan. By June 30, all businesses and nonprofits with five or more employees in the state must either offer their adult workers a 'qualified' retirement plan (such as a pension with defined benefits or a 401[k] plan) or sign up for the state-run CalSavers Retirement Savings Program. CalSavers offers workers individual retirement accounts at no charge to their employers. Larger companies already have to comply with the mandate, and the state has begun penalizing the ones that don't.
