The American gold-medal winner in men's singles figure skating from the Beijing 2022 Olympics, Nathan Chen, stepped away from the sport earlier this year to focus on his studies. But the lure of the Games is never far away, especially for a champion.'It's an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life [competing in the Olympic Games]. So I would love to have another opportunity to do that,' the 23-year-old Chen told Hollywood Life on 20 October, seeming to hint at a possible return for the 2026 Games in Milano Cortina.
