Moderna Inc will delay its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries to the European Union by several months under an agreement announced on Thursday. The U.S.-based vaccine maker will postpone the delivery of some doses initially planned for the second quarter of 2022 to later in the year, the European Commission said in a statement.
 This is the bloc's second agreement with vaccine manufacturers to optimise supply as it gears up for a potential booster campaign in the fall. In May, Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE also agreed to push back COVID vaccine deliveries by three months.
