American alligators in a notoriously polluted North Carolina waterway could be facing similar consequences from chemical contaminants as local people, according to new research. Gators living in the Cape Fear River, with high levels of PFAS (polyfluoroalkyl substances) accumulated in their blood, displayed signs of weakened immune systems and autoimmune disease, according to a study, published Thursday in the journal Frontiers in Toxicology. PFAS are a class of manmade compounds commonly called 'forever chemicals' because of how difficult they are to break down.
