By Reuters Published: 05:38 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 05:38 EDT, 31 May 2022 By Alan Charlish WARSAW, May 31 (Reuters) - Shares in Hungarian oil company MOL rose more than 5% early on Tuesday, helping to make Budapest's main stock index the region's strongest performer after the European Union exempted Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia from sanctions on Russian oil. European Union leaders agreed in principle on Monday to cut 90% of oil imports from Russia by the end of this year. The remaining 10% will be temporarily exempt from the embargo so that landlocked Hungary, which was the main holdout against a deal, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic, keeps its access to Russian oil, which it cannot easily replace.
