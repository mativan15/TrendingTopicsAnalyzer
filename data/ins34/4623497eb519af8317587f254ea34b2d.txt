AFL fans have expressed their sadness after Mitch Wallis was axed by the Western Bulldogs on Monday after 12 seasons with the club.

The 29-year-old was a father-son recruit in 2010 and played 162 games for the Bulldogs, but cruelly missed out on the drought-breaking grand final triumph in 2016 through injury.

Wallis played the first 17 games in 2016 before breaking his leg, watching on from the sidelines as the Bulldogs won the flag.
