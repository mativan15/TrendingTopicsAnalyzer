Integra received approval from North Miami officials to redevelop a former church site into a $100 million apartment project.

NoMi Square will be located on a 7.6-acre site at 13855 N.W. 17th Ave. The Miami-based developer, through affiliate North Miami Venture LLC, purchased the property for $4.5 million in 2021. The church was abandoned years earlier.

The project was approved for 338 apartments in seven stories, plus four live-work units with both residential space and room for a business, and about 500 parking spaces.
