May 28—ASOTIN — Practice makes perfect, and the ECH-Science team is hoping they perfect maneuvering through their underwater robotics course before they head to an international competition.

The team is made up of Ella Tretheway, a seventh grader at Asotin Middle School; Claire Ledgerwood, a seventh grader at Holy Family in Clarkston; and Merredy Hardin, a home-schooled sixth grader. Rob Setlow is their coach through the Asotin Lions Club, because the team isn't associated with any school district.
