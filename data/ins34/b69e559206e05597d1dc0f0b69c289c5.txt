Honda Motor Co. will develop artificial intelligence technology to detect abnormalities in a driver's physical condition by analysing how the vehicle is travelling and any subtle changes in the driver. The technology is expected to reduce accidents involving elderly drivers, which has become a social problem, and also to help detect dementia or glaucoma at an early stage. The automaker aims to put it to practical use around 2030. Working with the National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology, Honda is using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sensors to analyse a driver's brain and eye movements.
