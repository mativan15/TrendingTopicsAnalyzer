Darwin Nunez is 'keen' on joining Erik ten Hag's summer transfer rebuild at Manchester United. That is according to talkSPORT, who claim Benfica have placed a hefty £68million price tag on the prolific Uruguay striker.Nunez has become a target for a host of Europe's elite clubs after netting 34 goals this season, including strikes in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final defeat to Liverpool. The 22-year-old has made nine appearances for his country so far, and will be hoping to earn his place in this year's World Cup squad where Diego Alonso's side will face Ghana, Portugal, and South Korea.
