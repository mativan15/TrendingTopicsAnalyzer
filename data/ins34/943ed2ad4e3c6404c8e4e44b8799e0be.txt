SleepX, a subsidiary of AppYea (OTC: APYP) focusing on the development of accurate wearable monitoring solutions to treat sleep apnea and snoring, announces it received approval from the Helsinki Committee to begin its planned clinical trial on the SleepX PRO application.

This follows the company's recent update that it intends to test the SleepX Pro application at a hospital sleep lab. The trial is the first step towards applying for an FDA approval under the first-of-its-kind medical device category for contactless detection of sleep apnea to be performed through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of breathing during sleep.
