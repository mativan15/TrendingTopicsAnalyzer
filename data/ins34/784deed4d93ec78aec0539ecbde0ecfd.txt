Christmas came early for Louisiana Tech baseball. After securing the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament with its first Conference USA title, the Bulldogs are ready for the Austin Regional with Texas, Dallas Baptist and Air Force.

"It's a lot of adrenaline, it's a lot of anxiety, it's kind of like Christmas morning," Louisiana Tech baseball coach Lane Burroughs said. "You can't wait to wake up and get there."

After the Bulldogs lost a three-game series at Southern Miss in April, Burroughs told the team it would be back to take the conference title.
