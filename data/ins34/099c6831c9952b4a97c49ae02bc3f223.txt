Concerns have been raised about a group of 11 Albanians flown out of the UK soon after arriving here in small boats despite a government undertaking not to fast track Albanian nationals.Last month the Home Office was forced to concede that it did not have the right to do so, after earlier claims from former home secretary Priti Patel that the UK could quickly return asylum seekers who arrived in the UK and made 'spurious' claims.The Albanians are thought to have arrived in the UK last week and were taken from Manston in Ramsgate where the Home Office processes small boat arrivals, to Stansted airport from where they were put on a plane back to Albania the next morning.
