Hold on to your potatoes! Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom star Ke Huy Quan has shared the behind-the-scenes story around his viral reunion photo with Indy himself, Harrison Ford.

Nearly forty years ago, the Vietnamese-born child star played the archeologist adventurer's sidekick Short Round in Steven Spielberg and George Lucas's blockbuster Raiders of the Lost Ark sequel, and the duo crossed paths again at Disney's D23 Expo in September, where Ford appeared to tease the release of the fifth and final Indiana Jones film next year.
