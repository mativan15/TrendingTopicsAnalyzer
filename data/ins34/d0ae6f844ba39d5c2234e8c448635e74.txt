Elon Musk has informed investors he plans to lay off nearly 75 per cent of Twitter's workforce if he takes control of the social media company, according to The Washington Post.With 7,500 employees, this percentage would result in 5,625 people being out of jobs. As ever with the billionaire's sweeping statements, however, the truth might be less dramatic.Twitter's current management is planning to cut the company's payroll by about $800 million (£719 million) by next year, according to Business Insider, whether the deal with Musk goes ahead or not.
