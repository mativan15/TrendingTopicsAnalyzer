Bimbo or no bimbo?
Fellow former briefcase beauty Donna Feldman told The Post that she doesn't feel the same way about her time on 'Deal or No Deal' as Meghan Markle does.
'I disagree that I or anyone on the show was ever treated like a ‘bimbo,'' the Los Angeles-based model insisted.
Markle claimed in her 'Archetypes' podcast episode released Tuesday that the game show treated the women like bimbos while speaking about the term with Paris Hilton.
Markle appeared on Season 2 of the show in 2006, and while she said she was 'grateful' for the job when she was 25, she felt she was only valued for her looks.
