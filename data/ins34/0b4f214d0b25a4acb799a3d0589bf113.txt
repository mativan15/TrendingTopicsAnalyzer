WASHINGTON – Emulating Donald Trump, the Republican candidate for governor of Arizona repeatedly refused to say Sunday whether she would honor the results of her election – if she lost."I'm going to win the election and accept that result," Lake said twice on CNN's "State of the Union."Lake is among this election's most prominent "election deniers," Republicans who agree with Trump's false claims about his loss in the 2020 election and suggest they may file protests of their own after the November elections.
