On Wednesday, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said the bank's embattled mortgage business could have a smaller footprint in the future — and suggested criticism of Wells Fargo's home lending practices are partly to blame.  Speaking at Bernstein's annual Strategic Decisions conference in New York City, Scharf said that Wells Fargo is "in the process of changing strategically where mortgage fits in," adding that "mortgage is a hard business."Scharf cited in part the lending standards for conforming loans set by government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a transcript of his remarks from data provider Sentieo.
