(Bloomberg) -- Members of South Korean boy band BTS plan to do their mandatory military service starting this year and will only get back together around 2025, their management company said Monday.The band's oldest member Kim Seok-jin, known as Jin, will start his enlistment process as soon as end-October, Hybe Co. said in regulatory filings and on Twitter, adding that other members will follow based on their individual plans and that the timing was not definite. The group shocked their fans in June when they said they will take an indefinite hiatus to pursue solo projects, but fans hoped the government would exempt the superstar group from service.
