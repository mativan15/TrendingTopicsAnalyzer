APEven before fans and teammates could start celebrating Manchester United's victory over Tottenham, an upset Cristiano Ronaldo was seen walking back into the tunnel. The legendary footballer sat on the bench as the match started and stayed there. Even before the final whistle, and when United has two substitutions still available, he left the ground looking visibly upset. Goals by Fred and Bruno Fernandes helped Erik ten Hag's team sweep past Tottenham in a 2-0 win and move to the brink of the Champions League qualification positions in the Premier League.
