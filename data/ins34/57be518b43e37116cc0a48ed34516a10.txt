During a midterm election cycle that has seen each party swap fortunes at least once, the New York governor's race has been rather boring. Democrat Kathy Hochul has maintained a wide lead over Republican congressman Lee Zeldin as she seeks her first full term. On Tuesday, though, two new polls suggested something of a shake-up.
A Siena College poll showed Hochul leading Zeldin by 11 points, 52 to 41 percent, down from her 17-point lead in September.
