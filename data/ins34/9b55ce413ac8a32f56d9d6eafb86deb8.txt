YouTuber Tasha K has been ordered to pay $4 million to Cardi B or secure a bond covering the entire amount. The latest development in the defamation case comes after a judge ruled against Tasha in January, saying the gossip blogger made damaging claims about the Grammy-winning artist.

Tasha K, legally known as LaTasha Kebe, is now in the process of appealing her case, Billboard reports. The judge said the YouTuber can only pause the judgement if she posts a supersedeas, which is a bond covering the entire amount.
