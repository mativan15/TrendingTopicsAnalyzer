VioletaStoimenova Introduction On October 14 Verano Holdings (OTCQX:VRNOF) announced it is terminating the January 31, 2022 agreement to acquire Goodness Growth Holdings (OTCQX:GDNSF). The reasons given were "GGH's breaches of covenants and representations in the Arrangement Agreement and the occurrence of other termination events." Like most industry followers, I was shocked, having written an article saying Goodness Growth was a good entry into Verano at a discount. I will personally take a big loss in percentage terms on GDNSF shares, although fortunately my initial cannabis positions are always small.
