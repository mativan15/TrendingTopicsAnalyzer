While many businesses struggle with staff shortages, a Taranaki pharmacy has invested more than $250,000 in robots to free their staff up from packaging prescriptions. At the start of the year Vivian Pharmacy in New Plymouth purchased a packing and a checking machine for pill dispensing. The packing machine disperses prescriptions into sachets and the checking machine puts the sachets through and alerts staff if there are any errors. It's the only one of its kind in Taranaki and one of only 10 in New Zealand.
