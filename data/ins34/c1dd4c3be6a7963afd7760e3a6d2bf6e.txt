Helicopter footage from above the Queen Elizabeth II bridge showed protesters suspended from the structure as M25 traffic is disrupted for a second day. The bridge remains closed after police were called to the Dartford Crossing at 03:50 BST on Monday.Aerial pictures also showed long queues of traffic with National Highways saying there was about six miles (10km) of slow-moving traffic and 60 minutes of delays both ways. Just Stop Oil said the action was in protest against new government oil and gas licences.
