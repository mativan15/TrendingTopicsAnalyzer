Uber is launching an in-house advertising division and rolling out its own form of targeted digital ads as it seeks to develop new revenue sources.

The ridehailing giant announced the launch of its 'enterprise-wide' advertising unit on Wednesday, saying it will be helmed by Amazon advertising veteran Mark Grether.

Uber (UBER) at the same time unveiled its new in-app 'Journey Ads' service, which lets marketers place ads within the Uber (UBER) app to reach customers at each step on their trips.
