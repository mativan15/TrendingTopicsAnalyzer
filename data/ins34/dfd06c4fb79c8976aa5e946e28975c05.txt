(Bloomberg) -- Senior UK business figures are calling on Liz Truss to stand down as prime minister after she was forced to scrap almost all of her economic policies amid chaos on financial markets.Three days after being appointed chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt dropped most of his predecessor's tax cuts on Monday, and scaled back the UK's energy-support program. Truss had already reversed a corporation tax freeze at the end of last week when she dismissed Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor.'I don't see how the Prime Minister can successfully disassociate herself from the failed implementation of policies, u-turns and mistakes by firing the chancellor and blaming him,' Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital Plc, told Bloomberg News.
