It's not a great time for self-driving tech startups. The ones that managed an IPO in the past two years have lost a combined 81 percent of their market value, dropping from a total of nearly $51 billion offering time to a mere $9 billion this month.
Crunchbase, which tracks startup valuations and investments, said in its report on the market that self-driving technology companies experienced a funding boom in 2020 and 2021, "but investors' love affair with the space didn't last."
Several of the companies revved fast with vast reserves of funding from well-known investors but pedigree and investors can't save new companies from market forces.
