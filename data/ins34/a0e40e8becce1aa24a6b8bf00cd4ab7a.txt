After Jeff Petry was sent off in overtime for cross-checking for his third penalty of the game, Dach got a pass from Sean Monahan and beat Casey DeSmith for the power-play goal.

It was Dach's first goal since he was acquired in a July trade with Chicago.

Evgeni Malkin had two goals for Pittsburgh, and Bryan Rust had two assists. DeSmith made 36 saves.

Crosby was held off the scoresheet. The center had a goal and two assists in each of the Penguins' first two games — both victories.

Samuel Montembeault stopped 26 shots for Montreal.
