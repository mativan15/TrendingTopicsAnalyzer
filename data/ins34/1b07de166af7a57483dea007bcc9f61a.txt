With the world-renowned mountain biking mecca of Rotorua an annual fix on the Crankworx calendar, this year's visit combines to make the city a must-visit this November: it just so happens that celebrated Kiwi rockers SIX60 are putting on a show in Rotorua on the mountain bike festival's culminant weekend. What makes Crankworx special is its broad appeal and spectator-friendly events including Speed & Style, downhill, Slopestyle and Pump Track Challenge. These race formats combine athletic power with gymnastic skill for spectacular results as the world's top athletes battle it out right in front of your eyes.
