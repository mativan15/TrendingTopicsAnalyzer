Collider.com With director Jaume Collet-Serra's Black Adam getting ready to open in movie theaters next week, I recently sat down with Sarah Shahi and Mo Amer to talk about making the highly anticipated DC movie. As most of you know, Dwayne Johnson and his team have been working on the Black Adam movie for a decade and the film is the first time Black Adam has been featured in a movie. In the film, you'll see his 5000-year-old origin story and why he was imprisoned after using his powers for vengeance.
