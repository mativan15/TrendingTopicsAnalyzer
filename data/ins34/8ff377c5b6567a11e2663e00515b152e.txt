James Cleverly has suggested the same Tory MPs who ousted Boris Johnson are now working to do the same to Liz Truss.

The Foreign Secretary said it is "many of the same people" who "defenestrated Boris" who are now criticising the new Prime Minister.

Mr Cleverly argued that none of the challenges facing the UK would be solved by "removing another prime minister" as he said the Government must focus on delivery if it wants to reverse dire opinion polls.
