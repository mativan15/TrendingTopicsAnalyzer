MELBOURNE, Australia — Five Australian women have sued the Qatari government two years after they were pulled off a plane and subjected to invasive medical procedures as part of an investigation into the abandonment of a newborn in an airport bathroom.

While Qatar has said it will review the protocols, the women say they want the country to enact policy changes to prevent a repeat of what happened to them.

Their lawyer, Damian Sturzaker, said that court papers were filed in Australia last week and served to the state-owned Qatar Airways on Thursday, and that legal papers would also be sent to Qatar's Civil Aviation Authority.
