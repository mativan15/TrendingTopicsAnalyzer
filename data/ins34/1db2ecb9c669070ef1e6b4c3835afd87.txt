Special counsel John Durham 's likely final trial ended in another defeat Tuesday as a federal jury acquitted Igor Danchenko, a Russian analyst who was the primary source of the anti-Trump Steele dossier, on charges of making false statements to the FBI.

The jury deliberated for about nine hours over two days before acquitting Mr. Danchenko, who showed no reaction to the verdict.
Mr. Danchenko was charged with four counts of making false statements related to his claims to the FBI that he had received an anonymous phone call in July 2016 from someone he believed to be Sergei Millian, the former head of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce.
