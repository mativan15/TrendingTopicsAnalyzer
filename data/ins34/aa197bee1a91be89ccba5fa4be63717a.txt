Shares of Dow Inc. DOW, -2.70% slipped 0.6% in premarket trading Thursday, after the specialty chemicals company reported third-quarter profit and sales that fell from a year ago, as higher energy costs hurt margins, but still beat expectations. The company said it has outlined plans to cut costs by $1 billion in 2023 as the macroeconomic environment remains "dynamic." Net income dropped to $760 million, or $1.02 a share, from $1.71 billion, or $2.23 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.
