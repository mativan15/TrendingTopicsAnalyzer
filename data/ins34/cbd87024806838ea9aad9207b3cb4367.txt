James ‘Arg' Argent has jetted out to Italy to meet his 18-year-old girlfriend Stella Turian's family, cementing their relationship.
The Towie star, 34, has been linked to the teen actress since June, with the pair recently photographed packing on the PDA while on a trip to Marbella last month.
And it looks like the couple is going from strength to strength, as reports claim Arg delighted Stella's relatives upon meeting them for the first time – and they are now planning another getaway.
‘James has totally fallen for Stella and she adores him too,' an insider claimed.
