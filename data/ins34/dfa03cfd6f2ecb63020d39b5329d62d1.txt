KAMPALA, Uganda — Visitors typically come to Itanda Falls, a cascade near the source of the Nile, to kayak on the powerful rapids or enjoy the lush natural beauty.

But for one weekend in September, the pine forest along the riverbank was alive with dancers. They swayed and sweated throughout the night to cutting-edge electronic music, then drifted down in the soft dawn light to bathe in the river.

Nyege Nyege is East Africa's biggest electronic music festival, and its sixth physical edition this year (the 2020 event went virtual because of the pandemic) attracted 15,000 visitors from across Africa and Europe.
