Joe Raedle Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) agreed to extend a refund period for its recalled Tread+ for another year. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Peloton jointly announced that consumers now have until November 6, 2023 to apply for a refund. On May 5, 2021, CPSC and Peloton (PTON) announced the recall of 125K Tread+ treadmills following the death of a child and dozens of incidents. The hazard with the treadmills is said to be that adult users, children, pets, and objects can be pulled underneath the rear roller, posing a risk of injury or death.
