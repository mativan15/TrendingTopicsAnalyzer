Michelle Gall is holding back tears.

She's overcome with emotion, watching her dream finally materialize into reality.

That dream was finding a home for Digital Girl, Inc., a technology hub for Brooklyn's Black youth created with the sole purpose of attacking the disparity in job opportunities for people of color in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.

The numbers paint a complete story: only 2% of jobs in science and engineering are held by Black women.

'I ended up starting my career late in life because I just didn't get the exposure that I felt I should have gotten, or the support that I should have gotten that led me down the path that I ultimately went,' Gall, the founder of Digital Girl told the Daily News.
