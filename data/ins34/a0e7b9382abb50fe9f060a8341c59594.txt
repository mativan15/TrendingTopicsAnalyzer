The well-preserved mosaic was hiding beneath a fourth-century building in Rastan, a town near Homs. Businessmen with the Nabu Museum in neighboring Lebanon bought the property and donated it to the Syrian government. In 2018, the government reclaimed Rastan from rebels amid the ongoing Syrian Civil War.
