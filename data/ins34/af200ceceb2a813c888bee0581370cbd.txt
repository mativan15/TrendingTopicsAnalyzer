If Donald Trump ends up running for president in 2024, he may not have former Vice President Mike Pence's support. As Pence spoke to students at Georgetown University's Institute of Politics on Wednesday, he replied to a question about whether he'd place a vote for Trump by saying: 'There might be somebody else I prefer.' Pence has hinted that he might take a stab at running for president in 2024. Before making a decision, he told the students that he and former second lady Karen Pence would be praying on the matter over the next few months.
