Abuja, Nigeria — 
Mmachukwu Orizu started her baby formula business six years ago after quitting her former job as a medical lab scientist. She uses grains such as corn, rice and brown wheat to make her recipes. She then packages them and prepares them for delivery. But because of Russia's war in Ukraine, she's not sure when she will get her next supply of wheat, and she said scarcity of wheat also is affecting the prices of other ingredients.

Orizu is the founder of Somma's Yummies.
"I use wheat alongside oats and yam flour to produce that particular one," Orizu said.
