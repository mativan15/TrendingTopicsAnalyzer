NEWS RELEASE Long Beach—The Labor Commissioner's Office has cited Torrance Car Wash more than $800,000 for wage theft violations affecting 35 workers, including minimum wage, overtime and contract wage violations. An investigation found that some workers worked beyond 80 hours per pay period, but received pay for approximately 80 hours no matter how many hours worked. Others who reported to work on time were made to wait before punching in and not paid for that time. 'The business owners violated labor laws to avoid paying workers the wages they were owed and refused to cooperate with our investigation by withholding documents during our inspection,' said Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower.
