Brighton have suffered a dip since Graham Potter left for Chelsea but new boss Roberto De Zerbi will be hoping to get his first win since taking charge when bottom-of-the-table Nottingham Forest visit the Amex Stadium on Tuesday (kick-off, 7.30pm).
Under Potter, the Seagulls were mixing it in the top four early on in the campaign but a creditable draw at Liverpool and two defeats to nil under their new Italian manager have left them seventh.
Steve Cooper's side are on a miserable run of form, though, losing six of their previous seven games, and are bottom of the table with only five points from 10 games, so Brighton will expect to dominate and get back to winning ways.
