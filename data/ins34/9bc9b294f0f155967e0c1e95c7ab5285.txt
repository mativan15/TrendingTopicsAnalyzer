When Ben Wallace pulled out of the Conservative leadership contest in July, he had already built a campaign team and secured the support of more than 25 MPs. But strains in his domestic life led him to conclude that the pressures of the job would have too great an impact on his family.

But friends say the Defence Secretary has now become much less categoric' about not running, after being approached by colleagues to stand in any possible contest.

Mr Wallace, who regularly tops the rankings among Tory party members, is ‘rethinking' his position because he believes that Rishi Sunak, the favourite to succeed Liz Truss, ‘cannot unite the party'.
