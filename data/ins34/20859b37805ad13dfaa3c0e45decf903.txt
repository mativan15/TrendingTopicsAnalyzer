Oct. 19—A legislative committee voted 8-1 Wednesday to sue the Department of Health and Human Services to gain access to investigative files of child murders before the criminal cases are resolved in court.

The Government Oversight Committee decided to take the unusual step of suing DHHS after agency officials did not comply with a subpoena seeking records involving the cases of children who had been in the state's child protection system and died from abuse or neglect. The agency and the Attorney General said releasing the records to lawmakers would violate confidentiality laws, particularly when there are criminal cases pending.
