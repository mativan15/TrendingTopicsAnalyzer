Spellers ages 7-15 traveled across the United States and from as far away as Guam to compete on Thursday for the title of "Champion" in the 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee.The challenging words the spellers face range from those with just a few letters like 'luge,' a small toboggan, to those that stretch through the alphabet like 'scherenschnitte,' a papercutting art form.This year's contest is being held just outside of Washington, in National Harbor, Maryland.Last year, when Zaila Avant-garde, 14, from New Orleans correctly spelled "Murraya," a genus of plants, she became the first African American to win the prestigious competition that began in 1925.
