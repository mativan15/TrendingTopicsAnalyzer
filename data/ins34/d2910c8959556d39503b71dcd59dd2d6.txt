'It's been five years that we've faced cuts to our social welfare system,' Annie Dally, a 55-year-old elementary schoolteacher, said in the middle of a boisterous, colorful union march that stretched for miles, snaking its way through Paris's Left Bank on Tuesday.Pointing out groups of protesting students, immigrant groups, gay teachers, retired seniors, and workers from various unions, Dally, wearing stickers asking for wage increases and early retirement, said: 'We're all in the same struggle.'The original strikes at refineries across the country have left about a quarter of the pumps across the country fully or partly dry.
