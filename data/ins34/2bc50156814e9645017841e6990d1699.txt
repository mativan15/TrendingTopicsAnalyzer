Published: 06:32 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 06:37 EDT, 20 October 2022 Rust will resume production this January, over a year after it was halted when star Alex Baldwin shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins dead on set. The film will resume at a new location, however, as the old New Mexico set remains closed amid the ongoing investigation into Hutchins' death.  Production teams are still looking for a new location, but Rust Movie Productions LLC attorney Melina Spadone said California was a possibility, according to Variety.
