The School for Good and Evil, Paul Feig's new fantasy film, has upset fans of the book it's based on after changing the colour of a character's hair. 
The Netflix production, which has been in development since before the pandemic, was made available to stream earlier this week on October 19.
It follows the story of two friends, Agatha (Sofia Wylie) and Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso), who attend the titular school for heroes and villains.
The School for Good and Evil has received a mixed reception from film critics so far, but fans of the book seem generally satisfied on social media.
