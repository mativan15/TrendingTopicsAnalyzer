PTIUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.Referring to Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav recounting an anecdote of a student mistaking him for Rahul Gandhi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday there is not much difference between the two leaders. While one criticises the country abroad, the other speaks ill about Uttar Pradesh outside the state, he said in a swipe at the Congress leader and Akhilesh Yadav. During the discussion on the budget in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Adityanath said children are innocent and the student, whom Yadav had referred to, must have said this after some thinking.
