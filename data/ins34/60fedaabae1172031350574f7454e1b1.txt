Rebel Wilson has spoken out about a newspaper threatening to out her for having a same-sex relationship in June for the first time. 
The actress, 42, had gone public with her relationship with girlfriend Ramona Agruma at the start of June, sharing a sweet photo of the two of them together. 
However, it later emerged that the Sydney Morning Herald had approached Rebel for comment before planning to ‘out' her first relationship with a female in an article. 
The publication faced backlash after columnist Andrew Hornery complained that Rebel had ‘gazumped' the story by going Instagram-official instead.
