Proposition FF is one of two measures on the state ballot this year that would affect Coloradans' income taxes – but only for households making more than $300,000 per year.

The Healthy School Meals for All campaign seeks to provide free breakfasts and lunches to all students in the state's public school system by lowering income tax deductions for wealthier households.

The proposition would limit state income tax deductions to $12,000 for single filers and $16,000 for joint filers, translating to an additional $450 in taxes owed by a couple that brings in $375,000 per year with the standard deduction, according to the state ballot booklet.
