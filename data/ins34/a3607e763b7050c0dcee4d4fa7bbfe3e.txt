One of the largest colleges in the Dayton region already is putting grant money to use. The project will provide a campus upgrade.

Sinclair Community College's Early Childhood Education Center is being renovated. The $140,000 project is being funded in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education.

The department awarded grants to four universities and colleges in Southwest Ohio - Sinclair and Wright State University among them.

Sinclair was awarded $551,000 and Wright State received $397,000, according to the office of U.
