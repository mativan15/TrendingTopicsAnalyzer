FRANK SCHWAB: I'm Frank Schwab here to give you my best bets for the NFC South this season. And we're going to start with the defending division champion, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Tom Brady retired for about a month then decided to come back, and with that became one of the MVP favorites.

My best bet for the Bucs is on Brady to win the MVP at 8 to 1 odds. Look, it'd be a great story for Brady, who's still playing somehow his highest level even in his mid-40s to go out with an MVP award.
