As the biggest college football weekend in the city quickly approaches, Visit Jacksonville is gearing up for thousands of visitors from the Northeast the weekend of Oct. 28-30.

Last year, the weekend of the Florida-Georgia game raked in nearly $6 million from lodging alone, with 67,200 overnight attendees. This year is expected to have an even higher total from room revenue as room rates continue to increase.

According to Visit Jacksonville, while last year had roughly a $37 million total economic impact for the city, this year is expected to hit at least $40 million.
