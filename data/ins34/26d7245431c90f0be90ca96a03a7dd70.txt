Everyone might be talking about the recent release of the Sonos Ray, but if Sonos' entry-level soundbar doesn't seem like a good fit, you can currently find discounts on a range of refurbished speakers in the Sonos catalog. Some of the current deal highlights include the Sonos Arc and Sonos Roam, which are available for $719 and $139, respectively.
The Sonos Arc normally sells for $900 new, but this refurbished model is available for $719.
