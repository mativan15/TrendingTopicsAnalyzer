AgenciesDhanteras is considered an auspicious festival of wealth and prosperity. While 'Dhan' means riches, 'Teras' signifies the thirteenth day of Krishna Paksha. Specifically, the first day of Diwali in India is regarded as Dhanteras or Dhanatrayodashi. It is believed that Goddess Lakshmi appeared from the ocean of milk during the Samundra Manthan. This year, some may have some confusion over the exact date of Dhanteras. While some say Dhanteras will fall on October 22, others think it will be on October 23.
