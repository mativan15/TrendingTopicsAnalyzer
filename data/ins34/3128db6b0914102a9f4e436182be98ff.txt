Siding firm James Hardie Industries said Thursday it will build a manufacturing plant in Crystal City in Jefferson County, where it will add nearly 240 jobs.

The Irish firm (NYSE: JHX), which makes fiber cement and fiber gypsum building materials, said the facility will total 1 million square feet. State officials said the plant would be located at 900 Airport Road, which property records say is owned by JeffCo Port Development Inc., whose president is James Kennedy.

The state of Missouri said James Hardie will be able to tap into tax subsidies from the Missouri Works program, which allows retention of the state withholding tax for new jobs or state tax credits that are refundable, transferable and sellable.
