BALTIMORE -- Rental scooters are finding their way from the streets of Baltimore to the floor of Inner Harbor.

The transition from a two-wheel freedom machine to a makeshift barrier reef causes damage to the scooters.

Department of Transportation officials say that they have hauled dozens of scooters from the Inner Harbor this week alone.

Scooters in our Harbor is something we don't like.



Sadly, the dive team had disruptions during COVID (just like everywhere else), so this haul was overdue.
