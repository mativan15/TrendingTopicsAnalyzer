Amid growing confrontation between Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the state, Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann Wednesday shot off a letter to Purohit asking him not to indulge in a 'proxy war' and asked him not to interfere in the functioning of the government.
In his letter to Purohit, Mann said that the appointment of Dr S S Gosal as the Vice Chancellor of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was not 'illegal' and it was done by the PAU board.
He added that PAU's board of management was responsible for appointing VCs for the university.
