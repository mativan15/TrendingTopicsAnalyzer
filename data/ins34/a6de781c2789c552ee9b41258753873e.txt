I recently interviewed at one of the biggest tech companies in the world. It was one of the rare times where the hiring manager came to me. Though this company is ubiquitous in my life, I'd never considered working there. In fact, I'd been so focused on the vision of where I wanted to be that I unconsciously delayed responding. When I did, I learned the position was still open and we set up an interview.I didn't think the first interview went particularly well but I made it to the second round. As I prepared, it became clear that landing this job would open doors and offer job security.
