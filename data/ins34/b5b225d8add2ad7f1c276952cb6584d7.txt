In the bid to become B.C.'s next premier, former cabinet minister David Eby is being challenged by climate activist Anjali Appadurai – and a new poll sheds some light on how the contest could play out. A Research Co. survey of 800 British Columbians suggests Appadurai has a lot of work to do to convince British Columbians to choose her over a party stalwart. Of those asked, 30 per cent approved of Eby, while just 12 per cent approved of Appadurai. Among just NDP voters, that gap grows to 42 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
