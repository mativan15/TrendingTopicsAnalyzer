Eleven months after 301 coal miners died in Turkey, managers and inspectors are standing trial for negligence. But families have criticized the government for shielding state institutions tasked with worker safety.

 Mining is a dangerous profession. Last year in Turkey, more than 300 miners were killed in separate incidents, causing anger and grief throughout the country and family members and rights advocates to ask hard questions of mine owners and government inspectors.
 The most deadly incident by far was May 13, 2014, when an explosion inside a coal mine in Soma in Turkey's Manisa province trapped - and ultimately killed - 301 miners.
