(Bloomberg) -- A plan by South Africa's largest drugs and personal-care products retailer to have a medicine dispensary in each of its stores is being helped by a pandemic-induced acceleration in the approval of licenses. Pharmacies and hospitals were a crucial part of South Africa's Covid-19 vaccination program. That, along with regulatory reforms this year, helped expedite the process of adding dispensaries, Clicks Group Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Bertina Engelbrecht said in an interview on Thursday.
