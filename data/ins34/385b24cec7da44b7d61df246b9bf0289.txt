Oct. 19—As darkness fell Tuesday evening in Riverfront Park, Coeur d'Alene's Sarah Thompson Moore flipped the lights on her new signature piece of public art.

LED lights emitted a soft glow, catching the aluminum panels of The Seeking Place and acting as a beacon for parkgoers on a hill just below the Pavilion.

"You spend this time coming up with something in your head, but then seeing it in the place that it was designed for, it's just really rewarding," Moore said.

Her piece was selected by the Spokane Park Board more than two years ago as the second public art structure to be paid for with some of the money raised by the $64 million in bonds for Riverfront Park's redevelopment.
