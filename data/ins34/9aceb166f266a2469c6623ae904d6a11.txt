Fitness startup Cult.fit is aiming for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 12-18 months as its core gym business has turned in an operating profit, a senior executive said. Cultfit's revenue had also grown more than 50% compared to pre-Covid-19 levels, Naresh Krishnaswamy, business head, told ET.

'The two businesses - our fitness and fitness products business - will lead the charge for Cult.fit over the next 12-18 months as we look towards turning completely profitable at an Ebitda level and as we look towards our IPO event in the next 12-18 months,' Krishnaswamy said.
