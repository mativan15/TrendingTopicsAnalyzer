JT BoschBy JT BoschOct 20, 2022If you were lucky enough to get one of the Limited Time Only Adult Happy Meals, the toy inside could be worth a lot of money. Someone is selling an un-opened set of 3 on eBay now and is looking for 300k! Now before you start bidding on this, just know that from everything I've seen, no one is actually paying that amount of money, they're just asking for it. But I wouldn't be surprised if someone did buy them because collectors with deep pockets like to spend money!
