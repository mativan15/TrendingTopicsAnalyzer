Whoopi Goldberg is taking issue with some of Meghan Markle's recent comments about her time on the game show Deal or No Deal.
 
On Wednesday's episode of The View, the Oscar-winning actress questioned what Markle, 41, recently revealed during her Archetypes podcast. In the episode that aired Tuesday, the Duchess of Sussex — then an aspiring actress — shared her experience as a "briefcase girl" on the NBC show, telling guest Paris Hilton she felt "objectified." Markle said she eventually left the show because of these feelings.
