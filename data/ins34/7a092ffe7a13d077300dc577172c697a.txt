Tether on Thursday added to its roster of stablecoins, launching its MXNT token pegged to Mexico's peso.

The token will initially be supported in the Ethereum, Tron and Polyong blockchains, the company said. MXNT is Tether's first foray into Latin America and joins the company's other pegged coins — USDT (U.S. dollar), EURT (euro), and CNHT (China's yuan).

Mexico is 'a prime location for the next Latin American crypto hub,' said Tether, noting a report from Triple A stating that 40% of Mexican companies are interested in adopting blockchain and crypto in some way.
