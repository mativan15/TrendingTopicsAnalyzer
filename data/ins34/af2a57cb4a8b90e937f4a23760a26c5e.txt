City law firm Clifford Chance will this week unveil its first ever "global wellbeing" chief as a battle for talent in the legal industry escalates.
The so-called magic circle firm, which last month raised wages for newly qualified solicitors in their mid-20s to £125,000, has hired Aon executive Charles Alberts to the new role.
Mr Alberts will be tasked with creating the law firm's first "global wellbeing strategy", a manifesto which sources said could shake-up everything from training, promotions and interviews to bonuses and perks.
