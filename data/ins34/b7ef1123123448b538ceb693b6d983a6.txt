Warchi/E+ via Getty Images California-based Parsons (NYSE:PSN) is an engineering, design, planning, and construction management services company split between two primary businesses - the Federal Solutions and Critical Infrastructure segments. Its recent deal to acquire Xator Corp for ~$400m (at a ~11x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2023 numbers) comes as a welcome surprise, adding a significant new revenue base to the Federal Solutions segment at a time when the company is beginning to inflect positively following several quarters of organic declines.
