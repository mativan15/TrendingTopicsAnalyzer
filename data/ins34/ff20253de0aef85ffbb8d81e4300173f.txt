While farmers' markets are typically considered sunny, summer events, the Downtown Windsor Farmers Market (DWFM) is extending its season to the end of the year. Effective Oct. 22 until Dec. 10, the market will be open from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., in an effort to accommodate the average 2,500 visitors it sees week after week. 'We're averaging over 40 vendors each week for the fall,' said Steve Green, manager of the market. 'Every week is a celebration of the market's success, which continues to see more and more visitors, more and more applause from residents, visitors and shopkeepers.
