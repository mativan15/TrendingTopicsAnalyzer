With Stadia's shutdown only months away, Bethesda is now offering free access to The Elder Scrolls Online on PC and Mac to all Stadia players. Players who own the title on Stadia only need to log in to their ESO account page and download the game, with no additional purchase required.
When Google announced that it was shutting down its cloud service, Stadia, fans had questions about what would happen to their progress in specific games like Destiny 2. Some developers have moved to port their games to other platforms in response to the confusion, but The Elder Scrolls Online will go a step further by making sure Stadia players won't lose any progress.
