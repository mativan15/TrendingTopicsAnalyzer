Rodrigo Santoro – Hector in 'Westworld,' Xerxes in '300'– leans forward in his chair during a Zoom interview almost touching the screen, such is his excitement. 'It's absolutely extraordinary, the accomplishment. What they did, what this man did. The mission seemed completely impossible.'

Santoro is talking about Ferdinand Magellan, whom he plays in Prime Video's 'Boundless,' directed by Simon West ('Con Air,' 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'), also starring Alvaro Morte, the Professor in 'Money Heist,' and ZDF Studios and RTVE's banner title at this year's Mipcom.
