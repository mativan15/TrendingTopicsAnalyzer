Pentagon officials said Thursday that Iranian troops are on the ground in Ukraine assisting Russian forces with drone strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure and other targets, marking a major escalation in Tehran ‘s involvement with the war and its close military partnership with the Kremlin.

The exact number of Iranian troops in Ukraine is unclear, but administration officials said they're stationed in Crimea, which Russia forcibly annexed in 2014 but which remains officially a part of Ukraine.

'We do assess that Iranians have been on the ground in Ukraine to assist Russia with the drone operations there,' Pentagon spokesman Air Force Brig Gen.
