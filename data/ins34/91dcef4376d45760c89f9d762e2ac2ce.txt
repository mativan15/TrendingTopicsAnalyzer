Do you want the bad news or the good news first when it comes to Social Security and Medicare?The trustees of the two giant federal programs—the cornerstone of America's retirement system for tens of millions—published their latest financial reports Thursday. The bad news is that the hole in Social Security's accounts grew another $600 billion last year, taking its total to $20.4 trillion and the total for the two programs to $25.3 trillion, the highest on record. That's the present value of the gap between the amount that Social Security and Medicare are expected to pay out over the next 75 years and the amount they are expected to bring in.
