Despite a steep drop in venture funding for crypto companies, some startups are still managing to secure fresh capital. Stardust, which provides developer tools for building blockchain-based games, said Tuesday that it raised $30 million in a funding round led by crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures.
Acrew Capital, Blockchain Capital and Distributed Global participated in the Series A round. Stardust declined to provide its valuation, but said that it was higher than in its previous funding round.
