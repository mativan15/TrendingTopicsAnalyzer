AgenciesIltija came into limelight in the aftermath of the Centre's August 5, 2019 decisions to revoke Jammu and Kashmir special status and bifurcate the state into Union territories.PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti's daughter Iltija Mufti will hold a fortnightly interactive session with people, the party has announced, a move which many viewed as an exercise before she takes the political plunge. The party on Friday posted a two-minute-video on its Twitter handle with the hashtag "#AapKiBaatIltijaKeSaat".
