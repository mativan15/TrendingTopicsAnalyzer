Colorado added 5,600 non-farm payroll jobs in September — down significantly from August but enough to keep the state's unemployment rate flat at 3.4%.

The state's labor force participation rate, which has been rising sharply enough that it caused the unemployment rate to grow in August, fell for the first time in a while in September, to 69.4%, as 2,800 people exited the labor force.

People may leave the labor force because of a variety of reasons — including retirement, out-of-state moves or giving up on trying to find a job — and Ryan Gedney, principal economist for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, said he was not surprised that labor-force participation may have plateaued, as it remains the second-highest percentage in the U.
