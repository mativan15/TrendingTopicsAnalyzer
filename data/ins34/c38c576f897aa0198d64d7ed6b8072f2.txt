Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Dow futures rose Wednesday morning, as Wall Street begins a new month of trading following a volatile May. Despite that turbulence, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 ultimately finished the month essentially flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.05% in May, its fourth negative month in five, as investors balance concerns about high inflation, the Federal Reserve's response to it and the pace of economic growth.
