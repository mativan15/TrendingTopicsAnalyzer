The world's largest skill championship has returned — and Samsung Electronics took its place as the Overall Event Presenter. The WorldSkills Competition 2022 Special Edition marked the 46th time the event has taken place and the fifth time Samsung has participated as an Overall Event Presenter. While the event was canceled last year due to the pandemic, this year, more than 1,000 competitors from 58 countries will participate in the competition, which will be held across 15 countries from September to November.
