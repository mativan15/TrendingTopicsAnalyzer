Given how often I point out when Fox News's Tucker Carlson says something false, it is fair to observe when he says something true. And on Thursday night, he did.

His show began in keeping with a now-familiar pattern for the network, energetically promoting a Republican facing a difficult fight in the upcoming midterm elections.
