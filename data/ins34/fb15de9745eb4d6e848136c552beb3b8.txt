The past sixty years of relative strategic nuclear stability were not without their concerns. Anti-ballistic missile deployments, both feared and actual, were a source of major concern both militarily and geopolitically, as was the advent of multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) for ICBMs. Two major issues for US strategic nuclear policy in the 1970s were the survivability of US Minuteman ICBMs and the overall viability of the US strategic nuclear deterrent, as the threats of Soviet multiple-warhead SS-18 and SS-19 ICBMs with increasing accuracy and Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) attacks posed plausible challenges to both the ICBM and bomber elements of US strategic nuclear forces.
