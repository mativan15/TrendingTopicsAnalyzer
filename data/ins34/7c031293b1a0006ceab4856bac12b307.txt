The buzz and hype have faded, but RECUR, a company that helps brands create and build communities around nonfungible tokens, is still building out its infrastructure and making future plans. According to a recent analysis by Dune Analytics, NFT trading volume has dropped 97% from its 2022 highs. Trading volume went from $17 billion in January to around $466 million in September, according to cumulative data from OpenSea, NFTX, LarvaLabs, LooksRare, SuperRare, Rarible, and Foundation. RECUR, which is blockchain-agnostic, launched in 2021 and raised $50 million in a Series A at a $333 million valuation last fall.
