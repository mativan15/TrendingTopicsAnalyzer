Punjab Police's claims of increased security, especially at checkpoints and sensitive locations, in the aftermath of the May 9 RPG attack on its Intelligence Wing headquarters seems to have failed to have the desired effect, with the street crime graph of Mohali continuing with its merry upward march.
According to details, at least 11 cases of snatchings have been recorded between May 10 and June 2 this year. Out of these 11 incidents, firearms were used in four cases, posing questions on the police's fresh and elaborate preventive security arrangements.
