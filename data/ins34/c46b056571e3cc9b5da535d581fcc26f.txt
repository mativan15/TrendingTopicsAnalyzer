R﻿alph Hasenhuttl says Armel Bella-Kotchap may require surgery after dislocating his shoulder in Sunday's draw at West Ham.T﻿he centre-back said on Instagram, external he was "all good" after being forced off in the first half against the Hammers, but Hasenhuttl is more cautious.H﻿e said: "It doesn't look good for Armel. He will definitely be out on Wednesday."I'm not so sure in what direction we are going - if we need surgery for him or if he will do without. I think he wants to try without, mobilising the shoulder and then coming back maybe in two or three weeks.
