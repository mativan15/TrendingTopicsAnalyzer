Each day the weather cooperates, Richard Dennis heads to a Citi Bike docking station, picks up a shared bike and begins a day of pedaling that will last about six hours, transferring bicycles from locations with too much supply to spots with too little. Since he started 'rebalancing' bikes nine months ago, he's racked up more than 15,000 rides, totaling 920 hours and 5,357 miles. It's also earned him up to $3,000 a month.

In cities where Lyft operates bikesharing programs like Citi Bike, the company has enlisted the help of 'Bike Angels' like Dennis to ensure an even distribution of bikes at its docks.
