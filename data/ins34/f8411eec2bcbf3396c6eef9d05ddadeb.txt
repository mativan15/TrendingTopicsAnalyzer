BOSTON (PRWEB) October 18, 2022 The U.S. economy is draining the fun out of life for many Americans hit by record levels of inflation, according to the American Consumer Credit Counseling (ACCC) Financial Health Index for the third quarter of 2022. While prices on some everyday necessities are becoming more affordable, many of those polled for ACCC's Q3 survey say they've had to eliminate simple luxuries such as after-work activities, certain premium food items, and long-distance travel. The analysis of household financial health and readiness by the national nonprofit American Consumer Credit Counseling indicates that more than 50 percent of respondents have either stopped dining out or buying high-end grocery items such as fine cuts of meat and premium seafood.
