Recently there has been a resurgence of movements across North America resisting anti-racist reforms such as the use of critical race theory in schools.These movements are often organized covertly, using social justice language and describing themselves as "anti-woke."Groups that oppose the teaching of critical race theory and 2SLGBTQ+ supports in schools often position themselves as truly or more accurately in favour of social justice by co-opting social justice language, alleging critical race theory discriminates against white people.
