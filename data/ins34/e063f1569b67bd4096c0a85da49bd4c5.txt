Regime change has been part of Iran's collective memory and triggered upheavals there. Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian's comments in an interview with American non-profit media organisation NPR that the protests would not lead to regime change highlighted the attempt to tap into the emotional import of the phrase.
Britain and the US smothered democracy in its infancy in Iran decades before they sought to import it to the region. In 1953, they removed democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh from power, setting off a chain reaction that led to the 1979 revolution and the state of play in Iran.
