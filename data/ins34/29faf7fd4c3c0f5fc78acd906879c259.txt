Appearing at a stormy session of prime minister's questions in Parliament, Truss repeated her apology for the disastrous fiscal program. But she insisted that she could continue to govern despite all the turmoil.'I had to take the decision because of the economic situation to adjust our policies,' Truss said, her obvious understatement drawing catcalls from opposition lawmakers and pained expressions from members of her own Conservative Party.It was a brutal ordeal for Truss in only her third appearance for such questioning as prime minister.
