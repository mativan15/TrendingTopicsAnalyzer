Jill Biden says she and President Biden rarely raise their voices in an argument — because they usually hammer out their quarrels via text messages.
The first couple coined a term for the way they bicker, 'fexting,' the first lady tells Harper's Bazaar in its June/July issue, released Tuesday.
The profile describes why she and the commander in chief first began 'hashing out their occasional spats over text,' saying the pair aimed to 'avoid fighting in front of the Secret Service.'
Jill Biden revealed that recently she let her fingers do the fighting in what the mag described as a 'fit of pique.
