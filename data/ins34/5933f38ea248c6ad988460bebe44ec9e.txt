PHOENIX (AP) — Donald Trump on Thursday endorsed investor Blake Masters in the crowded Republican Senate primary in Arizona, citing the candidate's strident support of Trump's lies about the 2020 election.The former president said in a statement that Masters is a 'great modern-day thinker' and that Masters' chief rival, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, has done nothing about the election fraud that Trump falsely claims cost him a second term.Republicans hope the winner of the Aug. 2 primary can unseat Sen.
