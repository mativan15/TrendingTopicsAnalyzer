By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:41 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 00:41 EDT, 21 October 2022 Penrith winger Charlie Staines has signed with Wests Tigers in a swap deal that allows utility Tyrone Peachey to return to the Panthers. An injury to Taylan May cleared the way for Staines to play in the Panthers' 2022 grand final win but the winger had fallen down the pecking order in the regular season and struggled for consistent game time. Staines had a year to run on his lucrative Penrith deal but with the emergence of youngster Sunia Turuva, his chances of locking down a full-time first-grade spot in 2023 appeared to be growing even slimmer.
