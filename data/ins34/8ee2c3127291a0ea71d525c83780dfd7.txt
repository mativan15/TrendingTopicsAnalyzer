Dame Judi Dench is calling for a change to The Crown.
 
The Oscar-winning actress said in a letter to The Times published Wednesday that Netflix should add a disclaimer to the royal drama, which returns for its fifth season next month, advertising itself as a "fictionalized drama."
 
"The closer the drama comes to our present times, the more freely it seems willing to blur the lines between historical accuracy and crude sensationalism," Dench, 87, said.
 
"Given some of the wounding suggestions apparently contained in the new series — that King Charles plotted for his mother to abdicate, for example, or once suggested his mother's parenting was so deficient that she might have deserved a jail sentence — this is both cruelly unjust to the individuals and damaging to the institution they represent," Dench continued.
