A recent survey of Gen Z and millennials around the world has found that many young people are deeply concerned with their financial futures. The survey, conducted by Deloitte between November 2021 and January 2022, included responses from more than 14,000 Gen Z members (defined as those born between 1995 and 2003) and 8,400 millennials (bon between 1983 and 1994). Of the respondents, 46 per cent of Gen Zs and 47 per cent of millennials said that they live paycheque-to-paycheque and are regularly worried that they won't be able to cover expenses.
