Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Credit Suisse has downgraded Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock to Neutral from Outperform as the bank's transformation process limits its upside relative to its peers. On the flip side, downside may also be limited "given a valuation within reach of prior cyclical troughs." Earnings visibility remains compromised by higher levels of investment to support infrastructure transformation and organic growth, limited near-term capital return capacity, and the pace of market exits, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note to clients.
