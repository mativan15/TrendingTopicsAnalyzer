New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced plans to review the Government's Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) which caps tarrifs.The Prime Minister in September said ordinary households will pay no more than £2,500 for gas and electric annually for the next two years. The amount is more than £1,000 less than the £3,549 average bills would have risen to on October 1 without Government intervention, and comes on top of the £400 energy discount. However, Mr Hunt on Monday said the EPG would be reviewed and changed in April 2023, meaning payments could increase next year for many families.
