Arthur Lee Cofield Jr., the 31-year-old inmate, stole $11 million from Kimmel's bank account by convincing customer service reps at Charles Schwab that he was the 94-year-old billionaire. Cofield then wired his stolen funds to a company in Idaho, exchanged it for one-ounce gold coins, chartered a private plane to fly those coins to Atlanta and then bought a $4.4 million house with the help of two accomplices. Kimmel, worth an estimated $1.5 billion, was not the only billionaire targeted by Cofield, according to prosecutors.
