The post-Graham Potter era at Brighton just cannot get going.

Make that just two points from four games under Potter's replacement, Roberto De Zerbi, after a lackluster 0-0 draw at home with lowly Nottingham Forest that prompted some jeers from Brighton fans at the full-time whistle.

For a supposedly attack-minded manager, De Zerbi is struggling to make his team dangerous going forward.

Since the 3-3 draw in the Italian's first match in charge — at Liverpool, no less — Brighton has played three games, had 54 shots and failed to score a goal.
