Playing videogames could trigger a potentially fatal cardiac episode in children with existing heart conditions, according to an international study published this week. The study, "Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death during electronic gaming," examined 22 incidents in which children between the ages of seven and 16 experienced an irregular heartbeat, either proven or suspected, and lost consciousness while playing videogames. Six of the children suffered cardiac arrest, and four died.
