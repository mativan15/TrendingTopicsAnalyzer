Earlier this week, Amazon decided to let shoppers in on discounts similar to July's Prime Day, which offered impressive deals across pretty much every category. Although the Prime Early Access Sale has since come to a close, you can still score amazing savings at a number of places this weekend.
 
Whether you're looking to stock up on new beauty or upgrade your winter wardrobe, you can save up to 42 percent at popular sites like Madewell, Abrecrombie, Tula, and Ulta Beauty. Or perhaps you want to get ahead of holiday shopping this year? Early Black Friday deals at Target include up to 50 percent off kitchen, electronics, and toys.
