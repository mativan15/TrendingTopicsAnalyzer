A pro-democracy protester who appeared to be beaten up by men from China's consulate in Manchester has condemned the attack as 'barbaric' and backed calls for the UK government to expel any Chinese officials involved.Speaking for the first time since the incident, which was captured on video, Bob Chan said: 'I'm shocked and hurt by this unprovoked attack,' adding he had been taking part in a 'peaceful protest'.He said he had bruises on his eye, neck and back and had nightmares about possible repercussions against his family.
