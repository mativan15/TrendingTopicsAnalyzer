PTIAkal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh without security coverAkal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh Friday declined the Centre's offer of 'Z' category security to him, saying it would have hindered his interaction with the public for propagating the Sikh religion. He, however, thanked the government for its offer earlier in the day. "I respect the sentiments of the Centre." His statement came after the Union Home Ministry granted him 'Z' category security. Akal Takht is the highest temporal seat of Sikhs, and Jathedar is its appointed head.
