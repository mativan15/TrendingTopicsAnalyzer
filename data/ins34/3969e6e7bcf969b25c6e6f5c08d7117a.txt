With the jury continuing its deliberations in the Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard defamation trial on Tuesday, supporters for both Depp and Heard are waiting to see which side will prevail in the high-profile trial and what monetary award, if any, the jury will decide on.Depp sued his ex-wife Heard for $50 million for defaming him in an op-ed she wrote in 2018 for The Washington Post, in which she alleged—without naming Depp—that she was a victim of domestic and sexual abuse. Heard countersued Depp for $100 million for nuisance, claims that are now being deliberated by the seven-person civil jury.
