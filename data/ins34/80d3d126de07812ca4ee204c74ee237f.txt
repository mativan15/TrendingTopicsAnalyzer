LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - British companies expect barely any growth over the next three months, in their gloomiest outlook since February last year, as the cost-of-living squeeze reduces households' disposable income, the Confederation of British Industry said on Wednesday.The CBI said the expectations element of its surveys of manufacturers, retailers and other services industries fell to +1%, indicating a 1 percentage point difference between the proportion of firms expecting growth rather than contraction.
