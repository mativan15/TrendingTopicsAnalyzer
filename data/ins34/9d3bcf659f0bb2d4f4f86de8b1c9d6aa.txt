(Bloomberg) -- Grandparents who want to help pay for grandkids' college costs are getting more bang for their buck.  Recent changes to financial aid rules mean they'll soon be able to contribute to 529 college savings plans that they own without penalizing their grandchild's eligibility for federal money, a limitation that's made some grandparents think twice before opening new accounts or adding to existing ones.  'The fear that a grandparent helping their grandchild by using their own 529 plan would interfere with them getting financial aid, that worry is gone now with the new rules,' said Stuart Siegel, president of college financial-aid service FAFSAssist.
