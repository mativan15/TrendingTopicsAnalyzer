DKosig Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) offers a data analytics platform that has traditionally been targeted at citizen data scientists. The stock has performed poorly over the past few years, driven by the combination of Alteryx's slow shift to the cloud and the demise of the ETL paradigm. Alteryx's recent product innovation and acquisitions better position the company for the future, and the company's revamped sales strategy appears to be working. Relative to peers, the stock no longer appears as cheap as it once did due to the large pullback in software stocks.
