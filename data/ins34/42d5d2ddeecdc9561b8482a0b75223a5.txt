Some pop culture moments, as they age, feel more and more like bouts of collective madness. Why did everyone hate Anne Hathaway all of those years ago? Around 2013, despite winning a slew of awards for her role in 'Les Miserables,' it seemed the actress couldn't catch a break. Despite a lack of scandal or outright offensive behavior, she was ' the star we love to loathe,' ' the bad kind of theater kid,' ' the kind of person who inexplicably bugs people.'

Since then, the criticism has all but faded from public consciousness, a half-remembered Hollywood fever dream akin to the time everyone ragged on Taylor Swift for writing about her exes or that one 2009 concert when everyone called a perfectly normal-looking Jessica Simpson fat.
