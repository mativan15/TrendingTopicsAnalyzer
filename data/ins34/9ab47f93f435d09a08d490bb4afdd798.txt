The month of June is National Indigenous History Month – a time to reflect upon and celebrate the rich history of Indigenous Peoples in Canada, but also a time to learn and confront a sometimes difficult past.
Janice Hill, an associate vice principal of Indigenous initiatives and reconciliation at Queen's University, she says the month is a time to highlight Indigenous figures and culture, but it's also a time to confront demons of years gone by.'Sometimes I think it's important for people to learn about the history and the trauma in order to be able to understand some of the challenges that we face these days,' Hill said.
