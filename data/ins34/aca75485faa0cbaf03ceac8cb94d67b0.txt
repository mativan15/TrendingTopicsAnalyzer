Europe needs to find a common response to the multiple crises it faces as it did in the COVID-19 pandemic, Antonio Costa told Euronews.

The Portuguese prime minister spoke on the sidelines of a congress of European socialists over the weekend.

"When we tackled COVID, we came together. We gave a common response and that helped us to overcome this crisis," said Costa.

"So we need to learn the right lessons and do now what we did when we needed to beat the virus and now we must do it to build peace.
