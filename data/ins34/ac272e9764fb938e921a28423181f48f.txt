It came as it emerged that Tory MPs in the party's Red Wall seats had been put on alert for an early general election next autumn.
David Canzini, Mr Johnson's deputy chief of staff, told 60 Tory MPs at an awayday in Leicestershire 'to be general election-ready by autumn 2023', sources told The Telegraph.
Oliver Dowden, the party chairman, also told the MPs he had set up a new Liberal Democrat attack unit to take on the threat from Sir Ed Davey's party in the South West.
Separately it emerged that Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, is drawing up plans for a second windfall tax on energy companies to ease the cost-of-living crisis for families.
