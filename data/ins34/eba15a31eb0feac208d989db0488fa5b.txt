THE SHOW | AMC's 61st Street

THE EPISODE | 'Man on Fire' (May 29, 2022)

THE PERFORMANCE | If Vance is going to do one thing, it's deliver a monologue as though his life depended on it, and he did just that this week in 61st Street's season finale. With Moses Johnson's (Tosin Cole) future hanging in the balance, Vance's Franklin Roberts defended the promising track star in an emotionally charged trial over the death of a police officer, and it was a masterclass on acting.
