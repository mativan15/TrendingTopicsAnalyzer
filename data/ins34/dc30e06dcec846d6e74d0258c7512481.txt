May 27—ANDERSON — Two years ago, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that scuttled the summer travel plans of thousands of Hoosiers.

Now, it's gas prices and inflation, according to a recent survey commissioned by the American Hotel & Lodging Association.

Even though the Memorial Day weekend marks the traditional start of summer travel season, Americans are rethinking those plans in a variety of ways.

The AHLA survey found that, although nearly seven in 10 Americans say they're likely to travel this summer, majorities report they're likely to take fewer leisure trips (57%) and shorter trips (54%) due to current gas prices.
