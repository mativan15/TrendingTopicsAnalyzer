The 39th CHEO Telethon was the biggest one yet, as residents, businesses and organizations in Ottawa, eastern Ontario and western Quebec came together to raise a record amount of money to make a difference at CHEO. The CHEO Telethon wrapped up Sunday evening with $11.8 million raised to support life-saving treatment, state-of-the-art medical equipment and research at Ottawa's children's hospital. CHEO President and CEO Alex Munter says the record amount of money comes as CHEO sees record demand for care.
