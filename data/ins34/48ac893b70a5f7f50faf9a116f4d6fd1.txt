Transfer news - LIVE!

We are edging closer to the official opening of the transfer window and rumours are already starting to pick up.

Romelu Lukaku is reportedly willing to take a significant pay-cut in order to seal a return to Inter Milan after his nightmare season back at Chelsea, although it is still unclear as to whether or not the Italian giants can afford a deal.

Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, has dropped a major hint over his Manchester United future by hailing Erik Ten Hag and calling for patience with the new manager as he begins yet another rebuild at Old Trafford.
