India's net profit increased 21% to 1,848 crore in the quarter ended September 2022 from 1,526 crore a year ago, riding on strong loan growth despite a fall in other income. Total advances increased 22% year-on-year with a 15% growth in retail, agriculture and MSME segments and a 22% growth in corporate loans led by segments like infrastructure, iron and steel, chemicals and NBFCs. As a result, net interest income (NII) grew 22% to 8,305 crore . CEO A Manimekhalai said the bank continues to maintain a conservative 10% to 12% credit growth target for the current fiscal year despite the strong growth in the second quarter.
