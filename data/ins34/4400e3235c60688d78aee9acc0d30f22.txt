Dealers in the global hub of the trade in diamonds claim EU rules against money laundering are being used to discriminate against them. Around two-thirds of them have had their US dollar accounts frozen by their banks.

Antwerp is the world capital of diamonds with more than 3,500 brokers, merchants and diamond cutters working there 
Enraged diamond traders in Antwerp say they are considering launching a group case to try to ensure access to their US dollar accounts.
The northern Belgian city is the global hub for the precious stones but EU money laundering rules implemented since 2016 have seen around two-thirds of the city's 1,600 diamond traders excluded from accessing the money they hold in US dollars in banks.
