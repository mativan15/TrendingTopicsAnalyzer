He tormented the Sparks for years, now Curt Miller will try to rebuild the downtrodden franchise.

The former Connecticut Sun head coach will take the same position with the Sparks, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who is not authorized to speak publicly. The two-time WNBA coach of the year led the Sun to two WNBA Finals appearances in the last four years, including last season, when the Sun lost to the Las Vegas Aces.

Miller, who doubled as the Sun's general manager and was the league's executive of the year in 2017, will take over a Sparks franchise that has missed the postseason for two consecutive seasons.
