Friction can create frustration at any moment. The sensitive Moon squares communicative Mercury, potentially inciting a war between our heads and our hearts. The confident Sun then clashes with intuitive Neptune at 11:39 am EDT -- we may see this create overly idealistic visions of the future. Grandiosity could lead to disappointment if we don't consciously manage our expectations. Finally, the Moon squares wounded healer Chiron, evoking more inner restlessness and frustration. It's okay to take a deep breath and try again later.
