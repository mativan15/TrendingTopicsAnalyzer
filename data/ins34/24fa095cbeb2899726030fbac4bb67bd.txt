Euro vs US Dollar Technical Analysis

The Euro has gone back and forth during the trading session on Wednesday as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior. At this juncture, if the market were to rally, it's likely that the 1.08 level above is an area that I would anticipate seeing a significant amount of resistance in, and therefore I would be very cautious about buying the Euro currently.

On the downside, if the market were to break down below the lows of the Tuesday session, then I believe that the Euro will continue to fall.
