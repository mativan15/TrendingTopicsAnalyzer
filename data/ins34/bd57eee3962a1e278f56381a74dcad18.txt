A Calgary consumer is questioning why he wasn't able to return what he says was a faulty glucose monitoring device at a local pharmacy.
John Haggerty recently went to a Shoppers Drug Mart location to get some supplies he needed to check his blood sugar following a hospital stay. He said after talking to the pharmacy representative, he was sold on a FreeStyle Libre System.'It sounded like a great option for me,' he told Global News. 'So I purchased it for about $170.'But Haggerty said when he tried it out at home, he continuously got an error message.
