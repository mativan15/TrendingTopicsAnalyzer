As the Cleveland Browns look to right the ship against the Baltimore Ravens, they will have to get healthy in a hurry. On Wednesday's injury report, the Browns were missing eight players from practice, seven of which are starters on this football team.
A few of the names on the list are scheduled rest days, however, as wide receiver Amari Cooper and guard Joel Bitonio got a day off. While Jack Conklin and Myles Garrett left the game early against the Patriots, neither was in the postgame notes, meaning the Browns are likely just being cautious with them as well.
