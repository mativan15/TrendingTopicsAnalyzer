UK consumer confidence remained near 50-year lows, rising slightly in October as Britain contends with soaring food, energy and mortgage costs and political chaos.

According to GfK's consumer confidence barometer, the index was up two points but continues to languish at an overall score of -47, from the minus 49 the previous month.

This month's reading was only marginally better than September, which marked the lowest level since records began in 1974 as the cost of living surged.
