Generac Power Systems stock plunged after the company announced its revenue and earnings would fall short of previous projections in part because of a $55 million charge likely related to the bankruptcy of former customer Pink Energy.

Generac said Wednesday the other significant cause of lower earnings and less-than-expected revenue growth was a continuing challenge of consumers ordering more home standby generators than the pace at which dealers and independent contractors can complete installations.
