Incoming Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag has earmarked the Uruguayan as a possible striker signing ahead of the summer window but might now need to look elsewhere. Nunez has attracted attention from all of Europe's top clubs with his outstanding form for Benfica. He finished the Portuguese league season with an excellent record of 26 goals in 28 appearances, and struck six times in the Champions League.
