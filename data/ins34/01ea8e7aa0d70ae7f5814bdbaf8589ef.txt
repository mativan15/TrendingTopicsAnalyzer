Just over a month since pledging to "deliver, deliver, deliver!" on the steps of Downing Street, today Liz Truss's political career came to a screeching end. She did deliver: a premiership characterised by chaotic U-turns and infighting, and what is likely the shortest tenure as PM in British history.
Critics believe she was never cut out for the job, even as they praised the steely determination and political skill that led her to Number 10. But her meteoric rise through the party ended almost as quickly as it started.
