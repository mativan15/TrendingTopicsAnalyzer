David Moyes says he understands West Ham fans' frustrations after his decision to withdraw top scorer Gianluca Scamacca in yesterday's 1-1 draw with Southampton was jeered by the away end.Summer signing Scamacca has been in fine form over recent weeks, scoring in back-to-back Premier League games heading into Sunday's contest at St Mary's and with six goals in all competitions so far this term.The Italian was the Hammers' biggest threat throughout much of the game against Southampton, managing seven shots in all and teeing up perhaps the best chance with a fine delivery for Lucas Paqueta, who could only head wide.
