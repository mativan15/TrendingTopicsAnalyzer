gorodenkoff/iStock via Getty Images Visa (NYSE:V) has partnered with business-to-business payments firm Thunes on Wednesday to help individuals and small business move money globally to 78 digital wallet providers. That enables Visa Direct to reach almost 7B endpoints, including over 3B cards, 2B+ accounts and 1.5B digital wallets. Generally, consumers don't need to have a card or account to load or receive funds directly to their digital wallet, paving the way for greater access to financial products, especially for underserved populations.
