Earlier this month, Lebanon's president announced that his country would soon begin sending Syrian refugees back across the border. Lebanon hosts between 1 and 2 million Syrian refugees and last summer, Lebanese authorities said they were ready to repatriate Syrians in groups of around 15,000 every month, in cooperation with the Syrian government. "The completion of this agreement will begin from next week, with the start of returning displaced Syrians to their country in batches," Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Twitter last week.
