Becoming a billionaire means caring a lot about making money, right?

Wrong, says Mark Cuban.

As Cuban built the tech companies in the 1990s that would eventually make him exorbitantly wealthy, he never prioritized personal riches, he told GQ on Wednesday. "I never, ever thought in terms of money," he said.

Instead, Cuban said his "driving motivation" was something else entirely. "I always thought in terms of time," he said. "That's always been my driving motivation: How can I control my own destiny? How can I control my own time?"

A 2018 Harvard Business School study found that placing a higher value on your own time over money typically results in greater overall wellbeing and increased happiness.
