Fox Business Network launched on October 15, 2007 as America was on the precipice of a financial crisis, and a unique approach to covering business news that prioritizes Main Street as much as Wall Street has helped the network thrive as it celebrates its 15th anniversary on Saturday. "Fox Business is, in my opinion, a living television miracle, and I'm not being overly dramatic here. I truly mean it because we have so many moments that we can remember, especially all of the originals, where we were just flying by the seat of our pants," longtime anchor Liz Claman told Fox News DigitalShe explained that FBN "went up in the air like an airplane, but we were still riveting the wings on," so Claman and other original hosts weren't exactly ready.
