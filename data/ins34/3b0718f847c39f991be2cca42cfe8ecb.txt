One of the Denver metro area's most expensive properties for sale — advertised as a "once-in-a-lifetime estate" — will soon be coming off the market after a year.

Located at multiple addresses, including 5280 S. University Blvd., the eclectic Greenwood Village property was listed in late September 2021 with an asking price of $21 million.

Listing agent Sandye Whitaker of Engel & Völkers Denver told Denver Business Journal that while the property had more than 20 showings and multiple interested parties over the past 12 months, it will be removed from the multiple listing service "any day now.
