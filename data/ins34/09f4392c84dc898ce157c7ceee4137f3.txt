SHARBOT LAKE, ONT. - A Sharbot Lake, Ont. woman is hitting the road, cycling on a 1,000 kilometre journey to raise money for pancreatic cancer research. It is a cause that's close to her heart after the disease took her mother just last year. Every time Mia Craig prepares her bike and puts on her helmet, she knows what her inspiration is. "My mom was Marina Mauri-Morsani, she was my best friend," she says getting emotional. The avid cyclist says it's one of the places she can feel closest to her mother, after losing her in April of last year to pancreatic cancer.
