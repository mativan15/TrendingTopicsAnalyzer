 Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the Arvind Kejriwal-led party wanted Delhi to be 'AAP Nirbhar' while the BJP wanted the national capital to be Atmanirbhar, and asked the people to choose between the two in the MCD elections. At the launch of a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Tehkhand here, Mr. Shah also accused the Kejriwal government of step-motherly treatment to the erstwhile three civic bodies and said it owed ₹40,000 crore to the municipal corporations.
