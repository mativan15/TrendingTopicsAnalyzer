The student loan forgiveness application officially opened on Monday at studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application, powered by the Education Department (ED). This is the only site where borrowers can sign up for student loan forgiveness.

The official launch of the application portal follows a beta test that offered borrowers periodic access over the weekend.

"This is a game-changer for millions of Americans," President Joe Biden said Monday at a press briefing with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona.
