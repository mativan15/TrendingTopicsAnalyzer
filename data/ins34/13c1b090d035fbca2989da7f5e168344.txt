The closure of two Wawa locations in the center of Philadelphia this week is the latest in a string of retail closures nationwide due to a rise in 'shrink', or retail theft.

'Despite reducing hours and investing in additional operational measures, continued safety and security challenges and business factors have made it increasingly difficult to remain open in these two locations,' Wawa spokesperson Lori Bruce told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Wawa started in the Philadelphia area, and is emblematic of the region both to residents and outsiders.
