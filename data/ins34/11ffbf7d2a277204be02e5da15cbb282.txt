World Games and Youth Olympic Games breaking medallists were among those to have progressed on Friday (21 October) to the Top 32 round at the WDSF World Breaking Championships in Seoul, South Korea.On the b-boys side, defending world champion Victor (USA), fellow American Jeffro, and Shigekix of Japan are all safely through. Shigekix, who also won the bronze medal at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires where breaking made its debut, finished the Top 64 round in second place.Last year's runner-up to Victor, Canada's b-boy Phil Wizard, is right behind having made it as the third-ranked breaker to reach the Top 32.
