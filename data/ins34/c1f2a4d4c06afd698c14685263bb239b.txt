Lifetime loan provider Spry Finance plans to more than double its lending over the next three years.The group, which specialises in lending to people over the age of 60, says it expects to be writing €150 million a year by 2025. It is currently the only lender in that sector of the market.The company has lent about €60 million to about 750 people since returning to the Irish market at the start of last year and says it currently has 3,000 customers in total on its books.Spry recently agreed a long-term funding arrangement with Canada Life Reinsurance which will refinance its existing loan book and provide funding for future lending, allowing it to meet what it says is growing demand for its product.
