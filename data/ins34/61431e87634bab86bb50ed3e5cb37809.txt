Ben Elton is reviving Friday Night Live for a one-off special tonight on Channel 4, featuring a special guest appearance from Harry Enfield.
The comedian, 63, will be bringing back the beloved stand-up and entertainment show as part of the celebrations for Channel 4's 40th anniversary. 
Rosie Jones, Julian Clary, and Jo Brand will also appear on the bill as part of the star-studded line-up at 9pm. 
In its original run, Elton hosted the series and featured the likes of Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and, of course, Harry Enfield as part of his comedy team.
