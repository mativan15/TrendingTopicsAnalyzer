China's aircraft carriers will be able to use hypersonic weapons traditionally launched from aircraft thanks to advancements in logistics technology that simplify and speed up the repair and maintenance of the weapons, according to People's Liberation Army(PLA) researchers.

China's air-launched hypersonic missiles, the specifics of which were not disclosed by the research team, have similarities to Russia's Kinzhal missile, which can reach 10 times the speed of sound over a range of 1,000km (621 miles), the research team wrote in a paper published in the Chinese peer-reviewed journal Aero Weaponry on October 1.
