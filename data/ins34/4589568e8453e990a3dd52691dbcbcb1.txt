A young lady told me that her boyfriend had broken off with her. She blames herself for all her broken relationships. She feels depressed and lonely. She constantly yearns for the acceptance of those who abandoned her. She says if they apologize to her or accept her, she will feel happy. However, her wishes are futile since she cannot control what they say or do. A young man is unhappy because he did not get the promotion, another man is anxious because he wants a large fan base on his social media…
The whole world today is in search for happiness.
