Dave Clark, Amazon's CEO of Worldwide Consumer, is resigning from the ecommerce powerhouse after 23 years.
He will leave Amazon effective July 1, 2022. Clark is the highest-profile executive departure for the company since Andy Jassy took over as CEO in July 2021, when founder Jeff Bezos relinquished the reins.
Clark, in announcing his departure Friday on Twitter, wrote, 'I've had an incredible time at Amazon but it's time for me to build again. It's what drives me. To all I've had the honor of working with: thank you for making it so much fun to come to work every day for 23 years to invent cool, amazing things for customers.
