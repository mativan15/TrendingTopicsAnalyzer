With the electric power grid stressed out in many parts of this country, it is usually wise to own a home backup generator. Also, the historic Texas winter storm in February 2021 brought home generators to a new level of importance. The leader in this industry is Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). The company manufactures and sells power generation equipment, energy storage systems and other power products for the residential, light commercial and industrial markets worldwide.





It also sells related accessories such as engines, alternators, batteries, electronic controls, steel enclosures and other components.
