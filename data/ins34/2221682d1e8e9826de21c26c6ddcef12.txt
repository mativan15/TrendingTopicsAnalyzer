Packers receiver Randall Cobb feared his season was done Sunday when he injured his left ankle. He rode the cart to the training room with a towel on his head and with tears in his eyes.

An MRI, though, revealed a high-ankle sprain.

Cobb said he expects to return in 2-6 weeks.

'I felt something pop,' Cobb said, via Rob Demovsky of ESPN. 'And I thought, ‘This is the way it ends.' It's nice to have the good news and to know that I'll be able to come back.
