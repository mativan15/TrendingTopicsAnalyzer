Ronald Martinez AT&T (NYSE:T) submitted a much better than expected earnings sheet for the third quarter that included better revenue and earnings per-share than projected and strong net additions in the booming 5G and fiber businesses. For those reasons, shares of AT&T soared 8% yesterday. Additionally, the company generated $3.8B in free cash flow in the third quarter which is more than enough to cover the dividend which costs AT&T approximately $2.0B a quarter. Since AT&T did not cut its free cash flow guidance for FY 2022, I believe AT&T continues to represent deep value for dividend investors! AT&T crushed expectations for its third quarter AT&T submitted a strong earnings report yesterday that saw the telecom beating Wall Street's expectations both on the top and the bottom line.
