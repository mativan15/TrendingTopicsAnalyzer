Manitoba's Opposition New Democrats are gathering this weekend in Winnipeg with the party riding high in opinion polls and an election one year away.Leader Wab Kinew told 190 delegates Friday night that the NDP raised a modern-day record amount of money last year. The party has also nominated candidates for the election slated for next October in more than half of the province's 57 constituencies.'There's a lot of speculation about an early election. We'll be ready to go whenever the writ is dropped,' Kinew said to applause.
