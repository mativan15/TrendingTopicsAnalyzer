GREEN BAY, Wisc. — The Jets pulled off a stunning 27-10 victory over the Packers at Lambeau Field on Sunday. Here are some thoughts and observations from the game:
1. The Jets have found an identity. Over the last two weeks, this team has gone back to the days of Ground and Pound. They are relying on a dominant defense and a strong running game to beat up their opponents, wearing them down and then pulling away in the second half.
In many ways it is reminiscent of Rex Ryan and the 2009 Jets. They seem to be operating around their quarterback.
