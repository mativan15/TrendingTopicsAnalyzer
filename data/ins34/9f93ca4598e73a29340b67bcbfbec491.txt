Sameer Wankhede

MUMBAI: Controversial IRS officer Sameer Wankhede appears to be in trouble as the NCB on Friday gave the clean chit to Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, in the drugs case related to the October 2021 cruise ship raid led by him as the agency's Mumbai zonal director.

NCP minister Nawab Malik was the first to claim that the raid was fake and an attempt to extort money from leading film stars. Then it was also alleged that even the panchas-five witnesses during raids-brought by the NCB were fake and had criminal backgrounds.
