Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Indian economy will stay on course and is projected to grow at 7% in the current fiscal year backed by key structural reforms. The government is taking initiatives to ensure revival while pursuing inflation management, she said in her address at the plenary session of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC. She is in the US for the annual IMF-World Bank meetings. 'Despite global headwinds, the Indian economy will stay on course and is projected to grow at 7%,' she was cited as saying in a press release, adding that this was an outcome of the conducive domestic policy environment and the government's focus on key structural reforms to boost growth.
