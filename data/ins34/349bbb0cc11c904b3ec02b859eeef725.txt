The Punjab government hasn't taken a call on its next step after governor Banwari Lal Purohit on Tuesday raised objection on the appointment of Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor Satbir Singh Gosal. State government officials say the appointment has been made as per the laid procedure and there is no scope to take a look back, but the government still would take a legal opinion and ponder on the issues raised by the governor. 'As far as we are concerned, the appointment (of the vice- chancellor) was done as per the laid norms and procedure and there is no violation of the act governing the agricultural university,' said a senior officer of the state government on the request of anonymity.
