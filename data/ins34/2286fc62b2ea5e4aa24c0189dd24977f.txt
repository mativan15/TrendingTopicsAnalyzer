A lengthy stretch of 0% APR can help you pay down your debt while accruing no new interest.Balance transfer credit cards help shift your debt from one or more high-interest credit cards to a new consolidated credit card account that will let you pay down your debt more easily. Most intro APR periods for balance transfer credit cards run from 12 to 21 months, giving you some breathing room to chip away at your debt until the standard variable interest rate kicks in.
