Feverpitched/iStock via Getty Images Builders FirstSource (NYSE:BLDR) is a supplier of building materials (lumber and manufactured components) to homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers. Examples of its products include lumber & lumber sheet goods, wood floor and roof trusses, wall panels, windows, doors, wallboard, exterior trim, etc. My rationale for shorting BLDR is that it is a 'leveraged' play on the housing market and new construction. As with homebuilders, when the market is hot BLDR's revenues and margins soar.
