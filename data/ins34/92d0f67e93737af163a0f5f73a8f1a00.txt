The court has heard evidence of that political pressure, and just this week the former boss of both accused and complainant, Senator Linda Reynolds, was accused by the prosecution of trying to 'coach' the defence by suggesting a line of questioning to defence barrister Steven Whybrow.In media terms, there was no better story than Brittany Higgins' alleged assault - a post-#metoo chronicle in which sexual crime, politics, cover up and scandal all intersected.Publishers wanted it too. Lehrmann's defence barrister has led evidence about the large $325,000 advance Higgins negotiated via Peter FitzSimons to write a book about her story (although, as Higgins told Whybrow during her cross-examination, to her, it is not a story, 'it is my experience').
