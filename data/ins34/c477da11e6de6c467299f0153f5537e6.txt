The Enforcement Directorate (ED) Friday attached seven immovable assets of gangster-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari in connection with a money laundering case against him and his family. The properties, provisionally attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, are worth Rs 1.48 crore (registry value) while their circle rate at the time of registration was Rs 3.42 crore.
Ansari, a former BSP leader, was booked by the agency last year for alleged money laundering on the basis of multiple cases registered by UP police related to land-grabbing and illegal businesses operated by him and his gang members.
