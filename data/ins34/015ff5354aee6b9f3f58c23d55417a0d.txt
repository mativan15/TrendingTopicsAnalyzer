Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open mixed Thursday, as investors digested quarterly corporate earnings amid continued political and economic uncertainty.

At 02:10 ET (06:10 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%.

The political confusion in the U.K. continues after the abrupt resignation of Home Secretary Suella Braverman late Wednesday, adding to the continued erosion of Prime Minister Liz Truss's authority.
