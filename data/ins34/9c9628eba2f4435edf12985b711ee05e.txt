NEWCASTLE have been told to splash out £50million if they want to sign Nathan Ake from Manchester City.
Eddie Howe wanted the centre-back in January and has identified him as a transfer target once again this summer.

The Toon boss has made a second inquiry about Ake after City gave him short shrift when he first asked in January.
The Dutch defender obviously knows Howe well, having spent four years under him at Bournemouth, before moving to the Etihad for £40m in 2020.
