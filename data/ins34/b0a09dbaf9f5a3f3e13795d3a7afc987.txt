Five Winnipeg mayoral candidates found common ground during a debate Thursday night, each agreeing to keep Winnipeg's current rate of property tax increases, although some said they'd look to raise or lower it after a few years.Right now, the city's 2023 and 2024 budgets have a maximum property tax rate increase of 2.33 per cent.Rana Bokhari's plan is to go along with that if she's elected mayor. She said if her administration has proven itself to be "trustworthy" by 2024, she would look at increasing the tax rate hike.
