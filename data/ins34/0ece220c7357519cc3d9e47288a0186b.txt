After splitting its first two games with Air Force this season, Texas earned the all-important tiebreaker on Friday afternoon.

Boosted by a big fifth inning, 12 hits and a solid start from Pete Hansen, Texas opened its 2022 NCAA Tournament run with an 11-3 win at UFCU Disch-Falk Field. The Longhorns advance to face Louisiana Tech in the Austin Regional's winners' bracket. That game will take place at 6 p.m. Saturday.

Texas (43-19) is the NCAA Tournament's ninth overall seed.

"If I could have drawn this game up today, I would have drawn it up just like it happened," Texas coach David Pierce said.
