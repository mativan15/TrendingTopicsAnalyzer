Jun. 1—Bring your party shoes as Festival Sefardí returns to Albuquerque on Friday, June 3 through Sunday, June 5.

This year, the festival is featuring two of the world's leading Sephardic poets, Myriam Moscona of Mexico City and Cuban-born Ruth Behar. The art show "Óstraca Imagined: Shards of Hebrew Poems from Spain" will also premiere during the festival with an opening reception.

"We started having an annual festival in 2010 and it was about eight or nine in a row, and then the last couple of years, we haven't done it because of COVID," director of Casa Sefarad and Festival Sefardí, Hershel Weiss said.
