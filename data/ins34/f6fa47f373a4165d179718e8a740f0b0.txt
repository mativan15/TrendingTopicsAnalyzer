Madonna rarely fails to outrage, but it was of all things a coffee table book that earned her the nickname The Queen of Obscene. Thirty years ago, fans first opened this book's aluminium cover. The only clue to its content was the word 'Sex' stamped on the cover. Inside were erotic soft porn photos and simulation of sex acts, including S&M. Joining Madonna in her exploration of sexual fantasy in words and risque pictures were the likes of actress Isabella Rossellini, rapper Vanilla Ice and model Naomi Campbell.
