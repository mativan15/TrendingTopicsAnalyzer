AgenciesMenai Bridge is a town and community on the Isle of Anglesey in northwest Wales. It overlooks the Menai Strait and lies by the Menai Suspension Bridge, built in 1826 by Thomas Telford, just over the water from Bangor. With a population of 3,376, it is the fifth-largest town on the island. As advised by structural engineers, the Menai Bridge needs repairs and maintenance. This crossing is closed to traffic as well as cyclists and pedestrians. It is likely to be closed at the beginning of the following year.
