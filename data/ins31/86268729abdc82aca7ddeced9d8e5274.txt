Bollywood actor Riteish Deshmukh and his wife Genelia have courted controversy over the allocation of a plot for an agro-processing unit in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area in their home town of Latur in Maharashtra.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which obtained the information about the land allocation under the Right to Information (RTI), has alleged Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia Deshmukh were accorded special favours by the state government. The company Desh Agro Pvt Ltd, in which Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh are partners with equal shares, has denied the allegations as 'baseless and factually wrong'.
