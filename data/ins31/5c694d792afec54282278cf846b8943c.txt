Q: I retired in 2020. My long-term plan was to move to a single-level home. I've delayed it because of the coronavirus pandemic, but I hope to make the move this summer.I own a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath townhouse, which I would sell. I am single and want to buy a three-bedroom, two-bath home so I have more space.I'm trying to figure out how much I can afford to spend. Can you recommend a good website or calculator? I would like to have a good idea how the numbers work before I contact a real estate agent or mortgage lender.
