	New Fox Entertainment CEO Rob Wade has talked up the potential for TMZ to become a 'huge entertainment studio,' setting out his stall at Mipcom Cannes for the first time since he was promoted and international distribution outfit Fox Entertainment Global (FEG) was launched.

	TMZ was acquired in a reported circa-$50M deal last year from then-WarnerMedia, handing Fox control of TMZ's linear, digital and experiential assets.

	'We feel there's an opportunity for TMZ to be a huge entertainment studio,' said Wade.
