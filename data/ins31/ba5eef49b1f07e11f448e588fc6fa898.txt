The Miami Dolphins have been bitten by the injury bug once again, as they have so often early in this 2022 season.
After cornerback Nik Needham went down in the middle of their Week 6 matchup with the Minnesota Vikings, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that the former undrafted free agent suffered a torn Achilles. The injury will end his season.

Needham had been pivotal in filling in for cornerback Byron Jones, who had Achilles surgery this offseason, playing 86% of Miami's defensive snaps through the first five games.
