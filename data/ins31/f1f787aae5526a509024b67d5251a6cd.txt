Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has reportedly retained Camille Vasquez, along with others at the Brown Rudnick firm. Vasquez may be a familiar face and name; she was the breakout star in the macabre courtroom drama that was Johnny Depp's defamation case against his ex-wife, Amber Heard. TMZ reports that Vasquez is one of a group of lawyers at the firm hired to handle West's 'business interests,' which are unlikely to be televised anytime soon. Vanity Fair has reached out to Vasquez for confirmation.
