A mum took to Facebook to post a picture of the pyjamas she bought for her son from Sainsbury's in the sale after she noticed something a little naughty about them once she was home

A mum was left in hysterics after she noticed that her toddler's pyjamas had a rude design on them.

Anna Armstrong picked up a two-pack of pyjamas from Sainsbury's clothing range Tu in the sale for £4.

Both sets, a yellow and a blue one, featured a cute lion design, which Anna thought would look adorable on her son Raphael, reports Daily Star.
