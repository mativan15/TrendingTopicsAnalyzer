LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Liz Truss has resigned — bowing to the inevitable after a tumultuous six-week term in which her policies triggered turmoil in financial markets and a rebellion in her party obliterated her authority. She said 'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected.' Just a day earlier Truss had vowed to stay in power, saying she was 'a fighter and not a quitter.' But Truss left Thursday after she was forced to abandon many of her economic policies and lost control of Conservative Party discipline.
