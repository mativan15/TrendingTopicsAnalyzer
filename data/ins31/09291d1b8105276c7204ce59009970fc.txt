A Russian oligarch has been blocked from using cash parked in frozen bank accounts to pay for the upkeep of his Surrey mansion.
Petr Aven, a banking tycoon with a £300m art collection, is accused of using two business accounts to evade sanctions placed on him because of his connections to Vladimir Putin.
The accounts containing roughly £1.5m were frozen by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in May, before a district judge relaxed the restrictions in July so that Aven could use the money to pay his mansion's utility and security bills.
