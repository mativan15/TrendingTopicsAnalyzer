The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will seek to address Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) concerns of a possible dilution of its powers by some provisions of the draft telecom bill, a top official said, downplaying the prospects of a conflict between the department and the sectoral watchdog. Government officials say the regulator is concerned about some clauses in the draft bill, including the ones that seek to give the DoT overriding powers on issues relating to tariffs and quality of service.
