The fundraising keeps Byju's valuation of $22 billion and its status as India's most valuable startup, with the bulk of the capital coming from the Qatar fund, a person familiar with the deal said on Monday, asking not to be named as those details are private.

Backed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, General Atlantic and Tiger Global, Byju's -- formally known as Think & Learn Pvt -- has raised billions of dollars in capital to finance a global acquisition spree in the face of a tech downturn worldwide.
