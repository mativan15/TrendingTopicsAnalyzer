Out of work as he underwent treatment for his cancer diagnosis, a Kentucky man's new hobby turned out to be a fruitful one.

Frank Long, of Bowling Green, said he was 'bored' and could 'have gone stir crazy' if it weren't for him playing lottery games online.

After winning $700 two times, his wife encouraged him to 'goof off' on Tuesday, Oct. 11, and go big with a $20 wager in the Bank Buster Jackpot Instant Play game.

The wager won Long $234,176.97, leaving him in disbelief.

'I kept clicking on (the winning message), thinking it isn't real,' Long said, according to lottery officials.
