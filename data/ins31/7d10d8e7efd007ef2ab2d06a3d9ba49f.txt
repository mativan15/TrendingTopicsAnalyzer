Food banks ought to be shocking in a country as rich as the UK, and a decade ago they were. In 2012, when the Guardian launched a Breadline Britain series, the idea of hunger as a widespread social problem was an unfamiliar one. Then, this newspaper sought to challenge the narrative being promoted by David Cameron's government that jobs offered a sure route out of poverty. In fact, research showed that 3.6m households with at least one adult in work were just 'one small push from penury'.It is a grim indictment of the policies pursued over the past 10 years that the food banks opened under austerity have not gone away, but multiplied.
