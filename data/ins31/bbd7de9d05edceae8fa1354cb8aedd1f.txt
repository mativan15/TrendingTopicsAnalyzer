Johnny Depp has prevailed in his $50m (£40m) defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard over accusations of domestic abuse.A seven-person civil jury in Virginia found that Ms Heard defamed the Pirates of the Caribbean and Fantastic Beasts star when she implied he abused her in a 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post.The jury also upheld one of Ms Heard's three claims in a $100m countersuit against Mr Depp and his lawyer, who had called her original allegations in 2016 an 'ambush, a hoax'.Neither side, however, got the full amount of damages they were seeking.
