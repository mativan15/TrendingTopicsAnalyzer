Another extraordinary day in Westminster today.
Liz Truss is battling to save her premiership after the new Chancellor tore up her economic strategy and the fifth Tory MP publicly called for her resignation. 
This afternoon Jeremy Hunt warned that "eye-wateringly difficult" decisions were needed as he ditched "almost all" the tax cuts announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng less than a month ago.
He is trying to restore economic stability after weeks of turmoil on the financial markets and today his changes reduced Mr Kwarteng's £45 billion tax giveaway by around £32 billion.
