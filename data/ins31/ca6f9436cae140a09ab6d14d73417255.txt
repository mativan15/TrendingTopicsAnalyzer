The United States will continue to vigorously enforce sanctions on Russian and Iranian arms trade, the White House said, asserting that it will stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. This will make it harder for Iran to sell these weapons to Russia, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference on Monday. 
There is extensive proof of Russia using Iranian drones to target military and civilian targets in Ukraine, she added. "We'll continue to vigorously enforce US sanctions on both the Russian and Iranian arms trade -- that's what we'll do from here, make it harder for Iran to sell these weapons to Russia.
