Just Eat Takeaway.com, Europe's largest meal delivery company, said on Wednesday it made an underlying quarterly profit earlier than expected as efforts to cut delivery and operating expenses offset falling orders.The total value of orders, known as gross transaction value (GTV), a common measure for e-commerce companies, rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting higher prices on menus, but the number of orders weakened, in line with analysts' expectations.The company said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were positive in the third quarter, ahead of guidance issued at the start of the year.
