After an extended period of time off following their 12-7 loss against the Washington Commanders last Thursday night, the Chicago Bears return to the football field for another primetime matchup. This time, it's against the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football.

The Bears, at 2-4 on the season, will look to snap their three-game losing streak against the Patriots and head coach Bill Belichick, who is looking to surpass former Bears great George 'Papa Bear' Halas in all-time wins. The two are currently tied with 324 heading into Monday's game.
