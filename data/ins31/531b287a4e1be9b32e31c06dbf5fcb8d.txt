Miley Cyrus has settled a copyright lawsuit a month after she was sued for posting a paparazzi photo of herself to Instagram, according to court documents filed Wednesday (Oct. 18) and obtained by Billboard. In the original complaint, filed on Sept. 12 in Los Angeles federal court, photographer Robert Barbera claimed that Cyrus reposted his 2020 image of her without a license or permission to do so. In the snap, the 'Midnight Sky' singer is seen waving to fans as she exits a building. In his complaint, Barbera claimed Cyrus has an 'immense presence' due to her millions of followers on Instagram, and that posting the image 'crippled if not destroyed' his ability to make money licensing it.
