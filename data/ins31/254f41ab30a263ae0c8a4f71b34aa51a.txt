An alarming trend at recent Sydney auctions has highlighted just how strong a position buyers have gained in the current market downturn.

Seeing the hammer drop at an auction is becoming a rarer sight across Sydney amid a dramatic market slowdown.

Preliminary indicators from the last week of sales showed only about one in four of the Sydney homes scheduled to go to auction actually sold under the hammer.

The bulk of the properties were instead withdrawn from auction before bidding could take place or the properties sold in pre-auction deals – both were normally a sign of lacklustre bidder interest.
