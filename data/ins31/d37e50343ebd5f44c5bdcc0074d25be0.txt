The legend of Robin Hood, the hero who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, has captivated people for centuries in stories, radio shows, television and movies. Playwright Douglas Carter Beane and his composer/husband Lewis Flinn thought it was time to bring the familiar characters into the 21st century.

Their new musical 'Hood,' which had a production five years ago at the Dallas Theatre Centre, finally arrives, after a two-year COVID-19 delay, at Sarasota's Asolo Repertory Theatre, where it was originally scheduled to open in 2020.
