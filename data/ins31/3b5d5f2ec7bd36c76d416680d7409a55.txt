The son of a U.S. citizen being detained and allegedly tortured by Saudi Arabia over tweets he posted criticizing the kingdom told The Washington Post that the State Department neglected his father's case.

In an opinion piece published by columnist Josh Rogin, Saad Ibrahim Almadi's son, Ibrahim, said nobody from the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia visited his father until six months after his arrest and no U.S. officials were present at his sentencing hearing earlier this month.

'I feel empty inside,' Almadi's son told the Post.
