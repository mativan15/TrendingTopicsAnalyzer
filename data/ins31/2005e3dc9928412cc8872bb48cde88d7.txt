Galaxis founder, András Kristóf, stated recently that "NFT technology can help artists and celebrities speak directly to their fans. In turn, digital technology can help artworks reach art creators directly, bypassing the complicated channels that have been in place until now. This is the aim behind the current spectacular collection at Galaxis, which will be launched in June under the title Girls, Robots, Dragons."

The Girls, Robots, and Dragons collection is comprised of 9,000 double-sided NFT collectibles that consist of premium fantasy (and sci-fi) artwork.
