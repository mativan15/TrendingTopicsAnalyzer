Oracle's recent personnel shake-up goes deeper than layoffs, Insider has learned.Hiring managers across the company have been asked to push back start dates for new recruits, according to two sources within Oracle's recruiting division. More broadly, hiring has been slashed or significantly slowed down across several business units, according to conversations with several company insiders. At the same time, some units that are currently able to hire for backfilled positions and roles deemed critical have been instructed to avoid top talent markets like San Francisco and Seattle in favor of candidates from areas where they can command lower salaries, according to the sources and another recruiter with direct knowledge of the matter.
