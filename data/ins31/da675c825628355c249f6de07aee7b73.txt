Stephanie McMahon, the chief brand officer at World Wrestling Entertainment, was on hand to say hello to advertisers at Radio City Music Hall after NBCUniversal's upfront presentation in New York on Monday, May 16. By Thursday, after both NBC and Fox had boasted of their WWE programming, McMahon shared on Twitter that she was taking a "leave of absence" to focus on her family. In March, McMahon's husband, Paul Levesque, who is a wrestler known as Triple H, suffered a heart attack and retired from the ring, although he remains on the WWE staff with some light duties.
