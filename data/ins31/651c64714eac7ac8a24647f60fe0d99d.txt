Apple employees at an Oklahoma City store have voted to unionize, according to an announcement late Friday, marking the second retail location of the tech giant's more than 270 stores in the US to do so.According to a report from Bloomberg, the workers voted to join the Communication Workers of America, which has been pushing to form unions in other Apple stores as well. The CWA confirmed the vote win in a tweet. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but it told Bloomberg it was proud of its compensation programs, and the increases in starting pay for employees over the past few years.
