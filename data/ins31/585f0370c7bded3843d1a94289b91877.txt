The parliamentary process to select a new prime minister is as much an opportunity for the Conservative Party as it is a challenge. Get the decision right and we will have placed the country on a much better path, with a prime minister who can grip the economic crisis immediately and restore faith in the British economy. 
Get it wrong, however, and it is difficult to see how we will be forgiven by our constituents, who face the pressures of rising mortgages, extraordinary inflation and an unprecedented cost of living crisis.
