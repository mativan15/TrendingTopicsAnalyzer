U.S. stocks continued a streak of choppy trading to start Thursday as third-quarter financial results from companies continued to barrel in against a backdrop of persisting growth concerns on Wall Street.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) nudged up 50 points, or 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.1% below the flatline. Meanwhile, Treasury yields held at multi-year highs, with the rate-sensitive 2-year note topping 4.6% for the first time since 2007.
