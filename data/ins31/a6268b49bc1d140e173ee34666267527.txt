As a fall wave of the pandemic appears to be building, infectious disease experts are warning B.C.'s risk is high and the government-reported number of COVID-19 deaths is misleading. The fine print on the B.C. Centre for Disease Control's weekly COVID-19 Situation Report reads that as of April, the province is only including deaths that occurred "within 30 days of their first positive COVID-19 lab result date." Sarah Otto, a UBC biomathematics professor and core member of the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group said she's had confirmation that if someone had a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 in August 2020, got sick again in August of this year and was hospitalized, tested positive and died from the virus, that person would not be counted, since it was well in excess of 30 days since their first positive test.
