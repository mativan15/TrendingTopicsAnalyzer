The Girl Scouts of America have received a whopping $84.5 million donation from billionaire MacKenzie Scott. It's the largest-ever single donation in the group's history, the Today show reported. The funds will go to the main organization as well as 29 local councils Scott chose, the Girl Scouts said in a press release. 'This is a great accelerator for our ongoing efforts to help girls cultivate the skills and connections needed to lead in their own communities and globally,' Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Sofia Chang said.
