The creator economy is 'burning up,' and the Jonas Brothers are cashing in.
Launching today with the help of these former teen heartthrobs, Scriber is a creator subscription company geared toward more established figures in entertainment (… like the Jonas Brothers). Joe, Kevin and Nick aren't just Scriber's first creators — they also have equity in the company.
Besides catering to more established artists, Scriber differentiates itself from other creator subscription products by functioning solely via SMS.
