The South Central Railway (SCR) has completed and commissioned a major 221-km rail line doubling and electrification project that could give a boost to agro and aqua economies in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh. Electrification of the final 32.8-km stretch of rail line between Aravalli and Nidadavolu has been commissioned on October 13, marking the completion of the decade-old project. The vital Vijayawada-Gudivada-Bhimavaram-Narsapuram electrification, Gudivada-Machilipatnam and Narsapuram-Nidadavolu doubling and electrification project was sanctioned in 2011-12 at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore.
