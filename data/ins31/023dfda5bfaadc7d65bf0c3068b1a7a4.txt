Published: 09:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 09:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris says not too much should be read into his side's inability to win games at their top six rivals this season.Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat at Manchester United, which would have been far worse had it not been for Lloris' heroics, followed a humiliating 3-1 loss at Arsenal earlier this month and a 2-2 draw at Chelsea, where Spurs needed an injury-time equaliser from Harry Kane to steal a point.Those results follow an early pattern this season that has yet to see any of the big six club win games at another big six stadium.
