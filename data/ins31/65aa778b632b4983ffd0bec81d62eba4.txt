SAN DIEGO – The San Diego Padres' fans, with tears in their eyes and their voices quivering, stood in their seats Saturday night, took out their cell phones, and snapped pictures and video for posterity.

It happened.

It really happened.

The Padres, after 54 years of existence, finally slayed the mighty Los Angeles Dodgers, their hated rivals 90 miles north on the I-5 Freeway.

The Padres, in one of the greatest moments in San Diego sports history, knocked off the Dodgers, 5-3, in front of a wild sellout crowd at Petco Park, advancing to the National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies.
