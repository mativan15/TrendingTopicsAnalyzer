AJ Pritchard reckons Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins is a hell of a lot easier than Strictly Come Dancing after becoming one of four recruits to pass the Channel 4 endurance show.
The 27-year-old professional dancer successfully completed the host of gruelling challenges along with EastEnders actress Maisie Smith, former Towie star Ferne McCann, and reality TV personality Calum Best in scenes that aired on Sunday night.
Asked whether he found his time on Strictly more challenging, AJ admitted he did.
