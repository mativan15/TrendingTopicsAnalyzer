(Bloomberg) — Malaysia reiterated that it will halt exports of all live chickens, shutting off prospects that some restaurants in Singapore could still import free-range or premium birds.

The export restrictions, which take effect on June 1, will include live poultry, whole carcasses, chilled and frozen meat, chicken parts and chicken-based products, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industries said in a statement late Wednesday.
