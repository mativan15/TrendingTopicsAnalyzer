Masterchef: The Professionals is back for another epic series and fans will chef see Anna Haugh taking the reins from former judge Monica Galetti.
Culinary experts Marcus Wareing and Gregg Wallace will be putting the pros through their paces as they create dishes to an exquisite standard.
However, viewers won't be seeing the return of Samoa-born chef Monica, as she confirmed her departure from the BBC series back in April.
