(Associated Press ) SILVER SPRING, Md. — U.S. consumer confidence edged lower in May as Americans' view of their present and future prospects dimmed in the midst of persistent inflation.
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dipped to 106.4 in May – still a strong reading – from 108.6 in April.
The business research group's present situation index, which measures consumers' assessment of current business and labor conditions, also fell in May to 149.
