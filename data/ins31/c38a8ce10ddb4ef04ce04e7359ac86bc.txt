Google has been ordered to pay $515,000 to an Australian politician for failing to remove two YouTube videos that a judge said had defamed him and "traumatized him significantly."Federal Court Justice Stephen Rares ruled on Monday that the videos forced John Barilaro, the former deputy premiere of New South Wales, to end his political career prematurely and had subjected him to a "relentless and vicious" cyberbullying campaign, per The Sydney Morning Herald.The videos in question were posted in 2020 by political commentator Jordan Shanks, a self-described comedian who runs the "Friendlyjordies" YouTube channel.
