That's rich: even people making well over six figures say it can be a struggle to stretch their money. To be exact, 36% of Americans taking home a quarter of a million dollars or more claim to be running out of money again by payday, according to the joint survey of 4,048 respondents taken by data and insights company Pymnts and the LendingClub Corporation. More than 40% of those earning at least $100,000 say the same. The big picture is bleaker. The report found that 61% of Americans overall were living paycheck to paycheck in April 2022.
