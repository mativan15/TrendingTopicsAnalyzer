Hugh Grant has said that his father is considering voting for Labour following a disastrous week in politics for the Tories.The Bridget Jones's Diary star is a frequent critic of the Conservative party and has ramped up his criticism in recent months.On Wednesday (19 October), the Tories descended into further chaos as Suella Braverman resigned as home secretary following two data breaches within her office.However, the MP took aim at Truss in her resignation letter, accusing the government of breaking 'key pledges' and 'pretending we haven't made mistakes'.
