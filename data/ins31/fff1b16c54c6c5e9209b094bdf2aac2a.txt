NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are falling Tuesday as Wall Street nears the end of a tumultuous month, bruised by worries about a possible recession, inflation and rising interest rates. The S&P 500 was 0.9% lower in midday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 270 points, or 0.8%, at 32,942, as of 11:34 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% lower. Highlighting the worries about inflation, oil prices rose after the European Union agreed to block the majority of oil imports from Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.
