Patiala: Coal stock in the thermal plants run by Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and independent power producers (IPP) has improved due to a dip in demand in the last two weeks. Besides a spell of rain, the PSPCL's decision to purchase more power from outside sources especially during its availability at cheaper prices is said to have helped the power plants in Punjab to save its coal stock.In both the state-run power plants, only a single unit is operational. In GHTP Lehra Mohabbat, one out of four units has been shut down since May 13 following ESP breakdown while two more units were shut on May 13 and 15 to reserve the coal stock.
