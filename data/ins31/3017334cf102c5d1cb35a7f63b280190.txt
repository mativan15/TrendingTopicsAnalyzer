Over the past nearly 30 years, Andrew Merken has developed a reputation as one of the leading corporate lawyers in Boston focused on emerging, growth-stage and middle-market companies.

He has advised and represented countless life sciences/healthcare, technology and business service companies, as well as VC investors and investment banks investing in/advising such companies, on seed round and VC financings, recapitalizations, M&A, private equity transactions, public offerings and corporate governance.
