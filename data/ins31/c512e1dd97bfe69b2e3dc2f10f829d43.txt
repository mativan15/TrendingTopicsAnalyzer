According to a study conducted by the NIH (National Institutes of Health),  the average smartphone has 17,032 germs on its surface, some of which could carry disease. Combine that with research from RescueTime (a company whose productivity software tracks your tech usage) that says most people pick up their phone 58 times per day, and well, you're exposing yourself to a lot of bacteria each time you check social media or send that text. One of the easiest ways to clean your phone (and other commonly used devices) is by exposing them to UV (Ultra Violet) light.
