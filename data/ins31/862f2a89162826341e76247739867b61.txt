The BJP on Monday asked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to appoint Sourav Ganguly as the state's brand ambassador in place of Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan if she is "so concerned" about the former Indian cricket captain. Leader of the opposition in West Bengal Assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, made the statement shortly after Banerjee said she was shocked that Ganguly was "deprived" of a second term as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president. Roger Binny, a 1983 World Cup-winning team member, will replace Ganguly as the BCCI president when the Board holds its AGM on Tuesday in Mumbai.
