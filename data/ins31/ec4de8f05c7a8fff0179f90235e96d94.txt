Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, fell just short of Wall Street revenue expectations for the third quarter — which were already lowered — reporting sales growth of 6%. The company posted sales of $1.128 billion for Q3 and adjusted net income of 8 cents/share. Net loss was $360 million, including restructuring charges of $155 million, compared with a net loss of $72 million in the prior year. In late August, Snap laid off 20% of its workforce, nearly 1,300 employees, and announced the shutdown of several initiatives, including ending Snapchat original series.
