Over the past nine months, people who have lived experience with homelessness have been cleaning up around Penticton.
ASK Wellness Society's Peer Ambassador program has employed 40 people who have collectively worked over 1,000 hours, cleaning up over 6,000 lbs of garbage.'I've heard from participants about the effects the program has had on their mental health. They've been able to budget their money better, they feel good about themselves when out in the community, and it also strengthens their trust in others,' said the program's team lead, Keith Girard.
