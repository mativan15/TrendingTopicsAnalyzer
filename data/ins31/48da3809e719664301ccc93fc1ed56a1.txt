Dan and Anna Novak said they can point to three competing cannabis dispensaries from the front door of their northeast Albuquerque store.

That doesn't count five others within a quarter mile of The Bad Company, the dispensary the Novaks opened on April 1 at 1616 Eubank Blvd. NE. Or the 27 retail cannabis locations within three miles.

The Novaks aren't alone with it comes to finding a lot of competition for consumers in Albuquerque.

There are at least 114 cannabis dispensaries open for business in the city, according to a Business First analysis of business registrations and licenses from legacy cannabis producers.
