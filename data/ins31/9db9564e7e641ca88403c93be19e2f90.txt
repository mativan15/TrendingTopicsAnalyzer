With the commencement of the 20th Chinese Communist Party congress, Xi Jinping is within touching distance of an unconventional third term as the head of the Chinese party-state. Author of multiple books and commentaries on China and professor in Chinese and Sinological Studies, JNU, Priyadarsi Mukherji, spoke to Rudroneel Ghosh about the implications of Xi's reign for both China and the world:
