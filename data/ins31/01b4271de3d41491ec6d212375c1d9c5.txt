A Washington Commanders fan who won a check for over $14,000 from the team in a 50/50 charity raffle was shocked when he went to deposit the check and it bounced. 
Drew Shipley, who purchased season tickets for the Commanders this year, told WUSA9 that he had won the Washington Commanders Charitable Foundation raffle during the team's home opening win against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 11. 
After waiting over a month for the check, Shipley called out the NFL team on social media asking for his money before asking his ticket representative to reach out to the team.
