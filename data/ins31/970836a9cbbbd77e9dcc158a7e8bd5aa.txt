China could turn Pakistan into another Sri Lanka with debt-trap diplomacy by turning debt into equity and assuming control of the country's vital assets.Last week, the country appealed to the International Monetary Fund to have its debt rescheduled.That's the second time Pakistan has tried to reschedule its debt in the last couple of years, most of which is owed to Beijing.According to Irina Tsukerman, a human rights and national security lawyer based in New York, Pakistanis perceive China as their "new best friend" for several reasons.
