This is the second installment of the Tribune Editorial Board's endorsements for U.S. House races in the Nov. 8 general election.

6th District

Democratic incumbent Sean Casten of west suburban Downers Grove defeated Marie Newman in a contentious primary and now faces Republican Keith Pekau, the mayor of southwest suburban Orland Park.

We endorsed Casten in the primary, praising his reasoned, pragmatic approach to governance that doesn't entail progressives' tack of throwing truckloads of money at every problem.
