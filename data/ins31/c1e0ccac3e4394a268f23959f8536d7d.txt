Early in Vatican Girl: The Disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi (Netflix) there comes an inevitable reference to Dan Brown, whose bestseller, The Da Vinci Code, wove a ripe account of Papal skulduggery and dark secrets festering in the Holy See.
Skulduggery and secrets are likewise embedded in the mysterious vanishing in 1983 of 15-year-old school girl Orlandi. She was a 'Vatican Girl', whose family had served seven Popes and who grew up in the rococo shadow of St Peter's Basilica. The baroque aspect of the story is played up with gusto by director Mark Lewis.
