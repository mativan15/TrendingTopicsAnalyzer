Seniors from Radisson, northwest of Saskatoon, are considering cancelling vital medical appointments over the high cost of parking fees at Saskatoon hospitals. 'We're worried about right now, we just can't afford to keep this up,' Ken Neufeld told CTV News. Ken and Shirley Neufeld often try to park on the street now when visiting the hospital, but that's not always possible. Shirley is a breast cancer survivor and Ken often visits the city for medical appointments and procedures. In July and August Neufeld say they paid over $70 dollars in parking fees to come to appointments at Saskatoon hospitals.
