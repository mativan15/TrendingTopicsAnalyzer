Kevin McCullar, Kansas' fifth-year senior transfer out of Texas Tech, could have flushed a breakaway dunk and focused some attention on himself during the Late Night in the Phog intrasquad men's basketball scrimmage Friday at Allen Fieldhouse.

Instead, the 6-foot-6, 210-pound combo guard tossed the ball off the backboard to a trailing Zuby Ejiofor, who caught the carom and slammed to the delight of 16,300 fans.

On another highlight-reel possession, McCullar lobbed the ball toward the rim, effectively feeding the 6-foot-9, 240-pound Ejiofor for a second crowd-pleasing jam.
