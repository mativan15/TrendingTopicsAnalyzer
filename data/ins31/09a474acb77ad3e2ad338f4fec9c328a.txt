Kwasi Kwarteng is mulling a support package for steelmakers and other manufacturers struggling to cope with rising energy costs.The business secretary is exploring whether the government could exempt heavy industrial manufacturers from network charges. These are included in bills to help to maintain and upgrade Britain's network of gas pipes and electricity cables that carry energy across the country and are regulated by Ofgem.UK Steel, the industry trade association, has complained that electricity prices for British steelmakers are significantly higher than those in France and Germany.
