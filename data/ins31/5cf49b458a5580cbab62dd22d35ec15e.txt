Investors should buy AT & T after its strong third-quarter results, according to Truist. Analyst Greg Miller upgraded AT & T to buy from hold — saying the bank and its predecessors had kept the hold rating for more than 15 years — because of an "increasingly visible outlook" after the carrier beat profit and revenue expectations in its most recent quarter. "[We] are upgrading the shares of AT & T to Buy from Hold (have been Hold rated for more than 15 years) on the belief that trends of the past few quarters are increasingly likely to continue," Miller wrote in a Friday note.
