Good morning. Jeremy Hunt declared that he had a 'clean slate' to overhaul the disastrous mini-budget after he was appointed chancellor on Friday, and this morning he is going to deploy it, making a statement consigning yet more of the measures announced by his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng, to the dustbin.

Announcing Hunt's appointment, Liz Truss confirmed that the government was going ahead with the corporation tax increase that had been cancelled in the mini-budget. But that was not enough to convince the financial markets that the government had spending under control and on Friday afternoon gilt yields were going up (meaning government borrowing costs were rising).
