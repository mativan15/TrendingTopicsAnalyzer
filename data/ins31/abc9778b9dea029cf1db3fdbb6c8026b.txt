The family of the James Bond actor, who died in October 2020 aged 90, is selling the 1964 classic car to raise money for a philanthropy fund set up in his name. The DB5, synonymous with the Bond franchise, has been listed as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' as it is the only car personally owned by Sir Sean. https://mobile.twitter.com/BroadArrowGroup/status/1527344340439539717 The winning bidder will also get a personal drive in the car from World Championship racer Sir Jackie Stewart, who was a life-long friend of the actor.
