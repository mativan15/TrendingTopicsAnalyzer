A Labour councillor who said he had 'the worst tan possible for a Black man' has been cleared of wrongdoing, The Independent can reveal.

Darren Rodwell, leader of Barking and Dagenham council and MP hopeful, was investigated on Monday after footage emerged of his comments at a Black History Month event.

Mr Rodwell, who is white, said he had 'the passion for the rhythm of the African and the Caribbean' while wearing a kufi, a traditional hat in parts of Africa.

The party has now concluded its probe into racism complaints after a one-hour interview in front of the National Executive Committee, Mr Rodwell said at his Parliamentary campaign launch in Tower Hamlets on Friday.
