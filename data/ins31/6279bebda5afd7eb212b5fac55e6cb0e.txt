Young lawyers have taken part in an Anglo-Dutch exchange for more than 50 years, forging friendships and business contacts, and broadening their understanding of the law.Participants have included future Law Society presidents and many City law firm partners.The biennial event, which started in 1966, allows UK lawyers of less than seven years' practice to spend time with the Young Bar Associations of Amsterdam, the Hague and Rotterdam.At the start of this month nine young barristers from England and Wales took part, with six on the Dutch side.
