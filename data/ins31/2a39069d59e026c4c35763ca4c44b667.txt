Premier Li Keqiang left his position in China's top leadership body early as President Xi Jinping consolidates control over the world's No. 2 economy.

Li, 67, wasn't included in the Communist Party's new 200-member Central Committee, a requirement for joining the more powerful Politburo and its supreme Standing Committee. That marks an end to Li's decade as China's No. 2 official, and a long career that at one point saw him in the running to lead the nation -- a role he lost to Xi.
