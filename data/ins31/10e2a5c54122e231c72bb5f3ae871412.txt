"Star Wars" actor Mark Hamill donated 500 drones to assist Ukraine in its efforts to push back Russian forces. "Very simply: Ukraine needs drones," Hamill told host Joe Mathieu during an appearance on Bloomberg Radio's "Sound On." "They define war outcomes, they protect their land, their people, they monitor the border, they're eyes in the sky," Hamill said, adding that he was "honored" to support the mission, which would include raising funds to support Ukraine's UNITED24 "Army of Drones" project.
