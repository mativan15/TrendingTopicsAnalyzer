Taffer may think he's bulletproof with his tavern concept, and not just because he has worked hard to temper everyone's expectations. He has also partnered with Cuisine Solutions, the sous-vide specialist that can promise something no kitchen brigade could: consistent cooking across the menu. The Northern Virginia-based Cuisine Solutions is essentially serving as producer for Taffer's Tavern, doing for restaurants what the host has done for years on his TV show: bend reality to his will. In this sense, Taffer's move into the hospitality biz is rather seamless.
