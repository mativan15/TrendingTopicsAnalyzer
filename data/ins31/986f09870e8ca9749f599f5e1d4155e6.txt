If Jack Quon and his family had gone on a planned trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Aug. 8, their home, which was in foreclosure, would have been sold at public auction before they returned on Aug. 15, according to a statement from his family.
Instead, Quon, 41, who was facing a mountain of debt, including a lawsuit seeking to recover $21,000 in unpaid credit card bills, ended his own life Aug. 2 in the parking lot of a 24 Hour Fitness sport club in San Mateo. 
But his death wasn't just an effort to escape his growing debt, it was an attempt to keep his family, who knew nothing of the financial catastrophe looming over Quon, from sliding into financial ruin, the statement said.
