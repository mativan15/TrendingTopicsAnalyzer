KALABURAGI: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, on Tuesday, continued his attack on the opposition Congress, reiterating his claim that the state was an ATM of the party when it was in power. Bommai claimed the previous Congress government 'looted' the people and funnelled 'black money to the party high command'.'When we went to Delhi during the time of the Siddaramaiah government, people used to ask us: ‘What is happening in Karnataka? It has become the ATM of the Congress party'. This is what the Congress government did.
