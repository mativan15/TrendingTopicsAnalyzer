Liverpool are unhappy with Bayern Munich's £25million valuation of Sadio Mane and will set a ‘far higher' asking price to allow the winger to leave Anfield this summer.
Mane has indicated that he wants to leave Merseyside and Bayern are leading the race for his signature.
The forward has just one year left on his contract at the club but his powers show no signs of waning, with Mane netting 23 goals last term.
Jurgen Klopp would have preferred to keep Mane but he's respectful of his wish to experience a new challenge and he wants a replacement lined up before allowing the former Southampton winger to leave.
