With its initial investments, Alabama Futures Fund has already brought multiple new job creators and tech companies to the metro and the state. But now comes the real growth, said fund leadership.

Matt Hottle, a partner in Redhawk Advisory and investment manager of AFF, said AFF is going into the last year of its investment period, which will end September 2023. After that, it will not make any new investments but will continue to manage and follow up on existing investments.

'We're now in a period of time where the real growth starts to happen.
