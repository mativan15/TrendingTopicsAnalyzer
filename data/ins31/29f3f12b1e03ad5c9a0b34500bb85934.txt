For Black people, hair discrimination is still a major issue. In fact, it's such a pervasive problem that in March 2021, Senator Cory Booker introduced the CROWN Act (S. 888), which will 'prohibit discrimination based on an individual's texture or style of hair,' per the United States Congress. The bill has already passed the House of Representatives and is waiting for a vote in the Senate.



Per a press release provided to The Root, with no movement on the bill, entertainment and media labor union SAG-AFTRA is urging Congress to pass the CROWN Act in a letter signed by members including Kerry Washington, Zoë Kravitz, Rosario Dawson, Don Cheadle, Niecy Nash-Betts and Yvette Nicole Brown.
