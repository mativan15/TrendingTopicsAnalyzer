(NYSE:GRBK) back in early 2020, and when we launched our Marketplace service Leads From Gurus, we had little hesitation in adding GRBK stock to our model growth portfolio as well. Last December, however, we felt the housing market might cool down, so we booked our gains by liquidating our Green Brick holding at a stock price of around $30.
