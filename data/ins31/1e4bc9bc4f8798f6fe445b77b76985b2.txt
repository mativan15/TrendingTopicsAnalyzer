When the 2021-22 regular season ended in April for the Houston Rockets, rookie guard Jalen Green was asked about his initial impressions of the 2022 NBA draft class. One of the three players he mentioned was Purdue guard Jaden Ivey, since Green played against Ivey in high school.

It appears those meetings left quite an impression on Ivey, too. In a recent 'film session' interview with ESPN's Mike Schmitz, Ivey was asked to name the toughest player he ever had to defend in his career.

Ivey responded:

I would say Jalen Green.
