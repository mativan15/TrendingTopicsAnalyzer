Ghana and Zambia are in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for bailouts to shore up their battered economies and prevent commodity prices from spiraling completely out of control. In August,the IMF approved a $1.3 billion (€1.03 billion) portion of the $8.4 billion that Zambia needs to restore its economy. Ghana started its negotiations for a bailout of $3 billion (€3.07 billion) with the institution in late September. The government has said it hopes to reach a deal by the end of the year.
