Now that the Lebanon maritime boundary deal has finally been made public – only as the cabinet actually voted to accept it – its merits can be fully assessed. It turns out that the claims made about its benefits are simply not reflected in the text of the agreement, which incurs costs to Israel well beyond what the public had been prepared for.
