 In 2022, Apple replaced the iPhone mini with the iPhone 14 Plus. Just two years ago, the iPhone 12 was the first 'mini' model of an iPhone series that Apple had launched. And if you have been a fan of a compact smartphone, then iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini are the only options that you can grab in the iPhone family. Sadly, the base variant of the newer iPhone 13 mini is out of stock, but the Flipkart Big Diwali sale is offering the iPhone 12 with a mind-blowing price cut of 34 percent! The deal doesn't end there as it comes with the option to exchange your old phone to get a higher discount.
