A new experiment shows central bank digital currency (CBDC) can work with private stablecoins, even if intermediary operators go bust, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Friday.

Private stablecoins are designed to maintain stable values relative to a reference currency like the U.S. dollar or an asset like gold, while CBDCs are digital versions of sovereign currencies.

Project Aurum – named after the Latin word for gold – shows CBDC used by retail customers can be private and flexible, said its architects, who also include the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and a research institute.
