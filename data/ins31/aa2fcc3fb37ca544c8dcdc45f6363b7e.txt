(Bloomberg) — Digital wealth platform Endowus Pte acquired a majority stake in an independent wealth manager in Hong Kong as the Singaporean company builds out its business beyond the city-state.

The deal to buy more than 60% of Carret Private Investments Asia Ltd. brings together Endowus's digital wealth technology with Carret Private's ultra-high-net-worth customers across Asia.
