OPINION:

The polls are starting to show that a conservative 'wave' may be forming after all for the midterm election. No kidding.

Somebody should tell The Washington Post. They reported on Oct. 10 that 'Half of voters say climate change is important in midterms.' Sure it is. You keep thinking that way.

For weeks, media polls gave the impression that Democrats were an even bet to hold the House and Senate, even though historically it would be extremely unlikely. Media outlets clearly hoped this would reduce Republican turnout.
