China will never give up the option of invasion to reunite Taiwan with the mainland, President Xi said on Sunday as he launched the crucial Chinese Communist Party congress that will confirm his position as the country's most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong. In a 104-minute speech to the 20th party congress, Xi promised "maximum efforts" for a peaceful reunification but insisted that the self-ruling democratic island must and would come under the sway of Beijing. "The Taiwan problem is a matter for the Chinese people to solve, and it will be decided by the Chinese people," Xi said.
