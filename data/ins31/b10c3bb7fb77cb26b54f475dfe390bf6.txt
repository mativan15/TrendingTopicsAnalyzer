DALLAS, Pa. — Penn State Wilkes-Barre partnered with several other campuses to help potential entrepreneurs in the community test the viability of their ideas.
The Northeast Region Idea TestLab, offered through the Wilkes-Barre, Hazleton and Lehigh Valley campuses, brought together a group of people in all phases of entrepreneurship to provide expert and peer support feedback for their ideas. The group met virtually each week for five weeks, culminating in an 'idea pitch' session on Oct. 11.
'The Idea TestLab is a free program that was designed for individuals, teams or businesses with an interest in figuring out if their idea makes sense to move forward,' said Stephanie Gresh, IDEA Hub coordinator and assistant teaching professor of business.
