They carry buckets stuffed with the only weapon left in their fight against an enemy that threatens their very way of life.They are heading to a field that despite its attractive appearance hosts the invasive Opuntia stricta, a prickly pear cactus that is taking over large swathes of northern Kenya's rangelands, inhibiting grass growth in a landscape with poor rainfall.There will be no grass with opuntia.
