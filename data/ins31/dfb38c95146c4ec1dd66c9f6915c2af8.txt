The art and science of stock market investing requires a tolerance for losing money on some of the shares you buy. But it should be a priority to avoid stomach churning catastrophes, wherever possible. We wouldn't blame NextNav Inc. (NASDAQ:NN) shareholders if they were still in shock after the stock dropped like a lead balloon, down 72% in just one year. That'd be a striking reminder about the importance of diversification. NextNav may have better days ahead, of course; we've only looked at a one year period.
