Our take

You can apply now to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt. As the Biden administration promised, the application itself is short, simple and should only take a minute or two to fill out.

Once your application is submitted, your eligible student debt should be canceled within six weeks, according to the Education Department.
