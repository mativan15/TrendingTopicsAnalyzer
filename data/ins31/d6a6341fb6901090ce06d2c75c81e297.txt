Union minister Smriti Irani termed it as a new low in Indian politicsThe by-poll to the Munugode assembly seat in Telangana is turning into a bitter fight between the state's ruling Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) and the BJP. On Thursday, some people dug up what looked like a grave, where they put up a picture of BJP national president JP Nadda with a banner that read 'Regional Fluoride Mitigation and Research Centre, Choutuppal'.

The BJP claimed that it was the handiwork of BRS workers who it said were scared of the increasing popularity of the BJP in the state.
