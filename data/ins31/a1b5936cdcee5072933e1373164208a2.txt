Housing and urban development minister Aman Arora on Sunday said that the state government led by chief minister Bhagwant Mann has eliminated corruption and mafia culture patronised by previous governments during the past seven decades. He was presenting the report card of seven months performance of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. Addressing a press conference here at party's headquarter, Arora slammed previous Congress, SAD and BJP governments for pushing Punjab into debt as most of their leaders were indulged in malpractices and they filled their own coffers, he said.
