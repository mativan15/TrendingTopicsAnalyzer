Somewhere at his core — beneath the endless scroll of scientific awards, the hundreds of millions of dollars he's earned as a technologist, and the weight of directing perhaps the most important AI company in the world — Demis Hassabis is a gamer. 
Growing up in north London, the child of a Greek Cypriot father and a Chinese Singaporean mother, Hassabis was a child prodigy in chess from the age of 4. He began writing his own computer games at 8, created one of the first video games to use AI at 17, and founded his own video game company not long after graduating from Cambridge University at 20.
