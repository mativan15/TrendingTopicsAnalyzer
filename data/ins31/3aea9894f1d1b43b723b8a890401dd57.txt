Published: 09:20 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 09:20 EDT, 15 October 2022 As the Chicago Blackhawks have kept going west to California, defenseman Jack Johnson has finally found some normalcy before the puck is dropped. Johnson and the Blackhawks will play their third game this Saturday night when they meet the San Jose Sharks in the first of three matchups between the Western Conference clubs this season. There was nothing normal about Johnson's return to Colorado on Wednesday night -- unless opening the season at the Stanley Cup-winning club you left in July and participating in that team's pregame celebration constitutes normal.
