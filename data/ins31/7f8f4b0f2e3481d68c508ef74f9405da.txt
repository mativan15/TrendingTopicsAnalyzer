Elon Musk told Tesla executives that the company needs to cut about 10% of its workers, reports Reuters. That's according to an email seen by the news agency and sent by Musk.The email, which Reuters described as 'brief,' was titled 'pause all hiring worldwide' and in it, Musk said he had a 'super bad feeling' about the economy. The email was sent on Thursday, two days after Musk sent another email to Tesla staff ordering workers to return to the office or lose their jobs. At the end of 2021, Tesla employed about 100,000 people, so a 10% reduction in workers would mean around 10,000 jobs at the company could be lost.
