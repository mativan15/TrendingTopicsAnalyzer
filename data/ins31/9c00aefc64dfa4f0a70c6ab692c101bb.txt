May 28—The term "Vandal Family" is often used to describe the shared connection between University of Idaho students, employees and alumni.

But for one man who attended the Moscow campus in the late 19th century, that term has a literal meaning.

Ole Hagberg, a European immigrant who began his undergraduate education in 1894, is legally recognized as a relative of the UI.

According to historical documents dug up by Aarika Dobbins, a management assistant in the UI College of Engineering, Hagberg was born in 1873 in Norway.
