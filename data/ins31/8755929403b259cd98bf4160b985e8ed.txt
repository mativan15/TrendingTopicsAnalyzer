The local share market has hit a three-and-a-half-week high in morning trade, finally breaking through a key resistance point after four failed attempts last week.

The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index at noon was up 57 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7,239.7 on Monday, after nearing 7,200 and then falling every day last week except Tuesday.

The broader All Ordinaries was up 59.1 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7,473.6

Every sector except energy and utilities were up, with AGL dragging the latter sector down after scrapping its plan to spin off its coal-fired power plans following opposition from tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes.
