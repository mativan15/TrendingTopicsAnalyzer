The recent announcement by BCCI secretary and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Jay Shah regarding India's reservation from traveling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup 2023 has met with serious criticism from several ex-cricketers. Many, who have represented Pakistan at the international level, argued Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to maintain a strong stance, urging not to travel to India for the ICC men's World Cup, which will be played next year. Some have even gone to the extent of boycotting Sunday's T20 World Cup match in Melbourne.
