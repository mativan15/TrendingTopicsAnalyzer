Pinterest Inc. announced a deal Thursday to buy shopping platform The Yes, as the social-media company attempts to increase the e-commerce activity on its platform. Pinterest PINS, +5.86% did not disclose a purchase price for the company, which uses algorithmic techniques to develop a personalized feed for shoppers. Pinterest began testing a similar service called Your Shop in the U.S. earlier this year, with plans to roll it out farther later in the year. The Yes was founded by Chief Executive Julie Bornstein, who was previously chief operating officer for online-shopping destination Stitch Fix Inc.
