Oct. 19—A critical incident last week has renewed discussion among city councilors about armored vehicles at the Norman Police Department.

Ward 5 councilor Rarchar Tortorello in a Monday news release argued NPD needs an armored vehicle to "save officer and civilian lives."

The city's officers used the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office's armored vehicle for safety during an Oct. 11-12 standoff with a barricaded person threatening "suicide by cop." The suspect allegedly fired from a residence in the 3200 block of Timber Shadows Drive, striking the vehicle multiple times but not hitting any officers, according to statements from the agencies.
