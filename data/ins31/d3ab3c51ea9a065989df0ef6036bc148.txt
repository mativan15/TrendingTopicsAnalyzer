Some of Asia's biggest animals are flouting 12,000 years of extinction trends and flourishing in areas near humans, a new study has found.

Four species — tigers, Asian elephants, wild boars and clouded leopards — are increasing their populations in areas that house human infrastructure, according to the study, published on Friday in Science Advances.

'Under the right conditions, some large animals can live nearby humans and avoid extinction,' lead author Zachary Amir, a PhD candidate at Australia's University of Queensland, said in a statement.
