The Home Office has been plunged into fresh chaos by Suella Braverman's departure, as it fights battles over asylum, immigration and policing.Ms Braverman's resignation was reported in the media before being communicated to staff, who had barely started work on implementing her agenda after she took on the role less than two months ago.A source said Home Office civil servants had no inkling of her departure, adding: 'The initial reaction was what the f***?' 'The thing that struck us about her is that she talked a lot but didn't deliver on anything,' he told The Independent.
