Netflix's The Good Nurse tells the chilling true story of Amy Loughren, the nurse who helped pin her coworker, the prolific serial killer Charles Cullen, in the murders of dozens of defenseless hospital patients. Starring Jessica Chastain as Loughren and Eddie Redmayne as Cullen, the film draws its real-life facts from journalist Charles Graeber's true crime book of the same name. In director Tobias Lindholm's hands, the film, based on a script by Krysty Wilson-Cairns, is a powerful portrayal of Loughren's heroism, side-stepping the modern true crime obsession with sensationalizing the evil killer at the center of the story.
