New export controls recently mandated by the Biden administration have placed hundreds of Chinese Americans at risk of losing either their jobs or their citizenship.

On Oct. 7, the U.S. government published a set of restrictions that essentially bar exports to China of American-made manufacturing equipment necessary for advanced chips production.

The White House said the initiative was aimed at thwarting China's capabilities in producing high-end semiconductors used in commercial and military technologies.
