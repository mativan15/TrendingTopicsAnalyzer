Enlarge / The GMC Sierra EV will be the brand's third EV after the Hummer EV truck and SUV. In January, Chevrolet showed off its first fully electric pickup truck, the 2024 Silverado EV. And on Thursday it was the turn of General Motors' stablemate GMC, which opened the order books for its new Sierra EV, which will arrive in dealerships in early 2024. Like the Silverado and the GMC Hummer EV, the Sierra EV uses GM's Ultium Drive motors and Ultium batteries, as well as GM tech like Super Cruise.
It's no surprise that's there's a family resemblance to the Silverado EV, although to my eyes GMC's nose treatment looks a little more successful—definitely a little more futuristic.
