AntonioSolano/iStock via Getty Images Citi has opened 90-day catalyst watches on four of its buy-rated biotechs, underscoring their potential to generate major catalysts in Q4. Three of those names, Apellis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:APLS), Eiger BioPharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:EIGR), and Merus N.V. (NASDAQ:MRUS), have outperformed the ~33% selloff in the biotech space, while the other Arcus Biosciences (NYSE:RCUS) has underperformed, as shown in this graph. Citi analysts led by Yigal Nochomovitz retain APLS as the firm's highest conviction pick naming the stock as its top selection in the SMID-cap biotech space.
