Kara Swisher and Steve Case go back — way back, to the 1990s. She was a young Washington Post reporter covering a new thing called 'the Internet' … and he was a co-founder of the company that became AOL. In the latest episode of On With Kara Swisher, they take a walk through time to look at how far the world has come and where tech companies have stumbled or fallen flat.
They also discuss Case's new book, Rise of the Rest, which offers an optimistic future for the expansion of entrepreneurship and innovation beyond a handful of places like Silicon Valley.
