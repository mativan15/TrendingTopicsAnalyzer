Memphis freshman Josh Minott will reportedly remain in the 2022 NBA draft and forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility, according to Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports.
Minott, who wasn't expected to return to Memphis, was named to the AAC All-Freshman team after averaging 6.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 33 games. He produced his best game of the season on Jan. 23: 18 points and nine rebounds in a win against Tulsa.
The 6-foot-8 forward is considered a potential first-round pick after a strong showing in the pre-draft process.
