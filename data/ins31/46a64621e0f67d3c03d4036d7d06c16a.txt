Venice-based PGT Innovations Inc. is strengthening its growing footprint in the Western United States with the $185 million acquisition of a manufacturer in Salt Lake City.

The purchase of Martin Door Holdings Inc. also marks PGT's entrance into a new product category — garage doors — which is expected to generate $60 million in sales by year's end.

PGT has been making inroads into the West in recent years through its subsidiaries Arizona-based Western Window Systems and California-based Anlin Windows & Doors, which it acquired at the end of last year for $126.
