With the broader equity market doing its best to reverse the lows that have done so much damage in recent weeks, investors in Target (NYSE: TGT) haven't seen a fresh low since June. While shares are still down about 35% from where they started the year, the fact that they're up the guts of 15% in the past 4 months is the bigger story. And after yesterday's updated rating from the team at Jefferies, it's looking like things are about to get even better.

Analyst Corey Tarlowe upped his rating on the retail giant to a Buy having previously had it as a Hold.
