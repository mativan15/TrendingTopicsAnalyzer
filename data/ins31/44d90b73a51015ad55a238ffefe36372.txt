The hotel industry was hit particularly hard by COVID-19.  As the world shut down, people stopped traveling, and millions of workers lost their jobs in hospitality.  But the CEO of the Hilton hotel chain thinks things are finally beginning to look up.  'We've seen very, very steady recovery,' Chris Nassetta, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. 'So I would say we're at the beginning of what I think is going to be a new ‘Golden Age of Travel.'' Hilton reported a net loss of $720 million for the year in 2020, citing the impact of the pandemic, when most people weren't leaving their homes let alone traveling.
