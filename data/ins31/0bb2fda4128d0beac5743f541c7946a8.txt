Even the nations sweethearts Holly Willoughby and Philip Scofield don't seem to be immune to cancel culture. If you have not seen the news they are accused of jumping the queue to pay their respects to Her Majesty The Queen.

Their explanation of a legitimate press visit did not seem to resonate well with the British public, especially when a story did not seem to be forthcoming. It was also pointed out that Holly and Phil don't normally venture outside the studio to go on location.

All this must be very distressing for the pair and I am not one to judge them, however, it does make me think about how easy it is to get ‘cancelled' nowadays and what we can do to avoid it.
