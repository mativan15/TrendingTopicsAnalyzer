It's Tennessee and everyone else when it comes to betting on the College World Series.

The Volunteers have been the most dominant team in college baseball in 2022 and enter the NCAA tournament at +225 at BetMGM to win the College World Series for the first time. No other team has better than +900 odds to win the tournament and just four other teams are at +2000 or better.

Tennessee is 53-7 overall and went 25-5 in SEC play this season. The Volunteers beat Texas A&M by six games in the conference standings and breezed through the SEC tournament a weekend ago.
