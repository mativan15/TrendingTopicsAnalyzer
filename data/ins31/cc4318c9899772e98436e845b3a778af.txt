Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Rohit Pawar speaks about nepotism in politics, the need to challenge the BJP's version of Hindutva and his relationship with his grand-uncle Sharad Pawar at the Town Hall hosted by The Indian Express. Excerpts from the interview:
This is your first term as an MLA and so many things are happening in the state. How has been the journey so far as a legislator?
Rohit Pawar: I would give all the credit to the people of Karjat-Jamkhed who ensured my victory. I am not very happy about the way things are going inside the Assembly.
