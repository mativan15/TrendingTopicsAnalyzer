The ongoing and unaddressed health inequity for Māori is costing hundreds of millions of dollars according to a new Indigenous-led study. It revealed inequity directly cost the health system $39.9 million per year with substantial additional costs from ‘ambulatory sensitive hospitalisations' and outpatient care. When the indirect cost of lost years of life and low wages were added, mainly borne by Māori whānau, the cost skyrocketed to more than $860 million. Māori were also found to be significantly under-utilising primary health care, which includes GP visits, which created an annual saving to the health system of $49.
