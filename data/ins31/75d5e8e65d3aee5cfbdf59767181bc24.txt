Jana Sena Party (JSP) president K. Pawan Kalyan on Sunday announced that the party is postponing the Jana Vani programme scheduled to be held at Port Kalavani Stadium in Visakhapatnam on Sunday. He said that the party had taken this decision in the wake of the late-night arrests of over 100 key JSP leaders by the city police on the eve of the programme.
