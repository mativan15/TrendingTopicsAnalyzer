The proposed nine-story condo complex on North York Street would involve the demolition of a house and an old two-story building. (Google Maps)ELMHURST, IL – A developer proposing a condo complex in downtown Elmhurst is presenting options for a smaller project at the request of zoning committee members and neighbors. But there's a catch: The developer would then seek financial help from the city. The 28 condos would take the place of older structures from 196 to 202 N. York St. The developer, Oak Brook-based RSCK Holdings, is proposing a nine-story building, with two stories of parking above ground and seven stories of condos.
