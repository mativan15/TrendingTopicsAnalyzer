Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM 4.56%), the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, traded nearly 5% higher as of 12:52 p.m. ET today after a Wall Street analyst upgraded the stock this morning.
So what
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase reported $3.12 of earnings per share on managed revenue of $33.5 billion for the third quarter of the year, both numbers that topped expectations.
Credit quality among consumers still looked quite healthy in the quarter, and the bank was buoyed by surging net interest income (NII), the profit the bank makes on loans and bonds after funding those assets.
