Derick Hudson Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been betting aggressively on the metaverse in the hope of creating an entirely new AR/VR ecosystem for users to enjoy themselves in a virtual world. Between 4Q20 and 2Q22, Meta has incurred a total operating loss of $18 billion for the Reality Labs segment on revenue of just over $4 billion. While the early losses are understandable as Zuckerberg has indicated Reality Labs will not be a real business story until the end of the decade, investors are beginning to question whether Facebook's transition into the metaverse will truly be a sustainable growth driver for the social media company.
