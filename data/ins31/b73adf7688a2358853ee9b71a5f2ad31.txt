If you've been waiting for the right time to sign up for one of the most popular travel rewards credit cards, this is it.

For a limited time, new Chase Sapphire Reserve® cardholders can earn 80,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. This is the biggest welcome bonus since the 100,000-point bonus that Chase offered when the card launched in 2016.

The offer is an extremely generous one, as those 80,000 bonus points are worth $1,200 when redeemed through the Chase Travel portal or Pay Yourself Back tool and potentially even more if you transfer the points and redeem with one of Chase's airline or hotel partners like United or Hyatt.
