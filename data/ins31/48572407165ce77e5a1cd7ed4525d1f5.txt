(RTTNews) - French stocks rose on Friday amid bets that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of rate hikes in the coming months. The upside remained capped after a survey showed growth in business activity in France's dominant services sector weakened in May compared to the previous month. S&P Global's final purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 58.3 points in May from 58.9 in April. U.S. jobs data is due later in the day and it is believed that weak data could sway the Fed towards a less aggressive policy path.
