In its most recent update on the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations reports that in 2020, despite some progress, 2 billion people still lacked safe drinking water and 1.7 billion did not have basic sanitation.  The world remains far behind achieving SDG 6 – clean water and sanitation for all. At the center of the global challenge is the financing of water and sanitation infrastructure projects in emerging markets.  Since the World Bank published its 2016 study on the costs of meeting the SDG targets, national governments, development partners and regional bodies have focused on mechanisms to attract private capital to the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector.
