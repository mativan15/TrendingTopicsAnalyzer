"He thought her future in-laws would sympathise after hearing about the incident and he might not have to pay her dowry ," a police officer said.The man, Dayaram Singh from the Kunda Khurd village, told police that thieves had stolen cash and jewellery worth roughly Rs 90,000 from his home. He claimed that the incident took place on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday and only "gifts" meant for his 22-year-old daughter's wedding were stolen.
