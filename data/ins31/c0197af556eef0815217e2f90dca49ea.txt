The deputy Chinese ambassador has been summoned for urgent talks with the British government over claims that one of his most senior diplomats attacked a pro-democracy protester.The Foreign Office said the government was 'extremely concerned at the apparent scenes of violence' at the consulate in Manchester and had told the embassy of the need to allow people to protest peacefully.The protester who was attacked said that he felt as though the state violence that he fled in Hong Kong had followed him to the UK amid allegations that Zheng Xiyuan, the consul-general, was involved in the attack.
