I was 12 years old the first time I was arrested for weed. I was handcuffed and taken to juvenile detention, the start of a life caught in the web of the carceral system. Every moment since then, I have been either incarcerated or on probation.

I am now 41, doing a 45-year prison sentence for taking another human's life. Every morning in prison, I watch CNBC's 'The Exchange' and marvel at the talking heads discussing the money to be made in cannabis stocks.
