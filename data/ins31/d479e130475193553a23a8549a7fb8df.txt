Sturm, Ruger & Co., a gun maker whose institutional shareholders include BlackRock and Vanguard Group, will host its annual meeting next week at which it faces a shareholder proposal to require a 'human rights impact assessment.'The proposal, calling for Sturm Ruger to conduct and publish a third-party review of the company's policies, practices and products, was filed last month by a group that includes nonprofit Catholic health system CommonSpirit Health, the Episcopal Church and the School Sisters of Notre Dame Cooperative Investment Fund.
