Bet_Noire/iStock via Getty Images Introduction We have been in a 21-month correction for this gold/silver bull market. Some would argue that this PM (precious metals) bull market is over. But in my mind, as long as $1680 holds for gold and $18.50 for silver, the PM bull market is only correcting. At some point, I expect this correction to end and for silver to break out. When that happens, many silver projects will push their share prices higher. If there is one thing I have learned investing in PM miners, it is that quality projects are what drive the share price to obtain outsized gains.
