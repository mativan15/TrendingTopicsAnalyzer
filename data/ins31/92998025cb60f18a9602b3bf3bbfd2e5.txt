The issues of food waste can be hard to see; more than half of it happens before it ever reaches our plates. Yet, it is one of the most critical issues facing our planet, contributing to both climate change and food insecurity.

In Canada, it's estimated that 58 per cent of the food produced is lost or wasted each year, which has an environmental impact equivalent to more than 2 million cars on the road.
