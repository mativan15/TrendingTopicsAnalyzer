The Loose Women panel have desperately implored King Charles III to call for a general election after Liz Truss' resignation as Prime Minister.
Following the announcement the politician made outside No 10 Downing Street on Thursday, it's been claimed that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak could be going head to head in the Tory leadership race.
However, many people are incensed that a general election hasn't been called before a new Conservative leader is revealed, including the stars of Loose Women.
