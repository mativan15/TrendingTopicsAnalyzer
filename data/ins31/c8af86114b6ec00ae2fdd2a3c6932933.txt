By Xavier Fontdegloria The Italian economy expanded slightly in the first quarter of the year as a sharp uptick in business investment offset falls in household consumption and net foreign trade. Italy's economy--the eurozone's third-largest--grew by 0.1% in the first quarter compared with the previous three-month period, the Italian statistics agency Istat said Tuesday. This marks a significant upward revision from the preliminary estimate reported on April 29, which pointed to a 0.2% on-quarter contraction.
