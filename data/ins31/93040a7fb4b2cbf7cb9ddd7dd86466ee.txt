Efe Abogidi withdrew from the NBA draft pool. So, is the high-flying forward returning to school?

Not necessarily.

Abogidi, a starter for Washington State over the past two seasons, backed out of the draft on Wednesday – the final day for collegiate athletes to do so and preserve their eligibility – according to a Twitter report from CBS college hoops insider Jon Rothstein. But Abogidi's NCAA playing days may still be finished.

The 6-foot-10 Nigeria native is 'seriously considering' signing a G League contract, per Jeff Goodman of Stadium.
