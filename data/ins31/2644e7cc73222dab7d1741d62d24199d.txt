By next Friday, and possibly sooner, Britain will have its third Prime Minister so far in 2022 — its fifth since the Brexit vote in 2016 — and still no certainty that its unprecedented political crisis is on its way to being resolved."Whatever happens, it's a mess," said pollster Joe Twyman of Deltapoll. "It's very difficult to see how a [Conservative] Party as divided and fractious as this can unite behind one candidate."Liz Truss's dramatic resignation as Prime Minister Thursday — just 44 days after winning the leadership — makes her the shortest serving PM in British history.
