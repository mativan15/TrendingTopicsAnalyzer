June 3 (Reuters) - Tenaris SA, a global manufacturer of steel pipes, said on Thursday it will pay $78.1 million to resolve U.S. probes into its alleged payment of bribes to win business from Brazil's state-owned oil company Petrobras.

The Luxembourg-based company will pay a $25 million civil fine plus $53.1 million in disgorgement and interest to resolve a civil probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
