But audiences are coming back despite a quiet start to 2022, OA chief executive Fiona Allan told AAP. "I think we're on the road to better... everything is picking up now with box office, so the rest of the year is actually looking really quite positive," she said. The country's largest performing arts organisation posted an operating loss of $22.
