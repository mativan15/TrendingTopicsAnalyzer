On Tuesday, Jammu Deputy Commissioner/District Election Officer Avny Lavasa issued an order authorising all tehsildars in the district to issue residence certificates to people who have been living in an area for more than a year but lack documentary proof of residence, so they could register as voters in the ongoing special summary revision of electoral rolls in Jammu and Kashmir.
The certificates were to be issued after field verification, as per guidelines provided by the Election Commission of India.
