Sitting down to face MPs at the Treasury Select Committee earlier this month, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey's warning was clear. Food inflation sparked by the war in Ukraine is 'not just a major worry for this country, but a worry for the developing world'.'I'm sorry for being apocalyptic, but it is a worry,' he added. While some in Government questioned whether Mr Bailey's use of language was sensationalist, global charities and policy experts said the Governor's choice of adjective was spot on: the world is sleepwalking into an 'unprecedented' hunger crisis.
