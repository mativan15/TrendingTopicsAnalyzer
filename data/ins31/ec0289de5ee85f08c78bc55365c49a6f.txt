Successful people don't necessarily give the best advice—they just tend to give more of it, a study has suggested.The study, published in the journal Psychological Science in April, involved thousands of people and tasked them with playing games of Word Scramble, a word-finding game.According to Psychology Today, which had access to the research, the study was split into four parts. In the first, 1,000 participants were asked simply to play Word Scramble and were asked whether they thought there might be any link between how good someone was at the game and how good they'd be at helping others play it.
