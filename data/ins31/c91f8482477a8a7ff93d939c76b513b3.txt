Scotiabank REIT analyst Mario Saric has a 'screaming yes' on his sector after a 23 per cent sell-off this year. But risks remain apparent.In a research report this week, Mr. Saric noted that value-oriented portfolio managers were inquiring as to whether now is a good entry point for REITs, and his answer is where the 'screaming yes' originated. He pointed to unit prices that are 26 per cent below net asset value on average, a level of cheapness that has only happened four per cent of the time REITs have been available.
