The Oregon Legislature's Emergency Board passed 69 items during it's Friday meeting at the Oregon State Capitol.

The Oregon Legislature's Emergency Board on Friday dedicated millions of dollars toward a variety of issues deemed to have immediate need in the state, including forest management, grasshopper and cricket suppression, affordable housing stabilization and law enforcement officer mental health.

In total, 69 items were passed.

Republicans said Democrats — who maintain control of the committee by virtue of their majority status in the Legislature — should have focused more money on the emergencies they contend Oregonians care most about.
