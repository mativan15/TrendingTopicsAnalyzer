A female shop worker has been jailed after grooming a teenage girl for sex.

Ellee Nicoll, 25, bought the young girl presents and gave her money before embarking on a sexual relationship with her.

A court heard that Nicoll 'cultivated' the relationship, engaging in months of sexting with the teen - and decided to watch a 'lesbian film' with her to normalise 'what [she] wanted to happen'.

The truth only came about when the young girl's mother became concerned at how close the pair were becoming and told the teenager what grooming entailed.
