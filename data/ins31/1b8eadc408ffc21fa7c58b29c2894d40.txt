An inflation gauge closely tracked by the Federal Reserve rose 6.3 percent in April from a year earlier, just below a four-decade high set in March and the first slowdown since November 2020.
Friday's report from the Department of Commerce added to other recent signs showing that while high inflation continues to cause hardships for millions of households, it may finally be moderating, at least for now.
The report also showed that consumer spending rose by a healthy 0.9 percent from March to April, outpacing the month-to-month inflation rate for a fourth straight time.
