Twitter users have mocked Republican U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker after he flashed what appeared to be a police badge during a debate with Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock on Friday.Walker was responding to Warnock's criticism that the Republican has falsely claimed to be a law enforcement officer. The former football star, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, previously made the false claim that he was an FBI agent."We will see time and time again tonight, as we've already seen, that my opponent has a problem with the truth," said Warnock.
