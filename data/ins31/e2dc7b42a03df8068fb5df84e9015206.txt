LOS ANGELES (CNS) - After creating some commuting headaches for tens of thousands of motorists, Vice President Kamala Harris departed from Los Angeles International Airport aboard Air Force Two Tuesday, bound for San Francisco, concluding a four-day visit to Los Angeles that included a discussion on efforts to protect reproductive rights. Harris departed from LAX around 8:30 a.m. But her motorcade from West Los Angeles to the airport prompted a full shutdown of the southbound San Diego (405) Freeway in the midst of the morning rush hour.
