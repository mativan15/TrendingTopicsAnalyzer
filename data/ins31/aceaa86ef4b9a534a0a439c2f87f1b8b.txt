LAWRENCE — Kevin McCullar has announced he's removing his name from the NBA draft process, and as a result returning to the college ranks.

The decision Wednesday means McCullar is headed to join the Kansas Jayhawks, the program he committed to in May as a transfer. McCullar had spent the past four seasons, also in the Big 12 Conference, at Texas Tech. And now he'll be a part of Kansas' effort to repeat as the national champion.
