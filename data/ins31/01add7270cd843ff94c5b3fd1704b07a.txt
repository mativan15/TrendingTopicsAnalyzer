For the first time, hearing aids are now accessible for purchase over the counter at businesses across the United States. According to the White House, beginning Monday, anyone with mild-to-moderate hearing loss will be able to purchase hearing aids in-store or online without a prescription, physical exam, or endocrinologist fitting - and for thousands of dollars less than they did previously. Customers may anticipate saving around $1,400 for each hearing aid or more than $2,800 per pair. According to Walmart's chief medical officer, people's entire health is a combination of various variables, including hearing, that affect physical and emotional well-being.
