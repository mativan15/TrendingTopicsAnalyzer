VICTORIA - British Columbia's ombudsperson has released a report on what he calls a 'disturbing' case in which federal benefits intended for the family of a disabled Indigenous girl were instead kept in the province's coffers for almost three years.The report from Jay Chalke's office says the B.C. Ministry of Children and Family Development acted unjustly by delaying thousands of dollars in federal payments to the caregivers, whose young granddaughter has mental and physical challenges.Released Tuesday, the report entitled 'Short-Changed' says the grandparents became the girl's legal guardians in 2013 and the Canada Revenue Agency confirmed their eligibility for the Disability Tax Credit and Child Disability Benefit in June 2019, retroactive to 2015.
