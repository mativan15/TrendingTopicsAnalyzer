Clement Lenglet has called on Tottenham to improve their 'intensity and quality' in big games after falling to another worrying defeat.

Spurs have now been beaten by Manchester United and Arsenal in their biggest tests of the season, while snatching a late point at Chelsea and losing away to Sporting CP in the Champions League.

'It's clear, we've lost three games against three big teams, this is where we have to improve,' Lenglet told Sky Sports.

'When we play this type of game we have to increase the intensity, the quality on the pitch.
