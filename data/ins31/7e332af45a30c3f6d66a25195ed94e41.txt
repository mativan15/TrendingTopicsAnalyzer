Published: 19:29 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 19:35 EDT, 19 October 2022 Southampton's third win of the season was enough for them too distant themselves from the Premier League's relegation zone as Ralph Hasenhuttl's side hung on against a Bournemouth side in a strong vein of form.But it wasn't enough to stop the pressure mounting on boss Hasenhuttl away to Bournemouth as his squad picked up three valuable league points.  Just 31 miles separate the two sides, meaning plenty of Southampton fans made the short trip to watch their team earn a 1-0 win on the south coast.
