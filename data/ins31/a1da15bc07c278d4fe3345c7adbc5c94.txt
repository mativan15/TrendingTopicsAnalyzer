Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu arrived here on Monday on the first leg of his three-nation tour of Gabon, Senegal and Qatar. "A special welcome! Vice President @MVenkaiahNaidu was received by Gabonese PM @OssoukaRaponda and FM Michael Moussa-Adamo on his arrival in Libreville, Gabon for the first leg of his 3-country visit," Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi tweeted. While Naidu's visit is the first by any Indian vice president to all three countries, it marks the first-ever high-level visit from India to Gabon and Senegal.
