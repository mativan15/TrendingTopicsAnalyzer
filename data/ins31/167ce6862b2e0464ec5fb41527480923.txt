A productive and impressive preseason helps the Oklahoma City Thunder ready themselves for the more regular season play.

The Oklahoma City Thunder just ended their preseason campaign on a high note following a hard-fought victory over the scrappy San Antonio Spurs. And the rigors of the NBA regular season are just a few days away.

Looking back on preseason in its entirety, things haven't quite looked like one might expect. The team enjoyed success despite injuries to the starting backcourt. Certain players have already surpassed expectations while others haven't appeared to be what fans might have envisioned.
