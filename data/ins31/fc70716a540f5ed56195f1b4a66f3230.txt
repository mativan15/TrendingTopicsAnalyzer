Pgiam/iStock via Getty Images Almost two years ago, I recommended purchasing Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) for its 35% potential upside within a period of two years. The stock reached my target price this week. More importantly, it has rallied 19% this year, and thus it has outperformed the broad market by an impressive margin, as the S&P 500 has declined 22% during this period. The big question is whether investors should take their profits on Globe Life or the stock remains attractively valued. Business overview Globe Life is a life and health insurance company.
