A new cabinet is to be sworn in on Sunday in Odisha, after all ministers in the Naveen Patnaik-led BJD-ministry resigned a day before to allow th chief minister to reshuffle his ministry. Patnaik who recently completed 23 years in office apparently wants to give a new look to his ministry before the 2024 elections to the Lok Sabha and Assembly, analysts said. This is the first time in the political history of Odisha that all ministers were directed to quit. Sources in the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) said that more than six of the 20 ministers who resigned are likely to be dropped from the new ministry.
