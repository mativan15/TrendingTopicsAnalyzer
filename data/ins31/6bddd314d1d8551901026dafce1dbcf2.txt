Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (LON:RR.) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future.
