The U.S. stock market's two-week rally is even stronger than it looks. That's saying something, since this rally has already tacked on impressive gains. As of the market's close prior to the Memorial Day exchange holiday, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.63% was 6.6% higher than where it stood at its mid-May low. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, -0.41% was 8% higher, and the Russell 2000 Index RUT, -1.26% was 9.9% above its May low. Yet the stock market's internals are even stronger than these headline numbers suggest.
