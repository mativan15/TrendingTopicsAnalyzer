Audi has always occupied an interesting niche in the luxury car market. It doesn't project the same sporty edge as BMW, nor does it exude the same stolid prestige as Mercedes-Benz. Instead, Audi sits somewhere in the middle. Its modern offerings providing effortless pace alongside pleasant comfort and an air of stealthiness, all without asking too much of the driver. As the 2022 S8 proves, it's that blend which Audi does best.

The $116,900 S8 is the big daddy of Audi's sedan lineup.
