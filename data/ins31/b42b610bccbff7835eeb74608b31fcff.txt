Three months ago I transferred £5,000 from my Nationwide FlexPlus account to my Portuguese current account in Cape Verde, where I am currently working. My money was lost and for two months Nationwide couldn't find it. Then it said it had turned up in a Lloyds Bank account in Britain, but after all this time I am still without my money. Nationwide is refusing to accept responsibility and closed my complaint.
