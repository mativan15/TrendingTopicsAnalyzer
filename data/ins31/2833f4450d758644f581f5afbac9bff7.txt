A Democratic political group unveiled a new ad seeking to pump young voters by highlighting President Biden's student debt forgiveness program, but audiences are mocking it. The group, Build Back Together, is using the ad in a "six-figure" campaign. It kicks off with a clip of MSNBC host Shepard Smith stating that the White House is "kicking off its efforts to forgive student loan debt." The screen then appears to glitch, with Smith repeating the word "debt" over and over before a beat kicks in and memes start spraying across the scene.
