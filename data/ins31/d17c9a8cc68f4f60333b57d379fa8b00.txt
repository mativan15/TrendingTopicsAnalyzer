The double whammy of the Russian war on Ukraine and changing climate poses a serious threat of food insecurity to several countries in Asia and Africa. The UN's World Food Programme estimates that about 44 million people in 38 countries are already at ‘emergency levels of hunger'. Amidst rising global food prices, a number of countries have banned export of agricultural commodities. As of May 29 2022, 18 countries (excluding Russia and Ukraine) have imposed bans on exports of various commodities like wheat, pasta, corn, chicken and vegetable oils.
