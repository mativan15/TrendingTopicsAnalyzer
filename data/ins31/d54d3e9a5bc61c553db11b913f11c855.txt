When asked Wednesday whether the administration would like to see the state's public investments moved elsewhere, Bysiewicz responded 'absolutely.'

Later Wednesday, a spokesman for the Lamont campaign confirmed that the governor shared Bysiewicz's views, saying 'we support efforts to align our investments with our values.'

'This is not a question of investment, this is about a candidate for governor being on the payroll of a foreign government and seeking to hide that relationship from the people of Connecticut,' said Lamont campaign spokesman Jake Lewis.
