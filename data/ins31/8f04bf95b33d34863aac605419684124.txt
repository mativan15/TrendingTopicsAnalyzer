By Australian Associated Press Published: 16:05 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 16:05 EDT, 16 October 2022 Papua New Guinea will kickstart their Rugby League World Cup campaign against Tonga this week, knowing a good showing will further strengthen their longstanding ambition to get their own NRL side. The Kumuls head to St Helens on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT) amid a boom in interest about the introduction of a PNG-based side to the NRL. While the country's Queensland Cup side, the PNG Hunters, have struggled since the start of the pandemic, the desire to establish a team in Australia's closest geographical neighbour has never been stronger.
