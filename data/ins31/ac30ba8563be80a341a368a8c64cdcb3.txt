Chelsea will motor ahead with their plans to pursue Jule Kounde in the upcoming transfer window despite two factors that could set them back. The Blues have made the Frenchman their top target ahead of Todd Boehly's arrival as new owner following his purchase of the club from Roman Abramovich. The American billionaire is prepared to bankroll Thomas Tuchel in the next few months to mark a new era. However, as they did last year, Chelsea are already finding problems in the transfer market when it comes to the signing of Kounde.
