A woman known as the 'Birdseed Lady' has been linked to a growing rat problem in San Francisco. ABC 7 in the Bay Area says hundreds, possibly thousands, of pounds of birdseed have been dumped around Glen Park over the past two years by the Birdseed Lady. Pest control contractors have been setting out traps in sewers to assess the problem. San Francisco's Helen Diller Playgrounds is seeing a big increase in rats, where kids play in one of city's nicest playgrounds. Store owner Janet Tarlov with the Glen Park Merchants Association, has tried to clean up the piles of birdseed.
