TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will respond firmly to excessive currency fluctuations, its top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said, following the yen's sharp fall to a 32-year low to the dollar.

"Each country would respond appropriately" to an agreement on foreign exchange market moves by the Group of Seven (G7) and G20 meetings last week, Kanda, vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters at the Ministry of Finance.

Kanda made the comment as the Japanese currency hovered close to a 32-year low near 149 yen, stoking concerns about boosting already high import costs that are squeezing households and companies.
