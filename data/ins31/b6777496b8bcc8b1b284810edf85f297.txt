Delray Beach-based MV Realty offered Nwana $850 to sign a listing agreement saying that if she decides to sell her Arlington, Texas, house at any time in the next 40 years, she will use MV as her listing agent. She said she 'thought it was a good idea,' adding that who lists her place is 'not important....They asked me if I was willing, and I needed the money.'
