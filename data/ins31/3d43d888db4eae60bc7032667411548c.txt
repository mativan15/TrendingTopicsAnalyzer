Football fans are gearing up for the 2022 World Cup, and we're sure it won't be long until we hear the dulcet tones of Baddiel, Skinner, and the Lightning Seeds around every corner. 
The song Three Lions, which popularised the immortal phrase ‘It's coming home', was released in 1996, featuring bittersweet lines about the England team's greatest football moments – and how they hadn't won a major tournament since 1966.
