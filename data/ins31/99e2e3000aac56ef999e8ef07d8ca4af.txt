Most investors don't think of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as growth stocks. But certain REITs have major growth potential. For example, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA -2.88%), now going by just MAA, saw its share price grow 871% to its peak in Nov 2021, outperforming the S&P 500 and providing an annualized return of nearly 15%.
But today's bear market along with a cooling housing market has brought share prices for this residential REIT down 37% this year. Wall Street hasn't lost hope in this stock though.
