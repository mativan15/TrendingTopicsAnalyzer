Former President Donald Trump could be facing a criminal indictment as soon as the midterm elections are over, according to a Florida state prosecutor.Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, said during a Florida Politics interview published Wednesday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) could be sitting on an indictment until after the November elections. He said that an indictment was likely in part because the former president had been "making admissions in his public statements" on the classified documents retrieved during the FBI's Mar-a-Lago raid on August 8.
