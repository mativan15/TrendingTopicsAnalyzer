JohnnyGreig/E+ via Getty Images Introduction Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) investors should be aware that due to the fact that the majority of revenues being earned abroad, the company will face significant headwinds as the dollar rises to extreme strength relative to most foreign currencies. At the same time, Japan-based Terumo (OTCPK:TRUMY, OTCPK:TRUMF) experiences the opposite effect as the yen reaches almost record-breaking weakness compared to most currencies. Therefore, it is more optimal to take advantage of forex to invest in Terumo rather than wait for JNJ's continued relative underperformance.
