Sheffield Wednesday, Portsmouth, Ipswich Town and their fellow football league sides will all enter the FA Cup after the draw for the first round was made. One of the most historic tournaments in football will welcome 48 sides from Leagues One and Two as it continues its journey to Wembley in June next year. Liverpool are the current holders, but with no Premier League or Championship involvement until the third round teams from lower down the pyramid will assume the limelight. Wednesday, arguably the biggest name in the first round, will play Morecambe whilst League One pace setters Plymouth Argyle have been drawn against Grimsby Town.
