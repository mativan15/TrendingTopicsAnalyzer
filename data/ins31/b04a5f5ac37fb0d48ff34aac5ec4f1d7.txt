Outrage over Netflix‘s fictional series The Crown reportedly has the streaming giant a bit 'rattled,' to the point where they're planning to postpone an upcoming documentary about defected British Royal Family members Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
Deadline reports that Netflix execs think 'it would be foolhardy to stream The Crown in November followed by the Harry and Meghan documentary in December.'
The Crown, a fictionalized drama that follows the sometimes-true, sometimes-exaggerated history of the British Royal Family, has raised eyebrows and ire amongst both the public and some of the show's real-life subjects, after trailers for the upcoming episodes allegedly paint a season full of invention and insensitivity.
