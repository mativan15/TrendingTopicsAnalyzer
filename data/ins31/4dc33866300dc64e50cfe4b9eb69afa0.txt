The 96-year-old monarch decided to include Harry and Meghan in the Jubilee celebrations, taking place this weekend. But commentator Nile Gardiner warned that the Royal Family "should be concerned" that the Duchess will use the Jubilee as a "publicity exercise for herself and her business interests." Meghan and Harry have returned to the UK to celebrate the Queen's 70 years on the throne.While they will not appear on the balcony at Trooping the Colour, they are expected to attend the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Friday.
