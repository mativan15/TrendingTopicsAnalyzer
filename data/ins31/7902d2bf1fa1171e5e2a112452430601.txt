The Karnataka government is drafting new guidelines for release of inmates facing life imprisonment on grounds of good behaviour after completing 14 years in jail so as to ensure that prisoners convicted of crimes against women and multiple murders are not eligible for it.
The guidelines are being drafted by the state home department following a clearance by the cabinet on July 22. The decision to not include inmates convicted of certain crimes comes after the name of a man serving a life sentence for four murders appeared on the list of those looking at a possible early release.
