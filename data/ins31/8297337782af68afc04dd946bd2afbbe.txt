The Miami Hurricanes suffered a setback in the first game of ACC baseball tournament pool play. They'll have a day to figure things out and try to turn things around before the NCAA Tournament begins.

The Hurricanes (39-17 overall, 20-10 ACC) are the No. 3 seed in the tournament. Their first game in Pool C was a 9-6 loss to NC State, the 10th seed who won both their games in pool play. The loss means the 'Canes cannot advance to the semifinal round.

Miami faces sixth-seeded Wake Forest (39-17-1, 15-14-1) on Friday in their second pool-play game.
