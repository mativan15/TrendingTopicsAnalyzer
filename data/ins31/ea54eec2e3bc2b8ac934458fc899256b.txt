Tamil Nadu's Rosy Meena Paulraj shattered the national record for women's pole vault for the second time in 15 days when she cleared 4.21m to win the gold medal at the National Open athletics championships here on Saturday.
Rosy, who turns 25 in a fortnight, lit up the opening day with another sensational performance, exactly 15 days after clearing 4.20m to set up a new national record at the 36th National Games in Gandhinagar.
She had then gone past V S Surekha's earlier national mark of 4.15m set in 2014.
