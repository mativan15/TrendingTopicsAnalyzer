A former insurance agent was arrested Friday morning in connection with multiple federal fraud charges, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio.

Seneca Birchmore, 44, of Cincinnati, was arrested on complaints related to misuse of social security number, aggravated identity theft and fraud in connection with major disaster and emergency benefits, according to court documents.

Birchmore lost his insurance license in 2019 after writing insurance policies for people who didn't want them in order to collect commissions, officials said.
