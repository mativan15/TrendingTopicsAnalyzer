When a 22-year-old Zepto employee Sohail Shaikh recently needed some money, a 'Magicloan' ad on YouTube for instant micro loans came to his mind. On April 24, he ended up taking a loan of Rs 6,000 from two apps, 'Magicloan' and 'cashmarket'.
'I was supposed to pay them back on April 30. I would get my salary on May 1, so I thought I would return it a day later. Their (loan apps) people however started calling me on April 29. I told them about the payment deadline but it didn't matter — they were abusive,' Shaikh told The Indian Express.
