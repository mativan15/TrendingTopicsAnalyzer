European gas prices pushed higher this morning ahead of further talks between EU leaders as they clash over how to tackle the energy crisis.

Officials will meet for the second time in a fortnight, but continued divisions mean the bloc is now unlikely to put a cap on how much it pays for gas.

The 27 nations are expected to back an alternative price benchmark for liquefied natural gas and joint gas buying, having earlier agreed to cut consumption and roll out a windfall tax on energy companies.
