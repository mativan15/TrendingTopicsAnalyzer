Published: 07:47 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 08:07 EDT, 15 October 2022 Peter Crouch has shared his concerns over Leicester City's financial position after having a quiet transfer window and feels 'confidence is low' at the King Power following a difficult campaign.The Foxes lost multiple players in the summer as long-standing goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel left the club to join Ligue 1 side Nice and the club also sold star defender Wesley Fofana to Chelsea for £70million.Despite important players leaving the club, there was an obvious lack of quality replacements being brought in as Alex Smithies and centre-back Wout Faes were the only two new players brought into the squad.
