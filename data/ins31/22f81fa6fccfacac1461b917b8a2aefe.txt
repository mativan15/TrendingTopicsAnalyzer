The last week of May saw dams across Maharashtra reporting a water level of 38.47 per cent of the capacity – up 1.47 per cent from last year during the same period.
If monsoon arrives by June 10, Maharashtra is unlikely to face any water crisis, said officials, adding that the rainfall will have to be intense and consistent to increase the water levels in the dams. For the last two consecutive years, Maharashtra has managed to avert drought.
The 3,267 dams across Maharashtra has a storage capacity of 40604000 million litre (ML).
