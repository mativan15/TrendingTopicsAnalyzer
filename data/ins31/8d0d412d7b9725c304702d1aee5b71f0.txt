Tennessee Titans safety Kevin Byard was one of the many players who paid their respect to franchise great Delanie Walker after he announced he was retiring from the NFL on Tuesday.

Byard and Walker played with each other from 2016 through 2019. The two wound up going to the Pro Bowl together after a 2017 campaign that saw the Titans win their first playoff game since the 2003 season.

On Tuesday, the All-Pro safety elaborated on the type of impact that Walker had on himself, in the locker room, and obviously on the football field.
