This Mariners season, full of memories and historic moments, came to a close after the sun set over T-Mobile Park on Saturday evening.

Fans packed the seats at the ballpark on a hazy afternoon in October, ready to watch playoff baseball in Seattle for the first time in more than two decades.

The Mariners, hosting American League West rival Houston in Game 3 of the best-of-five AL Division Series, took the field just after 1 p.m. to roaring cheers from a sold-out crowd of 47,690 that remained standing for much of the marathon that followed.
