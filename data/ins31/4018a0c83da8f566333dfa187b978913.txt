The government has faced a tumultuous past 24 hours in power, with Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigning and being replaced by Grant Shapps to an uproar over MPs' vote against a fracking ban. Prime Minister Liz Truss has faced further calls to resign as a result and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer appeared to take great joy in mocking the Conservative Party in Prime Minister's Questions yesterday. BBC Breakfast's Charlie Stayt put this to Wes Streeting on Thursday, although didn't appear to agree with Starmer's approach.
