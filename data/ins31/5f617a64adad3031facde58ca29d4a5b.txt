Oct. 15—ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Penn State defensive tackle PJ Mustipher kneeled on the Michigan Stadium turf during a break in the second half Saturday with his head bowed, not from exhaustion but from frustration.

Michigan was running for large gains with ease, making the Nittany Lions' nationally ranked rushing defense look utterly helpless.

"I just feel like another team completely dominated us," Mustipher said. "It never feels good. It's kind of embarrassing ... It's embarrassing."

The fifth-ranked Wolverines rushed for 418 yards and four touchdowns and raced past No.
