The first time Gil Cedillo speaks at length in the most notorious leaked audio in Los Angeles City Hall history, he discusses the joy of being a proud papi.

'I did [an] interview the other day ... and said I'm a grandfather, and I have a 47-year-old son, and a 2½-year-old little girl,' the Los Angeles City Council member said, four minutes into the conversation.

' Estás loca con esa niña,' said Nury Martinez, Cedillo's then-council colleague — you're crazy about that little girl.

'Look at these curls! You like these curls?' Cedillo soon exclaimed, apparently scrolling through his phone for a photo and eventually getting Martinez — who proclaimed she never particularly cared for 'that whole little kid s— ' — to admit that yes, she thought the hairstyle was cute.
