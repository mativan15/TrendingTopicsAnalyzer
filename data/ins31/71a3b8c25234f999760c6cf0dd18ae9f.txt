For the first time, streaming has overtaken legacy pay-TV in terms of adoption in the U.S. 65% of people aged 18 to 49 watched streaming TV in March 2022, more than the 63% that watched legacy pay TV. 
The future of entertainment will likely see streaming become the prevailing choice, but how can Roku (ROKU 5.60%) capitalize on this? It has some competitive advantages that could allow it to be an amazing investment over the long haul if CEO Anthony Wood's vision comes to fruition.
