Indiewire Todd Field's widely acclaimed Oscar hopeful 'TÁR' takes on a rarified world rarely explored in movies: classical music. In the drama now in limited release, Cate Blanchett plays the Egot-minted conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic who idolizes Leonard Bernstein and is now recording Gustav Mahler's fifth symphony in his vein. Except, she's now in freefall, thanks to a blizzard of accusations from protégés and peers alike.The movie may be divisive for its morally ambiguous take on a public figure and self-styled genius who unravels amid #MeToo-worthy allegations — when she's not seemingly grooming an ingenue, she's stomping over them, such as Noémie Merlant's up-and-coming violinist-turned-assistant Francesca.
