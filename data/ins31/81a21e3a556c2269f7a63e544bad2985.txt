Google Street View celebrated its 15th anniversary recently, wherein it received some fantastic features. First, it received a new camera that could capture a 360 degrees view of the world. It could capture the images of mountain tops, remote islands, local towns, and under-mapped areas like Amazon jungles. One of its many unique features is the time capsule of places. Whether you are an Android or iOS user, you can now tap on a place and get a historical view of that place. You will be able to see how it looked in a specific year and how it evolved.
