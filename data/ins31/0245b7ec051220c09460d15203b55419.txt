Two years ago, in 2020, when Aileen Henderson was only 99 years old, she published 'The World Through the Dime Store Window,' her memoir of growing up in the mining community town of Cedar Cove and then living in Brookwood, Alabama in the later 1930s and early 1940s.

She wrote of her work at Kress department store, her meager salary, her sister's love life, joining the military and becoming an airplane mechanic. With the GI Bill, Henderson would take the bachelor of arts at Judson College and a master of arts at the University of Alabama.
