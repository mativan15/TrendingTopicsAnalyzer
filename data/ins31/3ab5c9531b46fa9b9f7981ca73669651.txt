 By Staff, Agencies The Tel Aviv occupation regime is coordinating with the United States and Gulf nations on a process to normalize its ties with Saudi Arabia, Zionist Foreign Minister Yair Lapid confessed Monday. 'We believe that it is possible to have a normalization process with Saudi Arabia. It's in our interest,' Lapid boasted in remarks to ‘Israeli' Army Radio. 'We've already said that this is the next step after the ‘Abraham Accords,' to talk about a long and careful process,' he added, referring to the 2020 US-backed normalization deals the ‘Israeli' occupation entity reached with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.
