z1b Investment Thesis UiPath (NYSE:PATH) is down more than 80% since its IPO. All along the way, investors have been eager to buy the dip. And all along the way, whether the rally was at $70, $50, $30, or during the summer in the mid $10s, every rally was met with bears taking back control. And while there's a lot of validity to the bear case, I also have to question whether Barclay's recent downgrade of PATH might not be a little too late for the party. Even while I recognize that a lot of the problems that got UiPath to where it is today have not been solved, I have to acquiesce that a lot of negativity has already been priced in.
