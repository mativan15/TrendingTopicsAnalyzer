Published: 21:39 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 21:39 EDT, 29 May 2022 The Voice Australia 2022 runner-up Faith Sosene has raised eyebrows with her response to Lachie Gill winning the show on Sunday night. Shortly after losing to Lachie - the only white finalist in the top four - Faith, 25, uploaded a backhanded Instagram post caption suggesting Lachie, 24, only won because of his skin colour. 'We already knew Australia was gonna love & pick you! You're simply perfect for them,' Faith wrote next to a photo of Lachie.
