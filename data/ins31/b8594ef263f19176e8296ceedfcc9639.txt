This marked yet another move by Mamata to put distance between her and an agitation led by the Trinamool Congress that propelled her to power, replacing the Left, but also led to Tata Motors taking its flagship Nano plant to Gujarat in 2008. While it might have notched up political points for the TMC when in the Opposition, it is an uneasy legacy when Mamata is trying to woo investment, and now faces the BJP as the TMC's biggest rival in the state.
Next up are the panchayat polls, for which the State Election Commission has already started preparations, and then come the Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP last time stunned the TMC with its surge.
