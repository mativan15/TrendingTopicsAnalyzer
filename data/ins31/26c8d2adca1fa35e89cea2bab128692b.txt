NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A Nashville social club owner on Wednesday pleaded guilty to a campaign finance scheme that also involves a Tennessee state senator's failed 2016 congressional campaign.

Joshua Smith, 45, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the solicitation and spending of at least $25,000 of so-called 'soft money' — or funds not subject to federal limitations and reporting requirements — in connection with a federal election.

The plea comes three months before state Sen.
