The effect is felt on the field, in the stands, at schools, and at home.'The very fact that we're talking about it means that it's bad enough,' said Jim Quatromoni, athletic director at Hingham High School. 'I think the impact is more the opportunity lost and that ‘Friday Night Lights' experience in your school community. People and students who got that experience, it's hard to complain, but if you're denied it, you don't necessarily know what you've been denied.'According to the MIAA, the number of on-field football officials dropped 16 percent, from 867 to 729, between fall 2018 and this past June.
