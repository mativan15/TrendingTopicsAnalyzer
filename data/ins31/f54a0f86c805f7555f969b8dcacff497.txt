An impostor is a person who pretends to be someone else. They may pretend to be someone you know, such as a family member, a friend or a person you feel like you know but have not met in person. They may pretend to be working for the government or from a company you trust, or a company with which you do business on a regular basis, such as a computer software company.

Kelvin Collins is president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau serving the Fall Line Corridor.

Impostors are dishonest people who want to steal your money or personal information and will try to do this through a phone call, text message or email.
