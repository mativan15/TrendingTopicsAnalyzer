Tory MPs are openly saying they will vote against the government over fracking – even if they lose the party whip as a punishment.In an extraordinary instruction, the Tory deputy chief whip had declared the clash 'a confidence motion' – a status normally given to a vote on the future of a government itself.It 'is a 100 per cent hard 3 line whip', an email to Conservative MP reads, adding: 'This is not a motion on fracking. This is a confidence motion in the government.'But former energy minister Chris Skidmore, who signed net-zero pledges into law, tweeted: 'For the sake of our environment and climate, I cannot personally vote tonight to support fracking and undermine the pledges I made at the 2019 General Election.
