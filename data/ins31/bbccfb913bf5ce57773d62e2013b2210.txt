Mike 'MOD' O'Donnell is a professional director, facilitator and a regular columnist. OPINION: My mate Jimmy is a colourful character. Built like a jockey with an incendiary smile and quick wit, he's a well-seasoned digital entrepreneur. After doing interesting things with eBay and Monster.com in Australia, he worked with me at Trade Me for 10 years, before replacing me as chief operating officer and then chief consumer experience officer, before moving on to Wipster where now he's the chief executive.
