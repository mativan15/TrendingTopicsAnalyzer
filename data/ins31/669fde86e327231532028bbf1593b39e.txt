CoinSwitch has launched the Crypto Rupee Index (CRE8). The crypto exchange claims that it is India's first benchmark index to measure the performance of the Indian Rupee-based crypto market.
CRE8 tracks the performance of eight crypto assets that represent over 85 per cent of the total market capitalization of cryptos traded in the Indian Rupee. 'The index provides a trustworthy, real-time view of the Indian Rupee-denominated Crypto market based on actual trades, enabling Indian users to make informed investment decisions,' said Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO of CoinSwitch.
