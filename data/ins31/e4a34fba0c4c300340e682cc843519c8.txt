Democrats in the House of Representatives are looking to answer one of their longest lingering foreign policy questions; why was former President Donald Trump's administration so favorable to Saudi Arabia? 
To do that, they are hoping to interrogate one of the chief architects of Trump's Saudi strategy - his son in law Jared Kushner. 
On Friday, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-NY., sent a letter to Kushner regarding a $2 billion investment to his private equity firm, Affinity, which was set up after his exit from the White House in January 2021.
