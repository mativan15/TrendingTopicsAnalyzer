Leal Brainard, vice chairwoman at the Federal Reserve, has been the central bank's most vocal proponent for experimenting with government-issued digital money as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.88% and ether ETHUSD, -3.93% have exploded in popularity and as use of Federal Reserve paper money has declined in recent years. On Thursday, Brainard appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to make the case for these experiments in the wake of considerable volatility in crypto markets that lead to the failure of the widely used stablecoin TerraUSD.
