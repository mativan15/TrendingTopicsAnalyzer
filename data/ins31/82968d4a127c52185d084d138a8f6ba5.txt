May 29—John Augustine, President and CEO at Penn's Northeast, says Northeastern Pennsylvania is experiencing record growth — there are more developers, brokers and companies looking at the region than ever before.

And Augustine said there are a few reasons for this, but a key factor is, as the saying goes, "location, location, location."

Augustine said the region is in a period of unprecedented growth with more than 70 million square feet of new construction being planned on and around the Interstate 81/Interstate 80 corridor.
