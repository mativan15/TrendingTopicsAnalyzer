Even by Nintendo standards, Pokemon has been glacially slow to change. The series has long been iterative, and the community has certainly taken notice. This year's Pokemon Legends: Arceus showed a faint idea of what a bold reinvention of the series would look like. Now Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, touted by Nintendo as the "first open-world RPGs in the Pokemon series," raise the question: Are these going to be the main series games to follow Arceus' blueprint? The answer is mostly no, but Scarlet and Violet still represent the largest break in the main series we've ever seen.
