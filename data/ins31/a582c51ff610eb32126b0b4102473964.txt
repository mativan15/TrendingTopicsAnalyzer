Korea's strong dependence on Kakao servicesBy Kim Boram SEOUL, Oct. 19 (Yonhap) -- The recent massive disruption of Kakao Corp.'s dominant chat messenger KakaoTalk and other related services has affected nearly all sectors of South Korea, ranging from social networking and business to finance and transportation. It took about four days for the company to fully repair damaged servers and normalize all of its services after a fire broke out Saturday at its data center in SK C&C, located in Pangyo, just south of Seoul.
