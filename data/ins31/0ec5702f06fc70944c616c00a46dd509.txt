The cryptocurrency business run by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss is cutting 10% of its staff in response to a downturn in trading activity across the industry, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. This marks the first job cuts at Gemini Trust Co., which as a privately held company doesn't disclose its number of employees. The report said LinkedIn lists about 1,000 people who may work there. "This is where we are now, in the contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis — what our industry refers to as 'crypto winter,'" the Winklevoss brothers wrote to employees in a Thursday memo viewed by Bloomberg News.
