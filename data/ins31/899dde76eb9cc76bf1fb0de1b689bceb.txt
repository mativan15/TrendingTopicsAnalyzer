Members of the group Just Stop Oil also staged a sit-in protest on Park Lane where the sports carmaker's store is located in an exclusive area of the British capital. The action came after two Just Stop Oil activists hurled tomato soup over one of Vincent van Gogh's "Sunflowers" paintings at London's National Gallery on Friday.
