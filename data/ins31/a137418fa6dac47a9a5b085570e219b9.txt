By Xavier Fontdegloria An economic index that measures U.S. business cycles fell in September, resuming the downward trajectory of recent months and signaling an elevated likelihood the economy will fall into a recession. The Leading Economic Index compiled by private-research group The Conference Board decreased 0.4% to 115.9 in September after remaining unchanged in August, data published Thursday showed. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the index to decrease 0.3%. The indicator's persistent downward trajectory in recent months suggests a recession is increasingly likely before year end, said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at the Conference Board.
