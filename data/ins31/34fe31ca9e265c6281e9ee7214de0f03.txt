(RTTNews) - European stocks look set to open on a firm note Monday after China reported the fewest new Covid-19 cases in almost three months. Trading activity is expected to remain thin as U.S. stock and bond markets will remain closed today for the Memorial Day public holiday. Both Beijing and Shanghai eased COVID restrictions, with authorities in Shanghai rolling out a total of 50 stimulus measures to support the local economy, which has been hit hard by the restrictions. Asian markets followed Wall Street higher, while a weakening dollar buoyed greenback-priced bullion and oil.
