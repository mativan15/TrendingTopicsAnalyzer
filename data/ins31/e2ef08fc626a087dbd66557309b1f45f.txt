We're two weeks out from the NFL trade deadline on Nov. 1, and teams around the league are already beginning to make moves. It might be tough for the New Orleans Saints to get involved this time. They're under the salary cap by a razor-thin margin, with little wriggle-room after restructuring many of their contracts before the season started. They've run out of ways to work around the cap and might have to sit pat while other teams try to improve.
Maybe. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler suggested two players could be on the move for New Orleans, both wide receivers — one of them incoming and another outgoing.
