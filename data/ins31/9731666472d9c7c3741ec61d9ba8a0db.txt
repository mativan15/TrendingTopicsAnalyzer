At a glance, it may look like a regular monitor with a more colorful design, but there's more to it than that. Gaming monitors are designed to have a higher refresh rate, lower input lag, and game-genre presets that let you quickly adjust the settings—brightness, contrast, response time, and more—to suit different styles of play.
One might be particularly useful for fast-paced first-person shooters like Call of Duty, while another is geared toward less frenetic fare like Civilization VI or Crusader Kings III.
