Markets ended the week on another high as strong showings for many of London's financial stocks offset a drop sparked by the new windfall tax.By the end of the day the index had gained 0.3%, a rise of 20.54 points to 7,585.46.It is its highest point since the early days of the month, and the index has now gained more than 400 points since its low point on May 12.'It's been a decent week of gains for markets in Europe, with the FTSE 100 enjoying a particularly strong performance, on course for its best week in over two months,' said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
