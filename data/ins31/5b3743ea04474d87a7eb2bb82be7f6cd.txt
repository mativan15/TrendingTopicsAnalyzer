Unions representing tens of millions of workers in India are calling on Britain to suspend talks on a trade deal with the country, warning it would open UK markets to goods produced by child labour and modern slavery.A deal with the south Asian giant is one of the most coveted goals of Britain's post-Brexit trade policy, after hopes of a similar agreement with the US came to nothing.But Indian unions have claimed working conditions within the country could deteriorate further as a result of any deal, with Britain's TUC raising concerns over ‘widespread' use of forced labour.
