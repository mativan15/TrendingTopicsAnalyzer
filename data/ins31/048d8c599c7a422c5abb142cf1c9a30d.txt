U.S. stock futures moved lower in the early trade Wednesday as a two-day rally spurred by the better-than-feared start to earnings season lost steam.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.3%, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked down 60 points, or 0.2%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were off by 0.3%.

Netflix (NFLX) was in the spotlight following a big earnings beat Tuesday afternoon that included 2.41 million in new subscribers – a key metric watched by analysts – more than double Wall Street's estimate of 1 million additions.
