By Allen Henry October 14, 2022 / 10:26 PM / CBS Minnesota ST. CLOUD, Minn. -- A St. Cloud Priest, convicted of one felony count of third-degree sexual conduct, will soon be released from prison. In July 2020, Anthony Olerich was sentenced to 41 months in prison. But his victims and their advocates are now wondering - what happens to him? Advocates say it's not a common question that gets raised, despite its importance. "I wouldn't use the word common and I'll tell you why. Because not many of them go to jail," said Frank Meuers, leader of the Minnesota chapter of Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests or SNAP.
