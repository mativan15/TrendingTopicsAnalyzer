Sundry Photography J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) traded higher in postmarket action on Tuesday after topping estimates on both lines of its Q3 earnings report. The Arkansas-based transportation company reported total operating revenue increase 22% during the quarter to $3.14B. Operating revenue was up 12% compared to a year ago excluding the fuel surcharge revenue. The revenue growth was primarily driven by a 17% increase in Intermodal revenue per load, an 18% increase in average revenue producing trucks in Dedicated Contract Services, a 13% increase in Truckload volume, and an increase in Final Mile Services (FMS) revenue driven primarily by our recent acquisition - which were just partially offset by an 8% decrease in volume in Integrated Capacity Solutions.
