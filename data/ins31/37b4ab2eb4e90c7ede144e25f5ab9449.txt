The U.S. economy was even weaker in the first three months of 2022 than initially thought, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday, as it updated its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to –1.5%, a bit worse than the 1.4% decline that was first reported.

Lower numbers for restocking inventories and residential construction accounted for most of the downward revision, though those were partially offset by an upward revision in consumer spending. Overall, the decline in GDP in the first quarter reflects 'decreases in private inventory investment, exports, federal government spending, and state and local government spending,' as well as an increase in imports, the agency said.
