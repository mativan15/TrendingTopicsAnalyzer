Xi Jinping defended his hard-line reign on Sunday, presenting himself to a congress of China's ruling elite as the leader whose tough policies had saved the nation from the ravages of the pandemic and was now focused on securing China's rise amid multiplying global threats.

Mr. Xi, who is poised to claim a groundbreaking third term as leader at the end of the weeklong Communist Party congress, used his opening report to argue that his decade in power had brought historic gains. He pointed to the party's campaign against corrupt officials, its cleanup of the environment and its crackdown on antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong as key victories.
