An Australian software company has won a $13 million, five-year contract to establish the police firearms register. Objective Corporation announced its specialist regulatory platform, Objective RegWorks, had been selected to develop the register, which will require gun owners to enter their name, date of birth, address and other details. 'The Arms Information System (AIS) will be a secure digital platform that will manage the information related to arms (firearms, parts, ammunition, and other restricted weapons), firearms licensing, and any activities associated with the possession and use of firearms,' it said in a statement on its website.
