Celebrating 10 years of TechWomen, the U.S. Department of State's premier exchange for women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced yesterday that the program, which pairs international emerging leaders in tech with American mentors at U.S.-based technology companies for a five-week mentorship exchange, will expand to angle the program for success in the decade ahead, as well as meet the needs of today. A part of the United States' broader public diplomacy efforts, TechWomen leverages technology to bring people together for mutual understanding, with an aim to create opportunity for more shared peace and prosperity.
