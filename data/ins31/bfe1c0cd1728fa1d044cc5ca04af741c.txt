Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently demanded that all Tesla staff return to the office full-time, according to an email sent to executive staff that was leaked on social media. In the email, Musk said that workers who don't want to come to office should "pretend to work somewhere else."
Yet this kind of authoritarian, top-down approach rooted in mistrust and false assumptions goes against best practices in management and office psychology. It speaks to an illusion of control that will undermine employee productivity, engagement, innovation, retention, and recruitment at Tesla.
