There are plenty of NHL games this weekend for a fantasy hockey comeback. Jason Chen examines who's worth starting and who's not.

There are 13 games in the NHL this Saturday, so chances are you'll face the nerve-wracking task of choosing who to bench with most teams in action. There are five games on Sunday as well with four of 10 clubs playing the second game of back-to-backs.

Games start at 1 p.m. eastern time on Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, so set those lineups in time to hold your lead or start the comeback.
