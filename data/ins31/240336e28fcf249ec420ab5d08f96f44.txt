New Hertha Berlin club president Kay Bernstein says he believes the use of pyrotechnics by fans inside football stadiums should be legalized. Bernstein, a former member of the Hertha ultra group "Harlekins Berlin" turned businessman who was elected president in June 2022, has proposed designating specific areas of stands for the use of flares and smoke bombs, with provisions made for them to be safely extinguished immediately after use. "I cannot accept anything which puts people in danger, or any form of violence," the 42-year-old insisted to German newspaper Die Zeit.
