REUTERS/Vladyslav SodelA barrage of Russian missiles struck Ukraine's capital early on Sunday, hitting unspecified "infrastructure" targets, Kyiv's mayor said. No one was reported killed, with one person hospitalized with injuries. But the attack shattered a sense of calm in Kyiv, which hadn't seen similar strikes since the April 28 visit of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The missile strikes hit the Darnytski and Dniprovski districts in the city and that emergency services had arrived to the scene, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app.
