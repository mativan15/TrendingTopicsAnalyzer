Oct. 16—The Recovery Center of Cameron County is celebrating its 25th anniversary knowing it could be serving three or four times as many clients if it had the personnel and state funding of a decade ago.

The center occupies a suite of offices in the old Rio Grande Valley Gas building at 355 West Elizabeth St. in Brownsville. It became its own entity in 1997 after beginning life as part of the Cameron County Housing Authority.

In 2011, the first year such records were kept, the center was serving more than 500 clients a year, director Cesar Garcia said.
