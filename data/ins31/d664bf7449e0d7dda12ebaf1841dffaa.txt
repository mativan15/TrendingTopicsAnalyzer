May 31—EAU CLAIRE — The Eau Claire County Sheriff's Office has requested $6.2 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to fund three different projects, including opening the fourth cell block "pod" in the jail.

The three proposed improvements are a direct response to increases in jail populations, as well as the need to meet pandemic operational requirements.

Jail Captain Dave Riewestahl said the Sheriff's Office is seeking to remodel the county jail's booking area, complete a fourth pod area and fund a one-time bonus for essential workers within the jail.
