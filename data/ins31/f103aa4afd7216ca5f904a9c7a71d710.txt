An oil company in trouble with Colorado regulators over a pattern of spills and leaks has hired its first environmental specialist to help the business meet state rules and reform the company culture.

Denver-based K.P. Kauffman Co. tapped an experienced environmental, health and safety executive — most recently with a major pipeline operator in the state — to make sure the business lives up to a five-year plan it agreed to last year with the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission to avoid being shut down.
