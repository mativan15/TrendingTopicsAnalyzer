By Australian Associated Press Published: 20:50 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 20:50 EDT, 17 October 2022 New Zealand is dismantling the legislative framework for most of its COVID-19 restrictions, but keeping its seven-day isolation and limited mask-wearing provisions as cases start to uptick again. In a milestone in New Zealand's fight against the virus, Jacinda Ardern's government is paring back the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act, passed in 2020, and revoking the epidemic notice. That means the legal basis for lockdowns, quarantine, vaccine obligations - including job mandates, passes and scanning in - are all gone.
