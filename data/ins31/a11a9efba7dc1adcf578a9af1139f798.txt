That means the Novavax vaccine can be used as a booster for the messenger RNA vaccines manufactured by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech. The Novavax shot was developed using a more traditional, protein-based technology and was the first such coronavirus vaccine in the United States using that approach.

The updated mRNA boosters target both the original coronavirus and the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants while the Novavax booster targets only the original strain. But the company has said its booster shot provides protection against several strains, including BA.
