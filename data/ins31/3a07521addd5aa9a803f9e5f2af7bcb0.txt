We Are Large valuation cuts occurred in the business development company ("BDC") sector last month as a result of the central bank raising interest rates to their highest level since 2008. As a result, BDCs such as Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc. (NYSE:BCSF) have begun to trade at a significant discount to net asset value. Even though I prefer to buy a BDC if the price is right, which is usually the case if a BDC's stock sells at a large enough discount to net asset value for me, I believe Bain Capital Specialty Finance has a too-narrow dividend safety margin.
