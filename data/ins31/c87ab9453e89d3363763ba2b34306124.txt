I moved to Merrimack, N.H., from Massachusetts in 1985. My husband and I wanted to raise our children in what we believed was a beautiful and safe environment. During our Fourth of July parades, the water department would give out water bottles with a label that read 'Best Tasting Water in NH!' We thought we were getting fresh, natural, clean water.In March 2016, I learned the water we drink, cook with, shower in, and give our pets was contaminated with PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).
