ATLETICO MADRID striker Joao Felix is reportedly seeking a transfer exit.
That's after 'losing patience' with Diego Simeone after playing less than 30 minutes in the last four games.

A Bola claims Felix, 22, has become frustrated with his role at Atletico, three-and-a-half years after his £114million move from Benfica.
The Portugal star is yet to find his best form at the Wanda Metropolitano.
But Felix has particularly struggled this term, failing to score one single goal.
