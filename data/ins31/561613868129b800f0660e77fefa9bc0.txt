A grandmother dissuaded her daughter-in-law from picking up her crying infant, and now the new mom is struggling with lingering rage.

Looking for input from other parents, the mom shared her story to the subreddit r/NewParents, where the post quickly gained over 800 upvotes and nearly 200 comments.

Now, much like the new mom who was shocked when her mother-in-law announced her rainbow baby on Facebook, this mom's story is sending shock waves through the Reddit parenting community.

According to the mom's post, whenever she's around her in-laws, she goes against her own instincts by ignoring the cries of her 5-month-old little boy — all because her in-laws feel the baby is 'manipulating' her in getting her to pick him up.
