The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth around Rs 1,317 crore linked to Ireo Group, which is alleged to have siphoned off Rs 1,225 crore of homebuyers' money and laundered it using tax havens such as British Virgin Islands.
The attached properties include commercial spaces, residential premises, land and bank accounts belonging to the company and its chairman-cum-managing director Lalit Goyal, associated entities and key managerial persons, the ED said in a statement. The agency had arrested Goyal from IGI Airport in November last year in connection with its money laundering probe.
