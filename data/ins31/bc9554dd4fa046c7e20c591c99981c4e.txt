Amazon (AMZN) is the most attractive internet pick in a slower global economy, Citi said Tuesday, further bolstering our that the company can maintain its leadership despite a weaker macro backdrop. The research note explains that Amazon can maintain strength in either a hard landing recession or a so-called soft landing, marked by a slowdown in economic growth that avoids a recession. Amazon can still gain wallet share, Citi says, even if the consumer weakens further. Wallet share refers to existing Amazon customers spending repeatedly on the company's products and services like Amazon Prime in an environment where consumer demand has fallen.
