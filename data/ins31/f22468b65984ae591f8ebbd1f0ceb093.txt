Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry is on the cusp of having a potentially historic day in front of the home fans inside Nissan Stadium during a divisional matchup against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 7.

As many of you already know, the Alabama product recently surpassed 7,000 rushing yards and 70 touchdowns for his legendary career.

Even more recently, the Titans' star back went on to tie Earl Campbell for the second-most touchdowns in franchise history (73) after totaling two touchdowns against the Commanders in Week 5.
