Jun. 2—After much delay and plenty of anxiety, the MIAA announced the state tournament pairings in baseball, softball and volleyball on Wednesday.

With the new power rankings system still having the kinks worked out, there was plenty of angst around the state. Even now that they're announced, the MIAA posted a disclaimer that these pairings are not official until 24 hours pass.

Area clubs qualified in both Division 1 and 4 baseball and softball. In Division 1 volleyball, No. 11 Haverhill leads the contingent of five area teams into the fray.
