Greg Taylor insists Celtic's 'intense' schedule in the lead-up to the winter break makes squad rotation a must.Boss Ange Postecoglou has been utilising his squad in recent weeks and made five changes on Wednesday as Celtic followed up their 6-1 rout of Hibs with a 4-0 League Cup quarter-final win at Motherwell.Taylor, who was restored to the side at Fir Park, said: "Everyone is hungry to play. When you get an opportunity, most boys at the moment are taking it."We know it's an intense period. I think we've got another seven games to go now [before the World Cup break] so there's going to be plenty of rotation and opportunities for boys to play.
