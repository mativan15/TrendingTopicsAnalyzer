The majority of Humm directors on Monday expressed their rationale for the deal with Latitude, which will mainly be paid in Latitude shares, by saying it was a 'highly compelling value proposition' for the company to expand in the buy now, pay later as it battles an industry-wide decline in margins.Abercrombie responded it was 'ironic' to cite the competitive environment as a reason to sell, arguing all players including Latitude were exposed to the same economic forces. 'The fact remains that this is a dud deal for shareholders, as it stands, and should be rejected outright,' he said.
