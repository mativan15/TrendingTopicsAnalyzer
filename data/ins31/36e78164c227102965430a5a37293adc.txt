Italy's new far-right leader has formed a coalition government and become the country's first woman prime minister. Giorgia Meloni and her cabinet will be sworn in on Saturday, a presidential palace official has announced. It is the first far-right-led government in Italy since the Second World War.
Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy - a party with neo-fascist roots - was the top vote-getter in Italy's national election last month, although it did not win enough votes to govern outright.Instead, Ms Meloni had to turn to her two main, sometimes troublesome, right-wing allies - Matteo Salvini and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.
