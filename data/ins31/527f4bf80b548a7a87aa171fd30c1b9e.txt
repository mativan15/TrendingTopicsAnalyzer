gece33/iStock via Getty Images Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) on Wednesday filed a preliminary prospectus for a five-part bond sale to help fund the defense contractor's stock buyback plan. The offering of investment-grade bonds will raise $3.5 billion to $4 billion, a person familiar with the deal told Bloomberg News. The longest-term part of the offering is 41 years and may have a yield that's 205 basis points greater than Treasuries, the unnamed source said. Lockheed yesterday increased its share repurchase plan by $14 billion, including a doubling of this year's buybacks to $8 billion.
