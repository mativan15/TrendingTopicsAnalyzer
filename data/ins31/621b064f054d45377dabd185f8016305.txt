Rafael Nadal captured his 14th French Open title and 22nd Grand Slam overall, extending the men's record tallies in both cases. Nadal steamrolled Norway's Casper Ruud 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 to raise his career record at Roland Garros to a staggering 112-3 since his first French Open in 2005.

The win was worth $2.35 million (€2.2 million) in prize money for the 36-year-old from Spain and pushed his career on-court earnings to $130.7 million, $100,000 ahead of Roger Federer and second all-time behind Novak Djokovic at $156.
