If your worries over inflation and how it will impact your investments are keeping you up at night, buying shares of companies that own and rent out healthcare facilities could be a ticket to sweeter dreams. Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA -1.74%) is one such company, and its stock price gain of more than 8.6% year to date makes it look especially appealing, particularly in comparison to the S&P 500, which is down by more than 12% in 2022.
But real estate investment trusts (REITs) vary widely in quality, and picking stocks based on a few months of outperforming the market is hardly a recipe for long-term wealth-building success.
