Louisville, Kentucky-based Manna Capital Partners is investing nearly $600 million to build an advanced beverage production and distribution complex in Montgomery.

The project, called 'beverage park,' will create 280 jobs. It will be owned and operated by Manna affiliate Manna Beverages & Ventures. The facility will encompass over 180 acres of a local industrial park and will include a 1.7-million-square-foot production facility for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic products and distribution operations.
