There might be thousands of dollars sitting around for some people who didn't file taxes this year — and the IRS wants to make sure they're still able to get that cash relief."This year, for the first time, families can get the child tax credit, even if they owe no tax and even if they don't have a job or business," IRS spokesperson Eric Smith told Insider.Last week, the IRS announced that it would begin sending out letters to over 9 million people and families who qualify for tax credits, but haven't collected them because they didn't file taxes.
