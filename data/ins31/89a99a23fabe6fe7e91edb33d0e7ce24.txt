NANNING, China, Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In recent years, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has released a series of policies to promote the development of "night economy". In response, all parts of the region have actively carried out "night economy" activities such as night eating-out, night viewing, night entertainment, night shopping and etc., through which the "traveler flow" turns into "traveler stay", thereby effectively activating night consumption and boosting economic growth.A number of national-level night culture and tourism consumption clusters, such as the "Three Streets and Two Alleys" in Nanning, ASEAN Culture and Tourism Area in Nanning, Yueye Dong Village in Liuzhou, East West Street in Guilin, Rongchuang Tourist Resort in Guilin, and Taiping Ancient Town Block in Chongzuo, have become the model for the development of "night economy" in Guangxi.
