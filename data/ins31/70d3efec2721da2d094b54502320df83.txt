Perhaps you are waiting for The Merge later this year as a price catalyst or have longer-term optimism for the coin. In my portfolio, it's a must-have - a true blue chip cryptocurrency to hold along with Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Now that you have ETH, why not put it to work for you? Can the prudent investor find a safe and reliable way to earn rewards while holding the coin? Crypto reward platforms provide liquidity to other institutions, charge them interest, and share some yield back with the investor.
