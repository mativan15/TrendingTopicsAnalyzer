The AAPI Security Camera Donation Program started last year to combat the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, which increased by 73% nationwide. In response to the violence, Verkada began the initiative close to home in the Bay Area, where anti-Asian violence had increased by 567% in San Francisco alone. To date, the $100,000 camera donation has allowed for an initial 100 cameras to be deployed in Asian-owned businesses across the Bay Area — providing businesses with an extra layer of security.

The program's expansion is driven by continuing attacks and mounting concern over the personal safety of vulnerable populations across the U.
