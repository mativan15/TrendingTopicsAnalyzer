North Andover materials company 6K is getting $50 million in federal infrastructure cash to help build a factory that uses a radically different way to make lithium-ion batteries.The grant, announced this week, will help cover the $107 million cost of a full-scale plant in the southeastern US, a region where companies like General Motors, Ford, and South Korean manufacturer LG are spending billions to erect battery manufacturing facilities for millions of electric cars. A location for the new plant has not yet been selected.
