The White House is following the lead of some of the biggest names in the private sector and will begin paying its interns, the Biden administration announced Thursday. 
Participants in the 14-week fall program will be paid at a rate of $750 per week and will receive the payments in two installments – the first at or near the start of the internship and the second after completing the program. 
Money for the paychecks will be taken out of the government funding bill passed earlier this year and will be applied to internships across the Executive Office of the President and the Office of the Vice President.
