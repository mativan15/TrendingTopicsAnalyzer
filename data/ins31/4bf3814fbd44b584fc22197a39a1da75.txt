Jürgen Klopp says he will not miss his rivalry with Pep Guardiola and is looking forward to the day when they can have a drink together. The duo go head-to-head competitively for the 26th time on Sunday when Manchester City visit Anfield with Klopp again preparing to face the man he describes as 'the best manager in the world'.The German and Spaniard have coached teams against each other for more than nine years, since Borussia Dortmund defeated Bayern Munich in the 2013 German Super Cup. Klopp has been victorious on 11 occasions to Guardiola's nine as the mutual respect has grown between the two.
