A 26-year-old man died from a complication caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine after a doctor gave him outdated information.
Jack Hurn's GP told him there was a one in 250,000 chance he would develop a blood clot from the jab when the likelihood was actually much lower at one in 50,000. 
At the time, under-40s were supposed to be offered an alternative to the AstraZenca shot because younger people are more at risk of developing problems with it. 
However, people are able to choose to receive the jab if their decision is properly informed.
