The Lakers are entering this contest banged up, as Troy Brown Jr., Thomas Bryant and Dennis Schroder will not play. Their injury situation will test their depth against the defending world champs.
An interesting thing to note is that over the last several years, L.A. has been surprisingly competitive with the Warriors, as it has had lots of unexpectedly close games with them and even a few upset wins.
However, given the circumstances, we expect the Lakers to drop this contest, and it could get ugly, especially since they'll be shorthanded.
