Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN -4.28%) had a day to forget, at least as far as its stock was concerned. The company's shares took a more than 4% hit after the company announced a pricey deal in the oncology space.
So what
Regeneron announced that it's buying out its partner Sanofi's (SNY 0.43%) stake in Libtayo, the cancer drug on which they've collaborated.
Under the terms of the arrangement, Regeneron would hold the exclusive development, commercialization, and manufacturing rights to the medication worldwide.
