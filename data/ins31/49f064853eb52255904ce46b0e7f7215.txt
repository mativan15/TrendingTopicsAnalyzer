The mystery of the pack of Marlboro cigarettes in the Campbell baseball dugout won't drag on.

A Campbell athletics official told Knox News on Sunday the package seen during an interview with Camels coach Justin Haire during Saturday night's game against Tennessee in the Knoxville Regional was nothing more than a prop carried over from the Big South Tournament.

"The empty box of cigarettes was discovered during the conference tournament and became a good luck prop for the team during the run through the conference tournament," Campbell assistant director of athletics communication Davis Dupree wrote in an email to Knox News.
