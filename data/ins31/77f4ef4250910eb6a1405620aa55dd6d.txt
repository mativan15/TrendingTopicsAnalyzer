A Washington Commanders fan who won a team raffle was shocked when he discovered the check with his winnings didn't clear.
 
Drew Shipley, a first-time Commanders season ticket holder, told local Washington news outlet WUSA9 that he won a 50/50 raffle on September 12. According to the outlet, the Commanders' 50/50 raffle awards half of the raffle's prize money to the Commanders Charitable Foundation and the other half to a fan.
 
Shipley said he reached out to the team in the following weeks but never heard back.
