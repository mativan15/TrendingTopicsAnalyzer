Blue Origin sent up its fifth-ever New Shepard rocket with humans on board. The NS-21 mission lifted off at 9:26 a.m. EDT Saturday from the company's West Texas facility with six people on board, one of them the company's first repeat customer. The tourism rocket launches and lands in about 11 minutes offering those on board a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of the Earth's curvature as it speeds up past the Karman line - about 62 miles high - the internationally recognized altitude for someone having gone into space.
