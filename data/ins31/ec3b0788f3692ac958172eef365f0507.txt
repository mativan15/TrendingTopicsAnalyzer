Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two most valued cryptocurrencies, failed to gain steam on Friday morning, registering minor movements over the last 24 hours. Other popular altcoins — including the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) — saw a mixed bag of minor gains and losses across the board. Among lesser-known altcoins, the Toncoin (TON) token emerged to be the biggest gainer in the last 24 hours, with a gain of nearly 10 percent. Ethereum Name Service (ENS), on the other hand, turned out to be the biggest loser.
