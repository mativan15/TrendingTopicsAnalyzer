Macy's (M 0.52%) stock jumped by 19% on Thursday, May 26, after announcing earnings before the markets opened. The retailer reported better-than-expected profits and raised targets for the rest of the year. But even after soaring on the good news, the stock is not expensive.
Measuring by its price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios, Macy's is selling near its lowest valuation in a decade. Meanwhile, the company's prospects are improving as management has adjusted the business to better align with current consumer tastes.
