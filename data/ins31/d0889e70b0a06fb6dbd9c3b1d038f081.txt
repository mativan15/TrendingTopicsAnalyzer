Published on Jun 02, 2022 05:06 PM IST Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a scathing attack on the BJP and Narendra Modi government at the centre, days after Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection to a money laundering case. In a special TV address, Kejriwal claimed that he has proof that the Modi government was next targeting Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a fake case. The Aam Aadmi Party later tweeted a document claiming evidence of Kejriwal's claim.
