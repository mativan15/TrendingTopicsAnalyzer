MILWAUKEE — Marquette wants to build on the strides it made last year in coach Shaka Smart's debut season.

The Golden Eagles went 19-13 and reached the NCAA Tournament, a marked improvement from their 13-14 performance in 2020-21 that resulted in Steve Wojciechowski's firing. But a late-season slide showed that Marquette still has plenty of room for improvement as it tries to develop into a legitimate Big East contender.

That could take some time. Marquette must replace three of its top four scorers from last season, including first-team all-Big East selection Justin Lewis.
