An elephant calf has been filmed alone, after its twin died in a severe drought gripping northern Kenya.The incredibly rare elephant twins were first spotted in January this year, in the Samburu National Park.Twins form only one percent of all elephant births, meaning the find caused quite a stir among research groups at the time. Conservation charity Save the Elephants has been monitoring the twins ever since.It is incredibly rare for elephant twins to survive in usual circumstances, as mothers do not usually produce enough milk for two calves.
