Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin River Valleys has received a $4.2 million donation from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, part of an $84.5 million donation awarded to Girl Scouts of the USA and 29 of its 111 local councils across the country.

It represents the largest donation from a single individual ever made to the national organization, and it's the largest unrestricted gift given to the River Valleys chapter, it said in a news release. Scott is the ex-wife of Amazon.com Inc. founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos.
