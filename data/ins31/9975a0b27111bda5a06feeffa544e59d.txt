American currency will feature an Asian American for the first time next week when the U.S. Mint begins releasing quarters featuring Anna May Wong, an actor and activist who rose to stardom in Western films against all odds in the first half of the 20th century.

The Mint will begin shipping quarters featuring Wong's face on the reverse (or 'tails') side starting next Monday, as part of the American Women Quarters Program ― an act of Congress that calls for five women to be featured on quarters every year from 2022 through 2025.
