Some retailers at the Port of Sydney Development Corporation's downtown marine terminal say plans to diversify business operations seem to be showing early signs of success, but the corporation's plans for further commercial development are on hold, for now.The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the cruise ship industry for two years and port CEO Marlene Usher said losing nearly 70 per cent of the marine terminal's revenues exposed the weakness of relying on only one major source of income.As a result, the port has brought in a wider range of businesses and extended hours of operation to attract local shoppers to the Joan Harriss Pavilion and its giant fiddle statue.
