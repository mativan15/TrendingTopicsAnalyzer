Pop star Guy Sebastian has been recalled for questioning in the trial of his former manager after sending text messages to a witness about evidence in court.

The Australian Idol winner completed his cross-examination on May 24, but after another witness - Christian Bugno - revealed the pair exchanged text messages about disputed evidence before that date, he was brought back to the NSW District Court on Monday.

In 2016 Mr Bugno arranged for the entertainer to perform at his Venice wedding, and says his father paid for the business-class flights of Sebastian and his manager Titus Emanuel Day.
