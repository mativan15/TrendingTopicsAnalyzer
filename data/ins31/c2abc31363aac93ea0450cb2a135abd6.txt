The High Court of Karnataka has directed the State government to fix the fare of app-based autorickshaw aggregators within 15 days.Till then, the court allowed the service providers to also collect 10 per cent additional charge above the fare already fixed by the government. The government last fixed the autorickshaw fares on June 11, 2021. One of the reasons for the government to ban app-based autorickshaw-hailing service was that they were charging surcharge over and above the fare fixed by the government.
