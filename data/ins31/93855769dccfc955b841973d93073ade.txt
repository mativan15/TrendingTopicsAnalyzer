The City of Fredericton says it's transitioning its buses toward being green, but isn't totally done with diesel just yet.Fredericton Transit is beginning its "slow transition" toward zero emissions by committing to no longer purchase any buses that are powered solely by diesel, said Scott Brown, manager of building and fleet services for the city.In their place, Brown said the city will be purchasing diesel-electric hybrid buses, which have shown to emit between 35 and 40 per cent fewer greenhouse gases than the buses currently on the road.
