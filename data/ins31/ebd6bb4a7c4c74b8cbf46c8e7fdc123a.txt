Islamabad, Pakistan – The global money laundering and financing watchdog on Friday removed Pakistan from its list of countries under 'increased monitoring' after four years.
Pakistan has been on the 'grey list' of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) since 2018 because of 'strategic counter-terrorist financing-related deficiencies'.
The removal decision was announced by FATF President T Raja Kumar at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris, France.
'Pakistan had addressed technical deficiencies to meet the commitments of its action plans,' Kumar said in his speech.
