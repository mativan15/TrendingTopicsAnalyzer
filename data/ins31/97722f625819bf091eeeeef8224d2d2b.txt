European Union leaders on Friday gave the green light to a plan to provide Ukraine with 18 billion dollars in financial support over the next year, after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia is trying to spark a refugee exodus by destroying his country's energy infrastructure.The plan, endorsed at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, would see the 27-nation bloc match U.S. financial support for war-ravaged Ukraine in monthly installments."Ukraine is telling us that they need approximately 3-4 billion euros per month to have enough resources for the basics," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.
