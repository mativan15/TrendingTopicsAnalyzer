Oct. 15—WATERTOWN — Five years ago, Logan Nichols was a Sackets Harbor High School student when he participated in a tour of MetalCraft Marine US as part of Manufacturing Day.

Now 20, Mr. Nichols is a specialized welder/fitter building custom boats for the U.S. Coast Guard at MetalCraft, a Kingston, Ontario-based company that has manufacturing operations in Watertown and Cape Vincent.

On Friday, a group of about 15 Lyme High School students came through the Fisher Road facility in the Jefferson County Corporate Park during a tour for this year's North Country Manufacturing Day.
