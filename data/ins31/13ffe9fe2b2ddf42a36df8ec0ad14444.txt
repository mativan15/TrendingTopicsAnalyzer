Julia Roberts Has George Clooney Saved Under The Most Epic Name In Her Phone Contacts

Julia Roberts is opening up about a special nickname she uses for longtime pal George Clooney.

During an interview Thursday to promote the upcoming film 'Ticket to Paradise,' YouTuber Jake Hamilton asked the pair how they've saved each other's contact info in their cellphones.

Roberts was quick to reveal that she has her co-star marked as 'Batman Cell.'

'There's no picture, but George is in my phone under the code name ‘Batman Cell,'' the 54-year-old said, nodding to his titular role as the Caped Crusader in 1997's 'Batman & Robin.
