Fayez Sarofim, the billionaire money manager, died Saturday at his home in Houston, at age 93. 'I've always claimed it took someone from abroad to recognize the true potential in this country,' said Fayez Shalaby Sarofim in his first interview with Forbes Magazine in 1969. Back then Sarofim — 41 at the time — was a money man on the rise. The native-born Egyptian was known as The Sphinx for his inscrutable demeanor and his calm, unshakable faith in American exceptionalism.
