British Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday — bowing to the inevitable after a tumultuous, short-lived term in which her policies triggered turmoil in financial markets and a rebellion in her party that obliterated her authority.Making a hastily scheduled statement outside her 10 Downing Street office, Truss acknowledged that 'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.'Hers is the third resignation by a Conservative prime minister in as many years and leaves a divided party seeking a leader who can unify its warring factions.
