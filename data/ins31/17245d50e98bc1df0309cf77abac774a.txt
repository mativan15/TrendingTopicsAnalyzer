MONROE, Conn., Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elidah (www.elidah.com), a femtech medical device startup, is excited that preliminary studies have shown that ELITONE® (www.elitone.com), the first non-surgical, external treatment for pelvic floor disorders, is effective for both urge and stress urinary incontinence. After a recent 6-week trial, urge incontinence episodes were reduced by more than two thirds with a majority of subjects achieving a clinically significant reduction. One in three women suffer from pelvic floor disorders, which can cause issues including embarrassing leaks, known as incontinence.
