The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday arrested Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain in connection with a money laundering probe against him, his family members and associates.His party alleged that he was been harassed because Jain was AAP's chief election strategist for the upcoming assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was fast losing ground.Jain was arrested under Prevention of Money Laundering Act after around four hours of questioning on Monday, during which he gave evasive replies on the money trail, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.
