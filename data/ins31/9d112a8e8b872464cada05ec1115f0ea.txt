The Forest department has intensified steps to capture the tiger on the prowl at Cheeral under the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Sanctuary officials constituted a 40-member special team consisting of trackers and veterinarians for combing operations on Saturday. The team was divided into four groups and they searched the entire area. However, they could not trace the animal, warden Abdul Azeez told The Hindu.
