David Tennant has revealed he was in the running to be cast as James Bond instead of Daniel Craig – but only found out years later.
The Doctor Who actor had no idea he was floated as an option to play 007 until he was told that producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson had put him on the coveted list before Daniel was cast.
Asked if he had ever been in the running, David, 51, said: ‘I never believed I had, until I worked with a director recently who had worked with the Broccolis who said, 'Yeah, you were on the list that time,'‘ he said.
