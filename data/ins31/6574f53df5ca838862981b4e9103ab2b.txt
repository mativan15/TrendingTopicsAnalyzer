FALL RIVER — A Taunton resident who owns a food and beverage vending machine company has been charged with defrauding 'multiple victims who purchased vending machine routes from his company.'

A Bristol County Superior Court grand jury on May 6 indicted Kevin Lennon, 54, president of KBL Inc., on three counts of theft over $1,200 and two counts of 'publishing false or exaggerated statements.'

State Assistant Attorney General Gretchen Brodigan and investigators allege Lennon defrauded multiple victims who purchased vending machines routes from KBL Vending Inc.
