There weren't many people buying into the Falcons prior to the season, but the team's 3-3 start has helped change the narrative. Atlanta is tied with Tampa Bay for the best record in the NFC South, and if not for a controversial roughing the passer penalty when these two teams faced off, the Falcons could easily be sitting atop the division.

Going forward, the team has a real shot at returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2017. According to Pro Football Focus, the Falcons have the NFL's easiest remaining schedule.
