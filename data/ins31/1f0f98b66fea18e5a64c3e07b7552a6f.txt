Fearing a threat to his son's life, slain Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala's father followed him with guards when he did not take his security men with him and witnessed the 28-year-old fall to a hail of bullets, according to an FIR. Balkaur Singh, who took Moosewala and two others to a civil hospital on Sunday after the attack in Mansa district, said in his police complaint that his son would get threats to his life from gangsters for extortion.

On Sunday, when he learnt that Moosewala had left home without his security guards or his bullet-proof vehicle, he went after him.
