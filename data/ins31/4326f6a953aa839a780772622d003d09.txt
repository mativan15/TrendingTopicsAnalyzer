A bruising year for Snap Inc.'s shares worsened Thursday, as the stock plummeted more than 20% in after-hours trading as executives launched the company's first major share-repurchase program amid revenue issues in a poor environment for online advertising. Snap SNAP, -0.64% executives revealed that revenue increased less than 6% year-over-year in the quarter, and said that the holiday season is shaping up similarly, with sales increasing 9% so far in the quarter. The social-media company, which laid off roughly 20% of its staff this summer in response to the issues, also declined to provide a full forecast for the important fourth quarter.
