Charles William ('Bill') White made his living by dying.

By the time he moved to Fort Worth in 1965, he had already died 10 times. You see, White billed himself as 'the Living Corpse': He traveled around the country to be buried as a publicity stunt for drive-in theaters, taverns, automobile dealerships and other businesses.

White typically was buried in a plywood coffin that was roomy enough to allow him to lie flat. A vertical shaft provided him with air. He communicated via a microphone and a telephone, chatting with followers and reporters.
