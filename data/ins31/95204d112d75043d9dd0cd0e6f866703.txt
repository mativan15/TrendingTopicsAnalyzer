Published: 09:10 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 09:13 EDT, 15 October 2022 HBO 'Real Time' host Bill Maher on Friday said the GOP backs candidates like Herschel Walker to push back against woke Democrats who continue to push their woke agenda.'Part of the appeal of a Herschel Walker or a Donald Trump or any number of egregious a**holes Republicans have backed is, in their mind, the worst a candidate is, the more it says to Democrats, "we don't like what you're selling,"' he said. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Georgia Senate hopeful Herschel Walker, 60, paid for a woman's abortion in 2009 despite running on an anti-abortion political platform, and she claims he also urged her to terminate a second pregnancy.
