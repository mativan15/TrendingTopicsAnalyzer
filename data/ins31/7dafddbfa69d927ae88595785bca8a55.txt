Investing.com - European stock markets fell Friday, as rising bond yields reinforced expectations of an economic slowdown while U.K. political turmoil continued.

By 03:55 ET (07:55 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France edged 1.4% lower and U.K.'s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.

European bond yields have climbed sharply higher Friday, following on from U.S. Treasury yields rising to 14-year highs overnight, as the prospect of further aggressive interest rate hikes from not only the Federal Reserve but also the European Central Bank and the Bank of England soured investor sentiment.
