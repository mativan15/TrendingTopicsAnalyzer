An asteroid didn't wipe out these dinosaurs.
Vandals are responsible for an extinction event at a New Jersey Jurassic Park, where mammoth sculptures of dinosaurs were destroyed two weeks ago.
The heartbroken artist, Robin Ruggiero, 54, used dead wood, loose branches, vines, bark and animal bones to construct seven sculptures in the woods of Allaire State Park, including a mama, papa and baby pteranodon, stegosaurus and T-rex. 
'Whatever their intentions were, they affected a whole community of people,' a crestfallen Ruggiero told The Post, noting the destruction left kids in tears, wrecked wedding and engagement photo shoots, and grounded high school field trips.
