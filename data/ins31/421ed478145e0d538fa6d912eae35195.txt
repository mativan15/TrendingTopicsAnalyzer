Lee said he told Premier Li Keqiang there are 'a lot of challenges and difficulties' to overcome before travel with the mainland can resume. 'I will start seeking communication with the mainland side, to explain the Hong Kong situation to them,' Lee said Tuesday at a press conference at Hong Kong International Airport, held shortly after he touched down from Beijing.
