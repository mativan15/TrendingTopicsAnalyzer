Grandbrothers/iStock Editorial via Getty Images The ADRs of U.K.-based biotech Midatech Pharma (NASDAQ:MTP) added ~50% in the pre-market Wednesday after the company announced that the FDA issued the Fast Track designation for its development program of MTX110 in recurrent glioblastoma ("rGBM"). A rapidly growing and aggressive brain tumor, rGBM is characterized by short survival rates and frequent recurrence. MTX110, a water-soluble formulation of Panobinostat, would soon undergo a company-sponsored Phase I study targeting rGBM, Chief Scientific Officer of Midatech (MTP) Dmitry Zamoryakhin said.
