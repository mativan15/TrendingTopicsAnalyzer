Elon Musk renewed his feud with Bill Gates in a series of tweets in which he slammed his fellow tech billionaire for holding a short position on Tesla shares worth as much as $2 billion.
Musk revisited the issue shortly after he shared a poll asking his Twitter followers whether they found politicians or billionaires to be less trustworthy. More than 75% of the respondents said they trusted politicians less.
One follower quipped that they trusted Musk but not Gates, prompting the Tesla CEO to call out Gates' bet against his electric vehicle firm.
