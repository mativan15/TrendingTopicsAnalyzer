The Senate has its eye on bolstering retirement savings, months after the House approved the Secure Act 2.0.  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, also known as HELP, released a legislative draft that would encourage Americans to save more in emergency and retirement accounts as well as gain more widespread access to employer-sponsored accounts if they don't already have one. The proposal is called the Retirement Improvement and Savings Enhancement to Supplement Healthy Investments for the Nest Egg Act, otherwise known as the RISE and SHINE Act.
