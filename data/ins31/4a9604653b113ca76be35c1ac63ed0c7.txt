George Kittle and many of the NFL's tight ends will gather in a few weeks for the second Tight End University camp. They'll watch film, run routes, catch passes and surely talk about being underpaid as a position group. The idea to bring all the tight ends together generated from Kittle inviting Greg Olsen to work out with him in Nashville last year. Olsen, the three-time Pro Bowler who will become the lead analyst for Fox, suggested they turn it into an event. Travis Kelce loved the idea and it grew from there.
