For the first time in 16 years, both Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi finished outside the top three in the Ballon d'Or standings, as this year's award was scooped by Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema.Since 2005, the two superstars have dominated world soccer's most prestigious individual award, which is awarded to the best men's soccer player of the year by a vote of 100 journalists worldwide. Between them, the pair have won the prize 12 times. But at Monday's award ceremony in Paris, Ronaldo finished 20th, his lowest ranking in 17 years, while Messi, who won his seventh award last year, did not make the shortlist for the first time since 2005.
