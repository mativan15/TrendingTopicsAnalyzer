The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will award $2.8 billion in grants for projects to expand U.S. manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles and domestic mineral production. The grants will enable manufacturing and processing companies in at least 12 states to extract and process more lithium, graphite, nickel and other battery materials. The announcement is part of the administration's broader push to transition the U.S. away from gas-powered cars to EVs. The Biden administration on Wednesday said it will award $2.
