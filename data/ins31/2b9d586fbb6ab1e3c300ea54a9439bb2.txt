The inaugural Epic Carnival Experience (ECE) promises an all-inclusive Trinidad Carnival experience that lives up to its name. After two years without Carnival due to COVID, Trinidad anticipates a monumental comeback. While flight and stay accommodations are limited, if not fully booked, ECE offers a way to make your 2023 Carnival dreams still come true.

Marketed as 'the only all-inclusive hotel experience in Trinidad & Tobago for Carnival 2023,' ECE's one-of-a-kind floatel concept is attracting Carnival newbies and seasoned visitors.
