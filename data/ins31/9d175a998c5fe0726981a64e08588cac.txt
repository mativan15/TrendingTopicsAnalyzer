The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is now up 10% from a cycle low reached on May 20th, with even bigger moves in many of the most beaten-down segments. Our message here is that we see more upside with everything coming together for the market to surprise even higher. The S&P is still down about 12% in 2022 but keep in mind that many of the factors responsible for volatility between record inflation, climbing interest rates, a more hawkish Fed, and even the Russia-Ukraine crisis are old news.
