MADISON, Wis. — The University of Wisconsin System's new president said Thursday that he wants to continue a freeze on tuition for in-state graduates through at least the next academic year. Jay Rothman took over as president on Wednesday. He held a short question-and-answer session with reporters on Thursday. He said that system officials plant to present their 2022-23 budget to regents next week and the spending plan will include the freeze. Tuition for in-state undergraduates has remained flat for the last nine years.
