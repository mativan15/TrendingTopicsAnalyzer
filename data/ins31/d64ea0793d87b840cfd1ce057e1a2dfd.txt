The Montclair Film Festival, which became a hub for awards-seeking filmmakers when it moved to the fall from spring during the pandemic, kicks off Oct. 21 with a mix of high-profile narrative films and documentaries in addition to panels and master classes.

Darren Aronofsky's 'The Whale,' Maria Schrader's 'She Said,' Noah Baumbach's 'White Noise,' and Sarah Polley's 'Women Talking,' are among the Oscar hopefuls that will screen at the 10-day fest based in the affluent, northern New Jersey suburb that is home to entertainment creatives including Stephen Colbert.
