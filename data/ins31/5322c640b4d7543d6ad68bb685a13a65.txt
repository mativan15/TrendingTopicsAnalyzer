The Rev. Edison Bernavas wandered the verdant land surrounding Saint Francis of Assisi Catholic Church.

Almost 20 open acres stretched before him in the church's complex in Mango, a community just east of Tampa.

'We have a huge property — why not have something where seniors could be living in decent houses?' Bernavas said in a news release.
