After a year-long run as interim CEO at AMC Networks, Matt Blank is joining the board of directors at the entertainment company. The New York-headquartered Better Call Saul and Interview With the Vampire programmer has expanded its board from 14 members to 15 members and installed Blank as a director, AMC said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Blank was enlisted by the company last August as a temporary replacement for the top executive role after CEO Josh Sapan stepped away from the position following a 26-year run and transitioned to executive chairman.
