When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have enjoyed a 81% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 62% (not including dividends).
