Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tried to lay out the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties on Sunday, saying the former is trying to "find solutions" to the inflation crisis while the latter is busy "going to war with Mickey Mouse." During an appearance on ABC News' "This Week," Buttigieg was asked by host George Stephanopoulos to give advice to Democrats who are facing a tough midterm election due to the state of the economy."The bottom line is that there are two very clear and very different approaches here," Buttigieg responded.
