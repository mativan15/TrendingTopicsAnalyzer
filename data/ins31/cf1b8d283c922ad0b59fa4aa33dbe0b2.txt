In a major speech, President Xi Jinping has said China would "never promise to renounce the use of force" against Taiwan—prompting applause from delegates."We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification," Xi said as the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress kicked off in Beijing. "But we will never promise to renounce the use of force. And we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary."Taiwan has maintained a separate government from China since 1949, but China claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory.
