Professors at the University of Virginia School of Law have a few tips for first-year J.D. students to consider as they begin choosing their first elective courses for the spring.

First-years start the lottery process for spring courses on Oct. 27 at noon and finish Oct. 31 at 9 a.m. A drop/add/waitlist phase continues through January (see schedule). Students can start enrolling in January term courses Nov. 18.
