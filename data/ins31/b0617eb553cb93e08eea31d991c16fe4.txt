Starlink will continue to fund the satellite network providing battlefield communications for the Ukrainian military during the war with Russia, according to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk."The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free," Musk tweeted on Saturday. This comes after Musk asked the U.S. Defense Department to take over funding the Starlink satellite network on Friday, a U.S. official told NBC News.
