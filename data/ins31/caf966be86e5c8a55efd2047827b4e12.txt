The US Trade Representative (USTR) has questioned India for the country's growing spurious medicine problem. According to the USTR report, nearly 20% of all pharmaceutical goods sold in the Indian market are counterfeit, which is a damning claim given India's growing pharmaceutical market and its decades-long reputation as the 'pharmacy of the world.'
The Indian pharmaceutical industry ranks third in the world in terms of volume, supplying 20% of the global demand for generic drugs. With a strong network of  3,000 drug companies and approximately 10,500 manufacturing units spread across the country, if timely efforts are not taken now, India may lag behind due to a lack of quality pharma products.
