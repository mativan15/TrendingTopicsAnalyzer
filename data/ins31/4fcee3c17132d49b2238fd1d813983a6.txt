SEOUL, Oct 18 (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor is considering options for its suspended Russia operations that could include selling its manufacturing plant there, South Korean media reported on Tuesday.

Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of high-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of Western manufacturers since Moscow sent armed forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Hyundai Motor recently submitted to management a report analysing its future prospects in Russia due to the difficult operating environment, Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said, citing an unidentified auto industry source.
