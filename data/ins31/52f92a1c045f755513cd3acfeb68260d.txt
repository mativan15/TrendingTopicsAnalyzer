Jeremy Hunt is UK prime minister in all but name. Liz Truss is nothing more than a specter walking the corridors of power, occasionally wailing and clanking her chains. On Monday, she didn't even take an 'urgent question' — posed by Labour — on what on earth is going on, leaving the job to her former leadership rival, Penny Mordaunt. She also turned up late and looked miserable. Hunt is now both the public face of the government, routinely acting as its spokesman in parliament and the media. He is also its leading decision-maker, tearing up almost all of Truss's budget and starting from scratch.
