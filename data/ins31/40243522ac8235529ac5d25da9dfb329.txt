The Department of Justice has charged a former executive at OpenSea in connection with an NFT insider trading scheme, the agency announced on Wednesday. It is the first time that such charges have been laid in the realm of digital assets. Nathan Chastain was the head of product for OpenSea, which is the largest online marketplace for NFTs. Prosecutors allege that Chastain used his insider knowledge to purchase NFTs from collections that were about to be featured on the marketplace's homepage for personal financial gain.
