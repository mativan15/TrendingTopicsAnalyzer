SAN DIEGO — One-hundred and eleven wins, melted away in five short nights. The Los Angeles Dodgers, going, going, one reliever at a time toward gone in the seventh inning as the San Diego Padres strung together the rally of their lives.

The Dodgers didn't know what hit them in a mustard-colored Padres lightning strike Saturday night, and it might take them all winter to figure it out.

With five sudden runs in the bottom of the seventh, the Padres delivered a 5-3 knockout punch. The Dodgers go home, and the Padres advance to a most unexpected National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies who eliminated the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves in the other N.
