Job seekers in the United States are calling on businesses to start displaying their salary ranges on job adverts, saying salary transparency should be employers' number one priority on postings.It's fairly common for U.S. employers to not disclose their salary ranges publicly, with large corporations from Amazon to UPS listed amongst the worst offenders for lack of salary transparency, according to research by the national job search website Adzuna.Applebee's, Deloitte, PwC, Shell, Safeway, Walgreens, Walmart, Pizza Hut, and Target were also ranked low on the list when it comes to telling job seekers how much their job is salaried, with only 3 percent of job ads including a salary range.
