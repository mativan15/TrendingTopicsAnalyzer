Logitech's G Cloud Gaming Handheld is a heartbreaker. It's a joy to game on: it's much more comfortable to use than the Nintendo Switch, and when the conditions are right, it works like a dream. With a good connection to a cloud gaming service, it often felt like I was using a portable Xbox, or had somehow crammed a $1,500 gaming PC into a tiny footprint. The rest of the time, it's a mediocre Android tablet with a controller grafted on. It's just not fun to use. Sure, it can access a huge library of Android games, but trying to play the likes of Fortnite or Genshin Impact on its sluggish hardware was an exercise in frustration.
