A Kansas man accused of scamming people out of more than $1 million through his autopsy business pleaded guilty to a federal fraud charge Thursday.

Shawn Parcells, a self-taught pathologist from Leawood, Kansas, pleaded guilty in federal court in Topeka. Under sentencing guidelines, Parcells could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined up to $250,000, according to court records.

In February, Parcells announced an intent to change his plea. He is scheduled for sentencing Aug. 25 and nine other counts remain pending.
