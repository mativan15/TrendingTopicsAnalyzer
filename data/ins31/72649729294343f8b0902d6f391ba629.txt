ST. ALBANS, Vt. (AP) — A man arrested in Vermont last week agreed Thursday to return to New Hampshire to face charges in the April shooting deaths of a Concord couple.

Logan Clegg, 26, waived extradition during an online hearing in Vermont Superior Court in St. Albans, and New Hampshire authorities said they were prepared to pick him up immediately.

Clegg, was arrested last week in South Burlington on an unrelated fugitive from justice charge from Utah after New Hampshire detectives alerted police.
