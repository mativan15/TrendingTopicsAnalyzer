BRP Group is making inroads into the Florida property insurance market with the launch of two new AM Best-rated homeowners insurance products earlier this year, and the insurance brokerage is planning to roll out more insurance offerings by early 2023, CEO Trevor Baldwin told the Tampa Bay Business Journal.

'We're bringing much-needed capacity to the state,' Baldwin said. 'These are two of the first homeowners' solutions to be brought to market in years.'

BRP's new products are a direct response to the dwindling — and unaffordable — options available for Florida homeowners, he said.
