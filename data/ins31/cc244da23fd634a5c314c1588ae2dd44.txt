A survey of madrassas across the state of Uttar Pradesh has identified about 7,500 unrecognised madrassas. UP madrassa board chairman Iftikhar Ahmed Javed said these madrassas will not be considered illegal but instead will be given chance to be recognised after fulfilling required criteria. He said such recognition will open doors for funds and modernisation.
