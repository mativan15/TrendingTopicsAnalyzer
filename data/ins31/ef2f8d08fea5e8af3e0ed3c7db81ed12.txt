LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Los Angeles Rams' injury luck had been largely excellent during the first five years of coach Sean McVay's career.

His sixth season has been a prolonged test of the Rams' ability to persevere through a run of poor health at key positions.

They're meeting the challenge so far, even if they don't look like championship contenders just yet.

The defending Super Bowl champions are 3-3 heading into their bye week despite playing the season to date with a patchwork offensive line and a sketchy secondary.
