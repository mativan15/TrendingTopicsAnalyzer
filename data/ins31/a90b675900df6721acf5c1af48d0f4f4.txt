First of three stories on candidates for U.S. Senate in Alaska in the Nov. 8 general election.

Days before Alaska's first open primary election in August, U.S. Senate candidate Pat Chesbro stood before an audience to make her case. This election needs the voice of a Democrat, she opened.

"I am determined in this race to say what I think is important to say," she said.

Chesbro introduced her background and the issues that compelled her to run: gun violence, abortion rights and climate change among them.
