Interpol arrested 75 suspected members of the Black Axe West African crime syndicate, and intercepted over $1 million in various bank accounts as part of a wide-ranging multi-country operation aimed at thwarting the group's cyber-fraud efforts that fund its criminal operations.
According to the international police agency, Operation Jackal spanned 14 countries on four continents targeting Black Axe and related crime groups in the region. Law enforcement officials raided 49 properties and seized what Interpol called an "immense quantity of assets" – including 12,000 SIM cards – that spawned investigative leads that have potentially identified 70 more suspects.
