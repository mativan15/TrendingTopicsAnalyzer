Credit card borrowing is rising at its fastest annual rate in 17 years, the Bank of England said on Tuesday, with analysts warning a recession looks increasingly likely as growing numbers of households go into debt to make ends meet.The annual growth rate for credit card borrowing hit 11.6% in April – the highest figure since November 2005. The rate for all consumer credit increased to 5.7% in April from 5.2% in March, rising faster than at any time since just before the pandemic.The latest data shows a 'divided nation', analysts said, with millions borrowing money to buy food while others splashed out on treats and luxuries using their credit cards.
