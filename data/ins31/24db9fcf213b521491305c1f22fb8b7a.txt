Ken Komperda is one of four people who live at 4 W. Bailey Road, a Naperville house that must be vacated after its owner pleaded guilty to charges he violated city ordinances by running illegal boarding houses and submitted false court statements.'There are many of us that are now going to be homeless because of this and, in reality, it doesn't seem like anybody in Naperville cares. They just want us out of their town,' Komperda said.He understands why people were upset by what was happening in their neighborhood, but 'I'm a victim in this just like apparently these neighbors are,' he said.
