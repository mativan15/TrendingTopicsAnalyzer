British Prime Minister Liz Truss is not long for 10 Downing, a senior Conservative MP told the UK Telegraph on Wednesday. 'I'd now be calling the relatives to say it is hours, not days,' the individual told associate editor Christopher Hope.After rumors Truss had fired Chief Whip Wendy Morton in the lobby of the House of Commons and 'marched her out,' leading her deputy Craig Whittaker to resign in protest, the government issued an official denial on Wednesday night, insisting both were still in their posts.
