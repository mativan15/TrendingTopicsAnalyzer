The European Commission is facing fresh calls to make good on its 2017 antitrust decision against Google Shopping by banning Google from displaying its own shopping comparison ads units in search results -- boxes which Google populates with revenue-generating ads -- as they argue the self-preferencing units constitute an ongoing competition abuse by the adtech giant.

The 2017 Commission decision found Google abused its dominance by systematically giving prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service and demoting rival comparison shopping services in search results.
