Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland proposed to City Council today an ambitious plan to invest $684 million into renovating the three biggest local sports venues and building a fourth over the next several years.

The pitch would include major, extensive renovations to FedExForum and Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium; minor updates to AutoZone Park; and a new build at the site of the Mid-South Coliseum to be home of Memphis 901 FC.

"There is no doubt in my mind that sports does many things," Strickland told City Council.
