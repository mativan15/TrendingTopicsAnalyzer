Liz Truss is facing calls to turn down a Prime Minister's allowance of up to £115,000 a year because she was only in office for 44 days.
The Public Duties Cost Allowance (PDCA), which was introduced after Margaret Thatcher resigned in 1991, is designed to support former PMs in their public duties after they leave office.
