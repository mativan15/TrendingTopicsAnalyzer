Cleveland hasn't won the World Series since 1948 and they made this October really special, but unfortunately they fell one game short of an A.L.C.S. appearance in Houston.

The 2022 magical season for the Cleveland Guardians has finally ended. In the fifth and decisive game in the American League Division Series, the New York Yankees knocked Cleveland out of World Series contention with a 5-1 win.

Perhaps the outcome would have been different if they played Game 5 last night, but maybe not.
