Good morning, Chicago.

In their final debate of the campaign, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker accused Republican challenger Darren Bailey of being a 'threat to democracy' over his support for former President Donald Trump. Bailey countered with a new name for Chicago, labeling it 'Pritzkerville' in blaming the governor for its problems with crime, education and business retention.

The hourlong debate came with three weeks until Election Day and found both candidates trodding through well-worn themes, such as crime and abortion rights, as each blasted the other as an 'extremist.
