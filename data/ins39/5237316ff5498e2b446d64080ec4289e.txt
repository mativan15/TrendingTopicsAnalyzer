The new Prince of Wales is showing how "seriously" he takes the role of monarch he is destined to inherit from his father King Charles III also through the choice of aides he has made during the years, according to a royal author. Valentine Low, a royal correspondent who recently penned the book Courtiers: The Hidden Power Behind the Crown, noted Prince William has chosen over the years to be supported by some aides who don't have the background traditionally held by most of their colleagues. Rather, the Prince of Wales has picked people who worked with the Government before joining the Royal Household.
