Stormont parties have urged the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to back the election of a new speaker as the assembly was recalled on Monday.The Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, told MLAs that people in Northern Ireland wanted action, not protest.But the DUP MLA Paul Givan said the recall by Sinn Féin of the Stormont assembly was not a 'serious attempt' to restore power sharing, telling MLAs: 'Today's recall is another attempt at majority rule and has no credibility when it comes forward from the party that kept these institutions down for three years.
