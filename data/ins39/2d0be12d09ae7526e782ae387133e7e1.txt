It's that time of year again. Fortnitemares is back as a spooky, Halloween-themed event in Fortnite: Battle Royale. This year's Fortnitemares will be the first to feature the excellent No-Build Mode, which will now include a Horde Rush replete with a final boss. While the main Fortnitemares event only lasts until November 1st, the Horde Rush will be available through November 15th and the v22.40 update. You can also transform into a werewolf in this year's Fortnitemares.
