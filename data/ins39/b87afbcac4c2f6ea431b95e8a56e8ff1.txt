Albany lawmakers passed an aggressive package of bills Thursday night that will tighten gun control across New York in the wake of two devastating mass shootings in recent weeks. 
The package includes 10 bills that impose age restrictions on the sale of semi-automatic rifles, ban most civilians from buying bulletproof vests, close a high-capacity magazine loophole and strengthen existing 'red flag' laws among other measures. 
Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to sign all 10 bills into law in the coming days.
