Russia declares martial law in occupied Ukraine

President Vladimir Putin of Russia declared martial law yesterday in four regions of Ukraine that Moscow recently annexed but that it does not fully control. This means that pro-Russian authorities can impose even tighter restrictions, as Moscow fights to hold off Ukraine's military advances.

Martial law in the four annexed territories — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — would allow the authorities to impose curfews, seize property, forcibly resettle residents to another region, imprison undocumented immigrants, establish checkpoints and detain people for up to 30 days.
