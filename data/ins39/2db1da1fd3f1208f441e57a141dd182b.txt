We all think we know Ardal O'Hanlon.

He's...um...excitable...Father Dougal McGuire in Father Ted, mild mannered George Sunday in My Hero, irrepresible DI Jack Mooney in Death in Paradise, and embattled Eamon in Derry Girls.

He has decades of stand-up under his belt (Whose Line is It Anyway, Live at the Apollo). More recently, he's faced, head-on, the bizarre challenges of Channel 4's Taskmaster.
