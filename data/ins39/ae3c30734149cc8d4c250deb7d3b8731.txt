Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News We first made Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) a Long Idea in March 2018. Since then, the stock is up 12% compared to a 48% gain for the S&P 500. Despite its underperformance, the stock still offers investors favorable risk/reward, especially amid the current market volatility. We think the stock is worth at least $104/share today – a 35%+ upside. Colgate's Stock Has Strong Long-term Upside Based on: the company's large share of the global toothpaste and manual toothbrush market; the near-recession-proof resilience of Colgate's products; the company's large distribution network; expected long-term growth in the company's key markets; the current price has 35% upside at consensus growth rates.
