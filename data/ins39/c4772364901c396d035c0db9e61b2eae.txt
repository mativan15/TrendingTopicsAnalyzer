Vladimir Putin has said he is imposing martial law on the four regions of Ukraine recently illegally-annexed by Moscow.

The four regions affected will be Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, none of which though are under full Russian control, and whose annexation has not be recognised by the West.

Meanwhile civilians have been told to evacuate the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Kherson 'as fast as possible' as Ukrainian forces surround the region.

Ukraine's troops 'will shortly begin an offensive against the city of Kherson,' said Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of the Kherson region, which Russia partially controls.
