The State government is reportedly reluctant to pay farmers ₹25 lakh per acre to acquire land for building the feeder canals.
Agricultural fields in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts are facing hurdles in irrigation due to a poor distributory network of canals from the Thotapalli barrage and a lack of proper feeder channels for tanks.While the Thotapalli irrigation project, built across the Nagavali, began functioning from 2015, a robust distributory network could not be put in place to ensure that water reaches the fields through canals.
