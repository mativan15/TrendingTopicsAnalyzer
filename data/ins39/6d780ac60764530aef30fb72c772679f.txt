(RTTNews) - The Indonesia stock market rebounded on Friday, one day after snapping the three-day winning streak in which it had climbed almost 270 points or 2.4 percent. The Jakarta Composite Index now rests just above the 7,180-point plateau although it's expected to turn lower again on Monday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is soft on pessimism over the outlook for interest rates following a stronger than expected jobs report from the United States. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion.
