Ryland Zweifel/iStock via Getty Images Introduction Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC) reported fourth quarter earnings for fiscal year 2022 prior to the market open on Friday, May 27, 2021, and the numbers were far from ideal. Shares have since slumped, nearly touching 52-week lows before rebounding slightly to right under $5 as of the time of writing. At face value, the negative reaction was likely the result of Canopy's revenue decline and per-share losses dramatically exceeding consensus analyst expectations: Canopy reported revenues of C$111.
