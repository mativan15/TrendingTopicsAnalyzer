The Kroger-Albertsons merger announced last week will create a new giant in the retail grocery space, which could change the game for Amazon and Walmart.That's according to Anat Alon-Beck, professor of business law at Case Western Reserve University. "We're talking about two of the largest grocery chains merging—one of largest M&A deals in this space," she told International Business Times in an email."It's a deal that could completely reshape the current landscape. This new company would be so big that it could compete with the likes of Walmart and Amazon in the grocery sector.
