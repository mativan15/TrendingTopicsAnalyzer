The Biden administration is reportedly mulling launching national security reviews scrutinizing some of Elon Musk's business ventures, including his Starlink internet service and pending $54.20 per share buyout of Twitter. The news dragged down shares of the social media company. Sources told Bloomberg that U.S. officials are concerned about the billionaire's behavior in the wake of his recent tweets about pulling the plug on Starlink funding in Ukraine, the country's conflict with Russia and his plans to acquire the social media giant with a group of foreign investors.
