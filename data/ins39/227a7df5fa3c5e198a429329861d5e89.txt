The Biden administration has canceled federal student loan debt for hundreds of thousands of students who attended the for-profit Corinthian Colleges. The relief is being extended to students who attended the schools from their opening in 1995 to their closure in 2015. Corinthian operated the Everest Institute in the Rochester area -- formerly known as the Rochester Business Institute. Students received loan relief in a 2017 settlement, but it was not automatic -- it required what critics said was a confusing application process.
