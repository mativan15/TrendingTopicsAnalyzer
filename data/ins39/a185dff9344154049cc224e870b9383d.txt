P﻿rince Harry has made a surprise appearance at the Masters of Scale Summit in San Francisco, US. The Duke of Sussex joined BetterUp CEO Alexi Robichaux and entrepreneur Reid Hoffman on stage ﻿on Wednesday (local time) to discuss "why leaders need to focus on their mental fitness". The 38-year-old spoke about his experience having a therapist and why he has a coach, even as someone who grew up a member of the royal family. "Great to hear someone who you think grew up with everything talk about the need for therapy and coaching for everyone," Kurt Schrader, the CEO and co-founder of app Shortcut, said on Twitter of the discussion.
