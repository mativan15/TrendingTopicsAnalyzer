Amid the PPE kit row in Assam where Assam chief minister Himata Biswa Sarma has been accused of giving a contract to his wife Riniki Bhuyan Sarma, an allegation now amplified by the Aam Aadmi Party, the Assam chief minister on Sunday attacked Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal referring to his 2020 tweet exchange with Delhi BJP MP cricketer-turned-politician Gautam Gambhir. "Delhi CM suo moto offered to buy PPE kits from anywhere without tender. Why? Does his Deputy CM think the CM is corrupt as he asked someone to arrange PPE kits from somewhere immediately, and said that Delhi Govt will buy them? No reference to any tender etc," Himanta Biswa wrote on Twitter.
