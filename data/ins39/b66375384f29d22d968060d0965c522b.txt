October 19, 2022 04:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time MUNICH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The 10th Allianz Motor Day addressed the question of how sustainable car insurance can be. The discussions at the international event hosted by Allianz focused on how electromobility can be promoted as a key lever for decarbonization on both the product and service sides and how CO2 emissions can be reduced through sustainable claims management.

The Allianz proposition was clear: 'In car insurance, we see many levers in sustainable claims management that can significantly reduce CO2 emissions,' says Klaus-Peter Roehler, member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE, responsible for the insurance business in Germany, Switzerland, Central and Eastern Europe as well as Global P&C Retail and SMC and Global Claims.
