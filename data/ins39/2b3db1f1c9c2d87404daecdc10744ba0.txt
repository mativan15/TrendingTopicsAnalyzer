PTIPierce Brosnan, left, Noah Centineo, Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge and Quintessa Swindell attend the world premiere of "Black Adam" in Times Square on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022, in New York. The early predictions suggest that Dwayne Johnson's "Black Adam" will be unable to match the collections of Marvel's superhero movies. In "Black Adam," Dwayne Johnson, popularly known as The Rock among his fans, played the role of a superhero for the DC Extended Universe. The film's collection will also be adversely impacted due to the declining footfall at cinema halls, considering that "Black Adam" is a pre-Diwali release.
