A prominent Melbourne snake catcher has won his legal battle against the state government after it refused to renew his wildlife controller licence over a series of breaches he admitted to while removing serpents around Melbourne.

Stewart Gatt, who operates as ‘Stewy the Snake Catcher', was eventually granted a new licence, but the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal told him on May 21 he must stop posting videos of his exploits to his large social media following.
