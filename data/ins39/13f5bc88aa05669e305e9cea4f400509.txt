By Australian Associated Press Published: 05:30 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 05:30 EDT, 31 May 2022 Brisbane have agreed to freeze contract talks with Payne Haas until the end of the 2022 season. Haas stunned the NRL last Wednesday when he made a request for an immediate release from the club. The prop, who entered Brad Fittler's State of Origin camp on Monday, was booed by Broncos fans during their win over the Gold Coast on Friday. Haas told AAP on Monday he wasn't "money hungry" and disliked the perception his release request was viewed as a cash grab.
