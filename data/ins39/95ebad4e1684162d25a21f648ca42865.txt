It is a return home three years in the making.

The first Strathroy Hometown Festival since 2019 kicks off with an expanded classic car show and shine taking over downtown Friday, June 10. It is organized by the Strathroy Caradoc Cruisers Car Club, whose Wednesday night gatherings made their triumphant return at the Shops on Sydenham May 4.

The festival formerly know as Turkey is more important than ever to people who call the area home whether they still live here or not, according to Cruisers director Mary Wright.
