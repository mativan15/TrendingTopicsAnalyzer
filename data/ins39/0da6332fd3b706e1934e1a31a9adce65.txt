Teresa Giudice is speaking out after Vicki Gunvalson picked her as the most overrated Real Housewives star.
 
At BravoCon 2022 on Saturday, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 50, told PEOPLE exclusively that she thinks the Bravo franchise stars should be supportive of each other.
 
"My response [to Vicki's comment] is we're all Housewives," she said. "And we should all be lifting each other up and not saying anything negative about each other."
