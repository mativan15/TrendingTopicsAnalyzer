WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The United States will continue its close relationship with Britain and the successor to British Prime Minister Liz Truss, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said on Thursday after the UK leader announced her resignation.

U.S. President Joe Biden will issue a statement later on Thursday, his top aide added.

"Our country's always had a special relationship with the United Kingdom without regard to the partisan affiliation of our president or the politics of their prime minister," Klain told MSNBC in a televised interview.
