The Biden administration is continuing its renewable energy push while Americans face record-high prices at the gas pump. Last week, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced plans to move forward with two of California's first-ever offshore wind power grids, located near coastal cities Humboldt and Morro Bay.But, one environmental and energy expert sent a warning that turbines might not be as efficient as the administration thinks."For a solar farm or wind farms, you need to spread that thing out over so many hundreds of square kilometers, and that's your problem," Fraser Institute Senior Fellow Cornelis van Kooten told FOX Business' Kelly O'Grady.
