The Fondation Cartier, a glass building that seems to float on Boulevard Raspail in Paris, has found a new captain. On Thursday, October 6, France's oldest corporate foundation announced the appointment of its new director, Chris Dercon, alongside Hervé Chandès, who remains its artistic director. In the small world of culture, the news is likely to cause a stir because the Belgian Dercon is an authority in the field. Until now, he was the head of the Réunion des Musées Nationaux-Grand Palais (RMN-GP), a public structure that brings together a dozen museums.
