NEW YORK, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new book by the creator of the National Inventor Club, "How to Make Money With Your Invention Idea: An Inventor's Quick Startup Guide," is a step-by-step manual that helps inventors decide if their idea has "legs," and if so, what to do about it. It answers these basic questions: You've got a great idea for a new product or service - but what do you do with it? Where do you go? Who do you trust? Author and Inventor Coach Brian Fried, the founder and CEO of product-development services provider Inventor Smart and a frequent guest on innovation-themed television programs and podcasts, crafted "How to Make Money" to help inventors at all stages of the commercialization process put aside emotions and focus squarely on business potential.
