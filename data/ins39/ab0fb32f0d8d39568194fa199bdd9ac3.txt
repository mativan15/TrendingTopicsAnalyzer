After missing the past three games, veteran cornerback Sheridan Jones made his return to the field in Clemson's 38-24 win over Florida State.

So far, Sheridan Jones' senior season has been filled with adversity.

Clemson's most experienced cornerback was supposed to provide a veteran presence in the Tigers ' secondary, but due to suffering two different stingers, Jones was forced to miss three consecutive games.

Jones made his much-anticipated return over the weekend in the Tigers' 38-24 win over Florida State, but getting to that point was not an easy task.
