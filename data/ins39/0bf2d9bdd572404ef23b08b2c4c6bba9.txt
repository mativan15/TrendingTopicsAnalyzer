 Microsoft really wants Chrome users to move to Edge (opens in new tab) and has, to that end, introduced a new feature, exclusively for the users of the Google browser.As seen on 9to5Google, since Edge version 101, which was released in early April this year, the browser has had a feature allowing users to constantly keep importing data, automatically, from the Google Chrome browser.While 'import browser data' as a feature has been around for ages, it was usually a one-time thing that users had to manually trigger.
