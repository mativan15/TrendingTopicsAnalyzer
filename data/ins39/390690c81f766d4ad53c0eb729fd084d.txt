A Triad business – founded by two Wake Forest University alums – swam with the sharks tonight and not only came out alive but richer.

Storage Scholars was featured as the first company to pitch on tonight's episode of ‘Shark Tank,' where they sought $250,000 for a 5% stake in the company. The company received offers from four of the Sharks – all but Lori Greiner – and ended up making a deal with famed Shark Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur who owns the Dallas Mavericks, AXS.tv and Magnolia Pictures, among other ventures.
