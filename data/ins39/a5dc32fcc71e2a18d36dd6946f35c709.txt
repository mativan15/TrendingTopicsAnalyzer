Published: 09:00 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 09:01 EDT, 19 October 2022 Ministers tried to head off a new Tory backbench mutiny over fracking today by warning would-be rebels that voting with Labour could collapse the Government.Fracking was halted in 2019 amid fears over earthquakes and tremors, but Liz Truss approved a restart after taking power designed to boost energy security.  Keir Starmer's party is using an Opposition Day motion today to try to ban drilling, and entice Conservatives unhappy at it potentially restarting in their constituency to show their displeasure.
