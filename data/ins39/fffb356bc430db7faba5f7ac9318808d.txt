Psychiatrist Dr. Charles Sophy joined ‘Cavuto: Coast to Coast' Wednesday to discuss mental health uncertainties among children in response to the Uvalde, Texas school shooting. DR. CHARLES SOPHY: I tell people to look at five key areas of their life: sleeping. If you see your child or anybody under the age of 18 who, [if they're not sleeping] well, jump on it. If they're not doing their schoolwork or they're not working, jump on it. They're not eating. They're not dealing with their emotions. You see them start to withdraw.
