AgenciesRepresentative ImageSri Lanka's main airport on Saturday denied the island nation's government was behind a decision to detain an Aeroflot aircraft, after Russia lodged a diplomatic protest over the move. The Airbus A330 was seized at the Bandaranaike International Airport on Thursday, the same day it arrived from Moscow, after a directive from a court in the capital Colombo.
 Flight SU289 was about to return to the Russian capital with 191 passengers and 13 crew aboard. Sri Lanka's top envoy was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry on Friday to receive a "resolute protest" over the detention, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
