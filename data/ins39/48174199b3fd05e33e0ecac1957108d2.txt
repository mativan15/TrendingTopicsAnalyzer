It's week three and the (hopefully) 2-0 Iowa Hawkeyes just took care of business against a new-look Iowa State squad at home! Now, they have a team in a very similar situation in Nevada. At least on the surface, the 2022 season has the appearance of a bit of a rebuild for the Wolfpack.

For the first time in three years, it will not be Carson Strong throwing the passes for the Mountain West contenders. Strong graduated this year and is now fighting for a roster spot on the Philadelphia Eagles.

Top receiver Romeo Doubs was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of this year's draft, and tight end and secondary pass catcher Cole Turner was a fifth-round pick as well.
