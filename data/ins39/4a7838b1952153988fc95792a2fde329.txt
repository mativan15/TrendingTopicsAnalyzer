Vodafone Idea (Vi) has said its board will meet on October 21 to consider raising funds by issuing preferential convertible debentures to a vendor. Industry executives and analysts said this vendor could be Indus Towers, but this couldn't be independently confirmed by ET. Vi and Indus Towers did not respond to queries on the issue. Vi owes the tower company around ₹6,800 crore. 'A meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on October 21, inter-alia, to consider and evaluate a proposal for issuance of debenture securities convertible into equity shares on a preferential / private placement basis to a vendor, subject to regulatory and other statutory approvals as may be required, including approval of the shareholders of the company,' Vi said in an exchange filing.
