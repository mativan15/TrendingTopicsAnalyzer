Tesla is set to announce its third-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, and it has a high bar to reach in order to win over investors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.Tesla has had — like the rest of the broader stock market — a bad year. The stock has dropped nearly 40% year-to-date, and is down almost 50% from its record high reached in November. The sharp decline means Tesla is at a "fork in the road" moment as it faces growing global competition in the EV space and hits road bumps in reaching its delivery targets, said Wedbush.
