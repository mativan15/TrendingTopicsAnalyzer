The State-run Oushadhi, a public-sector Ayurvedic drug-manufacturing company, has submitted a proposal to the Kerala government seeking its permission to take over the Salagramam ashram (mutt) owned by Swami Sandeepananda Giri, head of the School of Bhagavad Gita, at Kundamankadavu in Thiruvananthapuram for developing it as a medical wellness centre. The public sector company has zeroed in on the property spread over 18,000 sq ft at 73 cents on the bank of Karamana River after holding a search for an ideal location in Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts.
