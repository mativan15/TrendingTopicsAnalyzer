Lee Zeldin is continuing to see momentum in his campaign to unseat New York Governor Kathy Hochul in next month's election, as yet another poll shows the Republican cutting dramatically into the Democrat's lead.Hochul is leading Zeldin by 6 percentage points, with the governor ahead 47 percent to 41 percent, according to a SurveyUSA poll that was done for TV stations WHEC and WNYT and released Thursday.But Zeldin has gained serious ground against Hochul since a SurveyUSA/WNYT poll in August, in which the Donald Trump–endorsed candidate was 24 points behind Hochul (55 percent to 31 percent).
