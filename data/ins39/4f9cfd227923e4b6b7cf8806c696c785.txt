I worked with APJ Abdul Kalam from 1993 to 2015 (except between 2000 to 2002). These were the years of his greatest triumphs, capping a career that already saw his successes in the space programme and the foundation he laid for the missile programme. This was also a career trajectory that rose sharply only to dip. In 1997, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a rare honour given only to a handful of people since Independence. Not so long after, however, as principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, he found his career in a cul-de-sac.
