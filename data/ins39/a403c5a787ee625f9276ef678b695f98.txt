May 28—CANTON — A decision to consider resubmitting a Local Waterfront Revitalization Program application for Grasse River recreation hit a snag during a joint meeting of the Canton town and village boards Wednesday night.

At the previous joint meeting, in April, a decision was made to send the topic back to the recreation and economic development committees for reconsideration.

An application was made in 2021 through the state's Consolidated Funding Application, but it was turned down.

Economic Development Director Leigh Rodriquez received feedback from the New York Department of State, which administers the program, on how to make a new application better.
