Jyothi Yarraji became the first Indian to go under 13 seconds in the women's 100m hurdles by breezing past the finish line in 12.82 seconds at the 61st National Open athletics championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Monday.The 23-year-old had clocked 12.79 at the recently held National Games in Gujarat, but it wasn't considered a National record because it came with a +2.5 m/s tailwind assistance. Anything over 2 m/s doesn't count for a record.The Open being her last event of the season, she seemed determined to go out on a high by adding the gold to the Inter-University, Federation Cup and National Games titles she had already won.
