The Crown Stamp on pint glasses provides reassurance to drinkers that they are not getting short measures, the Government argued as it launched a drive for its return.
In 2006, European Union regulations meant the symbol – used to denote a pint in Britain since as far back as 1698 – was replaced by the CE marking.
But with Brexit delivered, the Government has announced a push to get the crown back on to British pint glasses.
New guidance will be issued on how manufacturers can apply the symbol to beer glasses as a decorative mark on a voluntary basis.
