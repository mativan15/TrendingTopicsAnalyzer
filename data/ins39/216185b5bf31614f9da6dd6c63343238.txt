SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mother-of-two Yang Zengdong, 40, is ready to take her family for a long-awaited outing to mark Shanghai's grand re-opening from COVID-19 lockdown on Wednesday.

Her ambitions – head to a mall, see what is open and maybe buy a drink or some small toys for her young daughters – are modest, but even those simple pleasures have been impossible during the gruelling two-month lockdown.

Unfortunately for retailers desperate for a quick, "vengeful" return of shoppers of the sort seen in 2020 when China enjoyed a "V-shaped" recovery from its initial battle with COVID-19, the excitement that is palpable on newly bustling city streets is tempered by wariness about the future.
