Wachiwit These are indeed interesting times for streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). After a couple of difficult quarters, where subscriber numbers actually fell, the company posted a rather impressive third quarter with significant subscriber gains. Digging deeper, the picture becomes even more bullish for investors, even though there are still some issues to be worried over. Despite the improvement, I do still think that the enterprise is overly pricey compared to what you can get from other streaming-oriented firms.
