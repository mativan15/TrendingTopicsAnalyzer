An education charity in France has claimed that disciplining children by sending them to a 'naughty step' can be considered a 'violent' punishment.

Stop VEO, which combats violence against children, has reportedly launched a campaign to change guidance set out by the Council of Europe that recommends parents send naughty children to 'time-out'.

Many parents choose to send misbehaving children to steps, rooms, or corners to reflect on what they've done wrong by themselves.
