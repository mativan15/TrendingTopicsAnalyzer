The food safety watchdog has warned consumers against eating food past its use-by date or switching off their fridge and freezer to save money.The Food Standards Agency (FSA), whose remit covers England, Northern Ireland and Wales, said people were taking risks because of financial pressures caused by rising energy bills and the cost of living crisis.A survey for the group found 32% of respondents had eaten food past its use-by date at least once in the past month because they could not afford to buy more, while 18% had turned off a fridge or freezer to reduce their bills.
