One of the Tampa Bay area's top educational philanthropists, Gus Stavros, died Oct. 18. He was 97.

Stavros was part of that 'greatest generation' of entrepreneurial business builders and givers, with a willingness to share his wealth and wisdom.

The elder statesman-philanthropist dedicated his energy to education, from K-12 up to various Florida state universities. He might be best known for helping establish what is now Largo's Gus Stavros Institute, home to Enterprise Village, Finance Park and other economic education programs that thousands of students participate in every year.
