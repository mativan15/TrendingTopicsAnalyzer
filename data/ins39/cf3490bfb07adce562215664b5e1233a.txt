Arizona-based publicly traded simulation company VirTra Inc. wants to enter the defense industry and subsequently add jobs in Orlando.

Why this story matters: VirTra's expansion here means the generation of high-wage jobs for the local economy. Jobs in the modeling and simulation industry pay an average annual salary of $89,996, according to compensation data company Payscale. That's much higher than metro Orlando's average annual wage of $50,770, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
