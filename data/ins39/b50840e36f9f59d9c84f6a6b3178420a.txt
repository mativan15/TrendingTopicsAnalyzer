Women's leadership development in entrepreneurial business is critical to improving women's participation in management and businesses in Bangladesh. Research shows that only seven percent of all business establishments in Bangladesh are women-owned and women-headed. This limited ownership and development of women's leadership behavior is a clear gap to be filled. Thus, the study aims to identify women's leadership behavioral factors (WLBFs) and examine the causal relationship between WLBFs and women's leadership behavior practices (WLBPs) in line with path–goal leadership theory.
