TOMS RIVER - An Atlantic County man was sentenced to seven years in state prison on Friday for setting fire to a home in Lakewood as three people were inside, announced Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer.

Jamal Preston, 27, of Egg Harbor Township, must serve at least 85% — almost six years — of the sentence under the state's No Early Release Act before he is eligible for parole, according to the Prosecutor's Office.

Preston pleaded guilty in January to the charge of aggravated arson at which time he admitted that on Aug.
