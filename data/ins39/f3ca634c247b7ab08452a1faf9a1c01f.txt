PATNA: After nearly five years, the Bihar government will once again revert to the old practice of supplying books to school students, instead of transferring money through direct benefit transfer (DBT) initiated in 2017, following the state's inability to ensure the timely availability of books, officials said.Additional chief secretary, department of education, Dipak Kumar Singh, said the decision would be implemented from the new academic session starting in April to ensure the timely availability of books, along with an almanac, to the students at the start of the academic session.
