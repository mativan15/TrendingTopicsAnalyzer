'Why should we believe anything you say when it's been proved you're a habitual liar?' That was the first question for Boris Johnson in a grilling from Mumsnet users this week.The forum's founder, Justine Roberts, who had the job of posing users' questions to the prime minister, mused afterwards that he might have a 'woman problem'.Polling certainly appears to bear that out: in YouGov's latest snapshot of voting intentions, Johnson trailed Keir Starmer by six percentage points as best prime minister choice among men, but by 12 points among women: 21% to 33%.
