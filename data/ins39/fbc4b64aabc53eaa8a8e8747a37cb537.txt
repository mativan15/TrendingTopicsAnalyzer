Only half of bosses agree with monitoring staff working from home according to a survey.The survey of 2,000 bosses carried out by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development/HiBob found that more than 55 per cent of bosses agreed with collecting information on staff working remotely — meaning nearly as many didn't.Despite this, three in ten business leaders use software to monitor the productivity of staff working remotely.Hayfa Mohdzaini, senior HR research adviser at the CIPD, said hybrid and remote working has 'fuelled the debate on employee monitoring practices and what is acceptable'.
