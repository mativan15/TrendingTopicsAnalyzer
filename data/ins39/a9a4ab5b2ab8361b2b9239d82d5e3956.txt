Danielle Smith had been premier of Alberta less than a day when she grabbed headlines far and wide by declaring that unvaccinated people were the 'most discriminated against group' she had seen in her lifetime (she's 51).'

An appalling statement from someone who knows better.

The unvaxxed were so discriminated against, Smith said, she is going to make sure they are protected under the Alberta Human Rights Act.

If Smith wanted attention she got loads of it; everything from ridicule to outrage to cheers from those who wanted her to double-down.
