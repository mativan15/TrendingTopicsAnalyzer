Published: 17:31 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 17:31 EDT, 3 June 2022 Dear Bel,My mother, aged 92, has decided to leave her house to charity in her will.The residue of the estate (not insubstantial) will be shared equally between my sister and I.My sister is furious, exclaiming — in a heated exchange with my mother — that she was relying on the money from the house.As a consequence, she has cut off contact with my mother.My sister fell out with my father, just months before he died, also over a money-related issue.
