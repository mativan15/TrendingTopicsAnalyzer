Mirror reader T Williams says the country could be 'damaged irreparably' if the Tories remain in power. What do YOU think?I'm ashamed to say I have voted for the Conservatives for 60 years. But the Government we have now - one that gained power through the back door - is not only a disgrace, it is dangerous. I say now in desperation, if we don't get rid of them quickly the country will suffer irreparable damage. I feel very sorry for all the young families who could lose their homes as interest rates rise.
