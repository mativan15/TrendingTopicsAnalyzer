Strictly Come Dancing's Hamza Yassin has opened up about his hair, explaining it's around '17 years old'.
The Countryfile presenter has won hearts on the show, and last week landed a near perfect score with his partner Jowita Przystal for their stunning Salsa.
Along with his epic moves, viewers have been impressed with Hamza's incredible dreadlocks, which reach down to about his knees.
