The NBA opener almost got violent.
Early in the third quarter of the Celtics-76ers matchup on Tuesday, Joel Embiid and Marcus Smart got tied up going for a rebound. Smart's arm got wedged between Embiid's arm and body before the 76ers big man twisted his frame to free himself.
Smart, though, felt Embiid was attempting something sinister and resisted the urge to retaliate.
'Went for the rebound, basketball play. Went for the steal, basketball play,' Smart said. 'Referee blows his whistle, calls a foul, I stop play, my arm's still in there and he tries to break it.
