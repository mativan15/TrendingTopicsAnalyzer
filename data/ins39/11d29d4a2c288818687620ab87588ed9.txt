After a week off to lick their wounds from their first loss of the season, 20-10 to Purdue on Oct. 1, the Gophers return to action Saturday at No. 24 Illinois (11 a.m., BTN, 100.3-FM) in a game that carries importance in the Big Ten's West Division race.

The Gophers (4-1, 1-1 Big Ten) are a half-game behind division leaders Purdue, Illinois and Nebraska, which each have 2-1 conference marks. A Minnesota victory would vault the Gophers ahead of the Fighting Illini and keep them on the heels of Saturday night's Nebraska-Purdue winner in the West standings.
