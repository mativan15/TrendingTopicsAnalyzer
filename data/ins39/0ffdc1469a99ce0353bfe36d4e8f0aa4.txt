A man who was seen in a video clip last week driving his autorickshaw on to a railway platform in Mumbai has been fined by the Railway Protection Force (RPF). The auto driver, identified as Vinod Pandey, was fined Rs 500 under the Railway Act for driving his vehicle onto platform number one of Kurla station.

A railway official said Pandey was possibly confused about how to exit the big, sprawling station "He had driven his family to the station and then moved towards the south of the station believing he was taking an exit road," PTI quoted an official as saying.
