DUTCH Crown Princess Catharina-Amalia has been forced to move out of her student flat over a gangsters' plot to kidnap her, it has been alleged.
Fearing for her safety, the 18-year-old, who started a degree at the University of Amsterdam this autumn, moved out of her Amsterdam digs and back to the royal palace in The Hague.

The heir to the Dutch throne was under heightened security due to fears that criminal gangs may target her for kidnapping or an attack, the royal family revealed last month.
