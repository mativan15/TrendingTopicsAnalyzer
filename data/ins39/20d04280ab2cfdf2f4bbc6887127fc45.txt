A travel trailer without plumbing parked in the driveway of an East Vancouver home is being offered for $650 a month, in the latest eyebrow-raising Craisglist ad in the city's increasingly unaffordable rental market. The post advertises the trailer as a "private bedroom," and promises the tenant would have access to the kitchen, bathroom and laundry machines inside the adjacent home. "You'll love this," the ad reads. "Clean and cozy place, quiet neighbourhood." The landlord prohibits smoking both inside and outside the trailer, along with any drugs, pets, parties or "overnight visitors.
