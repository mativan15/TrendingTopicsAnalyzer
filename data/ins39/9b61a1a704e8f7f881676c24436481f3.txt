Dear Amy: My 50-something son, currently unemployed, has struggled financially and career-wise since he graduated college 30 years ago.
He is a sweet guy, and a great husband and father. Sadly, he's been laid off from many jobs over the years. I think he only left a job voluntarily once, to take a better job, and that was early in his career.
He thinks he has excellent communication and leadership skills. I think his writing skills are good but his in-person communication skills are a big problem.
