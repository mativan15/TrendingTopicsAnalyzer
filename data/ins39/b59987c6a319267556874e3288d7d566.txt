'A great part of our national wealth,'says LAIRD BELL of Chicago, 'is locked up in corporate form. Some few of the advanced corporations recognize that it is good business to promote higher education in its research aspects. The logical next step is to recognize an obligation to promote both theoretical research at the university level and the production of good citizens at the college level.'Mr. Bell, an attorney and a director of many corporations, is closely associated with Harvard, his alma mater; he is Vice-chairman of the Board of Trustees, University of Chicago, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Carleton College.
