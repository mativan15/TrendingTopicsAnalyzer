The Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce and Jacksonville Transportation Authority officially opened the Open Innovation Center at the Jacksonville Regional Transportation Center Friday morning.

Budgeted at $1 million, the 3,900-square-foot business accelerator is on the second floor of the JRTC at LaVilla and serves as the Chamber's hub for innovation and technology training for entrepreneurs and employees from business and industries across Jacksonville.

JAX Chamber's Venture Services Division will be based inside the Open Innovation Center and its entrepreneurial education programs, including JAX Bridges, will be held at the new facility.
