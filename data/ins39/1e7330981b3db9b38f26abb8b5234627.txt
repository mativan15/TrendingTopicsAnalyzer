The Cowboys quarterback 'controversy' that loquacious owner Jerry Jones refused to nip in the bud is officially dead.
The Cooper Rush hype train came to a screeching halt Sunday night in the Cowboys' loss to the Eagles in Philadelphia, and injured starter Dak Prescott declared his intention to return from a thumb injury next week against the Lions.
'That's my plan,' Prescott told reporters after Dallas' 26-17 loss. The Cowboys (4-2) fell to third place in the NFC East behind the Giants (5-1), while the Eagles improved to 6-0.
