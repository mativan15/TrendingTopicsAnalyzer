June 1 marks the beginning of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+) Pride Month in the UK and in many countries around the world.
Held annually in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred at the end of June 1969, Pride is also about communities coming together in celebration, protest, unity and solidarity.
While Pride celebrations looked different in 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid pandemic, Pride Month events will hopefully be back to normal for many in 2022.
Ruth Hunt, Stonewall's Chief Executive, said: ‘Pride is a time when we stand together, in celebration of what we've achieved and to renew our commitment to fight for true equality for all LGBT people.
