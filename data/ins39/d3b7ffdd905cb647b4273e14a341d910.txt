LATHAM, N.Y., June 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Comfort, value and style are the three qualities that Deer Stags footwear has built its products and business on for decades. In the early 20th century, Deer Stags pioneered a new kind of construction that made the uncomfortable, stiff dress shoe a thing of the past. Today, all of the brand's shoes for men and kids, from slippers to sneakers to formal wear, are designed with comfort as the top priority.
