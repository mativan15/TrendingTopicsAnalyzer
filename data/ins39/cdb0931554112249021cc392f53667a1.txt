Straw connected with some fans at Yankee Stadium before Game 5 of the ALDS, making amends after an ugly incident near the bleachers back in April

NEW YORK — Back in April, Guardians outfielder Myles Straw called Yankees fans the "worst fan base on the planet" after an incident in the outfield at Yankee Stadium.

Six months later, during a rain delay before Game 5 of the American League Division Series, Straw took some time to help fans in the Bronx stay busy while waiting for first pitch.

The outfielder and his teammate, Will Brennan, emerged from the third-base dugout, tossing a football back and forth on the warning track, steps away from the tarp.
