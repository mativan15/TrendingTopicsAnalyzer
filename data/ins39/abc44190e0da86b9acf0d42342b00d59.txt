Fewer than 1% of the Bay State's elderly tax filers receive more than $1 million in distributions from taxable retirement accounts or pensions each year, the amount that would trigger the proposed surtax before voters in Ballot Question 1, a new report suggests.

The Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a think tank that supports the so-called fair share amendment or millionaires tax, said Monday that of the 400,000 Massachusetts taxpayers who received distributions from taxable retirement accounts in 2019, only 3,820 of them reported incomes of at least $1 million.
