Animal trainer and 'Tiger King' star Bhagavan 'Doc ' Antle faces federal money laundering charges Monday in South Carolina.
Antle, 62, also the owner of a Myrtle Beach Safari, was arrested Friday by the FBI and reportedly remains in custody at the J. Rueben Long Detention Center in Conway, South Carolina. The charges are related to money laundering but the full details on the charges will be formally announced in court, a source told the Associated Press on Saturday. 
'It's fitting that 'Doc' Antle is behind bars after years of locking up the endangered animals he uses in tawdry photo ops,' Debbie Metzler, associate director of PETA's Captive Animal Law Enforcement division, said in a statement.
