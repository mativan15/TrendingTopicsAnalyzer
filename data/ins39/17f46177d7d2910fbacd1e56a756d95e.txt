A TikToker gave a peek at a New York City apartment rental she toured, and it looked like an overpriced accident waiting to happen.

Housing prices are skyrocketing across the country — and it shows. In New York City, there are more Airbnbs than apartments for rent, almost no housing vacancies under $1,500 a month and the city board just voted to approve the largest rent increase in stabilized units since 2013.

TikToker @charlottesaround was apartment hunting when she stumbled upon a $4000 per month gem (spoiler: it was not a gem).
