(Bloomberg) -- Michael Patchen has left his role as chief risk officer at crypto-broker Genesis after three months, according to a person familiar with the matter. Genesis, a unit of Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, didn't return several requests for comment. Patchen didn't return a call for comment. Patchen's exit follows a recent wave of departures at the New York-based lender. Bloomberg News reported last month that multiple senior executives at Genesis had left as part of a leadership shuffle in the aftermath of its exposure to bankrupt hedge fund Three Arrows Capital as well as a broad market downturn.
