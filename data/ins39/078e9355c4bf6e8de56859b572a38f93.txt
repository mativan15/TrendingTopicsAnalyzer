The TMC on Monday said mismanagement of the economy, high inflation and subversion of Constitutional principles have almost been "synonymous" with the eight years of the Narendra Modi regime at the Centre.Addressing a press meet, senior TMC leaders and Ministers Sashi Panja and Chandrima Bhattacharya said the Modi government has "failed on all fronts", and demanded that a proper audit of the PM CARES fund should be carried out.
