A war of words ensued between Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader accused the latter of 'brazen corruption' under the 'pretext of the Covid-19 pandemic'.
At a press conference in Delhi on Saturday, the AAP leader alleged that the Assam government had given contracts to companies owned by Sarma's wife and son's business partners for supply of PPE kits above market rates during the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.
