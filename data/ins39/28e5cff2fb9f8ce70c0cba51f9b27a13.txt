A new amphitheater could be on the way to Uptown near Protective Stadium and Legacy Arena.

A proposal was presented at a recent Jefferson County Commission pre-commission work session.

The amphitheater is expected to cost $50 million and would be located adjacent to The Star at Uptown development that is currently underway at the former Carraway hospital site in North Birmingham.

The project, which would include a 9,000-seat venue expected to host 15-17 shows per year with a projected 120,000 ticket sales annually and $7 million in gross ticket revenue, would be a joint effort between the Jefferson County Commission, the city of Birmingham, the BJCC and Live Nation, the same entity which owns Oak Mountain Amphitheater.
