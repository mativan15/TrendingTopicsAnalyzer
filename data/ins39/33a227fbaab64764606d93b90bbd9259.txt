Chalmers said there had been plenty of discussion ahead of the election about holding an October budget rather than waiting until next year.'It's turned out to be the right decision,' he told this masthead.'The pressures in energy markets have gotten worse. We've got natural disasters and we know more about borrowing costs, the NDIS and the three other pressure points, and so I'm pleased that we're doing [it] in October and not waiting [until] May.'The fortunes of the Albanese government will in large part be determined by how Chalmers shapes his first budget.
