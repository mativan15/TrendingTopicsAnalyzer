Published: 17:09 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 17:09 EDT, 18 October 2022 Texas Tech could have a three-quarterback rotation when it hosts West Virginia in a Big 12 game on Saturday in Lubbock, Texas. Tyler Shough, who has been sidelined since injuring his collarbone in a season-opening rout of Murray State, returned to practice this week. If he's cleared to play, he'll see time against the Mountaineers alongside Donovan Smith and Behren Morton. "If (Shough's) released, then you'll see all three quarterbacks," Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire said.
