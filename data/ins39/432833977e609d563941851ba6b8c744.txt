It was the Midwest's biggest dance music party for most of the last decade and the crown jewel-turned-Kryptonite of Robert F.X. Sillerman's EDM empire — but on May 17, Spring Awakening's current owners announced the festival's highly anticipated return was being delayed to help shore up the company's bottom line.
The 2022 Spring Awakening scheduled for July 8-10 is being pushed back to 2023 so that its owners, LiveOne, can keep their promise to investors to deliver 'positive adjusted earnings' in the current fiscal year, chairman and CEO Robert Ellin explained during a May 19 investor summit — two days after officially announcing that the event was being postponed until 2023.
