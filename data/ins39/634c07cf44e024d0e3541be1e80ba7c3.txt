For four rears TOM LEA, the artist and author of El Paso, has been absorbed in writing and illustrating his incomparable two-volume history of the King Ranch, to be published by Little Brown. His hero is Richard King, son of an Irish immigrant, who made his reputation as a steamboater on the Rio Grande and who came ashore in his late twenties to become a cattle baron of Texas. He was early befriended by Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, and when the Civil War broke out, the King Ranch, 'the back door of the Confederacy,'shipped beef to the armies and cotton across the border.
