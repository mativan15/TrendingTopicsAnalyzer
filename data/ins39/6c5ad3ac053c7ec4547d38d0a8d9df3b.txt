Anthony Rapp has responded after his lawsuit against Kevin Spacey was dismissed.Rapp, who is known for his performances in Star Trek: Discovery and in the original Broadway production of Rent, had sought $40m (£36m) in damages after alleging that a then-26-year-old Spacey made an 'unwanted sexual advance' towards him when he was 14, during a party at Spacey's Manhattan apartment in 1986. Spacey has 'categorically' denied the accusation.On Thursday (20 October), the three-week trial came to an end after a New York jury concluded that Spacey did not molest Rapp.
