The new Chancellor is likely to have offered some reassurance to markets with his pledges to bring down the deficit, economists have said.

Jeremy Hunt used his first round of broadcast interviews since being appointed on Friday to pledge to 'bring back certainty and stability into public finances', as he prepares for a fiscal statement on October 31.

In a marked change of tone from his predecessor, the UK's fourth Chancellor in four months said he would focus on 'public finances that you can afford' and warned of 'difficult decisions' on spending with all government departments asked to find efficiencies.
