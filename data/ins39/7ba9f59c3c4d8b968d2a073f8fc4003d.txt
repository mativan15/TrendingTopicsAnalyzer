OTTAWA, ON, Oct. 16, 2022 /CNW/ - The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today issued the following statement on Small Business Week, which runs from October 16 to 22, 2022:

"Today marks the beginning of Small Business Week, an opportunity for us to celebrate the creativity, dedication, and innovation of Canadian entrepreneurs, and small and medium-sized business owners.

"From your local grocery store you visit every weekend, the coffee shops you pass on your way into work, and the corner store or dépanneur that always seems to be open, small businesses are the heart of our communities and the backbone of our economy.
