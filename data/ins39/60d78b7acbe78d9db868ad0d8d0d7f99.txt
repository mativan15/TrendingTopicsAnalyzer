Hold your nerve and your stomach: this gorefest is almost too good to pass out while watching it. Making headlines for apparently causing cinemagoers to faint and vomit, with an ambulance reportedly called to one screening, Terrifier 2 is not for everyone, but this tasteless wonder meets nauseating expectations. Blood, guts, molars and tendons fly across the screen with reckless abandon. No body part is safe from Art the Clown, a Pennywise on bath salts who treats the human body like a diamond-stuffed piñata, each blow and decapitation unearthing intestinal bounties and gushing reserves of liquid ruby.
