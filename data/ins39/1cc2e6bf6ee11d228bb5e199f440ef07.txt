The phase 2 trial, dubbed CALDOSE-1, evaluated different doses of the drug versus placebo in patients with UC, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The company said the trial did not achieve the main goal of clinical remission for the pooled 30mg/day and 45 mg/day active dose groups of vidofludimus calcium versus placebo at week 10.
