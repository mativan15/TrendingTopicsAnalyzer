Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the figure behind the buy-now, pay-later online shopping revolution, has sparked an outcry after he publicly posted a list of employees that Klarna had laid off. Last week, the Swedish fintech firm let 10% of its workforce go—about 700 employees in the United States and Europe—joining a number of tech players that have announced hiring freezes or job cuts as fears of a recession mount.On both Twitter and LinkedIn, Siemiatkowski praised the work of his former employees and linked to a Google Sheet that contained contact details for about 600 of them, created as an outreach tool for recruiters by a coworker who survived the layoffs.
