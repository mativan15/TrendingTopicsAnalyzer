 A quarter of a million US Army soldiers will be using collaboration tool Google Workspace after entering into a partnership with the tech giant. Google Cloud made its announcement last week, after the service was granted Impact Level 4 authorization by the Department of Defense in July, which sanctions its use for handling controlled unclassified information, such as that pertaining to defense and intelligence. The partnership comes off the back of the creation of the company's new division, Google Public Sector, responsible for providing its cloud-based services to local and federal public institutions in the US, in order to streamline their operations.
