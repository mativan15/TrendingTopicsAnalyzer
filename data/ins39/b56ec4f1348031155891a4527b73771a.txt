Credit cards for consumers with bad credit won't provide the high limits and great rewards found among the very best credit cards, and that's OK. The goal of these cards is to help repair credit ratings so that consumers can move on to those better credit card offers in the future.Poor credit -- usually defined as a FICO score under 580 -- will definitely reduce the number of available credit cards, but there are still plenty of good options for consumers hoping to rebuild their credit. Secured credit cards require a deposit to open your account and usually provide lower rates and fees than unsecured cards designed for those with bad credit.
