BJP has withdrawn its candidate for the forthcoming Andheri bypoll in Maharashtra. It will be the first significant poll in the state after the collapse of the MVA government on the heels of a split in the Shiv Sena.
The outcome of BJP's decision is that Rutuja Latke, candidate of the Uddhav Thackeray faction of Shiv Sena, is all but guaranteed a win. The bypoll is on account of the demise of Ramesh Latke who won in the last election.

BJP's decision to withdraw its candidate was preceded by public lobbying by other political parties to do so.
