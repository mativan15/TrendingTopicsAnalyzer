Audie Cornish, the venerated NPR host who left the public radio giant in January to join CNN and the now-shuttered CNN+, will premiere her first podcast with CNN Audio, The Assignment With Audie Cornish, on Nov. 17. Releasing Thursdays on all major podcast platforms, the show will feature interviews with 'everyday people' at the center of debates happening in the arts, education, politics, business and sports, according to CNN. 'I'm thrilled to launch The Assignment with the CNN Audio team. I've long wanted a show that spotlights the voices of real people living through stories at the intersection of hard news and pop culture,' Cornish said in a statement.
