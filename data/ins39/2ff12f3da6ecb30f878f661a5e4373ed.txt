As hospitals across the province grapple with lengthy patient wait times and staffing shortages, London, Ont., NDP MPPs say they have scheduled a town hall Thursday night to discuss the issue and to hear concerns from local constituents.
The town hall, which will be held at Goodwill Industries on Horton Street at 7 p.m., is aimed at addressing 'the health care crisis and impact of privatization in Ontario's public health care system,' a party advisory reads.Word of the town hall comes a day after London Health Sciences Centre reported significant wait times of more than 15 hours in its emergency departments for non-urgent matters.
