luza studios/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is a pharma company that specialises on pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and consumer healthcare. Although it has a large drugs portfolio, its focus is on one single drug, Dupixent (14% of sales). The reliance-on-one-drug strategy represents large risks as both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) have recently delivered similar products to the market. Sanofi positioned itself as a leader in the vaccines segment, but failed badly during the COVID-19 outbreak and is still playing a catch-up game with the mRNA technology.
