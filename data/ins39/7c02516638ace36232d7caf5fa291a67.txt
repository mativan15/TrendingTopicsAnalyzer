(Bloomberg) -- The UK is opening applications for as much as £40 billion ($45.1 billion) of funding to energy traders to stave off a worsening liquidity crisis.Volatile European energy-market prices have meant companies face historically high levels of liquidity issues, meaning they have to tie up huge amounts of capital, locking up funds. The UK follows countries in Europe, as well as the European Securities and Markets Authority, in trying to help smooth conditions.The Energy Markets Financing Scheme will help firms facing temporary short-term financing problems and allow commercial banks to provide larger credit lines to approved companies.
