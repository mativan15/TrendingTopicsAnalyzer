Oct. 15—PERU — In the week prior to Friday night's showdown in high school football between undefeateds Peru and Moriah, fans gathered at Stewart's in Port Henry daily to talk about the big matchup.

"It was all the Stewart's talk for sure," Alex Larrow, a Moriah graduate said as he and his friends tailgated before the game in the parking lot at Peru High School.

Larrow and his buddies Colin Harris, Tanner Whalen, and Austin McKiernan made the 50-minute drive up from southern Essex County to watch the Vikings square off against the Nighthawks.
