Fury had been in talks with Joshua over a December showdown but will instead take on Derek Chisora for a third time Tyson Fury has pocketed £10,000 after winning a bet with his promoter Frank Warren over his doomed fight with Anthony Joshua. Fury and Joshua were a signature away from agreeing to fight in December but talks ultimately collapsed, leaving Fury to instead opt to face Derek Chisora. The heavyweight rivals will clash three weeks before Christmas at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. But Warren was so confident Fury WOULD fight Joshua that he struck a £10,000 wager with his fighter - and has now been forced to pay up.
