Piramal Pharma on Wednesday listed its shares on the BSE and National Stock Exchange (NSE). In June 2020, the Carlyle Group Inc invested equity capital for a 20 per cent stake in Piramal Pharma Limited (PPL). Accordingly, the pharmaceuticals business was vertically demerged from Limited (PEL). In October 2021, the board of directors of PEL approved the demerger of the pharmaceuticals business and simplification of the corporate structure to transform PEL from being a multi-sector conglomerate to two separate sector-focused listed entities in financial services and pharmaceuticals.
