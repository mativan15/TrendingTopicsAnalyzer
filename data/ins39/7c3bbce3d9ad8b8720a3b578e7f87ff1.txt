(NASDAQ:RCM), a provider of revenue cycle management services to healthcare companies, dropped for the third straight session on Friday to reach a 52-week low on below-average volume. About ~1.4M RCM shares have changed hands, compared to the 65-day average volume of ~1.9M. Today's decline followed a bearish view on the Murray, Utah company from Truist Securities, which slashed its price target to a Street low of $25 from $29, citing an uncertain macro environment, rising interest rates, and market volatility.
