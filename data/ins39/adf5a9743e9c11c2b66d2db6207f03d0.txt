Meghan Markle's wedding day was one for the ages — but could have made history books for all the wrong reasons.
The actress wedded her beloved Prince Harry in May 2018 at St. George's Chapel.
Her bridal look came complete with a Givenchy gown and the shining Queen Mary tiara given to her by the late Queen Elizabeth. 
However, the Duchess of Sussex, 41, reportedly wanted a different headpiece for her big day.
Royal historian Robert Lacey claimed in his book, 'Battle of Brothers: William and Harry,' that Markle wanted to wear an emerald and diamond-encrusted tiara on her wedding day instead.
