The Tennessee Titans already figure to have the kicker spot locked up for 2022 after inking veteran kicker Randy Bullock to a two-year deal this offseason.
However, undrafted free agent kicker out of Iowa, Caleb Shudak, appears set to give Bullock a run for his money this offseason. Shudak has been impressive in the limited looks we've gotten of him early on.
On Day 2 of rookie minicamp, Shudak nailed all of his field goal attempts with head coach Mike Vrabel and general manager Jon Robinson watching close by, including a 55-yard attempt.
