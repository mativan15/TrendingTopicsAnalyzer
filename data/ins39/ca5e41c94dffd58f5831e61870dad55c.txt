Peter Crouch says he is under extreme pressure from his kids to spill the names of mystery celebs on The Masked Dancer. The dad of four says his two daughters have been begging him to reveal their identities. But the former England, Liverpool and Stoke ace has been holding firm. He knows the girls would spill the beans and jeopardise the chance of him coming back and sitting on the panel again. 'My girls have been dying to know and pulling every trick in the book to try and get the names out of me,' said Peter, 41.
