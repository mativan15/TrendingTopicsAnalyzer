Tickets are being sold under premium tatkal category in the range of ₹2500 to ₹8500 which is several fold higher than normal fare. The premium tatkal has dynamic pricing which means ticket prices increase based on demand.People who are trying to travel as schools and colleges are reopening are forced to spend more as berths are on waitlist on trains connecting Chennai with cities including Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Madurai, Thiruvananthapuram and others.
