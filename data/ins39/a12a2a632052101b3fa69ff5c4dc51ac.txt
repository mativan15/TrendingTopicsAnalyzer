ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Outside the beige walls of the Ramsey County Courthouse, more than 30 people chanted 'Democracy!' in near-freezing weather Wednesday and held up signs reading, 'We Choose Us" — the name of a voting rights advocacy organization that opposes efforts to make voting more difficult in counties across Minnesota.

Members said groups such as the Dakota County Patriots and MidWest Swamp Watch are 'attacking our democracy' by calling for 'dangerous changes' that include hand-counting ballots, limiting drop-off boxes, and flooding a county election office with dozens of data requests that are bogging down staff.
