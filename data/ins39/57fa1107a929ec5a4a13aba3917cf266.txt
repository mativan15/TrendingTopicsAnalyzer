Published: 20:08 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 20:08 EDT, 18 October 2022 Google Maps shows a cheeky label for the location where New York City Mayor Eric Adams has decided to house asylum seekers in the city.Rather than reading 'Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center' - as Adams called the soon to be opened center on Randalls Island - on Google Maps the facility location is tagged as 'Adams Tent City.'The tag appears when navigating over the northwest coast of the the remote island between Manhattan and Queens in Google Maps, but is only visible when zoomed in to about 100 feet above ground level.
