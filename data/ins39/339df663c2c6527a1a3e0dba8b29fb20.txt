New chancellor Jeremy Hunt has refused to back Liz Truss as a confident leader who has a grip on the economy.

In a sign of just how weak Truss's political authority is after an extraordinarily damaging week, Hunt instead chose to sympathise with his new boss, saying she is 'under extraordinary pressure'.

Hunt was appointed as chancellor on Friday after the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng, but is now widely seen as more powerful than the prime minister herself.
