October 19, 2022 / 11:13 PM / CBS Boston By Courtney Cole, WBZ-TVBOSTON - Even in the face of danger, Jean McGuire has never been one to let fear dictate her life. "Oh no, no. Don't be afraid, go anywhere you want," she said. "Boston. New England. Get yourself together. This should be a safe country." In an exclusive interview with the civil rights and educational trailblazer, she spoke with WBZ-TV's Courtney Cole about the night she was attacked in Franklin Park. Late Wednesday, police released surveillance images of the man they are calling a person of interest in the stabbing.
