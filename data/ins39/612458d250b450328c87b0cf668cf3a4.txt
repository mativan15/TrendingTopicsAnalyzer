A bleak business confidence survey published by ANZ is a sign that the economy may be in worse shape than the Reserve Bank believes and inflation may be peaking, rival bank ASB says. The ANZ survey found a net 56% of firms expected economic conditions to deteriorate, putting their expectations at their lowest since the April 2020 ‘level 4' Covid lockdown. ANZ chief economist Sharon Zoller noted the proportion of firms expecting to raise their prices over the next three months had slipped slightly over the month, from 80% to a new figure of 71%.
