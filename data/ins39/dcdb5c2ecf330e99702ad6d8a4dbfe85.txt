New Zealand dairy companies have applied to answer the call from the United States for baby formula. Fonterra and The a2 Milk Company (a2MC) have submitted applications to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to supply finished infant formula to parents in the country amid severe shortages. Fonterra director of stakeholder affairs and trade, Simon Tucker said the company was fully aware of the severity of the situation in the US and wanted to help. The company doesn't currently distribute baby formula to the US but A2 does.
