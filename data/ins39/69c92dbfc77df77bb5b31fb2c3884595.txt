Burns may be a good Putinologist, but even he didn't predict how much the Russian leader would scramble the Biden administration's foreign policy agenda.
During Burns' Senate confirmation hearing in February, he said that, as CIA director, he would have 'four crucial and inter-related priorities.' They were: 'China, technology, people and partnerships.'
Russia was not on that priorities list. To be fair, few people in Washington were bothered by that at the time. The city was far more obsessed, on a bipartisan basis, with China and its ambitions.
