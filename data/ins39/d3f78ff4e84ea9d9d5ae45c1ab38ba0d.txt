The Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers' Welfare Association has appealed to the State government to demarcate areas in the district as industrial zones in the revised Master Plan that is under preparation. P. Nallathambi, president of the Association, said that of late there were several complaints from residents about pollution from industries in their respective neighbourhoods. This was leading to sealing of industries, etc. There were several clusters in the city with presence of industries and houses.
