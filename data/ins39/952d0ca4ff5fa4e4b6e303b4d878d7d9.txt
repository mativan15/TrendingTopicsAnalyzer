It's just as you suspected: your Gen Z and millennial coworkers just aren't taking cybersecurity at work seriously enough. 
Professional services firm EY made that determination after speaking to 1,000 US workers whose current job requires the use of a work-issued laptop/computer a majority of the time. While 83 percent of respondents said they understood their employer's security protocols, the data points to a disconnect between understanding and implementation.
According to EY's findings, 58 percent of Gen Z and 42 percent of millennial respondents said they disregard mandatory IT updates for as long as possible, something only 15 percent of boomers and 31 percent of Gen X admitted to.
