STANFORD AT NOTRE DAME
Records: Stanford 1-4, Notre Dame 3-2
Kickoff: 4:30 p.m., Notre Dame Stadium

Series history: Notre Dame has won three straight and leads the all-time series 22-13. The teams have met every year since 1997, except for the pandemic-affected 2020 season.
Storylines: The Legends Trophy – made from Northern California redwood with an Irish crystal bowl – is on the line … Notre Dame recovered from its 0-2 start under new coach Marcus Freeman and is a 17-point favorite over Stanford, which hasn't won a game against FBS competition in 54 weeks, the longest streak in the country.
