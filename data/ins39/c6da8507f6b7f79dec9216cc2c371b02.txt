A man has revealed that he spent $4,500 on new gacha game Dislyte and still failed to max out his character.
Dislyte, the latest game from Lillith Games, best known for the mobile game AFK Arena, has been met with a very mixed response from gacha game fans, due to its overreliance on spending money to do pretty much anything. 
Gacha games are based off of the real life gachapon machines from Japan, those little machines you pop 20p in to get a toy in a spherical capsule. They're still huge with collectors in Japan and the gacha video games are enormous world wide.
