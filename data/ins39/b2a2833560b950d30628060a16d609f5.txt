LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields were edging back towards multi-year highs on Tuesday with investors focused on central bank policy, while eyes were on Britain's gilt market after reports the Bank of England (BoE) could delay the start of quantitative tightening.

The Financial Times reported the BoE was likely to delay the sale of billions of pounds of government bonds to encourage greater stability in gilt markets.

The central bank had previously delayed the start of quantitative tightening from Oct.
