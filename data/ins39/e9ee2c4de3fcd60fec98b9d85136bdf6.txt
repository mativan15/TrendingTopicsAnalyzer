When governments hand out money, there's usually a catch. 
Yet with Rishi Sunak's cost of living payment package, the general consensus appears to be that it will genuinely help the most vulnerable households to bear the burden of sharply rising energy bills, grocery bills and everything else bills. 
Analysis from the Institute Of Fiscal Studies suggests a worker on around £29,000 will now see their real take-home incomes stay approximately the same this year as last. 
A full-time minimum wage worker on around £16,200 will be about £340 better off this year after adjusting for inflation.
