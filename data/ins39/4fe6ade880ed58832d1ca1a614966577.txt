Nadine Dorries has slammed Tory MPs who have been plotting to remove Liz Truss from Number 10. The Brexit-backing Mid Bedfordshire MP took to social media to take aim at her Conservative colleagues, including those who helped oust Boris Johnson from Downing Street.Writing on Twitter, the ex-Culture Secretary said: "I cannot imagine there's one G7 country which thinks we're worthy of a place at the table."The removal of one electorally successful PM, the disgraceful plotting to remove another by those who didn't get their way first time round is destabilising our economy and our reputation.
