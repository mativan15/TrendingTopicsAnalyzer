Good morning. On behalf of all the men and women of the FBI, it's an honor to be here today to remember Bryan and honor his life.For those of you who may not know, Bryan joined the Bureau in March of 1992, and he spent his 30 years of dedicated FBI service here in Mobile.His father, Clay, was also a Bureau employee, working 42 years with the FBI before retiring as FBI Mobile's photographer.And Bryan's mom, Mary, had also been an FBI employee before Bryan was born.So it's clear that the FBI was in Bryan's blood.
