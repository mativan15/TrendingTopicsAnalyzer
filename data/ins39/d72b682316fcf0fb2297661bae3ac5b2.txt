A left-wing Democrat challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the June 7 California House primary blasted the longtime lawmaker Monday as a 'corrupt oligarch' who only caters to elites after Pelosi's husband was busted for alleged drunk driving near the couple's $5 million Napa Valley vineyard.
'More people are coming to recognize the corruption of the incumbent, which is ultimately why I ran,' Shahid Buttar — who is running to unseat the 18-term Democrat in California's 12th District — told The Post in an interview.
