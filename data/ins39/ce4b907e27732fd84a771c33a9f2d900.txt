Schroptschop/E+ via Getty Images iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers ETF (BATS:BATS:PICK) is an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to companies involved in the extraction and production of diversified metals, aluminum, steel, precious metals and minerals. The expense ratio of the fund is 0.39%. Assets under management were $1.654 billion as of May 27, 2022. I last covered PICK in late 2021, and believed that it was a "strong buy" as I thought it was undervalued on the basis of its fundamental valuation.
