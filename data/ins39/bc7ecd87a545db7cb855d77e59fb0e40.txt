A NSW parliamentary hearing went off the rails after a government MP said witnesses were peddling 'conspiracy theories' and drew a heated response.A committee looking into the government's handling of land acquisitions for major transport projects invited Sydney residents to have their say on Friday.The witnesses included people who said they weren't adequately compensated when they were made to give up their homes in the inner west to make room for the WestConnex motorway.Among the witnesses was former St Peters resident Richard Capuano, who said in a submission to the inquiry transport authorities had low-balled him when his home was acquired in 2014.
