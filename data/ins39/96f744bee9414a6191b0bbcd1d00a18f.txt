A civic group says blood tests it conducted on people living near US military bases in Okinawa have detected two to four times Japan's national average level of widely used chemical compounds known collectively as PFAS, or poly-fluorinated alkyl substances. Many of the compounds are described as toxic. The group on Saturday released the test results of blood samples collected from 387 people in six municipalities in Okinawa Prefecture. The tests were conducted with the help of Kyoto University following a series of reports on the compounds being detected in high concentrations in rivers and spring water near US military bases in the prefecture.
