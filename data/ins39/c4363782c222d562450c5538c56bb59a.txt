Daria Chyrakh and her partner Anton Intiuk came to Canada two weeks after their home town of Kyiv was bombed by Russia.
'Other countries said to Ukraine, ‘Russia can start a war in your country' but we thought it was impossible,' Chyrakh explains. 'When we saw the bombings we understand it's really (dangerous).''The second day or third day (of bombings) my husband said, we must go to another place to save our lives.'Soon they'll be joined by more than 50 other refugees at Gimli's Training Centre.
