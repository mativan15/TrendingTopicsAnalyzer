The Enfield Republican Town Committee is calling on two Democratic Town Council members to resign after they were allegedly seen on surveillance video removing GOP signs from the lawn of a store on Hazard Avenue.

The video shows a truck pull up at night in front of a store. Two men, identified as Democratic council members Matthew Despard and Nick Hopkins, get out of the truck, walk to the edges of the lot and begin removing signs, placing them in the back of the truck. Among the signs removed is that of Carol Hall, the incumbent and Despard's Republican opponent in the race for state representative in the 59th District.
