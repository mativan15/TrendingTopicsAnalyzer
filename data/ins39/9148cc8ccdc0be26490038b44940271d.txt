First-time coach Camila Cabello was finally feeling the stress that comes with being a Voice coach Tuesday night, when she paired her two most interesting contestants – Eric Who and Sydney Kronmiller – against each other. Eric and Sydney performed a theatrical, slow-burning rendition of Lady Gaga's "Paparazzi" that was so good, Camila couldn't decide who to save and who to let go. "I'm so stressed," Camila told host Carson Daly. "See, now she's really feeling what the Battles are all about right here," said Gwen Stefani.
