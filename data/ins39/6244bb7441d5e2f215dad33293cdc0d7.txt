The U.S. earnings season is under way. So far, only 19 out of 418 companies in the U.S. technology sector have reported their latest earnings results; next week, we will see earnings from big names such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The sector remains under pressure. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLK) is down 28.7 per cent year-to-date, which is still better than the dismal performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, down 31.3 per cent over the same period. This week we screened for stocks in the beaten-down sector that are outperforming their benchmarks ahead of their upcoming release of earnings.
