Bengaluru: Edtech firm FrontRow has laid off close to 145 full-time and contractual employees, almost 30% of its workforce, as funding dries up amid the market downturn. The company confirmed the layoffs to ET, and said they were undertaken to increase efficiencies and lengthen the company's runway. It said most of the layoffs were from the sales and business development teams. After years of hypergrowth, edtech firms are bracing for a slowdown in funding and a few, including Unacademy and Vedantu, have laid off employees in recent months to cut costs and increase efficiencies.
