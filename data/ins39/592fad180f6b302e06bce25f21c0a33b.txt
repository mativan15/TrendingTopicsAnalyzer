Leica is back on the scene with a new camera, sort of. It's bringing the M6 rangefinder back into production, 20 years after it was supplanted by the M7. The timing may be curious to digital-only creators, but it comes at a time where photochemical film is enjoying a renaissance. As NBC News detailed in a recent report(Opens in a new window), swaths of millennials and Gen-Z picked up film cameras during COVID lockdown, driving prices higher on the used market.

That's good news for old camera hoarders looking to downsize collections, but leaves the young, scrappy, and hungry set out in the cold.
