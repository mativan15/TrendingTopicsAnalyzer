May 30—IPSWICH — It seemed serendipitous: Mary Cayer's son, like a lot of kids, wanted a dog. and his sister's friend's mom was a dog breeder.

While most of the puppies at "Just Behaving" went for thousands of dollars, breeder Heidi Harris did have one dog who might fit the family's budget.

Reese, a 5-year-old dachshund, was available, for $500.

"She's done breeding," Cayer's lawyer said his client was told.

As it turns out, Reese wasn't done.

Now Cayer, 52, of Ipswich, could be facing felony larceny charges, after Harris accused her of stealing Reese — and the four puppies that Reese, unbeknownst to either Cayer or Harris, was carrying.
