James Corden has said he did "nothing wrong" and is feeling "zen" after being criticised by a New York restaurant owner for his alleged bad behaviour.

The actor and comedian, 44, was briefly barred from Balthazar in Manhattan on Monday after Keith McNally claimed he had been "extremely nasty" to his staff on two separate occasions.
