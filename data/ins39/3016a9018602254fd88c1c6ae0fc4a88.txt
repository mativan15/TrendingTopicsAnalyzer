That's another mystery solved.
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery director Rian Johnson confirmed at a press conference at the BFI London Film Festival that lead character Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is queer, according to Entertainment Weekly.
There's a scene in the soon-to-be-released sequel to the 2019 Knives Out where Blanc, a crazy detective, has a live-in male lover.
'Yes, he obviously is,' Johnson said when asked about the character's sexuality. 'And there's nobody in the world I can imagine in bringing me more joy for Benoit Blanc to be with,' he added in reference to the unknown actor who plays Blanc's lover.
