The BBC has prepared secret scripts which could be broadcast if energy shortages cause blackouts or the loss of gas supplies this winter.The scripts, seen by the Guardian, set out how the corporation would reassure the public in the event that a 'major loss of power' causes mobile telephone networks, the internet, banking systems, or traffic lights to fail across England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland would be unaffected because its electricity grid is shared with the Republic of Ireland.The public would be advised to use car radios or battery-powered receivers to listen to emergency broadcasts on FM and long-wave frequencies usually reserved for Radio 2 and Radio 4.
