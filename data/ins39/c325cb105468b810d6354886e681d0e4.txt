MOSCOW, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Weekly consumer prices in Russia rose marginally for the fourth week running, data published on Wednesday showed, adding weight to analysts' expectations that the Bank of Russia may decide to end its rate-cutting cycle next week.

The central bank cut its key rate six times this year after an emergency hike to 20% in February as Russia sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, causing inflation to spike.
