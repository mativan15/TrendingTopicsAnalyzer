May 28—Laurel Havens said pandemic-related transports during the past two years increased the wear and tear on his ambulances.

The executive director of Muskogee County Emergency Medical Services accepted delivery of a new ambulance on Friday. The ambulance was purchased by Muskogee County commissioners, who presented it to MCEMS.

"We normally rotate our ambulances out every four to five years," Havens said. "During COVID, because of the abnormal length of distances that we were transporting patients to, our ambulances were exceeding the maximum mileage quicker than we could replace them financially.
