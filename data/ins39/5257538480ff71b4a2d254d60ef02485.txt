Steve Cooper says Saturday's game with Liverpool is a reminder of why Nottingham Forest were so desperate to get back in the big time.Forest host Liverpool at the City Ground in a repeat of their first home fixture in the Premier League in 1992, when Teddy Sheringham's goal gave them a 1-0 win.It has been 23 long years since the Anfield club have visited in the league as Forest meandered in the second and third tier.Boss Cooper was the man to bring them back up last season and says Saturday lunchtime's game is their reward.
