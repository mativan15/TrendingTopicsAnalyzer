No MLS team has won more games, scored more goals or earned more points in the regular season than LAFC since it entered the league five years ago.

The playoffs, however, have been the team's krytonite.

Four times the team has made the postseason, and until Thursday it had only one win to show for it. Nineteen other MLS teams have won at least that often in the playoffs over that span.

Denis Bouanga wasn't there for any of that history. And if he knew about, he ignored it, scoring twice in his playoff debut to help LAFC to a 3-2 win over the Galaxy at Banc of California Stadium, sending the team to the Western Conference finals against the winner of Sunday's Austin-Dallas game.
