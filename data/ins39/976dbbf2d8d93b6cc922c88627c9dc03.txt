Lost in translation of the Hawkeyes' offensive woes is the fact that Iowa hasn't necessarily started the way it's wanted to defensively in each of the past three games.
In fact, each of Iowa's past three opponents have scored on their opening possessions. That started with a 12-play, 66-yard drive at Rutgers, it continued with an 11-play, 75-yard drive by Michigan and Illinois also began its contest against Iowa with a 17-play, 66-yard scoring drive.

Of course, the Hawkeyes stiffened in the red zone and held both the Scarlet Knights and Fighting Illini to field goals.
