EXCLUSIVE: Ron Perlman (Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio), Yolonda Ross (The Chi) and Daniel Diemer (The Midnight Club) will star opposite Liam Neeson in the mob thriller Thug, reteaming the Oscar nominee with Cold Pursuit director Hans Petter Moland.

	The film from Sculptor Media and Electromagnetic Production, which is currently shooting in Boston, revolves around an aging Boston gangster (Neeson) who attempts to reconnect with his children and rectify the mistakes in his past, though the criminal underworld won't loosen its grip willingly.
