The latest generation Apple TV 4K improves where it counts.

While Tim Cook didn't take the stage for an Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc. Report event today, the Cupertino-based technology giant did drop some new products. Here we're discussing the next-generation Apple TV 4K.

The big news here is the new lower starting price of just $129.99. And that's considerably less than the $179.99 starting price. It's also for double the storage at 64GB starting. Apple's also boosting the performance with the A15 Bionic chip.
