The modern F1 race cars are networked, connected and intelligent machines that have hundreds of sensors. These sensors deliver billions of data points, that are analysed, and help the cars outperform their competition – just like Lewis Hamilton did in his dramatic win at the Silverstone! 
But what does that have to do with better healthcare? Well, one piece of technology that is changing the way healthcare is being delivered is Balistocardiography combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
Balistocardiography or BCG was developed in 1877 by JW Gordon that was inspired by seismology and was majorly developed to explore and monitor cardiac activity by incorporating sensors used in weighing scales.
