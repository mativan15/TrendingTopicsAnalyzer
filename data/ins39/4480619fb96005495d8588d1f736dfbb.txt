Prices are rising rapidly, inflation is close to double figures, a war has caused disruption to energy supplies, crowds are flocking to see Abba and the country is getting ready to celebrate the Queen's jubilee with street parties and community events. This is 1977 and the parallels with today as Her Majesty marks 70 years on the throne are startling.
