By Joe Hoppe Fiske PLC said Thursday that it swung to a pretax loss in fiscal 2022 as revenue fell on macroeconomic volatility, and that Chairman Clive Harrison will step down in 2023. The independent stockbroking and investment-management company said pretax loss was 349,000 pounds ($391,508) for the 13 months ended June 30, compared with a restated profit of GBP366,000 pounds in comparable period. Revenue in the period fell to GBP5.8 million from GBP5.9 million, as the second half of fiscal 2022 was hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the knock-on effect on energy prices and a subsequent acceleration in tightening of global monetary policy, the company said.
