Domino's Pizza's (DPZ -4.78%) stock surged 10% on Oct. 13 after the pizza chain posted its third quarter earnings report. Its revenue rose 7% year-over-year to $1.07 billion and matched analysts' expectations. Its global retail sales grew nearly 5% on a constant currency basis, with its 2% same-store sales growth in the U.S. offsetting its 1.8% decline overseas.
But its adjusted earnings still declined 14% to $2.79 per share, which missed analysts' expectations by $0.19. Investors seemed to gloss over that bottom-line miss and focus on its accelerating domestic sales growth instead, but Domino's stock still remains down more than 40% for the year.
