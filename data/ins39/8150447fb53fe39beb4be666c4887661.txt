Even if Mac Jones is healthy enough to play, Patriots coach Bill Belichick won't commit to naming him the starting quarterback for next week's game against Chicago.'We'll see how that process is,' Belichick said Monday morning. 'Mac still wasn't able to play [Sunday]. We'll continue to evaluate him and see how he's doing physically.'Jones, who suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 3 against Baltimore, has missed New England's last three games. The Patriots elected not to place him on injured reserve, indicating they were hopeful he would be able to return within a four-week span.
