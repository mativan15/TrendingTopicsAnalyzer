The Wrap Netflix has defended 'The Crown' as a 'fictional dramatization,' after former UK prime minister John Major called the show a 'barrel load of nonsense' and railed that its depictions of his time in office were 'damaging and malicious fiction.'The former prime minister's comments came after the show was accused of fabricating a smear against King Charles, showing him lobbying Major for a secret plot to oust the Queen.Major's office told The Mail on Sunday that the meeting never took place.
