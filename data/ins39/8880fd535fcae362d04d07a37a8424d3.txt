Harper hit his fourth homer this postseason and Schwarber hit a jaw-dropping, 488-foot drive that carried the Philadelphia Phillies over the San Diego Padres 2-0 Tuesday night to open the all-wild card NL Championship Series. Zack Wheeler was awesome, too, combining with two relievers on a one-hitter for Philadelphia.
