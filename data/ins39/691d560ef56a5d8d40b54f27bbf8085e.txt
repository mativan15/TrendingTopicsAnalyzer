India and the UK are unlikely to finalise a trade deal before 2023, largely because of the political turmoil in Britain and differences within the outgoing Liz Truss (she resigned Thursday) government on issues such as mobility of professionals and immigration, people familiar with the negotiations said.Though both sides continue to be engaged in negotiations for the free trade agreement (FTA), it is now becoming increasingly clear the earlier deadline of Diwali will not be met, the people said. The Indian side has firmed up its stance on key issues such as mobility of professionals, students and automobiles and indicated it will not budge on these, they added.
