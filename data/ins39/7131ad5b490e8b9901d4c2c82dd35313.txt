With today's technology, deluxe laptop PCs can easily overpower many mainstream desktops, and nowhere is that clearer than in gaming PCs. The 15.6-inch MSI Raider GE67 HX isn't as colossal as the company's 17.3-inch GT77 Titan (though one configuration shares that behemoth's blazing Intel Core i9-12900HX CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics), but our test unit is less than half as expensive at $2,499.99. Even at its much lower price, the Raider still boasts a gorgeous OLED screen and impressive audio, not to mention excellent productivity and gaming performance.
