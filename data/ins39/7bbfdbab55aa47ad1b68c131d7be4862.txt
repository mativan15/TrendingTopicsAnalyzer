Southwest Airlines Co. launched a new referral program on Monday aimed at attracting new business clients as travel demand continues to recover.

The Dallas-based carrier's "Refer-a-Company" program allows individuals to earn 25,000 Rapid Rewards points for each company they refer to Southwest's managed travel system. An individual can refer a maximum of five companies, which means they can receive up to 125,000 Rapid Rewards points in a 12-month period.

After a busy summer travel season, Southwest (NYSE: LUV) has turned its attention to business travel in the fall.
