NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of doing "pressure politics" following the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)'s summons to Manish Sisodia and alleged he was more of a "corrupt collection agent" of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal than deputy CM.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also hit out at Kejriwal, who he alleged was "kingpin" of scams his ministers are accused of, for comparing the action against Sisodia and another minister Satyendar Jain with what the British did to Bhagat Singh.
