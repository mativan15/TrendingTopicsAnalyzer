With a price-to-earnings (or "P/E") ratio of 22.3x The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Southern could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth.
