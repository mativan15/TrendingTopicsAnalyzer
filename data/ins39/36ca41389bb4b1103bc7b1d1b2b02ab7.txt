The Tennessee Titans have been ravaged by injuries early on this season, and while many positions have been impacted, perhaps none have been more so than the outside linebacker group.

Tennessee lost Harold Landry for the entire 2022 campaign due to a torn ACL, Ola Adeniyi has missed the last three games and is currently on injured reserve, and Bud Dupree has missed two games and exited two others early.

Despite all that, the Titans' pass-rush has still proven to be formidable thanks to the emergence of Rashad Weaver, and with the usual strong showings from Jeffery Simmons and Denico Autry.
