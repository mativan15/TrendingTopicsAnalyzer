UK house prices slowed in August but growth remained in double-digit levels as the property market remains resilient to inflationary pressure and turmoil in the wider UK economy.

Fresh figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday show property prices increased by 13.6% year-on-year in August.

That was down from 16% in July, which reflected how prices in the same month last year were hit by the end of a tax break for home-buyers.
