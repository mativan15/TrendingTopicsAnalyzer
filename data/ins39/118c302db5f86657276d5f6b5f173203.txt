Danielle Johnson started her ecommerce shop, Plantish by JM, in 2020 with no idea where it would lead. A native of Jamaica, she says her family couldn't afford to send her to college and most jobs there didn't pay well.

"In Jamaica, the school system is kind of made for people that work 9-to-5 jobs," Johnson says. "There's no outlet for entrepreneurs or people that want to start a business, so I spent a lot of my life not fitting in, outside the box."

So, she took the entrepreneurial leap and started her own business selling herbal teas, all naturally harvested in Jamaica and sold to customers in the U.
