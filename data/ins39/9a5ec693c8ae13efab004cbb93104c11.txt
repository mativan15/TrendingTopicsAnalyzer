The Interpol on Thursday unveiled the first-ever ‘metaverse' specifically designed for law enforcement worldwide, at its ongoing 90th General Assembly in Delhi. The Interpol metaverse allows the registered users to take a virtual tour of its general secretariat headquarters in France's Lyon, interact with other officers via their avatars, and even take training courses in forensic investigation and other policing skills, it said.
