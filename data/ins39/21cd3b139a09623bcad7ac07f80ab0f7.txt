Hong Kong (CNN)Concerns are growing for Australian TV host Cheng Lei, who has been detained in China for nearly two years, following an interview with her partner in which he claimed authorities had cut her access to embassy officials and tightened her food supply.Cheng, a former business anchor for China's state broadcaster CGTN and mother of two, is accused of illegally supplying state secrets overseas, a charge that carries a possible sentence of between five years to life in prison. She has been in custody since August 2020 and her original detention came amid rapidly worsening ties between Canberra and Beijing.
