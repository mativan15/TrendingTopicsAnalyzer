Q: Who isn't in the rotation at the start of the season? – Danny.

A: Um, most of the roster. Two-way players Jamal Cain and Dru Smith will likely have to wait their turn, and since each is limited to being on the active roster for up to 50 games, it might behoove the Heat to keep them inactive early. Omer Yurtseven has been out nearly two weeks with ankle pain, so that likely has him out of the mix Wednesday against the Bulls. And Udonis Haslem didn't participate in the preseason, so there likely is little reason that would chance with the rest of the roster healthy.
