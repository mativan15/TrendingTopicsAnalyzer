gorodenkoff Magnachip Semiconductor Corporation (NYSE:MX) has performed extremely poorly over the past year. It is now a $454 million market cap semiconductor company with a $50 million buyback program. I think some big holders have indicated they want out (note the price action), and MX will probably negotiate a price where to take them out. Data by YCharts I have egg on my face, as I've been bullish from a signed deal (that got blocked) to rumors of another deal (that didn't come to fruition). I've been holding and even adding on the way down.
