Adam Smith, the eighteenth century guru of modern capitalism and free market economics, should be essential reading for our politicians.
Prior to the eighteenth century and its Enlightenment, the vast majority of people in the world were subsistence peasants who had no means to grow their wealth beyond being the servants of the rich. It is the application of Smith's ideas in his twin works Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations  — not the ideas of Marx — that have, via an invisible hand, lifted the world out of poverty and servitude, 
As Smith observed, it is through economic growth via the reward for the ideas and labour of the masses — not the accumulation of wealth of property owners — that wealth is created.
