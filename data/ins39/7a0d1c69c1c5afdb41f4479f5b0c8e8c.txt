courtneyk/E+ via Getty Images Cambria Tail Risk ETF (BATS:TAIL) is a vehicle that aims to protect an investor's portfolio from significant downside market risk. As per the ETF's literature: The Fund intends to invest in a portfolio of 'out of the money' put options purchased on the U.S. stock market. TAIL strategy offers the potential advantage of buying more puts when volatility is low and fewer puts when volatility is high. While a portion of the fund's assets will be invested in the basket of long put option premiums, the majority of fund assets will be invested in intermediate term US Treasuries.
