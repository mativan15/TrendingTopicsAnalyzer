Despite the success, the Warriors' three titles aren't enough. 'Boston was very important and those guys were very helpful. They're friends to this day — not too close friends, though,' Lacob said. 'I want to kill them right now, I'm going to be honest. I'm very competitive about this and I'm sure they are, too. It's going to be a battle on the court and a little bit of a battle on the ownership level, too. We want to kill each other and we want to win, both teams. And they should.'
