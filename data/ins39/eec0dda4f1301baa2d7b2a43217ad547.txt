1997 Formula 1 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve believes Daniel Ricciardo's spell with McLaren is over, with the team 'preparing the media' for an axing.

Daniel Ricciardo's time with McLaren is coming to an end prematurely, according to Jacques Villeneuve. The 1997 F1 World Champion said that recent comments from CEO Zak Brown show that machinations are already in place to remove the Australian from his seat.
