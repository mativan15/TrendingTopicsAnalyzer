Coach Mack Brown and the North Carolina road warriors added their fourth straight road win of the season in Saturday's 38-35 win at Duke. No, the Tar Heels did not trade in their mascot, but they've definitely changed their mindset.

'Considering that we've been able to win close games and on the road, it definitely shows that we're growing as a team,' linebacker Cedric Gray said.

Carolina (6-1, 3-0 ACC) went 0-for-5 last season in road games. Add on its bowl losses from the 2020 and 2021 seasons, it was 0-for its last seven away from Kenan Stadium.
