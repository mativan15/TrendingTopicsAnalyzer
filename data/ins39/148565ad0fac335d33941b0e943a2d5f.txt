Published: 23:26 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 01:20 EDT, 18 October 2022 The Bureau of Meteorology's unexpected $70,000 rebranding of its nickname under the former government has sparked a maelstrom of bemused and waggish responses. The national weather forecaster asked media outlets to stop referring to it by its longstanding household nickname "the BoM", or "the Weather Bureau". Instead, it wants to be called "the Bureau" at second reference, in line it says with the 1955 Meteorology Act. "With an ever-increasing number of severe weather events, it is more crucial than ever that the Bureau of Meteorology's insights, wisdom, data and information are shared, understood and acted upon," it said in a statement on Tuesday.
