Editor's note: Thompson changed drivers recently, then went back to her previous Cobra driver. She returned to her Cobra RadSpeed driver she played last season in the weeks leading up to the 2022 U.S. Women's Open. The conversation below, which occurred before she switched back, focuses on the most recent Cobra model. 
David Dusek: You transitioned into the new Cobra LTDx driver fairly quickly.
Lexi Thompson: The first time I saw it was at a photoshoot for Cobra, and I really liked the looks of it, to begin with, but then I started hitting it for the action shots in the commercial and I was ripping it.
