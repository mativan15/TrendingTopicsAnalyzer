The cost of rapidly charging an electric car has risen by a fifth in just eight months due to soaring energy prices, new data has shown.

According to the RAC, the average price of using a public rapid charger in the UK increased from 36.7p per kilowatt hour (kWh) in September 2021 to 44.6p per kWh this month.

This has added £4 to the typical cost of completing an 80% rapid charge of a family-sized electric vehicle (EV) with a 64kWh battery.
