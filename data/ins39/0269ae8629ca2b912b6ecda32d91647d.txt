Welcome to our continuing daily coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here is a summary of the main recent developments: Vladimir Putin said he believed the 'partial mobilisation' of army reservists would be completed in two weeks. The Russian president said after attending a summit in Kazakhstan on Friday that a total of 222,000 reservists would be called up, down from the 300,000 figure initially circulated after the order last month. The Belarus defence ministry said Russian troops would start arriving in the country 'in the next few days' as part of its joint force.
