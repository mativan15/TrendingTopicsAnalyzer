Srivatsan's success began with his father, Mr Rajagopal, an accountant at a pharmaceutical company who always had faith in his son's abilities. Mr Rajagopal invested in his kid's enthusiasm and devotion when any other middle-class father would have been hesitant to allow his son to pursue an unconventional profession like gaming.

Vatsan has been playing video games since he was a toddler. As he grew older, his passion for video games evolved into a desire to work as a game developer. He began exploring courses and universities for gaming education at an early age, whereas most of his peers went to study engineering or medicine.
