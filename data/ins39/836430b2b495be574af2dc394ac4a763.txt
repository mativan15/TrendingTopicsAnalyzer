La Liga president Javier Tebas has told Barcelona they cannot currently sign Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski due to financial regulations.

The 33-year-old Pole confirmed earlier this week that his time with the German champions was 'over' after an eight-year spell.

Barcelona manager Xavi has previously said the club have entered negotiations to sign Lewandowski but that it is a difficult deal to complete.
