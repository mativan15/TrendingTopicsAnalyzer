James Mylne 's hyper-realistic portraits are already incredibly impressive but when you learn that they are drawn in ballpoint pen, they become mind-boggling.

The London-based artist's preferred tool is a standard Bic biro, which leaves no room for any mistakes, slips, smudges or retouches.

"It's a permanent mark every time," says James, "I do get a bit of a rush out of using an instrument that you can't really make any errors with."

James' love of the ballpoint pen goes back to school when he was drawn to it because of its ability to create realistic images but with a boldness that you can't get from pencil.
