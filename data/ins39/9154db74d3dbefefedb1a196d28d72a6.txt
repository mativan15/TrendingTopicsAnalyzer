The Phoenix women's team have the honour of being one of the first teams to use a world-class training facility in Upper Hutt. The $108m NZ Campus of Innovation and Sport (NZCIS) is one of the most advanced training and research facilities in the world. It is expected be fully finished by Christmas but is already providing a training base for Wellington Phoenix and Wellington Rugby​. For the Phoenix women, the contrast with how the team trained last year could not be more stark. Covid forced the players to stay in Australia, where they were based in Wollongong.
