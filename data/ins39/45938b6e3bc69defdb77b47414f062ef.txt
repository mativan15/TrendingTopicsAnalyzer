Comparisons with 28 September 1976 have abounded over the last week. Denis Healy, then Chancellor, was sitting in the VIP lounge at Heathrow, gin and tonic in hand, waiting to fly to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington when he learnt that there was a calamitous run on the pound under way. 
Within the hour, he had returned to the Treasury to announce that the UK would be applying to that very same organisation for a $4bn emergency loan.
At least Kwasi Kwarteng had actually made it as far as Washington before being forced to return home early to face what in some regards was a similar crisis.
