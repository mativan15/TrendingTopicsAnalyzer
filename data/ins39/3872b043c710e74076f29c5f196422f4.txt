Ralph DeNunzio, who reached Wall Street pinnacles of power with chairmanships of the New York Stock Exchange and the venerable securities firm Kidder, Peabody & Company, where he spent 34 years until stepping down after it was caught up in an insider-trading scandal, died on Monday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 90.

The cause was heart failure, his son Peter said.

Setting aside aspirations for a sports broadcasting career, Mr. DeNunzio went straight from Princeton to Kidder, starting as a trainee in 1953 and rising to chief executive and chairman.
