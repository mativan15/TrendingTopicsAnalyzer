The injury bug that plagued the Nets virtually all of last season has followed them into yet another new year with championship aspirations.

After missing Nets' final three preseason games, starting shooter Joe Harris will miss Wednesday's season opener against the New Orleans Pelicans with what the team is calling soreness on the left foot that underwent two surgical procedures last season.

Sharpshooter Seth Curry, who did not play in any preseason games, will also miss the opener working to get his left ankle in a better place after offseason arthroscopic surgery.
