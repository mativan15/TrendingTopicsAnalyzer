May 31 (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) has urged shareholders of Spirit Airlines (SAVE.N) to vote against a proposed merger with Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC.O).

JetBlue Airways Inc's (JBLU.O) competing offer of $30 a share is superior from a financial standpoint, ISS said in a report on Tuesday, with a cash consideration at a meaningfully higher premium than the mostly stock deal from Frontier.
