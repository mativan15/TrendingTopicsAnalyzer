Some Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) shareholders are probably rather concerned to see the share price fall 38% over the last three months. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 62%, less than the market return of 82%.

Since the stock has added US$6.2m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.
