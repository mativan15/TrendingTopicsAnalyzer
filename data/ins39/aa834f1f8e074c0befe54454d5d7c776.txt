Lobro78 Introduction In my previous article, I pointed out that the new iPhone 14 sales would likely disappoint before the release of the new iPhone back in August. The reasoning behind this argument came from the likely pressure Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will experience from the currency risks and the weak demand from a potential increase in iPhone 14 prices. Today, even after Apple restrained from raising iPhone prices in key markets including the U.S. and China, I believe Apple's iPhone sales will disappoint throughout 2022 and into 2023 due to worsening currency risks, which leads to a conclusion that Apple's valuation is too expensive today.
