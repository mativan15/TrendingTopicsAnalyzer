(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. appointed an executive committee to oversee its second Vision Fund, Latin America funds and future vehicles, its chairman Masayoshi Son said in a staff memo seen by Bloomberg News. Alex Clavel will oversee investing teams in the US and Latin America while Greg Moon will run the teams in Europe and Asia, and Navneet Govil will lead 'functional' or non-investment teams such as finance and compliance, Son said. A SoftBank spokesman confirmed the memo's contents and declined to comment further.
