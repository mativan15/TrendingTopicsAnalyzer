Denver's defense expected to make an impact tonight

It's Monday night, and we have an AFC West showdown on tap as the Denver Broncos take on the Los Angeles Chargers. The Broncos come into this matchup having lost their past two games, but they have an opportunity to bounce back against a weak Chargers defense.

Conversely, the Chargers have won each of their past two games, with Justin Herbert playing through a rib injury. However, he and the rest of the offense have a tall task in front of them going up against this Denver defense.
