For the first time in their brief, not-even-two-year history, the Kansas City Current will take the field for a playoff match on Sunday in Houston.

It's a win or go home scenario, a format the team encountered during the knockout phase of the NWSL Challenge Cup. But the playoffs are not quite the same as a preseason tournament. Elimination then simply meant the Current could focus fully on the NWSL regular season at hand.

A loss against the Dash would mean the Current's season is over and the offseason would begin.
