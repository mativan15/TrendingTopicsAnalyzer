magann/iStock via Getty Images Westlake (NYSE:WLK) was downgraded to a Hold rating from Buy by analysts at Deutsche Bank. They said rising interest rates are making homebuying more expensive and dampening demand for building products such as plastic pipes. Westlake is seeing pressure on prices for polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics amid the combination of reduced demand and increased supply from competitors in China. Strength in prices for caustic soda won't be enough to overcome weakness in other plastics, according to Deutsche Bank.
