It is possible that you may witness human astronauts landing on the moon within your lifetime, according to a recently authored research article. The researchers analysed how NASA's budget has changed over the years since the 1960s to gauge how likely it is that the space agency will deploy a mission to Asteroids beyond Mars in the next century.
The non-peer-reviewed paper titled, 'Impact of Economic Constraints on the Projected Timeframe for Human-Crewed Deep Space Exploration,' is available on ArXiv.
