Brighton 0 Nottingham Forest 0
Nottingham Forest moved off the foot of the Premier League with a hard-earned point at the Amex last night to leave new Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi still awaiting his first victory.
Seagulls forward Leandro Trossard went closest to a breakthrough, hitting the top of the crossbar from just inside Forest's 18-yard box in the 31st minute. 
The hosts had 19 attempts on goal, compared to Forest's three, but were frustrated by some determined defending from Steve Cooper's side and have failed to score for three successive games.
