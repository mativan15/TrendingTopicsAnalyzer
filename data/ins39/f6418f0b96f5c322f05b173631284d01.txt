By Indivisible Houston's Leadership TeamGreetings from Indivisible Houston!We are proud to be in the fight with all of you, and to disrupt this week's Indivisible newsletter… though not as proud as we were to disrupt Ted Cruz's evening last week when our board member Benjamin Hernandez took him on over his callous and deadly opposition to gun reform during dinner at a fancy sushi spot following the NRA Convention.If you are wondering how we did it, we are happy to share it, and will be running a livestream workshop tonight, June 2, at 6pm Central Time titled 'Challenge Them' on how to hold extremist MAGA politicians accountable on the spot.
