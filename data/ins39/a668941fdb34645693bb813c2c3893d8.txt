In 2020, Alejandra Gomez saw years of activism in Arizona make national headlines.Once a Republican stronghold, the state elected a Democrat to the presidency for the first time in decades – in large part due to a grassroots movement started by young, progressive Latinx organizers like Gomez.'It was an inflection point – a big exclamation point', said Gomez, who is the co-director of the advocacy group Lucha.But almost immediately after, she said, she saw the backlash.This year, ahead of midterm elections that could see control of Congress sway from Democrat to Republican, the movement that started as a response to Arizona's rightwing, anti-immigrant politics is facing daunting obstacles.
