Collider.com Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for Episodes 1-9 of House of the Dragon.Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine) has taken his final pained breaths, and his son Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) has ascended the Iron Throne, for better or worse. However, the ninth episode of House of the Dragon saw two of the Seven Kingdoms' most prominent figures in a contest to retrieve the young king for his coronation. As one might expect, the debaucherous Aegon was nowhere near the Red Keep when news broke of his father's passing, causing his mother and grandfather to send out their own respective agents to track him down and prepare him for the coronation.
