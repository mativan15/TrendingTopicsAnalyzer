My last trip to Fire Island was in 2019, a buggy, fraught week during which I felt woefully alienated from my housemates (by my own doing, not theirs) and altogether lonely and old and gross and tired. Such is the peril of going to a place like that—a gay retreat that promises the comforts and excitements of familiar company, but also holds the potential for dire jags of self-doubt. At the end of my time there, I got on the ferry back to Long Island and decided I'd finally had enough. I had tried to make Fire Island work for me, but I'd failed, time and time again.
