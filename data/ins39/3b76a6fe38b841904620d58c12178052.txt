Subaru cemented its name in rallying history when it won three World Rally Championships in the late 1990s, giving driver titles to such well-known rallying names as Petter Solberg, Colin McRae and Richard Burns. The Japanese carmaker however, owes a lot of that success to British motorsport and advanced engineering group Prodrive who prepared and ran the winning cars after teaming up with Subaru in 1990.
