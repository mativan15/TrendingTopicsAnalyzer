NEW DELHI: The increase in smartphone penetration, enhanced connectivity, and the availability of affordable data have enhanced India's digital adoption. Local manufacturers can now list their products on e-commerce or social commerce platforms or engage directly with the customers through D2C models. In addition, these sellers are safeguarded from cash-related risks such as theft, customers asking for credit if they don't have adequate cash and more cash being required for operational purposes. Digital payment startups such as Ezetap are accelerating this journey through their smart solutions.
