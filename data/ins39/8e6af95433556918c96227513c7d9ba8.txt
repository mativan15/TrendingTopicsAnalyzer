India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the rollout of 75 digital banking units, or DBUs, as the federal government seeks to bolster financial inclusion in the country of almost 1.4 billion people.

'People living in small towns and villages will find benefits like transferring money to availing loans,' Modi said Sunday in an online to mark the launch of this new format of banking hubs in 75 Indian districts. 'Digital Banking Units are another big step' toward making banking services more accessible to citizens, he said.
