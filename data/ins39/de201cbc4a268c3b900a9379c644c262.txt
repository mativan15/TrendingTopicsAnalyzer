Americans' monthly debt bills are smaller than they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic despite high inflation and rising costs, according to Experian.  The credit reporting company wrote in a blog post that "monthly payments overall are still lower than they were during the pandemic." Americans' average monthly debt payment in June was $1,014, $31 less than the average amount paid during the pandemic.  That decrease was due to smaller credit card debt payments, which averaged $169 in June compared to $203 in March 2020.
