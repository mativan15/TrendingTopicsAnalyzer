Propaganda is not what it used to be.These days, a crummy movie like '2000 Mules,' a big cinematic lie about the Big Lie that rampant voter fraud denied the reelection of the last U.S. president, is what passes for artful disinformation. Widely mocked, it's a lunatic 'Triumph of the Will' without the formal skills of Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl — pollution without the prettiness, Triumph of the Rubes and Grifters.Oh, for the long-gone days of ancient Persia.What propaganda used to be is on glamorous display in an exquisitely crafted silver plate that anchors the final room of 'Persia: Ancient Iran and the Classical World,' a new exhibition at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades.
