The crypto market risk aversion worsened early Thursday, with ether (ETH) and other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) taking a bigger hit than bitcoin (BTC), with one trader pointing to Friday's monthly options expiry as source of renewed volatility. 
Ether, the native token of the leading smart contract blockchain Ethereum, traded at $1,830 during the European hours, representing a 6% loss on a 24-hour basis, Forbes data shows.
