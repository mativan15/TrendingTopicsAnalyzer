One of the most unique players in Colorado State basketball's history has played his last game as a Ram.

David Roddy will forgo his senior season and keep his name in the 2022 NBA draft. Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports first reported Roddy would stay in the draft.

Assuming Roddy is selected (which is a near certainty), he'll be the first Ram chosen in the NBA draft since 2013 when center Colton Iverson was the 53rd overall pick by Boston.

Most mock drafts have Roddy as an early second-round pick, with a few saying he could sneak into the back end of the first round.
