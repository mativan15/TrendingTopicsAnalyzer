Metacritic, a website that collects and quantifies reviews of music, movies, TV shows and video games, a Taylor Swift album drop is one of the best days of the year.

'There's nothing quite like Taylor Swift,' Marc Doyle, the site's 51-year-old founder, said in an interview last week. 'We get a great deal of traffic and user participation, a lot of people sharing it on social media.' In 2020, when Swift released 'Folklore,' her eighth studio album, traffic swelled by 'roughly a half million page views,' including user review pages, he said.
