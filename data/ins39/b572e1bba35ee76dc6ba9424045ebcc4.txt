A group of Twitter shareholders filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk in a federal court on Wednesday, accusing the world's wealthiest man of deliberately driving down the company's stock as part of a scheme to renegotiate his ongoing $44 billion buyout of the social media platform—yet another sign that tension may be boiling over among Twitter's shareholders.The lawsuit comes on the heels of a shareholder meeting this week, during which Twitter's executives reportedly didn't address Musk's bid. Musk did not attend, but the Tesla CEO loomed large over the conversations, and shareholders appear to be splitting along pro-Musk and anti-Musk lines.
