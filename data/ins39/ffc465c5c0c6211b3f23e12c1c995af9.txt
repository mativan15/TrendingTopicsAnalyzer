Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of SpaceX, abruptly reversed his decision Saturday, saying his company would continue to fund the operation of the Starlink internet service in Ukraine, where it has become a digital lifeline for both soldiers and civilians.
Musk, the world's richest man, drew criticism Friday when he said on Twitter that his company could not 'indefinitely' fund Ukraine's use of Starlink. The service has been crucial for the Ukrainian army's communication as it advances into territory occupied by Russia and defends against continued Russian attacks.
