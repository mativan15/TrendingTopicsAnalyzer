Even though the civic body states that only contracts for parks not being maintained by resident welfare associations (RWAs) would be given, the decision to hand over maintenance of parks to private firms has not gone down well with the residents of Chandigarh. The residents feel that this is a decision in the direction of gradually taking over maintenance from them. Many residents have opposed the decision of the civic body stating that it is ‘ill conceived'. They also said that the reason some residents are unable to maintain parks is because of the petty amount being given by the MC.
