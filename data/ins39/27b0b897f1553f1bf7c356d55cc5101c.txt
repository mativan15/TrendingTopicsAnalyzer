It's challenging enough stepping in for veteran Cody Fajardo, which resulted in a firestorm of controversy this week among the passionate Rider Nation fan base, but the 25-year-old pivot is also dealing with the additional stress brought on by the Riders' 2-9 record in their last 11 games. The late-season futility has put the club's playoff chances in serious doubt.
