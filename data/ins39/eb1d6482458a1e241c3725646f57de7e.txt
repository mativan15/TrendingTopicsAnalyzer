KanawatTH/iStock via Getty Images Stocks had a ripsnorter of a rally last week and a lot of people are pondering the question in the title over this long weekend. The S&P 500 was down 20.9% from intraday high (4818.62, January 4th) to intraday low (3810.32, May 20th). From that intraday low the market has risen 9.1% in just six trading days. That still leaves the market 13.7% from the intraday high and most investors still down double digits on the year (-11.5% for the standard 60/40 portfolio). For Alhambra investors, the typical moderate risk account is down 4 to 5% or less than half the 60/40.
