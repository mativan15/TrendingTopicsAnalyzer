Bray Wyatt returned to WWE at Extreme Rules and debuted a haunting new theme song for his SmackDown comeback a few days later.
The man formerly under a mask as The Fiend appeared to break character and bare his soul to the fans on Friday night before a perfect horror twist, with new Code Orange track Shatter providing a perfect soundtrack as he walked down the ramp.
From the haunting piano introduction to the pounding drums and anthemic chorus, the track – which reminded some fans of bands like My Chemical Romance – seemed to be a perfect mix of hope and tension.
