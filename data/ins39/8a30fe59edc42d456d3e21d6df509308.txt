A standard homeowners insurance policy typically doesn't cover damage from flooding. Paying out of pocket to repair property or replace belongings after a storm surge or heavy rain can be costly. Just one inch of water can cause $25,000 worth of damage to the average home, according to FEMA. If you live in a high-risk area and have a government-backed mortgage, your lender will require you to purchase flood insurance. But even if it isn't required, getting coverage is still worth considering — Mother Nature is unpredictable, and being insured can give you peace of mind.
