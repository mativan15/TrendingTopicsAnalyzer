Voters have until Nov. 8 to decide who will fill the 30 open seats in the Arizona Senate, where election winners will go on to craft policies around issues ranging from voting rights to abortion over the next two years.

The Senate race in left-leaning Legislative District 22 may be the most unusual in the state. Nine hopefuls are vying for the Tolleson area's seat in that contest, but each of them is a write-in candidate so their names won't actually appear on the ballot.

Former Rep. Diego Espinoza will be the only person listed on the ballot despite his resignation in September, when he took a job for Salt River Project.
