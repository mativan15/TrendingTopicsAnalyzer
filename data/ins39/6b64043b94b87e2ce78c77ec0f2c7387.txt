TikTok has announced an adults-only live streaming mode in new updates to its platform.

The mode, TikTok suggests, would be useful for 'a comedy routine [that] is better suited for people over age 18' or 'a host may plan to talk about a difficult life experience and they would feel more comfortable knowing the conversation is limited to adults,' it wrote in its news release.

TikTok says the feature will be launched over the coming weeks, but did not give a specific timeframe.
