Slow economic growth is leading to an increase in total consumer debt across Canada, according to an economics expert. 'Particularly with respect to inflation and wages, we've seen that wage, inflation gap open up a little bit and that's one of the big reasons,' University of Regina economics professor Jason Childs said in an interview with CTV Morning Live Regina. Total consumer debt has risen more than eight percent in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022 when compared to last year, according to a recent report from Equifax Canada.
