June 3, 2022 12:49PM ET The Linda Lindas link up with Bikini Kill's Erica Dawn Lyle, Kathi Wilcox, and musician/filmmaker Vice Cooler, in the video for their new collaboration, 'Lost In Thought.' The song appears on Lyle and Cooler's new benefit album, Land Trust: Benefit for North East Farmers of Color, out today, June 3, via Bandcamp. 
'Lost In Thought' is a breathless punk blast that clocks in under 90 seconds and features the Linda Lindas leading a riotous call-and-response vocal performance: 'I'm not here/Just a big mess/Noting is clear/No more, no less/Lost in thought/Lost in thought!' The video for the song features the Linda Lindas yelling, dancing, and moshing around a backyard while Lyle plays guitar, Wilcox plays bass, and Cooler plays drums.
