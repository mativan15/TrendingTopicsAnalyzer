A man accused of transferring $3 million from a woman's account in a brazen home invasion in San Francisco is back in California after his capture in Taiwan, police said.

Tianze Zhang, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles, was booked Friday on suspicion of first-degree burglary, kidnapping for ransom, and making criminal threats, according to San Francisco County Jail records.

It wasn't clear if he has legal representation in the case. The San Francisco Public Defender's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
