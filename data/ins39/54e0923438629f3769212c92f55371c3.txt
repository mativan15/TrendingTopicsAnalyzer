Published: 00:41 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 00:41 EDT, 21 October 2022 Forcing animals to swim in tubes of water and inhale smoke is harmful and should be phased out of medical research in NSW, a state parliamentary inquiry has recommended. Two types of research, which involve forcing mice to inhale cigarette smoke and struggle in beakers of lukewarm water, were of particular concern to the upper house committee. While intentionally killing or hurting animals was abhorrent and completely unacceptable, medical research producing extraordinary health benefits would require the ongoing use of animal testing, the committee chair wrote in the report released on Friday.
