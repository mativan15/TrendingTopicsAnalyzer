In order to prevent misuse, the central government has asked citizens to share only masked versions of their Aadhaar cards with organisations. In a press release on Sunday, the government said, "Do not share photocopy of your Aadhaar with any organisation as it can be misused. Alternatively, please use a masked Aadhaar which displays only the last four digits of your Aadhaar number." The masked version can be downloaded from UIDAI official website by selecting the option 'Do you want a masked Aadhaar' to download.
