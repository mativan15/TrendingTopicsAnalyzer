STAFF REPORTFROM THE CRITTENDEN PRESS FULL EDITIONMarion Baptist Church is mobilizing forces this weekend to refurbish Veterans Park on North Weldon Street in Marion.The project is part of its Faith in Action initiative, said pastor Aaron Brown.'We want our beliefs to be seen in action not just heard in our words,' He added. 'The world is tired of hearing people say they love their community, but never show it. We want to show it in action.'The church had been developing a plan for a block party in that area of town for several weeks and after an on-site inspection at the park, the Baptists realized it needed some attention.
