On Tuesday, the Carolina Panthers made the latest addition to their active roster official—announcing the signing of linebacker Chandler Wooten from the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad. And speaking of practice squads, they'd issue a few changes on their own as well.

Carolina has added three players to the group, including a familiar name in running back Spencer Brown. Brown returns after being released from injured reserve early last month.

The six-foot, 220-pound rusher first joined the Panthers back in May of 2021, when he signed on as an undrafted free agent from the University of Alabama Birmingham.
