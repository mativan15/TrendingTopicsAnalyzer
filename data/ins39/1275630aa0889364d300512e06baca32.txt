Simran Kaur is co-founder of Girls that Invest, which offers commentary on personal investment aimed at young people. Question: I was previously dating a girl, and while we were dating she went through some financial hardship. She conveyed to me that she couldn't get any support from her family and that she would likely have to start doing illegal things to support herself. So I started lending her money to pay for her bills. In total, I lent her about $5000. We have since broken up but she has managed to get a good job and can easily support herself now.
