KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — One of the graves had broken open in Kabul's Nader Shah Hill Cemetery, exposing a near-complete skeleton at the bottom of the pit in the hard earth. The boys, who had been playing nearby, were not impressed.'There's a lot of ruined graves, it's not unusual,' one boy, around 10, said with a shrug as they looked down at the bones. The only reason the kids came over, interrupting their soccer game, was to see what an Associated Press photographer was taking pictures of.When asked if they were scared by it, the boy and his friends cracked up laughing.
