Investing.com -- U.K. government bond prices opened sharply higher on Monday in anticipation of a comprehensive about-face by the British government on its ill-fated plans to slash taxes.

Yields on some U.K. Gilts, which move inversely to prices, fell by over 20 basis points on expectations that the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, will effectively abandon almost all of the measures announced only a couple of weeks ago by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng.

The pound, meanwhile, pared overnight gains to trade 0.
