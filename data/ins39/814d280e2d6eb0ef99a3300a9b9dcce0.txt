The Powerball drawing on Wednesday night was estimated to be worth $168.5 million with a cash value of $100.1 million. There were no grand prize winners from the drawing, which means the jackpot will continue to grow. The winning lottery numbers drawn on Wednesday were 11, 41, 56, 57, 63 with a red Powerball of 2. The Power Play was 2X. Since the jackpot went unclaimed, the next Powerball drawing will take place on Saturday. The jackpot will reach an estimated $184 million, with a $109.3 million cash option.
