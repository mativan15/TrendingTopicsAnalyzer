Dave Herman, who helped protect Joe Namath in the Jets' historic Super Bowl III win, died Wednesday at 81.
For most of his 10-season career, Herman played at right guard but head coach Weeb Ewbank shifted the offensive line around in the 1968 postseason, including moving Herman to right tackle. 
Following the Jets 27-23 win over the Raiders in the AFL title game, Herman was tasked with Bubba Smith, the Colts star defensive end. The Jets, 18-point underdogs, defeated the Colts 16-7.
