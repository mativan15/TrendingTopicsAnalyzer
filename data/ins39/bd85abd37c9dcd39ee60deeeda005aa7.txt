 Recovering from its record low, the rupee rose by 14 paise to 77.57 against the U.S. dollar in early morning trade on Wednesday. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.58 against the American dollar, then inched higher to quote at 77.57, registering a rise of 14 paise from the last close. On Tuesday, the rupee declined by 17 paise to close at its all-time low of 77.71 against the U.S. currency as surging U.S. bond yields dampened the appeal of riskier assets.
