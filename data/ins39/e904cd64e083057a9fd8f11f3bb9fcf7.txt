The rising Hindu nationalist movement that has spread from India through the diaspora has arrived inside Google, according to employees.In April, Thenmozhi Soundararajan, the founder and executive director of Equality Labs — a nonprofit that advocates for Dalits, or members of the lowest-ranked caste — was scheduled to give a talk to Google News employees for Dalit History Month. But Google employees began spreading disinformation, calling her 'Hindu-phobic' and 'anti-Hindu' in emails to the company's leaders, documents posted on Google's intranet and mailing lists with thousands of employees, according to copies of the documents as well as interviews with Soundararajan and current Google employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about retaliation.
