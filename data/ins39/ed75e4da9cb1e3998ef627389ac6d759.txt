B.C.'s ombudsperson says the provincial government failed to pass along federal disability benefits to a family caring for a young Indigenous girl living with mental and physical challenges. The child, identified as Jesse, was two years old when she ended up in her grandparents' care in 2013. As Jesse faced more difficulties, the grandparents, who are on a fixed income, were encouraged to apply for federal benefits. In a report, the independent ombudsperson's office found the grandparents qualified for a federal Child Disability Benefit in 2019, which at the time amounted to $242 a month – but that the money went to Ministry of Children and Family Development.
