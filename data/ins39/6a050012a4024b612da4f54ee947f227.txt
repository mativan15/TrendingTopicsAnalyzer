APLike several other luxury sports car manufacturers, Aston Martin showed up at the Spanish Grand Prix flaunting its highly upgraded challenger. But the talk of the event was AMR22, which ran into a controversial similarity with Red Bull's RB18, which was also pointed out by FIA. Aston Martin denied the offence by stating that the upgrades for AMR22 were conceptualized far ahead of the RB18 launch and were also given a clearance from the FIA. Red Bull however went ahead to set up an internal investigation on the grounds that there may have been an illegal transfer of IP for ‘green Red Bull' or AMR22 as a result of a number of its employees leaving to join Aston Martin in the year 2022.
