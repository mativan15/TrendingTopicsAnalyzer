IT operating models are in transition with organizations experiencing high levels of uncertainty and the need to adapt to rapid change, according to Forrester. For organizations to be successful going forward, they must transform at the pace of the business and set a dynamic vision for the operating model, the newly-released report, 'The State of IT Operating Models 2022' finds. Forrester makes a correlation between tech maturity with maturity in customer obsession.
'Maturity in customer obsession defines what IT must do to enable business success at each maturity level,'' the report said.
