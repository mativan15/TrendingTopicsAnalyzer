Former BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker has admitted he ‘hates talking about money' after it was previously revealed he was in the top 20 highest-paid presenters at the broadcaster before his exit. 
Dan quit his role on the show last month after six years and will start his new position at Channel 5 on Monday.
It came just months after former co-host Louise Minchin stepped down after 20 years in late 2021. 
The 45-year-old will act as an anchor on 5 News, but will also front programmes such as documentaries for the corporation, in a deal said to be worth £1.
