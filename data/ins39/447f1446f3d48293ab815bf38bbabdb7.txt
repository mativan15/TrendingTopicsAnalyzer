Bill Pugliano/Getty Images News Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) shares rose in premarket trading on Thursday as Nomura turned bullish on the stock. The firm's analysts said that better-than-expected pricing in Europe and North America as well as insulated margins given a slower EV rollout are key positive factors for the next twelve months. Further, easing raw material costs overall are expected to serve as a tailwind into 2023. 'Stellantis' limited exposure to China also lowers longer-term geopolitical risks, in our view,' the analysts advised on Thursday.
