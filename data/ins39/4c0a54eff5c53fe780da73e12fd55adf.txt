The Golden State Warriors dropped their first Game 1 of the 2022 postseason after the single worst 4th quarter collapse in NBA Finals history. Up 92-80 heading into the final frame, the Warriors were outscored 40-16 in the 4th quarter and lost Game 1 by double digits to the Boston Celtics.The first three quarters looked great for the Dubs. Steph was cooking, the defense was shutting Jayson Tatum down, and they were controlling the game. Then it all fell apart due largely to a barrage of 3-pointers from Celtics Derrick White and Al Horford in the final quarter.
