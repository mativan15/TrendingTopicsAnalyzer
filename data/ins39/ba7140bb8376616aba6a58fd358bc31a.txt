CNN —

The high cost of hearing aids has long been a barrier for many people who have hearing problems. Traditional prescription hearing aids cost on average $2,000 per ear, and many people need two of them.

But the US Food and Drug Administration's rule change in August means that people with mild to moderate hearing loss will be able to buy these devices online or in stores without a prescription – and for a lower price – starting October 17.

That means people won't have to visit a hearing health professional and have a custom fitting, a process that can also be cost-prohibitive.
