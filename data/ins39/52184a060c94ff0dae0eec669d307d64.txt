New-look Western Sydney are enjoying their best start to an A-League Men season in three years after Tomislav Mrcela's wonderful goal delivered a 1-0 upset win over Melbourne Victory.

In Saturday's other game, the Newcastle Jets beat Perth Glory 2-1.

At AAMI Park, after Nani hit the post for Victory in the 11th minute, Mrcela's strike on the counter 30 minutes later proved the winner in front of 18,017 fans.

It is the first time Western Sydney have won their opening two games since 2019-20, and their first back-to-back wins since May 2021.
