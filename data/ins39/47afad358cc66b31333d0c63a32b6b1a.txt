Peace talks brokered by the AU that were scheduled to begin in SA on October 8 have been delayed indefinitely. One likely reason is that Eritrea is pushing for an outright victory in the conflict, according to Harry Verhoeven, a professor and Eritrea expert at Columbia University, and three diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity, because they aren't authorised to speak to the media. Yemane Ghebremeskel, Eritrea's information minister, and Billene Seyoum, Abiy's spokesperson, didn't respond to emailed questions on Eritrea's role in Tigray or answer calls seeking comment.
