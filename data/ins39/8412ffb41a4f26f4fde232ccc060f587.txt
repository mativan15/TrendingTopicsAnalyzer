Minnesota will receive nearly $100 million in federal money in the next three years to help small businesses, especially those getting started.

Gov. Tim Walz and state Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) Commissioner Steve Grove announced the new money on Friday at Flava Café, opened less than three months ago in St. Paul's Frogtown neighborhood by Shaunie Grigsby.

"It should not be difficult to get government help when you're a small business and today it kind of is," Grove said.
