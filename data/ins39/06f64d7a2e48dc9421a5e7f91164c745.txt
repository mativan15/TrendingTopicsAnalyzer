A motorist who deliberately drove into a biker at nearly 70mph has been convicted of murder after fleeing to Ireland to try and escape punishment.

BMW driver Keith McCarthy slammed into the moped of father-of-three Kerrin Repman on April 15, 2020, in Dovercourt - killing the 29-year-old biker and also seriously injuring a bystander.

McCarthy, 40, of no fixed abode, fled the scene on foot and left the country - being tracked down in Ireland.
