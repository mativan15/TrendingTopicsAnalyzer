The controversy regarding total number of votes obtained by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the confidence motion it had tabled in Vidhan Sabha ended Monday with Speaker Kultar Singh Sandhwan amending the record stating the ruling party had got 91 votes.
Earlier, the Speaker had announced that the AAP had got 93 votes, including that of the two SAD legislators, Manpreet Singh Ayali and Nachhatar Pal. Later, the two legislators had protested stating that they had not voted for AAP. They had also written letters to the Speaker protesting against counting of their vote in favour of AAP.
