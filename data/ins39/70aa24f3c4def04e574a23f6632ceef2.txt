Plaza Premium Group already operates two lounges at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport but CEO Song Hoi-see says his company is just getting started as it looks to continue growing its presence in the U.S.

Hoi-see visited DFW during a recent trip to the U.S. and got to see the Plaza Premium Lounge in Terminal E for the first time in person. Hong Kong-based PPG opened the 1,400-square-foot lounge, its first location in the U.S., in 2020 when travel was still heavily restricted due to the pandemic.
