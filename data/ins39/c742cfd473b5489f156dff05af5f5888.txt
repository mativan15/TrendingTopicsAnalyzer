Schumer says Chinese companies with connections to the Chinese Communist Party have been selling their chips to companies that work very closely with the federal government. Schumer believes that could put national security at risk as well as the data of New Yorkers. He is now working to add a provision to the National Defense Authorization Act that'd increase demand for microchips that are made in places like Upstate New York.
