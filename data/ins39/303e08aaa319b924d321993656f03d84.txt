aluxum/E+ via Getty Images The shares of Syneos Health (NASDAQ:SYNH) traded lower in the pre-market Tuesday JPMorgan downgraded the Contract Research Organization to Neutral from Overweight, citing uncertainty over the company's revenue outlook. The analysts led by Casey Woodring attributed the decision to SYNH's recent update on the Book-to-Bill ratio, noting that it has prompted the team to be more cautious about SYNH's growth outlook compared to those of peers. The analysts are particularly concerned about the near-term softness in the company's large pharma pipeline, arguing that it's an issue specific to SYNH given its lower exposure to large pharma partners.
