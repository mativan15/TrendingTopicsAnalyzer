Mets pitcher Drew Smith is doing his part to keep Edwin Diaz in the Mets bullpen. 
On Thursday, Smith took to Instagram to try to sway Diaz — who's about to become a free agent — to re-sign with the Mets. 
'I'll give you an extra 100 dollars if you sign back with us,' Smith wrote in the comments of a post by Diaz thanking fans after the Mets were eliminated from the postseason.
Other fans in the comments also joined the recruiting campaign, offering to 'chip in' for Diaz to remain with the Mets. 
In a separate comment, Smith wrote, '@sugardiaz39 look at all the extra money we've collected for you on top of the pile Steve [Cohen] will offer.
