As we head into Sunday, we will watch the potential for another batch of precipitation to move across the state - especially during the afternoon and evening hours. A few rumbles of thunder can't be ruled out. In fact, as you can see by the hour-by-hour forecast above, we should be dry but partly sunny for the first half of the day before those rain chances move in during the afternoon in the Twin Cities. Morning temperatures will start off in the 50s, climbing to the upper 60s to low 70s for highs.
