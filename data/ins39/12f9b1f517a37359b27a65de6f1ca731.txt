British retailers and hospitality groups are warning of staffing shortages in the run-up to Christmas as they seek tens of thousands of temporary workers in preparation for the 'golden quarter'.
Companies across retail, hospitality and manufacturing have warned they may struggle to meet demand even as the government considers relaxing immigration rules to allow more workers from overseas for key industries. 
More than 250,000 seasonal workers are needed in the hospitality industry alone, according to estimates by trade body UKHospitality.
