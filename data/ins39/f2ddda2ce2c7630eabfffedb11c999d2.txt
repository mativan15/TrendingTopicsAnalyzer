New York, June 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Krause House is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by a community of basketball lovers and purists. Together they will establish a model for bringing the first fan-governed team to the league. The collective of ambitious contributors whose goal is to own an NBA team describes the underlying mission of DAOs in its purest form: difficulty by one but achievable by many. In recent developments, the exclusive organization has purchased all 25 Fire NFTs for ownership in the BIG3 Ball Hogs team.
