Succession Season 4 is one of the most highly-anticipated shows and fans finally have a sneak peek. The show released its first promo on Monday, along with other shows coming on HBO in 2023. For the uninitiated, Succession is a drama series about media tycoon Logan Roy, his multi-billion-dollar empire, and his dysfunctional family.
 
Succession Season 4 is set to premiere next year, which will see the Roy family trying to win control over Waystar Royco.

 The last season saw Logan Roy's children - Shiv, Kendall, Roman, and Connor - putting aside their differences and aligning against their father.
