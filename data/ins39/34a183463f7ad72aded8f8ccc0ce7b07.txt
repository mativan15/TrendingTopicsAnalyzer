The Zacks Consumer Staples sector has held up relatively well in 2022 vs. the general market, down roughly 13%.

Companies in the sector can generate revenue in the face of good and bad economic situations, helping explain why it's been a bright spot in an otherwise dim market in 2022.

A titan in the sector, Procter & Gamble PG, is on deck to unveil quarterly results on October 19th before the market open.

Procter & Gamble (often referred to as P&G) is a branded consumer products company that markets its products primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores, and pharmacies.
