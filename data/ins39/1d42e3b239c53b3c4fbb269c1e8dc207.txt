Jun. 5—There is a $78 million difference between how much Aiken County would receive in the plans of the South Carolina Senate and South Carolina House of Representatives for allocating the state's plutonium settlement money.

Both chambers of the South Carolina General Assembly incorporated plans to spend the remaining $525 million of the money the federal government agreed to pay after failing to build the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site or remove the plutonium stored at the site that was to be used in the facility.
