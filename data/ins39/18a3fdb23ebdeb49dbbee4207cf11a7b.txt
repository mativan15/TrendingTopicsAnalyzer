Amid the reports of anomalies in paddy procurement, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has directed the Haryana government to conduct the physical verification of the paddy stock at rice mills.As per the FCI, the decision was taken following the recent newspaper reports that bogus procurement was going on in some of the mandis and also fudging the figures of non-basmati produce and trying to increase the same in place of the basmati variety.'It was decided to make physical verification of paddy mandatory by state and FCI officials in order to curtail any bogus procurement operations under the central pool,' reads the statement.
