WASHINGTON – In the shadow of another mass shooting in America, the House Judiciary Committee met Thursday to debate the some of the most sweeping gun-control measures considered by Congress in decades.

House Democrats are pushing the new legislation, dubbed the "Protecting Our Kids Act", after 19 children and two adults were killed last week in a Uvalde, Texas, elementary school. That mass shooting came a week after 10 Black people were killed in a racist mass shooting in a Buffalo grocery store.
