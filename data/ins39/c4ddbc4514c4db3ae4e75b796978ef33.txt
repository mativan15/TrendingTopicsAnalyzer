After missing the postseason, the New York Knicks are widely expected to improve their backcourt either through free agency or the trade market.
New York's point guard depth is murky at best, and most of their rostered players (Derrick Rose, Kemba Walker, Alec Bucks) do not project as long-term bets.
The Knicks could make sense as a home for Donovan Mitchell if Utah decides to blow it up. Notable free agent guards, specifically Jalen Brunson and Tyus Jones, are often linked to New York as fits this offseason as well.
