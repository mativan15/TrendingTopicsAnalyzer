West Milford, N.J.: To Voicer Warren D. Gross: While I agree with much of what you said in your letter, I was with you up until the last paragraph where you wrote, 'Speaking for myself, I believe in the teachings and values of Jesus Christ. Where would He stand on who, what and where we are today? Recreating governments with His values, standards and beliefs should be the major criteria for holding office.' So you believe that in the land of the free, only Christians who believe in Jesus Christ and his values, standards and beliefs can hold office?Are you aware that five Christian Supreme Court justices, including the newest, Amy Coney Barrett, ruled that states have the right to enact their own laws to restrict access to the vote? Those same justices are about to rule that states do not have the right to restrict access to weapons of war to people who should not have them.
