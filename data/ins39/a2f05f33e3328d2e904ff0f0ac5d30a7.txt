Lululemon is a multibillion-dollar leader in the high-end active wear category that owns and operates 600 stores, 40 of which are located in Europe. Its roots date back to 1998 when it opened as "Lululemon Athletica," a yoga-wear brand geared toward women and yoga enthusiasts.

With in-store services, a heavy emphasis on community symbolized by its well-loved, reusable shopping bags, the brand offers an upscale shopping and product experience.

Demand for athletic wear has grown exponentially since those early days, and in 2022 Lululemon continues to lead the way, with its second-quarter revenue soaring 29% year over year.
