LoadingBiden's plan aims to add enough oil supply to the market to prevent price spikes that could hurt consumers and businesses, while also assuring the nation's drillers the government will swoop into the market as a buyer if prices plunge too low.The president, facing criticism from Republicans who charge he is tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for political reasons and not because there is an emergency, also said he would refill the nation's stockpiles in the upcoming years.Biden already announced the record release of 180 million barrels from the SPR earlier this year to combat a potential supply crisis brought about by sanctions on oil-rich Russia following its February invasion of Ukraine.
