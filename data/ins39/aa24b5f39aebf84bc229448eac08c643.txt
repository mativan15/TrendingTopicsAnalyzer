Texas is suing tech giant Google for allegedly collecting biometric data of millions of Texans without obtaining proper consent, the attorney general's office said in a statement on Thursday.In its complaint, Texas says that companies operating in the state have been barred for more than a decade from collecting people's faces, voices or other biometric data without advanced, informed consent.'In blatant defiance of that law, Google has, since at least 2015, collected biometric data from innumerable Texans and used their faces and their voices to serve Google*s commercial ends,' the complaint says.
