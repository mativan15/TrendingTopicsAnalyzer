"Going to the Match" painting by LS Lowry has been sold for £7.8 million. It shows a crowd gathered at Burnden Park Football Stadium. The Players Foundation's sale of the artwork sparked debate, with Salford mayor Paul Dennett stating that the new owner must maintain the accessibility of the auction.
 The Lowry Museum and gallery chief executive, Julia Fawcett, expressed the joy of her organisation at the purchase in a statement following the sale. She said about her excitement to have purchased the picture for the city's collection from LS Lowry paintings that evening due to an exceptionally generous contribution from The Law Family Charitable Foundation.
