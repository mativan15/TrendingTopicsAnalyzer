A UIDAI advisory warning citizens of the misuse of Aadhaar card photocopies and e-copies by unlicensed entities went viral across the country. A stung GoI withdrew the note and asked cardholders to exercise 'normal prudence' while sharing Aadhaar numbers. However, specific concerns raised by the UIDAI advisory weren't addressed. Officials seemed more worried about the 'possibility for misinterpretation' and stressed that the Aadhaar ecosystem had adequate safety features. Many private agencies demand and collect Aadhaar card photocopies even when they are not licensed to do online authentication.
