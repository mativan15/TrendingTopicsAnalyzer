LOS ANGELES (CNS) - The Los Angeles Dodgers will begin their offseason Sunday, far earlier than expected. After winning a franchise-record 111 games in the regular season, the Dodgers were eliminated from the postseason Saturday night with a 5-3 loss to the San Diego Padres at Petco Park to lose a National League Division Series three games to one in one of the greatest postseason upsets in baseball history. The Padres won 89 games in the regular season, 22 fewer than the Dodgers. The only greater difference in victories for a postseason series winner was the 1906 Chicago White Sox, who defeated the Chicago Cubs in the World Series after winning 23 fewer games in the regular season.
