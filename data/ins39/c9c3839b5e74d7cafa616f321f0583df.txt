Premier Li Keqiang led an unprecedented crisis meeting this week as he called in more than 100,000 Chinese Communist Party officials. However, Chinese President Xi Jinping was absent from the meeting, raising speculation of a power struggle within the CCP. Mr Li appeared to distance himself from President Xi, as he urged officials to prioritise economic growth and protecting businesses, instead of zero-Covid.Earlier this month, President Xi urged all officials to abide by China's extreme zero-Covid lockdown measures.
