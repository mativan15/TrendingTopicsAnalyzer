(Bloomberg) -- Even as more companies accept remote-work arrangements, the norm of being available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shows little sign of fading.That's even though 94% of desk workers want flexibility in when they work, according to a new survey by Slack Technologies Inc.'s Future Forum, compared with 80% who say they want location flexibility. Slack polled more than 10,000 desk workers in the US, Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the UK.Asynchronous arrangements — meaning that employees get work done on their own schedules and aren't required to be online at the same time as their coworkers — remain rare outside some startups and tech companies.
