As much as 8 billion rubles (about ₹1,000 crore) of dividend income belonging to Indian oil firms is stuck in Russia after the Putin administration clamped down on dollar repatriation, officials said on Friday. Indian state oil firms have invested $5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9% stake in Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9% in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.
