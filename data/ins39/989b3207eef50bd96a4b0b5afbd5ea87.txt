C N Ashwath Narayan, minister for IT, electronics and skills development of Karnataka, has said that paid freelancing beyond office work hours is literally cheating and professionals wanting to do that should shift out of the state.

"As a policy and ethically, how can moonlighting be allowed? It is not fair in any way to have moonlighting. That's not the way forward. It is literally cheating," said the minister during an interaction with TOI.
