Cash savers will see their wealth destroyed by soaring inflation, which has jumped back to a 40-year high.
Inflation rose to 10.1pc in September, above the consensus expectation of 10pc. Even though interest rates are rising, savings rates still lag far behind.
A saver depositing £20,000 in the best buy easy-access account – which pays 2.55pc at Skipton Building Society – would earn £510 interest in a year. But this would not come close to offsetting erosion from inflation.
In real terms, the £20,000 pot would see a net loss of £1,371 – taking its inflation-adjusted value down to £18,629 after 12 months.
