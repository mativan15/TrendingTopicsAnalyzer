The first U.S. quarter featuring an Asian American will go into circulation on Oct. 24, the U.S. Mint announced. The quarter will depict Anna May Wong, considered the first Chinese American film star in Hollywood.

The obverse, or 'heads,' side of the coin will feature a portrait of George Washington designed and sculpted by Laura Gardin Fraser in 1932. The reverse, or 'tails,' side will be a close-up image of Wong resting her head on her hand, framed by the lights of a marquee sign, the U.S. Mint said.
