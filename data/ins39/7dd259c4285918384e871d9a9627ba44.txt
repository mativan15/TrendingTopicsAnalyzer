The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a Texas law permitting people to sue social media companies for suppressing their posts — with a surprise coalition of justices creating a narrow majority in favor of Big Tech.
The high court voted 5-4 to grant an emergency request from two industry groups that claim the Republican-backed measure would open the floodgates to hate speech and misinformation, turning online public platforms into 'havens of the vilest expression imaginable.'
The ruling put the law on hold while it's litigated in lower-level courts and came just one week after a federal appeals court largely threw out a similar law enacted in Florida last year.
