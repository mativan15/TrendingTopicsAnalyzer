One in five UK gamers (19%) and one in three US gamers (29%) admit to having destroyed their accessories in the past. To highlight these issues, Opera has released a video showcasing the Anger Controller, an imaginary set of super durable gaming peripherals that can withstand even the most extreme rage.

"Anger Controllers are our tongue-in-cheek way of highlighting the very real issue of rage and anger management amongst gamers, which impacts many individuals including those they play with," said Maciej Kocemba, Head of Opera GX.
