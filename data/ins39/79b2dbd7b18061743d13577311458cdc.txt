Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration this week pushed back against a lawsuit seeking the immediate release of all records related to the flights of migrants from Texas to Massachusetts but agreed to provide them no later than Dec. 1.

Lawyers for the Republican governor filed a nine-page response late Tuesday to a demand from the open government group Florida Center for Government Accountability for records, including phone and text logs from DeSantis' chief of staff, James Uthmeier, as well as any communication between Florida and Texas officials.
