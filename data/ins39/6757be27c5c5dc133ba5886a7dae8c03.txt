May 27—It was a special day Thursday as friends, community members and colleagues gathered to congratulate the end of an era for Unit 40 Superintendent Mark Doan.

The Effingham Community High School Hearts Rock Cafe was filled with those wanting to wish Doan a happy retirement during a special open house. Doan's last day is June 30.

"I think he did an outstanding job," said Jim Littleford, who is retired after serving as superintendent in Charleston and Altamont. "He will be missed."

"He was always one of the go-to guys I could call and bounce things off of," Dieterich Unit 30 Superintendent Cary Jackson said.
