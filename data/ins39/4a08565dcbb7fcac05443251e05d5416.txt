Things have not been easy for Nicky (played by Kimberly Hart-Simpson) since she returned to Coronation Street and it looks as though the former sex worker's life is about to take a turn for the worse. Daisy (Charlotte Jordan) has not approved of Nicky and her daughter Maise (Lucia Aliu) living with former love interest Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) while she tries to find a job. Will Daisy find a way to make Nicky lose custody of Maisie in a twisted revenge plot?Nicky was last seen on Coronation Street in 2020 when Daniel paid off her debts so she could make her exit.
