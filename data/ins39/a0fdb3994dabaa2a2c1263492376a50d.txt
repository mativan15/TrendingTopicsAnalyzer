One of the most viral moments from the 75th Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped over the weekend with the presentation of the Palme d'Or to Ruben Ostlund's 'Triangle of Sadness,' wasn't a slip on the red carpet or those fighter jets that flew over Tom Cruise's head. It was the director James Gray making a thoughtful argument for how mainstream moviemaking can be more than superheroes. Gray, who premiered his autobiographical '80s coming-of-age film 'Armageddon Time' at Cannes, drew widespread applause for comments suggesting that Hollywood studios should be willing to lose money on less franchise-based modes of moviemaking to help expand, not narrow, the moviegoing audience.
