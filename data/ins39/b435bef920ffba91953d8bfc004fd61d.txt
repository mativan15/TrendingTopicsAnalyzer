The cocreator of dogecoin has made some harsh comments about Elon Musk, calling the Tesla and SpaceX CEO a "grifter" who wasn't capable of running basic code.  Palmer is best known for being one of the people behind dogecoin, a cryptocurrency coin based on a meme that launched in 2013. Partly thanks to Musk, dogecoin is now one of the world's most valuable crypto coins.  However, Palmer criticized Musk in his interview with Crikey and shared some details of his "interesting past" with the billionaire.
