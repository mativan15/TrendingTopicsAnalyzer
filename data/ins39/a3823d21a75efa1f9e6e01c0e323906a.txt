May 29—Walden Mutual has become the first bank of its kind to be chartered in New Hampshire in a century, but is still working to raise its goal of $25 million in capital.

The bank has already started making loans using seed money and through partnerships with other banks, said CEO Charley Cummings. The bank received its conditional charter from the New Hampshire Banking Department earlier this month as it continues to raise capital and seek final FDIC approval. It is also the first new mutual bank in the country since 1973.
