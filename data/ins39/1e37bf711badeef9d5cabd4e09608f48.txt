 The Federal Government has committed AU$2.4 billion towards upgrading an estimated 1.5 million homes and businesses with full fibre NBN, replacing the poor-performing copper wire that currently serves them.The upgrade is likely coming to regional areas and outer city suburbs across the country, and will see the inferior fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) technology replaced with fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP), giving these homes access to better internet speeds.
