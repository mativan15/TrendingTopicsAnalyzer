Like other first-party games from Sony, God of War: Ragnarok will have several graphical modes that players can choose from on PS5. Depending on your preferences, you'll be able to prioritize performance or quality with these modes, which require a few concessions.If Resolution is your top priority, you'll be able to run the game at one of two options, one of which renders the Nordic adventure at 4K resolution and a locked frame rate of 30fps (via Press Start). The other resolution mode has a slightly higher frame rate and requires an HDMI 2.
