Protests have continued in the northern Iranian city of Ardabil after a 16-year old school girl, Asra Panahi, died in hospital due to injuries she is believed to have sustained after security forces cracked down on a demonstration at her school. The Shahed girls high school was raided on 13 October after pupils refused to sing an anthem praising the Ayatollah and protested against the government outside. Many suffered injuries and were taken to hospital. Panahi reportedly died on Friday from the injuries she sustained during the crackdown.
