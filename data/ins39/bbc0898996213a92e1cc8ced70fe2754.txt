Gisele Fetterman slammed an NBC reporter as 'ableist' on Monday, a week after her stroke survivor husband, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, gave an interview to the network with the help of a closed captioning system. 
The Democrat Fetterman is in the middle of a heated campaign to be Pennsylvania's next senator with celbrity heart surgeon and former TV show host Dr. Mehmet Oz.
His interview with NBC News' Dasha Burns last week revealed the extent of auditory processing issues that have lingered since the 53-year-old's stroke in May.
