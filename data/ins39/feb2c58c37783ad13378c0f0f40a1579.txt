OTTAWA — Nokia Canada, the federal government, Ontario government and City of Ottawa have announced plans to turn the company's Ottawa facility into a research and development technology centre as Canada looks to further its 5G wireless technology strategy.

Nokia said Monday that the project will transform its 26-acre campus at the Kanata North Business Park into a mixed-use corporate, residential and commercial hub. The project will also receive $72-million in total funding from the three levels of government.
