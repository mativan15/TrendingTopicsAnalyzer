Grants for community projects totalling €2 million and paid for by the proceeds of crime seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau (Cab) have been announced by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee.Twenty-two community projects around the State received grants of between €5,000 and €150,000 in the first round of funding awarded under the Community Safety Innovation Fund. A total of €3 million will be made available for such grants next year, with the money again coming from assets seized by the bureau.'By putting this money back into the community, we can show that there is a direct link between the activities of law enforcement and improving community safety,' the Minister said.
