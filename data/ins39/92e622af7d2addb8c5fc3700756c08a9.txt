The Canadian dollar CADUSD on Thursday strengthened for the sixth day in seven against its broadly weaker U.S. counterpart as oil prices rose and the Bank of Canada signalled it has much more work to do to bring inflation under control.Canada's central bank will probably have to raise its policy rate to the top of its neutral range, double its current level of 1.5%, and could go higher, to prevent soaring inflation from becoming entrenched, Deputy Governor Paul Beaudry said.'The chances of a Bank of Canada pause in the fall are dwindling,' said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive.
