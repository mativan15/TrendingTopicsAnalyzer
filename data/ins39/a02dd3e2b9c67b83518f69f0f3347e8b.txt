CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – Rarely will both the bulls and the bears claim that the same indicator supports their position. Yet that is the case currently with margin debt. I'm referring to the total amount that investors borrow to purchase stocks, a sum that historically has risen during bull markets and fallen during bear markets. FINRA gathers the data and releases monthly totals with a several-week time lag. The April data, which was released a week ago, showed total margin debt to be $163 billion (or 17%) below the level reached in October, when it peaked.
