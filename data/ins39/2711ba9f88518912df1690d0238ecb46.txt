Wolterk/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Elevator Pitch I have a Hold rating for Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO). Investors have to consider both capital appreciation and capital return in assessing the attractiveness of any potential investment candidate. MRO is not a good dividend stock based on a comparison of its dividend yields with peers, so it isn't a Buy. On the flip side, Marathon's shares aren't expensive based on the free cash flow yield metric, and this implies limited downside for the stock at current price levels which doesn't warrant a Sell rating for Marathon Oil either.
