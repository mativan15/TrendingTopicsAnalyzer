PytyCzech Constellation Energy's (NASDAQ:CEG) stock price increased by more than 30% in the past three months as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law by President Biden. IRA creates a tax credit for the production of carbon-free nuclear energy resources and clean hydrogen. CEG is the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in the United States, which produces 10% of carbon-free electricity in the country. Thus, the company's contracted revenues will increase in the next following quarters.
