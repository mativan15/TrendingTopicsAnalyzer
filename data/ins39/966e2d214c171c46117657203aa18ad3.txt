Star Entertainment Group's licence for its Sydney casino will be suspended from Friday and the group will have to pay a record fine of $100 million for its failure to stem criminal activity and money laundering within its casinos.

The penalties were announced by the New South Wales Independent Casino Commission (NICC) on Monday morning. The NICC said in the 'public interest', it has appointed Nicholas Weeks as the manager of the casino, effective from 9am on Friday. Under the conditions of the suspension, the casino will still be able to trade, with Weeks now holding the licence.
