Moneysupermarket's new Money Super Seven (Moneysupermarket)

Consumers under pressure to make their budgets stretch further have given a boost to comparison site Moneysupermarket as it reported a better-than-expected leap in third-quarter sales.

Revenue swelled to £102 million for the three months to September 2022, up 33% on the previous year, led by 42% growth in the firm's ‘Money' division, as consumers shop around for the best deals for credit cards, loans and mortgages. The Wales-based business said it expected earnings to land at the upper end of market expectations.
