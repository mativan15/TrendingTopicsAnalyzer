(Bloomberg) -- Rich countries are falling well-short of their climate finance commitments to poor countries and are using 'misleading' and 'dishonest' accounting to inflate how much they are providing, just weeks before key talks, according to a new report.Wealthy nations provided less than $25 billion in public finance in 2020, compared to the almost $70 billion they announced, Oxfam International said. The nonprofit found that much of the money is being delivered through loans, which force countries further into debt, while the funds that are provided often have less of a climate focus than stated.
