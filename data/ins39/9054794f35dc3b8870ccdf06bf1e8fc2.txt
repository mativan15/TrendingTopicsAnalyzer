A Washington Post story from over the weekend detailed several instances of turmoil and infighting within Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social, including one occasion in which Donald Trump reportedly pressured an executive to gift several of his company shares to Melania Trump, Trump's wife.

It's the latest development in a series of troubling reports from inside the nascent company, headed by former California Rep. Devin Nunes. The Post obtained a copy of a whistleblower complaint filed with the SEC against the company in August by company executive Will Wilkerson, and in its report said the documents attached to the complaint reveal "a stunning portrait of the animosity that has built up inside the company" since its debut last year.
