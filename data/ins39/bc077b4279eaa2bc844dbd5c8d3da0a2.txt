Millions of people on benefits are missing out on cheaper broadband tariffs because companies are failing to promote them properly.

Only around 3.5% of those eligible for the deals are currently on one, says media watchdog Ofcom.

Social tariffs are low-cost broadband deals offered to customers on benefits and cost about £15 a month.

The average customer could save £140 a year by switching to one of these deals, consumer group Which? says.

Broadband providers are not obliged to offer social tariffs, but have been encouraged to by the government and Ofcom.
