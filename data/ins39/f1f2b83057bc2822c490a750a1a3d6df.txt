Meidinger Tower, one of the city's largest office buildings, will be sold in foreclosure in coming weeks as about half the building is vacant and its Chicago-based owner cannot keep up with debt payments. Meidinger's situation underscores the rising vacancy rate of prime office space in the CBD, which has alarmed city economic development officials. Compounding the issue, Humana will move 750 downtown workers to an East End office park later this year, and the 8-story Nucleus building at the Haymarket is about to come online with few tenants lined up.
