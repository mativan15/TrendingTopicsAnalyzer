Biocon Biologics on Monday said it has inked an out-licensing agreement with Yoshindo Inc to commercialise its two biosimilar assets in the Japanese market. Under the terms of this deal, Japan-based Yoshindo gets exclusive commercialisation rights in Japan for Ustekinumab and Denosumab -- developed and manufactured by Biocon Biologics -- for an addressable market opportunity of USD 700 million, Biocon Biologics said in a statement. 
Biocon Biologics, a unit of Biocon, will receive an upfront license fee as well as additional payments on the achievement of certain development milestones over the next few years.
