A local group of bagel shops has closed another one of its locations and is now just down to one outlet.According to a tweet from @mgnicosia, Finagle A Bagel at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston is no longer in business, with a check on the locations page for the business confirming this, as that shop has been removed from the page. The closing of the MGH shop means that the only remaining location is on Boylston Street in Copley Square; at one point in time, there had been more than 20 locations of the bagel chain.
