AgenciesA fishing team of father-son duo were having a great time when a massive humpback whale surfaced just feet away from them. They went striped bass and tuna fishing near Belmar, New Jersey. Zach Piller, the son, recorded a video of the incident and shared it three days ago on Instagram. He said that the whale hit the side of their boat.
 The video starts off with frenzied water movement, then in the next split second, thousands of tiny fish can be seen emerging from the water, followed by the enormous head of a whale poking out at the side of the pair's boat View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zach Piller (@zachpiller18) As Piller witnesses the massive beast break the water's surface, he can be heard yelling with delight.
