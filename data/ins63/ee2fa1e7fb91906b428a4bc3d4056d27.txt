Around 1.4 million Canadian adults who know or suspect they've had COVID-19 say they experienced symptoms months after getting sick, according to new data released Monday by Statistics Canada.
The data, released in partnership with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), is the first national look at Canadians who experienced long-term symptoms after a positive COVID-19 test or suspected infection. It was gathered through the second cycle of StatCan's Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey.
