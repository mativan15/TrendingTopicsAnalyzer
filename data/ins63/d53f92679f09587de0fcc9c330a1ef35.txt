Even though the Punjab Cabinet Friday approved a decision to restore the old pension scheme amid an ongoing strike by staff of 37 government departments, the employees said that they will still go ahead with their plan to go to poll-bound Himachal Pradesh over the issue.
Nearly 2.95 lakh government employees in Punjab has been on pen down strike since October 10 demanding restoration of old pension scheme. However, ahead of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections, the AAP government announced to restore the old pension scheme.
