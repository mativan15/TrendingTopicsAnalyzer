Mumbai: Led by a strong revival in demand for last-mile people mobility, premium bus transport provider Cityflo intends to expand its fleet 10 times to 1,300-1,500 luxury Mercedes-Benz buses in the next two years. To fund this expansion, the Mumbai-based company plans to raise about ₹125-150 crore, which will be used in partnering with more fleet operators and marketing the service on new routes in Mumbai and Delhi. Founded in May 2015 at IIT-Bombay by Jerin Venad and his friends Ankit Agrawal, Subhash Sundaravadivelu, Rushabh Shah, Advaith Vishwanath and Sankalp Kelshikar, Cityflo has started getting significant traction in business after the Covid pandemic.
