Euan Blair, eldest son of Sir Tony Blair and founder and chief executive of Multiverse has been made an MBE for services to education in the Queen's Birthday Honor's list. To coincide with the occasion of the queen's birthday on the 11th of June this year, the awards have been shifted early this year. Stating that he owes the honor to the staff at his tech start-up, Mr. Blair said, 'It's a real honor to receive this recognition, but it's on behalf of an organization full of people who are working tirelessly to build a truly outstanding alternative to university.
