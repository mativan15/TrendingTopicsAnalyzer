India's petrol and diesel sales soared in May on the back of a surge in summer travel to escape from the heat and vacation during annual breaks at educational institutions, preliminary industry data showed on Wednesday. Petrol sales by state-owned fuel retailers, which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, at 2.8 million tonnes in May was 55.7 per cent higher than the same period last year when a devastating second COVID-19 wave wreaked havoc on the economy. This consumption was 76 per cent higher than the demand in May 2020 and 12 per cent more than 2.
