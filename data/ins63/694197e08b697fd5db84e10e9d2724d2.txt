The European Commission is poised to approve a long-delayed Covid recovery plan for Poland, overriding concerns that Warsaw is making cosmetic changes to its heavily criticised legal system to unlock EU cash.The commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to sign the agreement in Warsaw on Thursday, although Poland will have to undertake further judicial reforms to access €36bn (£30.68bn) in recovery grants and loans.The decision marks a significant moment in the six-year battle for independent courts in Poland, while other disputes remain open.
