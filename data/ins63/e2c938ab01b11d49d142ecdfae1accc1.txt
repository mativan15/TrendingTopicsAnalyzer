On the face of it the house price figures from Nationwide today are puzzling.The building society has given us the first take on the state of the market in May, a month when interest rate hikes and the cost of living squeeze were supposed to start taking the heat out of bricks and mortar.But that is not what we got. Prices actually accelerated to 0.9% on the admittedly volatile monthly measure - their tenth successive monthly rise - while the annual rate only slowed from 11.2% to 12.1%.Nationwide cautioned that the market will slow later in the year, but if commentators were paid a pound for every time they wrongly called the turn in UK property, they would have scraped together enough for a deposit by now.
