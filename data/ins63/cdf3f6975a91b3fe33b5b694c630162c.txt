Former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy hailed Mason Mount following his Man of the Match display against Aston Villa by claiming the Chelsea playmaker could ‘play anywhere'. 
The midfielder scored twice as Chelsea recorded a fortunate victory against Steven Gerrard's side at Villa Park.
Chelsea were under the cosh for much of the first half and had Kepa to thank for keeping Chelsea in the game.
Nevertheless, Mount was the side's standout performer aside from Kepa and his second goal – a 25-yard free-kick – was particularly eye-catching.
