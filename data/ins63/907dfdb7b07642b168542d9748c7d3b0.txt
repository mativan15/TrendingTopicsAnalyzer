Romance is in the air as hit reality show Love Is Blind returns to Netflix.
The pods are open as a fresh batch of singletons look for love in season three.
The hit programme – which first aired in 2020 – follows a group of singles who get to know each other without seeing each other, and only meet face to face after they decide to get married.
And after that, they jet off on honeymoons before moving in together, with their weddings taking place weeks later in what can only be described as a whirlwind romance.
