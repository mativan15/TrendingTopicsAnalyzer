SÖLDEN, Austria (AP) — If FIS President Johan Eliasch needed a reminder of the long road ahead to his desired centralization of Alpine skiing's media rights, he got it on Friday.

Less than three hours before Eliasch was going to speak at the FIS Forum Alpinum about his organization's marketing rights management, the Austrian Ski Federation announced a two-year TV and streaming deal with NBC.

In a deal brokered by IMG Media and starting this weekend with the season-opening races in Sölden, all Austrian World Cup events can be seen in the United States on Peacock, a streaming service of NBCUniversal, while selected events will be broadcast by NBC.
