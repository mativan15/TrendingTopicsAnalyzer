NEW DELHI: UltraTech Cement's decision to invest Rs 12,886 crore to ramp up its capacity by FY25 may only add to fears of margin erosion in the sector that is marred by weak demand, low pricing power, high fuel cost and the entry of a new aggressive player Adani Group. Analysts said while the capex announcement itself is not a surprise, it is a few months ahead of its expectation. With other players also looking to ramp up capacity, near term pressure on cement stocks is all but likely, they said.
