When a key part of the U.S. bond market starts shrugging off new Federal Reserve interest rate hikes or tough talk on inflation, it's probably time to buy stocks, according to James Paulsen, the Leuthold Group's chief investment strategist. To inform his call, Paulsen looked at the relationship between the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 4.001% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.14% in several past Fed tightening cycles. He found five periods, since the mid-1980s, when the benchmark 10-year yield peaked, signaling bond investors 'blinked,' before the Fed stopped raising its policy interest rate.
