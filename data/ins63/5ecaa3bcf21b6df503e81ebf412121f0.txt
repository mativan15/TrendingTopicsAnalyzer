When you turn a device or appliance off, you probably assume that it's truly off and no longer drawing power. But that's not actually the case. Many common household appliances -- from your laptop charger to your printer -- run certain functions when plugged in and use up electricity even if the device itself isn't on. Luckily, the solution is pretty easy -- just unplug the appliances. Unplugging them will actually stop energy from silently draining out and increasing your bills, saving you both electricity and money in the long run.
