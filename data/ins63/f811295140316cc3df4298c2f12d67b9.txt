June 1 (Reuters) - Euro zone bond yields extended their rise on Wednesday as investors continued to digest inflation data which came in much higher than expected a week before a crucial European Central Bank policy meeting.

Higher-than-forecast inflation prints from Germany and the euro zone as a whole have sent the bloc's bond yields surging this week. Germany's 10-year yield, the benchmark for the bloc, is already up 19 basis points this week, set for its biggest weekly rise in nearly a month.
