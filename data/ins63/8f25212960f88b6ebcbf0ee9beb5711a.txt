OTTAWA - Canada's auditor general has joined a growing chorus of Indigenous advocates and economists who have urged the government for years to think beyond the current income tax system to get benefits into the hands of First Nations families. The most recent figures show only 79 per cent of eligible families on First Nations accessed the Canada Child Benefit in 2017 compared to 97 per cent of the general population.Auditor general Karen Hogan says one of the key challenges is that filing a federal income tax return is a mandatory step in the accessing the benefit.
