Concerned over the criticism of appointment of judges and 'attacks' on the judiciary on social media, the Chief Justice of India has stated that these should be controlled and strict action should be taken by the government, Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju said Monday.
Mentioning that he has received a letter from the CJI — Rijiju did not name the Chief Justice — the minister said that he has not replied yet 'soch samajh ke (deliberately)'.
'Kyunki agar jawab denge toh aage badhna padhega, aur aage badhenge toh phir desh ke liye kya hoga uska chintan manthan hoga (a reply would mean moving forward, and that would entail deliberations on what should be done for the country),' Rijiju said during ‘Sabarmati Samvad', organised in Ahmedabad by Panchjanya, the weekly magazine published by the RSS.
