The so-called 'grandparent scam' is getting under the skin of local enforcement agencies like the OPP. 'I guess the best way you could put it is we're annoyed, says OPP Const. Steven Duguay. A day after the Windsor Police Service warned of a rise in scam phone calls, OPP received an overwhelming number of reports of the same crime. 'We've had phone calls and walk-ins. Walk-ins in Leamington, I think we had upwards of six people come in and complain the same thing,' says Duguay, who adds Kingsville and Lakeshore OPP detachments also experienced an uptick.
