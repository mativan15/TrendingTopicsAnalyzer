The Arizona Cardinals and New Orleans are the only NFL game on for the world to see tonight. They open up Week 7 and hope to improve the quality of games fans have seen on Thursday nights this season.

Cardinals receiver DeAndre Hopkins makes his 2022 debut after serving a six-game suspension for testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance, coming just at the right time because Marquise Brown was lost for several weeks to a foot injury.

Meanwhile, the Saints will not have their two top receivers, their two top cornerbacks, their starting tight end and starting left guard.
