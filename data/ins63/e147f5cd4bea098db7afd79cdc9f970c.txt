(WBZ NewsRadio) — A Dorchester man created a website in the early days of the COVID pandemic, not realizing it would become a tool to help Boston residents find local dive bars. The website, bostondives.com, directs viewers to the closest dive bars based on their location. Viewers can also see all of the listed bars if they choose not to do it by location and are able to mark off each one they have been to. Nick Roy came up with the idea for the website while sitting at a dive bar with his wife when shutdowns started taking place around the country.
