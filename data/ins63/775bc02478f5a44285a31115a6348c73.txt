Drawing parallels between India's drain of wealth by the colonial rulers and the ‘brain drain' in the post-Independence years, Home Minister Amit Shah credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for turning this brain drain into ‘brain gain' by enabling students to pursue medical and technical education in Hindi and other regional languages.
Shah made the statement while speaking at Bhopal's Lal Parade ground Sunday where he had come to inaugurate the newly transliterated books in Hindi on the subject of anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology for first-year MBBS students.
