By Australian Associated Press Published: 11:30 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 11:30 EDT, 28 May 2022 John Aloisi has completed a remarkable redemption arc from the coaching wilderness to A-League Men championship winner and believes he and fledgling club Western United are just getting started. The club have received plenty of criticism for their small supporter base, lack of a consistent home ground and the dragged-out process of building their own stadium and training base. United fans made plenty of noise in AAMI Park's north end as Aloisi led the expansion club to a breakthrough championship in just their third season on Saturday night.
