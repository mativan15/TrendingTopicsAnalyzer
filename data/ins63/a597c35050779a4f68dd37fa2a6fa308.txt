It seems more and more likely that James Tarkowski will be heading out of the exit door at Burnley this summer and journalist Dean Jones has reported that Everton are prepared to throw money at the player in order to get him to join the club.

Speaking to Give Me Sport, Jones revealed that Frank Lampard is ready to offer much more in terms of weekly wage than any other interested party or the Clarets.

If money talks, then that should likely mean the defender sides with a move back to the Premier League and to Goodison Park over a deal somewhere else.
