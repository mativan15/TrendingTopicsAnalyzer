Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Topps Tiles Plc (LON:TPT) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date.
