The migrants arriving on buses at Port Authority will be taken to 'tent city' where they will be provided with food, shelter and medical assistance. They will also have access to TV and video games, and officials will talk with the asylum seekers about where they want to be long term. The city says the tents are built to survive the New York weather.
