It hasn't been the October the San Francisco real estate industry was hoping it would be.

Third-quarter median home sales prices have retreated dramatically from spring peaks, a decline brokers attribute to changing market conditions prompted by increases in interest rates, and declines in stock markets and consumer confidence. The median sales price for a home in the city fell from $2 million in the second quarter to $1.65 million in the third quarter, a huge 17.5% decline, according to September data from Compass (NYSE: COMP), and a 9% year-over-year decline.
