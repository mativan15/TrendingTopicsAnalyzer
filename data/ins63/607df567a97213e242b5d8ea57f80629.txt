I was excited to see Goodfellas when it opened in 1990. Excited because it was a Martin Scorsese movie—maybe more precisely because it was a Scorsese gangster movie. Excited because it was based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy, about the lowlife mobster Henry Hill, which as far as I'm concerned remains the best book ever written about how organized crime actually works. I was also excited by the cast, which included Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco, and Joe Pesci and was led by the then young actor Ray Liotta, who died this week at 67 and is the reason I'm writing this now.
