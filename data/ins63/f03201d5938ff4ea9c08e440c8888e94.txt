Baris-Ozer Cell therapy company Talaris Therapeutics (NASDAQ:TALS) shed ~24% pre-market Thursday after reporting a death in a kidney transplant patient in its Phase 3 trial for lead candidate FCR001. The patient who was initially diagnosed with grade II acute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) died after being hospitalized due to grade IV GvHD. The U.S.-based trial named FREEDOM-1 is designed to evaluate the allogeneic cell therapy FCR001 in 120 living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients. The trial's Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) reviewed the findings on the death and recommended that enrollment and dosing should continue.
