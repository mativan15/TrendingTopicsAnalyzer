It's ten o'clock at night in downtown Austin and I'm about to get dirty. 
Well, I'm about to explore the ‘Dirty Sixth', a stretch of historic Sixth Street so-named for its profusion of live music venues, dive bars, food trucks and restaurants. 
Crowds are milling around in the still-warm summer air, music drifts out of doorways and the general vibe is party central. My mates and I start queuing to get into a venue called the Cedar Room but change tack when we spot a man wearing a T-shirt proclaiming ‘Dirty Bills: The worst gay bar in Austin'.
