NASA has created a map of sky which provides a glimpse into the past! Here's what you need to know.
 Did you know that NASA has a way to map the entire sky? No, it does not work like Google Maps where Google uses satellites for satellite navigation combined with Google Car collecting data for Street View. Instead, NASA uses one of its explorer satellites to map the sky by studying and stitching data together. NASA's Near-Earth Object Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer, or NEOWISE completes half its trip around the Sun every six months.
