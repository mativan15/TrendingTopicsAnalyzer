Two in-form sides face off as Graham Potter puts his unbeaten record as Chelsea manager on the line against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday (kick-off, 5.30pm).
Since succeeding Thomas Tuchel in south-west London, former Brighton boss Potter has enjoyed a seven-match unbeaten run in all competitions, winning five and drawing two.
As for the Red Devils, things are looking up for Erik ten Hag after a tricky start to his Old Trafford reign and Wednesday's 2-0 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur made it four wins and a draw in their past five domestic and European matches.
