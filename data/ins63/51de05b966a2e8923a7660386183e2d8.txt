Acclaimed national security reporter James Gordon Meek hasn't been seen since an April FBI raid on his apartment just outside of Washington, DC.

Former colleagues at ABC News, a co-author on his forthcoming book, and even his neighbours say they have no idea where the documentary producer has been.

The worrying disappearance raises questions over whether the Biden administration has targeted or arrested the journalist, a major test of the president, who made a point last year to put new safeguards in place protecting reporters during leak investigations.
