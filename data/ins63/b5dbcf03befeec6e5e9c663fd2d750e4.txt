In the sparsely populated American West of 1890, an Englishwoman called Cornelia Locke (Emily Blunt) steps off a stagecoach in her best pink dress, with revenge in mind for the murder of her son. 
During the first episode of The English, Hugo Blick's excitingly ambitious drama of frontier violence, we do not learn the identity of the heroine's ultimate enemy – but she makes several more, among them a racist hotelier fond of prairie oysters. This could easily have been a Christoph Waltz part, but the news is better: he's played with smiling courtesy by a deliciously vile Ciarán Hinds.
