Jackson County officials recently learned the cost to build a new jail might be escalating — dramatically.

The size of the increase is murky, but substantial. 'Nothing's on paper,' one legislator told us, confirming that cost discussions are now underway.

What is clear, increasingly, is that the county must redouble efforts to find partners, including the city of Kansas City, who can share some of the cost of building the facility.

In June, county legislators were told a jail with 1,244 beds — the recommended size — would cost $256.
