UK business confidence rose for the first time in three months and since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but firms' fears over rising costs and economic slowdown increase.

The latest Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) Business Barometer shows confidence increased five percentage points to 38%, the highest since February 2022 and 10 points above the long-term historical average of 28%.

Confidence in the retail sector, fell two points to 27%, its lowest level since March last year amid concerns over the squeeze on household incomes and despite fading worries about COVID-19.
