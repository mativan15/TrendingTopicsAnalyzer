Last week, the Pittsburgh Steelers pulled off the biggest upset of the season when they pulled off a 20-18 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to snap a four-game losing streak. But according to the folks at Tipico Sportsbook, the Steelers will once again be an underdog this week against the Miami Dolphins.
Tipico has Pittsburgh opening as seven-point road underdogs to the Dolphins. Much of this has to do with the quarterback situations for both teams. Miami is getting their starting quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa back after missing time with a concussion.
