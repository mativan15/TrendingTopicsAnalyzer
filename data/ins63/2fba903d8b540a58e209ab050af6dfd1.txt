The government has surprised everyone by announcing a raft of new measures to help Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living.

Eligible adult Singaporeans will receive up to S$500 in cash to help them cope with the higher cost of goods and services.

This payout will go to roughly 2.5 million Singaporeans who earn less than S$100,000 of assessable income and do not own more than one property.

In addition, households will also receive another S$100 of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers to help them offset grocery purchases at supermarkets and pay for food and drinks at hawker centres and coffee shops.
