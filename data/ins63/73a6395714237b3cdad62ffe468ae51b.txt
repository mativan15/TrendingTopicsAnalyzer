For many observers, the collapse of LUNA and UST was an black eye for cryptocurrency. To Charles Hoskinson, it was a validation of his go-slow approach to developing a blockchain.

'If you move too quickly, as we've seen with Luna, and we've seen with $10.5 billion of hacks last year, you could actually get it to work until it doesn't, and then when it doesn't it's a catastrophic failure and everybody loses their money,' the Cardano founder said in a recent interview with CoinDesk.
