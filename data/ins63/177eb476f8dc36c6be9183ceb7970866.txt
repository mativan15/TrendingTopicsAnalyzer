PARIS, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The government of French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said it would push the 2023 budget bill through the lower house of parliament, using special constitutional powers to override the need for a parliamentary vote.

"It is our responsibility to make sure our country has a budget", Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne told lawmakers, adding that it would also take too long for the parliament to fully examine all of the amendments proposed by lawmakers.
