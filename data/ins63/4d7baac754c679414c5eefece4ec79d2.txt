LEXINGTON — The list of questions about Kentucky football's wide receiver room has grown again.

Former Alabama wide receiver Javon Baker, who signed with Kentucky in February, is no longer transferring to UK, a football team spokesman confirmed Thursday. A former four-star recruit, Baker was projected to compete for a starting spot for UK this fall.

Since Baker had not yet enrolled at UK, he can now consider other options in the transfer portal. In an Instagram story post, Baker indicated the decision to part ways with UK was made by the Kentucky coaching staff.
