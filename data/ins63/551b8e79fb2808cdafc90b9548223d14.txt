In October 2019, state wildlife police shot a man inside his houseboat docked off Key West because they said he doused himself with gasoline — then threatened to blow up himself and officers aboard his vessel with the flick of a cigarette lighter.

After surviving three Glock 9mm bullet wounds from a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officer's service gun, Monroe County prosecutors charged Adam Bounds with attempted arson and aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer.
