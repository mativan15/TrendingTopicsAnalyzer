Cincinnati's best-paying public company pays its average worker five times the amount its lowest-paying peer does.

A Business Courier analysis of company filings shows Mason's AtriCure once again tops the region's pool of public companies when it comes to average median pay, with an average pay of $133,905. Meanwhile, Kroger, the region's largest public company, comes in last. At Kroger, the average worker earns roughly $26,763, filings show.

That's not surprising given what each company does. AtriCure, a medical device maker known largely for its surgical treatments and therapies for atrial fibrillation, is more likely to have white-collar workers than Kroger, which has more hourly employees.
