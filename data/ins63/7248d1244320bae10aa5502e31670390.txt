(RTTNews) - A report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday showed regional manufacturing activity has contracted by more than expected in the month of October. The New York Fed said its general business conditions index slid to a negative 9.1 in October from a negative 1.5 in September, with a negative reading indicating a contraction in regional manufacturing activity. Economists had expected the index to dip to a negative 4.0. The bigger than expected decrease by the headline index was partly due to a steep drop by the shipments index, which tumbled to a negative 0.
