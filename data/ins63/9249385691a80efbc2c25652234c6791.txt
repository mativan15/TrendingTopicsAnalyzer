(Bloomberg) -- UK regulator Ofcom proposed changes to net neutrality rules carried over from the European Union to give telecommunications and internet providers more flexibility.Internet service providers should be allowed to offer a broader range of premium packages on a wider variety of parameters such as latency, and could include discounted tariffs during off-peak hours, according to proposals from the watchdog published Friday.'The net neutrality rules constrain the activities of broadband providers, and could be restricting their ability to develop new services and manage their networks,' Ofcom said in the report.
