Constituents in Uxbridge, where former prime minister Boris Johnson is MP, have urged Conservative politicians and the Tory party membership to 'bring Boris back' for a second term in Downing Street. Attempting to emulate his political hero Winston Churchill, who returned to No 10 in 1951, six years after being ousted following the end of World War 2, Mr Johnson was pictured in a British Airways flight back to England from the Caribbean on Friday having said he was 'up for it'. Roughly 50 MPs have declared their public support for him, though estimates are as high as 62.
