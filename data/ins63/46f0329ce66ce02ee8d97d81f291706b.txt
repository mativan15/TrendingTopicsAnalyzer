Amazon (AMZN 3.66%) shareholders voted on nearly 20 proposals during its annual meeting this week. One of these proposals has garnered loads of attention ever since Amazon announced it a couple of months ago. I'm talking about the idea for a 20-for-1 stock split.
During the meeting, the retail giant's shareholders approved the split. That means, as of June 6, Amazon shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. Meanwhile, this once-superstar stock has turned into a struggling one. It's dropped more than 30% so far this year.
