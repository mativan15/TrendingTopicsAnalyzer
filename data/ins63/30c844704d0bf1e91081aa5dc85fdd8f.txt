Cameron Mitchell is getting into the hotel business with the confidence of a man who knows what he doesn't know.

His eponymous Columbus-based restaurant group, well-known for its decades of experience and the dozens of establishments in its portfolio, is teaming up with developer Crawford Hoying on a new boutique hotel project at Bridge Park in Dublin.

It's a new type of venture for the high-profile Central Ohio power player.

'We have no illusions about what we're getting into,' Mitchell said.
