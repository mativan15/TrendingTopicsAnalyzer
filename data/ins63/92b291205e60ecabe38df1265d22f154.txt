Investors have been laser-focused on profit-producing companies, which has left companies in their pre-revenue stage on the sidelines. As a result, a growing number of biotech stocks are now trading below the value of the cash on their balance sheets. Over the past year, the SPDR S & P Biotech ETF is down nearly 44%, while the iShares Biotech ETF has lost nearly 23% over the same period. The steep discounts, plus a potential pick up in M & A, could spark renewed interest in the sector, but analysts say it may be wise to remain defensive in the sector.
