Prepare for more Black lady hilarity as Robin Thede 's Emmy-winning HBO comedy series ' A Black Lady Sketch Show ' has started production on its fourth season. Created by and starring Thede, 'A Black Lady Sketch Show' was renewed in June following a strong third season that netted two Emmys — one for outstanding picture editing for variety programming (a trophy the series has won in back-to-back years, with editors Stephanie Filo, Bradinn French, Taylor Joy Mason and S. Robyn Wilson honored for Season 3) and outstanding directing for a variety series (Bridget Stokes).
