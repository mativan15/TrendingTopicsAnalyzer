Oct. 19—ROCHESTER — Kinney Creek has always had a challenge for customer parking in its almost 10 years of business.

Now, parking options for people wanting a taste of the Med City Seltzer on tap are much easier as the Brewery has purchased the lot formerly home to Zorba's Greek Restaurant adding 20 additional parking spaces for people.

"We have ample parking in the back, but it's behind our building and not everyone always sees that or knows that," said Lindsay Hendrickson, marketing specialist for Kinney Creek.
