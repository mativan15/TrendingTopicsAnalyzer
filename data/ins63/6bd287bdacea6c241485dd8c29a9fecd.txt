A hypothetical attack on Taiwan by China would spark a global economic crisis, particularly if the manufacturing of crucial semiconductors is disrupted, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned this week.
Speaking at Stanford University on Monday with former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, Blinken said the risk of 'enormous' economic suffering in the event of a military attack in the Taiwan Strait was immense, making the need for a peaceful resolution to tensions in the region more important.
