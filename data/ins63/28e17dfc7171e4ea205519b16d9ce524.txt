In her new novel 'Demon Copperhead' (Harper, 560 pp., ★★★ out of four, out Tuesday), Barbara Kingsolver transports the plot of Charles Dickens' 'David Copperfield' to late-1990s Appalachia. It's a clever and grimly fitting conceit: Poverty, neglect and a frayed safety net are as true to life in contemporary rural Virginia as they were in Victorian England.It's also perfect territory for Kingsolver, who like Dickens has often used her fiction to advance social-justice causes. Some of the flaws in her approach still apply here – the notes of sanctimony, the occasional compulsion to lecture.
