The Washington Commanders will be celebrating the franchise's 90th anniversary with at least one less honoree than they'd hoped.

On Sunday, the team is having a ceremony including 10 former players that will be added to its greatest 90 players list. Former Commanders tight end Chris Cooley declined the invitation.

'At this point, I don't have a lot of desire to be involved with Washington Commanders,' he said on The Kevin Sheehan Show, "I don't have any interest in doing this."

He was selected to two Pro Bowls and played his entire nine-year NFL career from 2004-12 for Washington before its rebrand.
