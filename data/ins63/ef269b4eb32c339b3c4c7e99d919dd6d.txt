A fundraiser for the family of Irma and Joe Garcia – a teacher killed in the Uvalde school shooting, and her husband who died of a heart attack two days later – has raised more than $2.7 million. Irma, a fourth-grade teacher who'd worked at the school for more than 20 years, was killed in her classroom in the shooting last Tuesday, along with another teacher and 19 students at Robb Elementary School.
