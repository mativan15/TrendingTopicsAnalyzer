Liz Truss and Suella Braverman's plan to issue police with targets to cut crimes including murder by 20 per cent has been paused as officers demand engagement with the governemnt.The former prime minister announced the policy as part of her successful Conservative Party leadership campaign in July, and it was confirmed by Ms Braverman as home secretary.The Independent understands that the targets, dismissed as 'incoherent' and dangerous by police sources, were in an early stage of development and would have to be re-approved by new home secretary Grant Shapps to progress.
