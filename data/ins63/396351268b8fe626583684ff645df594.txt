New Delhi: The Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Thursday said it has arrested a 36-year-old man in connection with alleged duping of over 1,000 people across India of nearly ₹100 crores through Ponzi schemes. Ashish Malik, the accused who has an MBA degree, was arrested from his native Kakrola village in south-west Delhi on Tuesday. He was evading arrest since 2019 when he was booked along with his two accomplices on a Delhi court's direction following one Anand Laxman Pardeshi's complaint.
