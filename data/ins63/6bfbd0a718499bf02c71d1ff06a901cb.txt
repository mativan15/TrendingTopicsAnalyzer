WASHINGTON – Ohio Senate candidates J.D. Vance and Tim Ryan stage a second debate showdown Monday, both looking for an edge in a close contest with national significance.

The two meet in Youngstown just a week after a first debate in which they clashed over abortion, inflation, Ryan's support of President Joe Biden and Vance's support of former President Donald Trump.

Any of these issues could decide an election that could determine whether Democrats and Republicans control the U.S. Senate.
