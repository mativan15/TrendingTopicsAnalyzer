As fires and explosions in electric two-wheelers continue unabated, the government is all set to introduce EV battery standards (BIS standards) for EV two-wheelers that will be expanded to four-wheelers at a later stage. CNBC-TV18, citing sources from the consumer affairs ministry, reported the development. The BIS standards for EV batteries will look into "size, connectors, specification and minimum quality of cells, the battery's capacity". Acknowledging an urgent need, the sources in the ministry said that it is in touch with the battery industry stakeholders to bring out BIS guidelines for EV batteries, as initial reports have found serious defects in the batteries, including designs of the battery packs and modules.
