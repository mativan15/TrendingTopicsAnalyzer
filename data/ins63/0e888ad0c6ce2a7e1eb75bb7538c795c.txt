Donning a red, white and green charro-style skirt draped gracefully over her galloping Andalusian horse, Mexican American singer Ángela Aguilar serenaded thousands of fans at Crypto Arena in her hometown of Los Angeles last week. At 19, she's mastering her stage presence and delivering chilling renditions of her late grandmother's classics "Cachito De Mi Vida" and "Gaviota Traidora," rightfully earning her the title "princess of Mexican music." Ángela was born into musical royalty, after all. "I do feel some pressure," she says.
