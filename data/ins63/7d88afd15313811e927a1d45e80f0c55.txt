October 20, 2022 06:48 AM Eastern Daylight Time DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Kenya Cities Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

Nairobi and Mombasa are Kenya's most economically vibrant cities. The cities' economic strength is partially supported by higher consumer expenditure, as compared to the other major cities within the country.

Moreover, Nairobi holds the highest potential for future economic growth. However, challenges for the country's cities will persist - in the near term, increasing global inflation, and in the longer run, burdens on cities' infrastructure, due to large and increasing populations.
