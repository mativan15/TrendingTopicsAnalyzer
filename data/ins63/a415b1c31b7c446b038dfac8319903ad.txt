May 26—MURFREESBORO — Though this is Watertown's second appearance in the state baseball tournament, the Purple Tigers still achieved at least a couple of firsts Tuesday.

Coach Mark Purvis won the pregame coin toss for home team, which didn't happen last year as the Purple Tigers were walked off in both their games.

Most importantly, they posted their first-ever state tournament win and first shutout 1-0 over Loudon at Riverdale.

Alec Whitlock pitched four innings of four-hit ball with six strikeouts for the win.
