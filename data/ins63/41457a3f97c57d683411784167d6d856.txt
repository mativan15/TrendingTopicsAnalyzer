filadendron/E+ via Getty Images Urban One (NASDAQ:UONE) is a small cap stock that doesn't get talked about much on Seeking Alpha. However, that doesn't mean investors cannot achieve a massive ROI by holding the stock and taking on a bit of risk. In this article, I want to point out an excellent arbitrage play that could explore leading up to Juneteenth (June 19), which marks the date when slavery was officially ended in Texas. In 2021, President Joe Biden made Juneteenth an official federal holiday for the first time ever and I expect many Americans to celebrate June 19th 2022 with plenty of excitement and joy.
