Jrue Holiday's two-way play helps seal the Bucks' victory over the 76ers in their season debut.
When the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers met at Wells Fargo Center on Thursday, it was some old-school Eastern Conference basketball, with both teams scoring less than a point per possession.
The Bucks were on the right side of a 90-88 final score, withstanding a fourth-quarter comeback from the Sixers. Wesley Matthews hit the game-winning 3 and Jrue Holiday got the big stop down the stretch, as the Bucks opened their season with a quality road win and dropped the Sixers to 0-2.
