One of the most powerful women in world sport is in Auckland this week ahead of the draw for next year's Fifa Women's World Cup, which will take place on Saturday night at the Aotea Centre. Fatma Samoura was installed as Fifa's first female secretary-general in 2016 after more than two decades working in humanitarian roles for the United Nations and is the global governing body's second-in-command, after president Gianni Infantino. This is her third trip to New Zealand with Fifa, after a visit some time ago for a workshop and one earlier this year as the countdown to the tournament, being hosted here and in Australia next July and August, began in earnest.
