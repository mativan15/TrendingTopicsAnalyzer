By Reuters Published: 15:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 15:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 Terry Francona will return for an 11th season as Cleveland's manager, Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said Friday. Francona guided the Guardians to the American League Division Series in 2022 before the club lost to the New York Yankees in five games. Francona, 63, doesn't have a signed contract with the club at this point. Antonetti said determining how long Francona wants to run the club is part of the process.
