A 25-year-old man is facing charges for allegedly robbing two people with a knife in Moncton, N.B., according to a news release from the RCMP. Just after 7 p.m. on Sept. 18, police responded to two separate reports that a man armed with a knife robbed two different people on Main Street in the city. The RCMP says a man walked up to one person in a parked car, brandished a knife and demanded money, but instead, stole the person's credit card. A few minutes later, the man allegedly approached a second person on a nearby sidewalk and again pulled a knife – this time, stealing food.
