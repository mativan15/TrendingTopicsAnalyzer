June 03, 2022 08:29 AM Eastern Daylight Time DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Growth Opportunities for Global Travel and Hospitality Customer Engagement" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.



Customer service underpins success in the travel and hospitality (T&H) industry. Undoubtedly, more than in any other industry, the voice of the customer expressed in rankings and reviews takes a prominent role.

T&H organizations are streamlining several internal processes (including mobile and digital touchpoints) and empowering customers with automation and self-service solutions since, on average, more than 8 out of 10 hotel bookings are done without human intervention.
