Donna Miles is an Iranian-Kiwi writer based in Christchurch. OPINION: The word 'ideology' was coined in 1796 by French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher Antoine Destutt de Tracy. Ideology, or the 'science of ideas', as he called it, is broadly based on two inter-related elements, the emotions people experience when they interact with the material world, and the ideas formed as a result of those interactions. These days, the world ideology, especially when used by politicians, refers to a set of policies guided by a given system of beliefs.
