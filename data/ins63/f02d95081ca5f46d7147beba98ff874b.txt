With the global shortage of chips due to the pandemic and transportation issues, many people are still having a hard time picking up a PS5. Even worse, since scalpers have come into the mix, prices have skyrocketed for the console, making the buying experience frustrating and exceedingly expensive.To top that all off, in a recent earnings report by Sony, they expected the shortage to last well into 2023, even with the expectation of selling 18 million consoles by March 2023. That being said, there is bright news on the horizon in that Sony expects that come 2024, things will get back on track, with stock being on a reasonable level and sales reaching the same level as the ps4 at its height.
