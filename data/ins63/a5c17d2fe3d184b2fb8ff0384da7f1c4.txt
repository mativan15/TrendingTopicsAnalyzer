Please! Pretty please! With azúcar on top! I beg you  both — Kevin de León, and Gilbert Cedillo — to ignore the calls to resign your seats on the Los Angeles City Council Instead, I'm imploring you to stay and brazen this scandal out.
The people of Los Angeles need you, their power-hungry representatives, especially now that you and City Council Nury Martinez are disgraced by a tape of your racist insults against nearly every demographic in town.
Why?
So, they can have the pleasure of firing you themselves! A couple of resignations can't cure what ails Los Angeles and its governing body.
