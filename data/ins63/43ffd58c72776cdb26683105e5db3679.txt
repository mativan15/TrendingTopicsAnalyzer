This year's relentless sell-off in US equities has finally yanked the market into oversold territory for the first time since 2016, according to The Leuthold Group.The firm cited its proprietary Very Long Term Momentum algorithm, or VLT. The signal comes with the S&P 500 mired in a bear market — one driven by aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes intended to fight decades-high inflation.VLT's oversold reading overall means that a "low-risk buy signal is now mathematically possible," Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group, wrote in a research note published Friday.
