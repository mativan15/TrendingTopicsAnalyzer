Scott Olson Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) faces a lawsuit in South Carolina from a small group of employees from a single store in the state. The legal action accuses the company of defamation over its response to a union protest. The group claims in the lawsuit that the coffee chain giant falsely and maliciously portrayed them as criminals in statements made to the police on August 1 for the "illegitimate collateral purpose" of preventing plaintiffs from publicly protesting. During the incident, the Starbucks (SBUX) store manager reported the workers to local law enforcement because she said they would not let her leave until they got a raise and that one of them assaulted her.
