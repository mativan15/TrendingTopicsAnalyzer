Want to save money on energy bills this summer? Then it's time to stop overlooking your ceiling fan. That may sound strange, but there's a money-saving trick to make it usable year-round. In fact, almost every ceiling fan is designed to rotate clockwise and counterclockwise. Most everyone is familiar with the benefits of a fan's counterclockwise motion: It creates a downward airflow to cool you, which is ideal for anytime you're hot. The downward draft from a ceiling fan can even make you feel up to 8 degrees Fahrenheit cooler, which means you can rely less on air conditioning in the peak season.
