Orbex has been developing a 19m-long rocket for carrying satellites into low Earth orbit

Moray-based space rocket manufacturer Orbex has secured a £40.4m funding package to help towards planned launches from a Highland spaceport.

The Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB) and Jacobs, a company providing services to Nasa, are among the project's new investors.

Orbex has proposed launching small satellites into low Earth orbit from Space Hub Sutherland near Tongue.

The first launch could take place next year.
