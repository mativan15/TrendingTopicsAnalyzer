Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been filmed grooving along to protesters who chanted 'AOC has gotta go' while backed by a drum beat at a fractious town hall meeting.  Protestors confronted the second-term congresswoman at a town hall in Queens on Wednesday night.The grinning congresswoman shrugged off the aggressive criticism as she sipped from a water bottle and began to move her shoulders in beat with the chants.She sat on a stage throughout, and continued to smile even as one furious woman appeared ready to combust with rage while screaming herself hoarse from the seats.
