WARNING: Graphic

An Algerian woman charged with the rape, torture and murder of a 12-year-old girl found in a plastic box was in France illegally at the time, sparking fury at the country's immigration laws.

The child's brutalised body was found in the plastic box in a courtyard of her apartment building in northeast Paris after she failed to return home from school last week.

She was identified only by her first name, Lola, under French law. An autopsy showed she had died of asphyxiation.

She had other wounds including on her face and neck, and the numbers zero and one had been written in red on the soles of her feet.
