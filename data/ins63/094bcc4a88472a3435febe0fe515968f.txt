Ten months ago I first posed the question whether the Rangers should do whatever it would take to acquire Patrick Kane for what would have been a two-playoff-run rental.
Now, a season after the Blueshirts advanced to the conference finals without No. 88 — but who were stopped from completing their appointed rounds because of an inability to score against Tampa Bay — the how-much-is-too-much hypothetical pursuit of Kane has become the universal underlying narrative to the season.
Do you know how the Rangers can best answer this question? By having their top-six right wings play and produce at a level that obviates the need to deplete the organization's prospect pool in a deal for a one-and-done addition to the lineup, even one as potentially life-altering as Kane, that's how.
