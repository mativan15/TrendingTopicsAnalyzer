The provincial and federal governments are providing the seed money to help restart the oyster farming industry in Cape Breton's Bras d'Or Lake.Officials with Nova Scotia Fisheries and Aquaculture and Fisheries and Oceans Canada announced $2.1 million in funding on Friday to help establish a land-based hatchery to provide breeding stock and healthy larvae for commercial oyster growers.The hatchery will help re-establish an industry that was wiped out a couple of decades ago by Multinucleate Sphere Unknown X disease, also known as MSX, which is spread by a parasite that kills oysters, but is harmless to humans.
