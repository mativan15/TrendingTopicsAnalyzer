The 49ers shocked the world late Thursday night when they swung a trade for Panthers' All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey.
In the deal, Carolina got a massive haul. Per NFL Network, San Francisco sent a second-round draft pick, a third-rounder and a fourth-rounder in 2023, as well as a fifth-rounder in 2024. 
Which prompts the question: Was it worth it for the 49ers, giving up so much draft capital for a 26-year-old running back who has only played 16 games since 2019?
San Francisco is already behind the 8-ball in the draft, having traded first-rounders in 2021, 2022 and 2023 to move up nine spots in the 2021 NFL Draft to select quarterback Trey Lance.
