Jun. 3—ASHLAND — A federal grand jury has indicted a convicted felon deputies said was found in the parking lot of the Cannonsburg Walmart with a gun and drugs.

Thomas J. Bentley, 37, of Pikeville but formerly of Ashland, was charged in state court March 18 when a Boyd County deputy responded to a trespassing call at the Wally World off U.S. 60.

According to court records, Bentley was found parked in a white 2006 Mercedes high on some type of opiate.

After arresting Bentley on an outstanding trafficking warrant, the deputy turned up a large amount of money, powdered substances, syringes and a loaded revolver, a citation states.
