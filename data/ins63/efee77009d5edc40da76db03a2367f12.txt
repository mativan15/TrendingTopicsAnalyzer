Shares of document database-software company MongoDB (MDB 18.56%) took a steep 33% tumble in May, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. It was a rough month for tech stocks overall, especially for those like MongoDB that offer sizzling revenue growth but haven't yet turned a profit. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and beginning to tighten monetary policy to try and tame inflation, it isn't a great market environment for investing in companies such as this. 
However, to kick off the month of June, MongoDB reported stellar earnings for the first quarter of its current fiscal year.
