Oct. 18—A union that represents Frederick County's career firefighters on Monday accused the county of "misuse of public funds" and "unethical behavior" for creating a committee in support of a ballot question about who has the final say in bargaining disputes.

The county government created its ballot issue committee on Sept. 27 in support of ballot Question A, according to the Maryland State Board of Elections.

Question A, which is on general election ballots in Frederick County, would change wording in the county's charter to clarify that the County Council has the final say in bargaining disputes between the county and its career firefighters.
