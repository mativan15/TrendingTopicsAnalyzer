Small landlords would be incentivised to charge cheaper rents in return for being taxed less, under proposals set to be considered by the Government, according to a report in the Sunday Business Post. Officials at the Department of Finance are conducting a review of the tax treatment of landlords and are due to deliver a report in the coming months. Their findings will then feed into the tax strategy papers for the upcoming budget. It is understood a tax incentive for so-called 'mom and pop' or small landlords is one of the key measures under consideration and, if implemented, would require the property owner to charge rents a certain percentage below the relevant market rate to qualify for the scheme.
