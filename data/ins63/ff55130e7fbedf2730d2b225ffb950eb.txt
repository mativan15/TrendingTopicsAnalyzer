Would you pay £3 million for Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' football, or would you prefer to bank the money to keep up with your mortgage payments? The ball is being flogged off by the useless referee who failed to spot that the cokehead had used his fist to propel it into the net during that tortuous World Cup quarter-final in Mexico in 1986.Tunisian Ali Bin Nasser, now 78 years old, blamed the Bulgarian linesman for this fairly major error. How he ended up with the ball, which he has kept in a cupboard for the past 36 years, is a moot point.
