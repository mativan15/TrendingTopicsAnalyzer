Zion Williamson said he'd sign a contract extension if the Pelicans offer this offseason: 'Of course, I couldn't sign it fast enough.'

Pelicans lead executive David Griffin said not so fast.

Brian Windhorst of ESPN:

From what I have been told, the Pelicans, at this point, are not willing to offer a full five-year guaranteed deal. And a lot of it is flowing down from ownership. Gayle Benson, the owner, is also the owner of the New Orleans Saints. And I have been told they're going to take a football-style, Saints-style mentality with this contract negotiation.
