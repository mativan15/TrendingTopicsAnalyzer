(Bloomberg) -- Customers of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital Ltd. may recover about 72% of the value of their accounts under a tentative deal for the company to sell itself to FTX US, the digital-asset exchange. Under the arrangement approved by US Bankruptcy Judge Michael E. Wiles on Wednesday, the company can cancel its deal with FTX should it get a higher offer that pays customers more. The sale can't close until Wiles approves Voyager's bankruptcy payout plan, which the Manhattan-based judge may consider in December.
