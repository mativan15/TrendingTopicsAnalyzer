What walks like a crab, is as small as a flea and can be remote-controlled? The latest gee-whiz wireless gizmo designed by robotics engineers.

The walking robot, created to look like a peekytoe crab, is the smallest-ever remote-controlled walking robot, engineers at Northwestern University said. The millimeter-sized robot is revealed in the May 25 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Science Robotics.

Research is experimental now, but the tiny crab robots – they can be made to crawl, twist, bend, turn and jump – could eventually lead to even smaller robots capable of repairs and other work.
