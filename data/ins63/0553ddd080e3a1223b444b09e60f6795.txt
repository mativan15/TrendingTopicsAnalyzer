So much for the Warriors' culture being broken by Draymond Green's punch.
I'd say it's still pretty damn strong, considering that Jordan Poole signed a four-year extension worth up to $140 million on Saturday morning, and then, Saturday afternoon, Andrew Wiggins agreed to a new four-year, $109 million extension.
The two deals bolster the Warriors' title chances for both this upcoming season and years to come.
Poole's deal was market value. The Warriors and Poole's struck a fair balance between past performance and future potential.
