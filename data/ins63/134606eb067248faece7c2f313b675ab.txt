Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Thursday took to Twitter to push back on a report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the senator has been using tax dollars to travel between Washington, D.C., and a Florida vacation home, calling the piece 'the politics of personal destruction.'
'This isn't journalism, it's advocacy,' Johnson said. 'It is a fully coordinated attack by the Dem Party and their allies in the media.'
'When the truth isn't on their side, Dems and MSM media lie, distort, and engage in the politics of personal destruction,' Johnson continued.
