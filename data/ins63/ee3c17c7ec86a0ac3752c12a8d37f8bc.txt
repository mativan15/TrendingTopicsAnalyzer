Over the past two years, the company's public face in government capitals has instead been Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the U.K., who is now Meta's president of global affairs. He has served as a de facto messenger-in-chief, defending the company's political reputation in interviews, blog posts and conversations with policymakers.
'Bringing Nick in was an acknowledgment they needed someone who could speak politics,' said Crystal Patterson, who worked at Facebook for seven years on a variety of political teams before switching to lobby Democrats on Capitol Hill in February.
