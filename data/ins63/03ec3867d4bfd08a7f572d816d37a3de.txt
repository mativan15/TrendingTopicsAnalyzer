'Certain officers of the CBI seized my highly confidential and sensitive personal notes and papers pertaining to the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Information and Technology, of which I am a Member,' said the Congress leader and son of former finance minister P Chidambaram. He added that these included draft notes and questions for summoned witnesses as well as handwritten notes pertaining to the depositions made to the committee by the witnesses.
'Sir, these actions by the CBI, in so far as they relate to interference with my duties as a Parliamentarian, amount to a direct assault upon the democratic principles on which our Parliament is founded,' the MP stated in his letter.
