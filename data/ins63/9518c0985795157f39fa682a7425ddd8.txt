Ballpark Village on Thursday announced that Koibito Poké will open its second St. Louis location in the shopping and entertainment district in early 2023.

The Scottsdale, Arizona-based poké restaurant chain was co-founded by former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, who played for the team from 1996 to 1998. He's the chain's CEO.

Build-out of the 1,500-square-foot, Hawaiian- and Japanese-inspired restaurant's Ballpark Village location will begin this fall, officials said. It will be located adjacent to Bally Sports Live at 601 Clark Ave.
