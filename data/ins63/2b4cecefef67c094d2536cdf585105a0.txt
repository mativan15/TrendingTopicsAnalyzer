In an unforgiving macroeconomic environment that has felled many a portfolio manager, James Abate remains one of the last men standing.While the raging inflation, heightened volatility, and spiraling recessionary fears that have defined markets this year have devastated returns for other investors, Abate — the founder, chief investment officer, and managing director at Centre Asset Management  — has helped his firm's flagship fund beat 99% of its peers so far in 2022.Currently, the Centre American Select Equity Fund (DHAMX) ranks in the top 1% for one-, three-, and five-year trailing returns, according to Morningstar, echoing Abate's stellar performance in 2020, when he also bested 99% of his competitors.
