The Red Sox, Dunkin' Donuts, calling traffic circles 'rotaries' — Boston is known for many great things. Yet, on TikTok these days, the name of this east coast city means one thing and one thing only: the Birkenstock clogs with a rounded toe and a little buckle.

First designed in the late '70s as a colder-weather version of the brand's beloved leather sandals, Birkenstock's Boston clogs have a supportive footbed, a grippy EVA sole and a wide variety of colors and materials. They're historically beloved by art teachers, farmers market attendants and cool hippie dads that wear friendship bracelets, though for the last few months on TikTok they've also become a cult favorite sported by fashionistas, college kids, working moms and seemingly everyone else that wears shoes.
