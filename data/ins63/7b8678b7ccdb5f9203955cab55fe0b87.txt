BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A U.S. senator says a North Dakota farmer arrested in Ukraine on accusations he planned to kill his business partner is no longer behind bars but his status is unclear. Republican Sen. John Hoeven told the Bismarck Tribune for a story published Thursday that Kurt Groszhans is no longer jailed but is still in Ukraine. Hoeven says his office continues to work with the U.S. Department of State and Ukranian officials about Groszhans' treatment and safety. Hoeven's office didn't say how it learned that Groszhans was no longer jailed.
