Like the rest of the world, New Zealand has seen a surge in demand from businesses seeking certification as a B Corporation since the Covid-19 pandemic. Qiulae Wong, Aotearoa New Zealand manager for B Lab, which certifies B Corps, says they are running up against capacity constraints with quite long wait times for certification. New Zealand has 85 certified B Corps, which means they have been verified by B Lab as having high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.
