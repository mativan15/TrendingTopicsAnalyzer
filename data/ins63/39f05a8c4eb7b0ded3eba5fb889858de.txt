As BP PLC (NYSE: BP) makes a multibillion-dollar bet on biogas to support its energy-transition efforts, other majors could look for similar deals in bioenergy, a local expert says.

BP is acquiring Houston-based Archaea Energy Inc. (NYSE: LFG) in a deal valued at approximately $4.1 billion. After integrating Archaea's renewable natural gas and landfill gas-to-energy projects, the London-based energy giant expects its biogas earnings to reach around $2 billion by the end of the decade. BP is anticipating $10 billion in earnings from all of its energy-transition growth businesses by 2030.
