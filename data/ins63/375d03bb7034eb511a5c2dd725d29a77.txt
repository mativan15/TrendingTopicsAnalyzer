Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the BMTC Group Inc. (TSE:GBT) share price return of 14% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.2% in the last year.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
