Nicola Sturgeon has been left red-faced, after Full Fact, a major fact-checking website, highlighted statements made by the First Minister and two other senior SNP politicians. Ms Strugeon, John Swinney and Ian Blackford were found to have made misleading statements about renewable energy in the past month when they all claimed that Scotland gets 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources. To add to the embarrassment, Full Fact noted that they previously corrected a similar statement made by Ms Sturgeon a year ago, which led to the SNP acknowledging the error by correcting material on its website.
