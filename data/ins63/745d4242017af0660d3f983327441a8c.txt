90 Day: The Single Life's Natalie Mordovtseva is questioning where she fits in to her on-again boyfriend Josh Weinstein's life.
 
On Monday night's episode, the Ukrainian native told producers on the series that she was meeting with Josh's ex-wife Candace and the son they share together, Jett. "I'm afraid if they don't like me, it can be [a] breakup point for us," she said.
 
After Josh met up with Natalie, he told her that Candace has a boat and they would be taking part in an outing on the lake.
