Noise-detecting traffic cameras will be trialled in four areas in England in an attempt to crack down on 'boy racers' who rev engines and use illegal exhausts, the Department for Transport has announced.The so-called noise cameras will be installed on the roadside in Bradford on Tuesday, before a rollout in Bristol, Great Yarmouth and Birmingham over the next two months.A video camera will photograph vehicles and several microphones will record sound to help identify road users who break the law by revving their engines unnecessarily or use illegal exhausts as they drive by.
