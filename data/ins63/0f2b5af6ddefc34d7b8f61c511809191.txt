For some of us, squeezing in a workout is a constant struggle — especially since so many workouts are just plain boring. Aviron is seeking to change that with their gamified rowing machines — which offer challenging full-body workouts that feel more like games. In fact, you may recognize several of the games from the arcades of your childhood. (And if those don't keep you interested, you can watch Youtube on the Aviron's 22-inch HD screen while you row, too.) Aviron rowers start at $2,199.This was my first experience with a rowing machine, and I am already a believer.
