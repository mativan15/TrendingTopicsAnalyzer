NEW YORK — For the first time since joining the Big East in 2013, Creighton is the preseason choice to win the conference.

The ninth-ranked Bluejays received eight first-place votes from the league's coaches Tuesday. Creighton returns three double-digit scorers from last season's team that finished 23-12 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.

Coach Greg McDermott didn't put too much stock in the Bluejays' place in the preseason poll.

'It's based off what you did last year and who you return and we return a pretty good core,' he said.
