Stocks may have gone on sale this year, but they're not yet cheap, according to Goldman Sachs.Although the S&P 500 has fallen about 22% in 2022, US stocks are still expensive relative to history on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio basis, wrote David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, in a mid-October note. He noted that since the beginning of the year the index's P/E ratio has contracted from 21x, which was in the 91st percentile since 1980, to 15.8x, which is still in the 66th percentile.
