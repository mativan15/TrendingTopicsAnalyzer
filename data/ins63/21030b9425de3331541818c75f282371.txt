Anthony DiComo@AnthonyDiComoNEW YORK -- Traditionally, Memorial Day is a time for teams to take stock of themselves. The Mets have played 50 games at this point, nearly one-third of a season. That's a large enough sample size to draw some inferences, if not yet conclusions.
• Inference No. 1: The Mets are a good team.• Inference No. 2: The Mets may be a really, really good team.
It's too early to know the second part for certain, but the Mets continue providing evidence to that end. Their 13-5 win over the Nationals on Monday night at Citi Field, which improved their record to 33-17, was thorough enough to be effectively over by the third inning.
