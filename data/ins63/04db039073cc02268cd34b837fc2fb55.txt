As the news, the metrics, and public opinion polls continue to trend badly for the Democratic Party, it becomes clear that they have no Plan B. They have placed no one behind the 'Break glass in case of emergency' window.

Their leadership appears to have lashed themselves to the mast of the 'Woke identity politics before all' ship, with every intention of taking moderate, commonsense-thinking Democrats down with them.

Why?
