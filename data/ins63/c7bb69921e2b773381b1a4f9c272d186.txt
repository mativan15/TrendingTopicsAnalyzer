Episode 5 Act III has finally dropped for Valorant, and players have finally had their chance to try out the game's latest Agent in Harbor. The Indian character was first announced over a week ago, and he is now available to try out in all of your favourite modes. It will be interesting to see how the new Controller will fare in the game's current meta, as players experiment with combinations involving other Agents. 
With all the excitement of a new Act (and Agent), we made some changes and fixed a few bugs.
