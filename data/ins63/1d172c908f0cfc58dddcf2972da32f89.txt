Bruce Bennett Allstate (ALL) stock plunged 12% in Thursday trading after the car and home insurer said it expects to post a Q3 adjusted net loss of $400M-$450M. The main reason for the red ink is an $875M charge it took when re-estimating its prior-year reserve, excluding catastrophes. In addition, catastrophe losses for the quarter were estimated at $763M, pretax. Allstate said the reserve adjustment for personal auto insurance totaled $643M, primarily from bodily injuries coverages. Rising medical costs, increased accident severity, more complex medical treatment, and greater attorney representation led to the higher prior-year reserve estimates.
