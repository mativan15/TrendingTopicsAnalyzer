The principal chief commissioner of income tax (I-T), Geetha Ravichandran, has approached police, claiming that fraudsters, using her name and photo, sent messages to her colleagues and former colleagues on WhatsApp with an intention to dupe them. This is the second instance within one month when WhatsApp hackers targeted a senior I-T officer in Mumbai. Ravichandran, an Indian Revenue Service officer, said in her complaint that on April 26, a day after she took charge at Aaykar Bhavan in Mumbai, she received calls from some of her former colleagues in Chennai.
