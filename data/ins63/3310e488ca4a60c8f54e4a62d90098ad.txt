Disposable vapes "should be banned" due to their damaging effects on the environment, a campaigner has said. Vaping has become increasingly popular in recent years, as people attempt to kick their smoking habits. However, a side effect of this is that a large number of incredibly addictive disposable vapes, which contain valuable lithium, are being discarded on UK streets. An environmental campaigner spoke to Express.co.uk about why she believes that these types of vapes should be banned. Climate PHD student, Laura Young, who styles herself as @LessWasteLaura told Express.
