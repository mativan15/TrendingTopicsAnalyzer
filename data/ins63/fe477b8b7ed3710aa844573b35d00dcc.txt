Bring back licence fees, make them progressive, Oct. 14

I like that Randy Robinson, Ontario director of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, wants to see the licence-plate sticker fee reinstated and made progressive. We'll just have to wait for a progressive government to be elected. There is a snowball's chance in hell that a Conservative cabinet will do that. You see it accomplishes two purposes: It gets you elected and helps shrink government revenues to the point of strangling and eliminating services, such as health care.
