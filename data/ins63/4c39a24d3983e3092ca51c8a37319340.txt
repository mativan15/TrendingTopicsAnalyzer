Jackie, Tony & RyanOct 19, 2022The starting bid for a 15-year-old iPhone on the LCG Auctions site was listed as $2,500, but the now-ancient (in tech years) device ended up going for a whole lot more. Gizmodo reports that the unopened 2007 iPhone, a first-gen 8GB model from the year Apple debuted its smartphone, was sold on Sunday for just shy of $40,000—$39,339.60, to be exact. That particular version sold for $599 when it came out (around $860 adjusted for inflation). CNBC notes the winning bid is more than 50 times the device's original price.
