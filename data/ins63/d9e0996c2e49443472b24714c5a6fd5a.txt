Anthony Joshua's immediate future is taking shape.
The return of the former heavyweight titleholder reportedly has been pushed back to February or March. If he wins that fight, he is expected to face Dillian Whyte in a rematch next summer.
Longtime contender Chris Arreola has said that he has been in contact with Joshua's handlers to be his next opponent. However, Eddie Hearn, Joshua's promoter, insists he hasn't been negotiating with the American fighter.
Otto Wallin also is rumored to be under consideration for early next year.
