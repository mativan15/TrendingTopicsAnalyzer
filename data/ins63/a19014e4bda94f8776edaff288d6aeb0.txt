U.S. stock indexes were mixed after erasing early losses Wednesday morning, as investors welcomed Netflix's surprisingly positive earnings report and monitored a continued rise in Treasury yields. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 551 points, or 1.9%, to 30186, the S&P 500 rose 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.4%. The S&P 500 is up 4% from its 2022 closing low but remains down 22% for the year to date. Stocks struggled out of the gate after back-to-back gains on Monday and Tuesday as worries about stubbornly high inflation counteracted good news on company earnings.
