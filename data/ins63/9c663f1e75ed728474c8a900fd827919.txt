Two weeks earlier, Jyothi Yarraji had suffered the heartache of an illegal tailwind depriving her of an official sub-13 run in the women's 100m hurdles. The Telengana athlete though achieved it again, clocking 12.82secs to win the title at the National Open Athletics Championships in Bengaluru on Monday. Most importantly, a legal tailwind of 0.9m/s means it will be ratified as a national record in due course.The most improved woman athlete of India this season, Jyothi broke her own national record for the fourth time this year, improving on the 13.
