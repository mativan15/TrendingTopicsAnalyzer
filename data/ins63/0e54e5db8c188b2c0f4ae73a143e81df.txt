Just a week after announcing that it had raised $150 million for U.S. expansion, Puttshack announced the opening of one new U.S. location and the planned development of another.

The Chicago-based golf emporium chain said it's leased 29,000 square feet at 1850 Reston Row Plaza in Northern Virginia for a location that's scheduled to open in the summer of 2025.

Puttshack's newest location in Boston's Seaport neighborhood will open on Wednesday. The Boston location at 58 Pier 4 Boulevard occupies two stories and covers more than 26,000 square feet.
