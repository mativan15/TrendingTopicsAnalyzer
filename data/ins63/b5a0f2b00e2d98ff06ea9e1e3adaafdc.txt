Three of Hamilton's mayoral candidates didn't warm to talk of potentially resurrecting debate on whether vehicles should pay tolls for barrelling down the Red Hill Valley and Lincoln Alexander parkways.
Seven years ago, it was the subject of heated debate among city councillors with talk of requisitioning a study on potential levies to diminish traffic on the local roadways suspected to be a favourite shortcut for out-of-town trucks travelling beyond the city.'That is not something that I'm looking at, at this juncture,' former NDP leader Andrea Horwath said during a campaign stop at the Strathcona Market on York Street Thursday.
