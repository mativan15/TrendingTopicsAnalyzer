Jun. 3—CLEVELAND — An Ashtabula man is one of eight people charged Wednesday in a federal indictment accused of selling about 1,350 pounds of cocaine in northeast Ohio.

The U.S. Department of Justice released the 35-page indictment Thursday.

Marc Mahoney, 43, of North Royalton, who investigators said led a group of seven street-level drug dealers, brought cocaine from Mexico and then sold it to local dealers for redistribution. Mahoney made $20 million in cocaine sales from January 2019 to May 2022, according to the indictment.
