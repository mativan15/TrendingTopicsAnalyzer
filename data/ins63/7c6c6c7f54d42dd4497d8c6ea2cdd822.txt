Published: 07:45 EDT, 28 May 2022 | Updated: 09:30 EDT, 28 May 2022 John Aloisi says claiming his first A-League Men silverware as a coach stacks up with any of his memorable Socceroos goals after leading Western United to their maiden championship with a 2-0 grand final win over Melbourne City. The title, which United won from third place, marks Aloisi's first silverware as a coach and stopped City from becoming the first team to complete back-to-back premiership-championship doubles. After finishing 10th last season, United took a gamble on Aloisi, who hadn't coached since 2018 after a rough end to his time at Brisbane Roar and a brutal first job at Melbourne Heart.
