Published: 09:04 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 09:49 EDT, 21 October 2022 A £1 million fundraiser for Poppy Day has been cancelled because of the rail strikes. The Royal British Legion (RBL) said its London Poppy Day event 'will not go ahead as planned' on November 3 due to the action by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union. The RBL says it is now 'urgently considering alternative arrangements to lessen the impact' from the loss of funds on its work with members of the Armed Forces community.
