The Development, Monitoring & Evaluation Office under Niti Aayog will soon start a comprehensive household survey to evaluate the impact and outreach of key central sector schemes (CS) and centrally-sponsored schemes (CSS) amounting to an annual allocation of over ₹11 lakh crore. The exercise is expected to be completed before the next fiscal year following which DMEO will propose the necessary changes to the CS and CSS to prevent leakages and ensure that the scheme benefits go to the targeted individuals, a senior government official told ET.
