Guelph police have arrested a woman they say used a samurai sword to rob someone. Officials say the victim came to the police station to report the incident that happened earlier that day on May 25. Police were told that a woman known to the victim came to their home in the downtown area with a samurai-style sword. She reportedly held the sword to the victim's throat, caused several small cuts, demanded money, and then fled with a small amount. A week later on Wednesday, police say they found a woman at an address on Woolwich Street around 12:30 a.
