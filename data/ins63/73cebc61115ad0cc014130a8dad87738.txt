Kroger Co. unveiled its "store of the future" Thursday, testing the concept in Greater Cincinnati.

Downtown-based Kroger (NYSE: KR) launched the new store concept first at its Monroe store just off Ohio 63 on Heritage Green Drive about a week ago but made it official with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday morning.

The changes involve the way customers check out. The new concept gives customers a variety of options that include a group of Kroger's new high-tech modes of checkout as well as the traditional low-tech methods.
