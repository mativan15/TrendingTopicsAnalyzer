When Cairns student Jodie Mlikota was given a university assignment to build a start-up business that would solve a problem, she had no idea that five years later she would be the CEO of a multinational company.Ms Mlikota grew up in and around the sugarcane fields of Freshwater, attended Cairns State High School and studied at Central Queensland University's (CQU) Cairns campus. Her first job out of university was working at the Taste Port Douglas Food and Drink Festival.While studying at CQU,  Ms Mlikota was given an assignment based on entrepreneurship and thanks to the encouragement of her lecturer, the Gathar app was born.
