The 49ers head into their toughest matchup of the year facing a mountain of adversity on the injury front. That mountain could look more like a molehill if San Francisco can get a couple of their injured stars back though. Head coach Kyle Shanahan on Sunday intimated the team could get defensive end Nick Bosa and left tackle Trent Williams back as early as next week.
Bosa injured his groin during the team's Week 5 win over the Panthers. He missed the first two days of practice in the lead up to Week 6, but got a limited session in Friday before ultimately being listed as ‘questionable.
