Shares of Kohl's (KSS -3.06%) soared in early 2022 on reports that multiple suitors were interested in buying the company at a substantial premium. However, Kohl's stock has tumbled 29% over the past month as investors have grown concerned about the impact of high inflation on the retailer's sales and profitability.
Indeed, Kohl's stock reached a new 52-week low last week following a big earnings miss and guidance cut. Moreover, some bidders appear to have lost interest in buying Kohl's, while others plan to reduce their offers, according to Reuters.
