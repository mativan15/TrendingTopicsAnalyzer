I have only one memory of my father kissing me. I was 18 years old. It happened on the long curved platform of Kent Station, Cork, the night after the All-Ireland hurling final of 1979, when my teammates and I brought the Minor cup home.I can recall almost nothing about the match, but I clearly remember the railway station being packed with giddy people when the train eked itself out of the tunnel and braked to a stop. A pipe and drum band was playing full blast. From the door of the train I saw my father approaching through the crowd.
