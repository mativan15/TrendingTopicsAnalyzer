French officials on Monday continued their centuries-long battle to preserve the purity of the language, overhauling the rules on using English video game jargon.While some expressions find obvious translations – 'pro-gamer' becomes 'joueur professionnel' – others seem a more strained, as 'streamer' is transformed into 'joueur-animateur en direct'.The culture ministry, which is involved in the process, told AFP the video game sector was rife with anglicisms that could act as 'a barrier to understanding' for non-gamers.
