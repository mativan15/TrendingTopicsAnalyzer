Mark Lewis, who wrote and directed one of the most talked about (and disturbing) true-crime docseries in recent memory, is back on Netflix with a new series, 'Vatican Girl: The Disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi.' Like 'Don't F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,' 'Vatican Girl' was produced by British TV production company Raw. The four-part docseries will premiere globally on Netflix on Oct. 20.'Vatican Girl' is the latest probe into a case that started on June 22, 1983, when Emanuela Orlandi, a 15-year-old girl living in Vatican City, disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
