CNN —

After weeks of avoiding the abortion allegations against Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is putting money behind the accusations that have roiled the key race.

Warnock's campaign released a new television ad on Thursday that highlight the allegations that Walker paid for a woman's abortion and encouraged her to have another one. The Republican has repeatedly denied the accusations and CNN has not independently confirmed them.

The ad, titled 'Hypocrite,' contrasts those allegations with Walker's support for abortion bans with no exceptions, something the Republican called for as recently as this summer.
