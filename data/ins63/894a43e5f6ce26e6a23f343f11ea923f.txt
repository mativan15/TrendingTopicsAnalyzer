Two members of climate change group Just Stop Oil scaled the 84m-high masts on the north side of the bridge on Monday to "demand that the government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents".A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil told the PA news agency on Monday evening that the protesters were "all set up" to spend the night on top of the bridge.
