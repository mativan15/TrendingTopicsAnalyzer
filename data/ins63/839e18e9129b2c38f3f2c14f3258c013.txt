Russia is about to shut off its natural gas supplies to Shell's German customers. 
 

 Gazprom
 
 (GZPFY), the Russian state energy giant, said on Tuesday it would suspend natural gas exports to Shell
 
 (SHLX) starting Wednesday because the company had failed to make payments in rubles. 
 

 'Shell Energy Europe Limited has notified Gazprom Export LLC that it does not intend to make payments under the contract for the supply of gas to Germany in rubles,' Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram account.
