A Queens legislator is declaring war on auto body repair shops and rental car companies he claims are gobbling up neighborhood street parking spaces.
Councilman Robert Holden has proposed a law that would target auto body shops, car rental businesses and gas stations who use street parking for the purpose of dropping-off, picking-up, inspecting, storing, repairing, servicing or displaying a vehicle for sale, lease or rent.
The fine for such violations would range between $250 and $400 per day for each violation.
