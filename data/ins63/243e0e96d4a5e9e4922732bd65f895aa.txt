An economic hurricane is on the horizon, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at a Bernstein conference on Wednesday."You know, I said there's storm clouds but I'm going to change it... it's a hurricane," he said, adding that the potential for an imminent economic recession requires preparation by banks.For JPMorgan, that preparation includes conservatively positioning the bank's balance sheet to be ready for any economic shock."You better brace yourself. JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we're going to be very conservative with our balance sheet," Dimon said.
