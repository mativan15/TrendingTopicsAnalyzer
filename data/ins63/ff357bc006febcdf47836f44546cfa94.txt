According to a professor from Queen's University Belfast, there could be savings to be passed on to British households if the Daylight Saving Time change was abandoned.The practice was formally adopted between October 27, 1968 and October 31, 1971 on a trial basis, with advocates claiming it would save energy, reduce traffic accidents, and get people out and about and more active. This year, the clocks will go back an hour on the last Sunday of October at 2am, on Sunday, October 30. However, every year, people debate whether the clocks should still be changed each autumn.
