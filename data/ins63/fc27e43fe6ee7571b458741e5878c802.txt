'When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years,' wrote Sheryl Sandberg on her Facebook page on June 1st. With that the chief operating officer of Meta, the social network's parent company, announced her resignation. The year she joined Facebook made $272m in revenue. Last year turnover reached $118bn. Aside from Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's boss, no one has done more to build the tech behemoth, which boasts more than 2bn users around the world. In 2008 Facebook was in its infancy.
