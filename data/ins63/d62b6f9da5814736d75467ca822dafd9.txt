For social media influencers, success comes in units of thousands and millions – but for many of them that is followers, not pounds.This month, MPs recommended that the government investigate pay standards in the industry as part of a wider review of the influencer market, citing inconsistent pay rates and evidence of a racial pay gap.Influencers and content creators told the Guardian differing stories. Florian Gadsby, 29, posts videos of himself making pottery on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. He says his earnings are inconsistent across the different platforms, although it is not his main form of income (and he also uses the sites to advertise his wares to buyers).
