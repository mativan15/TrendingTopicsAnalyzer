The Wisconsin Humane Society used many of its secret weapons — adorable dogs, puppies and cats — to help raise $550,000 for its operations at its Paws & Claws Gala Saturday. Check out the attached slideshow with photos from the popular fundraiser.

The annual event for the Wisconsin Humane Society at The Pfister Hotel in downtown Milwaukee drew more than 430 Milwaukee-area business executives and featured many animals, including a number of puppies who lined the hallway with volunteer handlers into the reception area.
