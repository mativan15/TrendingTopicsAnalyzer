The new mutual fund window won't be available to all federal employees: It will be open to investors who have at least $40,000 in TSP savings. Further, participants must invest at least $10,000 in these new choices and can't invest more than 25 percent of their holdings in that window. They will pay a $55 annual fee, a $95 maintenance fee and be charged $28.75 per trade. Investors will also pay other fees and expenses that the funds charge, such as the ongoing management fee. The TSP will continue to allow investors to move their money around within current plan funds, meaning they can change the percentage of their holdings in different funds.
