MELBOURNE, May 30 (Reuters) -- Australia's top power producer AGL Energy AGL.AX on Monday ditched plans to split the company and said its chairman and CEO would step down, caving in to opposition from billionaire climate activist and top shareholder Mike Cannon-Brookes.AGL's capitulation comes as the country's biggest carbon emitter faces increasing pressure to speed up the closure of its coal-fired power plants while funding renewable energy projects to ensure the lights stay on in the country's shaky grid.
