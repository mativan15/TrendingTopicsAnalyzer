stockcam After my previous article about how I think that the bottom is in for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), this article aims to provide updates on the company ahead of its 3Q22 results. Investment thesis I have previously written articles on Netflix that can be found here. I continue to have confidence in the investment thesis for Netflix. I think that the expectations and sentiment around the company is particularly negative, and that the market concerns are overblown. I think that Netflix continues to remain attractive given that it has a business model that is expected to generate substantial free cash flows in 2022 and beyond.
