Residents looking for downtown living options will soon have another choice: purchasing a town house.

Johnson Commons, a partnership between Corner Lot Development Group and JWB Real Estate Capital, broke ground on a 91-unit project Tuesday morning in historic LaVilla.

"t's been two to three years in the making," said George Leone, COO of Corner Lot. "We're so thankful to be in this moment and get to see dirt being moved now."

Unlike some of the recent projects in the area, Johnson Commons is unique as it is being developed as a for-sale product, with prices yet to be finalized but expected to be between the "mid-to-high $300,000s" for the 1,800-square-foot residences, developers said at the groundbreaking.
