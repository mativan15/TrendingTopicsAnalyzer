Reiterating a decision made last month, American Airlines will eliminate first-class seats on international flights. American Airlines chief commercial officer Vasu Raja commented on the change In a third-quarter business call on Thursday."First class will not exist on the 777, or for that matter at American Airlines, for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it," Raja said. "The quality of the business class seat has improved so much. And frankly, by removing [first class] we can go provide more business class seats, which is what our customers most want or are most willing to pay for.
