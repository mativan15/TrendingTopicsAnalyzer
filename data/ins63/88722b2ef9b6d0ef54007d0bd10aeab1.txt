There's a reason why Central Perimeter has one of the largest shares of space out of all Atlanta office markets. Companies want to be where their employees are.

'Plain and simple — it's centrally located with improving infrastructure and access to transit,' said Christian Taylor, a director with real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield plc.

Atlanta's Central Perimeter office market, which includes the cities of Dunwoody, Brookhaven and Sandy Springs, has 26.8 million square feet of office space, according to real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.
