Steve Bannon has been given a delayed four-month jail sentence for refusing to cooperate with a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. The former White House adviser to Donald Trump was sentenced on Friday pending an appeal – meaning he will not walk into jail straight away. Mr Bannon was found guilty in July on two counts of contempt of Congress for failing to provide documents or testimony to the House of Representatives committee.A pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and attacked police with batons, sledgehammers and metal pipes in a failed effort to block the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.
