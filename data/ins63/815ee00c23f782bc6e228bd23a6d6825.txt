The Bobby Bones ShowBy Morgan HuelsmanOct 18, 2022Listener Billy decided to play the Mega Millions lottery because of Lunchbox talking about it on the Bobby Bones Show. He's played a few times, but never won anything big. This time when he played with the multiplier thanks to Scuba Steve, he won big time. He told the show through a voicemail that it was the most he's ever won through the lottery and he wanted to split it with Lunchbox since he was the inspiration behind buying the tickets. We spent a week trying to get ahold of him, but it was radio silent.
