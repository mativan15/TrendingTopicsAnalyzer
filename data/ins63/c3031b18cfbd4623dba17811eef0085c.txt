Netflix has been experimenting with a crackdown on password sharing in three Latin American countries, but a new report suggests that the initial trials have been off to a rocky start.Last month, the streaming platform said that it would begin regulating password sharing after it recorded its first subscriber loss in nearly a decade. The company estimated that up to 130 million households around the world use borrowed passwords to access the platform, Newsweek reported in April.CEO Reed Hastings said the platform previously tolerated the practice in order to get more viewers into the system.
