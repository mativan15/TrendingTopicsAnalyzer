NYCstock Snap (NYSE:SNAP) just reported a solid quarter and guided to very conservative Q4 numbers, causing the market to run in fear. The social media company is oddly preparing for a hurricane by announcing another $500 million share buyback. My investment thesis is finally Bullish on the stock following a Bearish view since nearly $60 due to Snap trading based on pending doom I think is unlikely to arrive. Is A Hurricane On The Way? Everyone knows the advertising market is tough with the Federal Reserve aggressively hiking interest rates and the global economy headed into a recession.
