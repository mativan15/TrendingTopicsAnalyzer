NBCUniversal has launched an initiative designed to turn TikTokers into its next generation of television creators.

	The company has launched a Creator Accelerator that features 11 social media creators. The creators, who have over 10M followers on social media, have signed development deals with Universal Studio Group to create original series as part of the program.

	Over the next twelve months, the creators will each have their own NBCUniversal content development mentor to help develop both scripted and unscripted content and they will go through a greenlight process that includes help with pitches.
