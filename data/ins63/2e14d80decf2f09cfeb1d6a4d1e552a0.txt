Twitter Australia paid less than $150,000 in tax in 2021 as a climb in sales and marketing expenses drove the company to a $2 million loss.The social media platform, which is in the middle of a takeover by US billionaire Elon Musk, grew its revenue by 11 per cent to $14.8 million last year, but a rise in costs led to a loss that reduced the size of its tax bill. It is the latest US tech giant to disclose its earnings to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, giving insight into how much money the sector makes locally.
