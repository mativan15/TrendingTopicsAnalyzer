Netflix is all set to stop subscribers from sharing passwords.
 Netflix is all set to crack down on password sharing. The video streaming giant is likely to scrap the password sharing feature by next year. The streaming giant will be adding a surcharge to the subscribers who share their account details with other households. Netflix has been testing this for quite some time now. The streaming service said during its quarterly earnings call on Tuesday that it would start charging additional fees from those who share their login ID and password from 2023.
