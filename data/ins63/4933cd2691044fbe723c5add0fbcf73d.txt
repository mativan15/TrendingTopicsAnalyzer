The Chicago Bulls got off to an impressive start this season with a 116-108 road victory over the Miami Heat. Perhaps what was most surprising about the win was they won without starters Lonzo Ball and Zach LaVine available for the game.

It could be a while before Ball returns to the court as he recovers from arthroscopic knee surgery in late September. LaVine had a similar procedure during the offseason, and despite playing in three of Chicago's preseason games, he was a late scratch for the season opener.
