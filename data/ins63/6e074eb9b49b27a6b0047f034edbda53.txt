Funtay/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is an onshore oil and gas company. According to Devon's sensitivities estimates, the stock is priced at less than 7x free cash flow. Meanwhile, Devon has a capital return program of approximately 8.9% yield via dividends and share repurchases. While I argue that Devon Energy is a compelling investment opportunity, I would like to see Devon be slightly less aggressive with paying down its debt and more aggressive in returning capital to shareholders.
