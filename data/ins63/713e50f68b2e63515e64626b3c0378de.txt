India's government late last month banned the Popular Front of India (PFI) and affiliated organisations for five years, accusing the groups campaigning for Muslim rights of involvement in 'terrorism'.
Authorities also arrested dozens of members of the nine outlawed organisations after conducting raids across the country.
The organisations have denied any links to armed groups and dubbed the action by the Hindu nationalist government a 'witch-hunt'.
Critics have said that little evidence has been provided to tie the groups to violence, adding that the government has been ignoring the violence committed by Hindu far-right groups – a charge the government has denied.
