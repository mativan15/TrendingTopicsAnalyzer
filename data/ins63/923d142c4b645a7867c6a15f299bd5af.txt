Three Tory MPs have called on Liz Truss to quit as pressure grows on the Prime Minister.
MP's Crispin Blunt, Jamie Wallis and Andrew Bridgen have all said the PM should step down, after her disastrous six weeks in government.
Crispin Blunt, MP for Reigate told Channel 4's Andrew Neil Show: ‘I think the game is up and it's now a question as to how the succession is managed.'
He was followed by Andrew Bridgen on Sunday evening, who told the Telegraph: ‘We cannot carry on like this.'
Mr Bridgen, who backed Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer, said: ‘Our country, its people and our party deserve better.
