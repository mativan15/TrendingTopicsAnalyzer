Ottawa police are warning the public of a scam targeting people for money through escort services and dating sites in the capital. In the last month, the number of reports to police involving extortion and threats has doubled. Police say the scammers will engage with a victim through escort services or a dating site, and will ask for a video of them pleasuring themselves. "Once received, the suspect threatens to expose the video to the victim's friends or relatives unless bitcoin or cash is paid," police said in a media release on Wednesday.
