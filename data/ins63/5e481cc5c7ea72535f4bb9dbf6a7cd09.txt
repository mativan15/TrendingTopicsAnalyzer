A U.K. conservative MP has slammed prime minister Liz Truss' administration and its 'inexcusable' handling of a vote on fracking in Parliament, he told BBC News on Wednesday evening.The opposition Labour party brought forward a motion to ban shale gas fracking in the U.K. after Truss' administration vowed to lift the ban to alleviate the energy crisis in the country. The government ultimately won the vote, with 326 votes opposing Labour's motion but the affair in Parliament descended into more chaos than usual on Wednesday evening as more than 40 Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Boris Johnson, abstained from the vote.
