Conservatives have launched new initiatives aimed at removing 'woke politics' from corporate boardrooms as the annual season of shareholder meetings winds down. The projects announced this week include an 'anti-wokeness' webinar, an online index that evaluates companies' diversity of viewpoints and a flurry of shareholder actions. They are the latest in a wide-ranging attack on corporate America's sponsorship of racial equity and transgender policies, deepening a rift between boardrooms and once business-friendly Republicans.
