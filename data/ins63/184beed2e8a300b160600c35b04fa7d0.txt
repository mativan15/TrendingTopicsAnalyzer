Poetic timing: It is 10 years since James Packer met with then NSW premier Barry O'Farrell at the apartment of influential broadcaster Alan Jones to unveil his dream to build a second casino in Barangaroo. If, as anticipated, the $2.5 billion development receives the green light from the government to open the casino as early as Tuesday this week there will be a party but no Packer - jubilation but without James.

What Packer had represented as his gift to hometown Sydney will mean little more to him than a passing interest from his new home in the US.
