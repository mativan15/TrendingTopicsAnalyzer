David Lenihan insists that he does not mind if the employees he funds to study for an executive MBA later move to rivals. 'I'm fine with that possibility, because I believe that the team members in whom we're investing will want to remain with us,' says Lenihan, the chief executive of Tiber Health, which uses virtual learning to train doctors.'And those who do decide to move elsewhere will not only be enthusiastic about referring high-quality individuals to us who can fill their roles; they'll also be eager to partner or collaborate on projects that are mutually beneficial to us and to their new employers,' he adds.
