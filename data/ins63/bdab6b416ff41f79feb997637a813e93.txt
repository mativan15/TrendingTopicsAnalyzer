BEST 3-3 TEAM

Ravens. Ten teams are 3-3. Seven of them are tied for first in their division. Which of these seven is most likely to rise the highest? Baltimore. The Ravens have lost to Buffalo (5-1), the Giants (5-1) and Miami when it had Tua Tagovailoa at his career best. Baltimore led Tua's Dolphins 35-14 in the fourth quarter in Week 2, the Bills 20-10 at halftime in Week 4 and the Giants 20-10 in the fourth quarter on Sunday.

WORST 3-3 TEAM

Seahawks. Who out there thought Geno Smith would be carrying Seattle to a three-way tie for first place in the NFC West through six games? Only Detroit is giving up more points per game than Seattle's 27.
