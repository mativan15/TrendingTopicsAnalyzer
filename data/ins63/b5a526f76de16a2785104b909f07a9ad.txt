Market watchers have been mixed on if, and when, a recession is on the horizon, but hedge fund manager Dan Niles said it is clear that the U.S. economy is headed for one. The U.S. economy has been plagued by a confluence of decades-high inflation and what many expect to be an aggressive rate hike cycle. Meanwhile, most of the U.S. has been seeing just "slight or modest" economic growth over the past two months or so, according to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report released last week. A slew of corporate leaders has also added to the chorus of recession warnings lately.
