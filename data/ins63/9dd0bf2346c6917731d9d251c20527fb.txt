More Video Maria Elena Vizcaino, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) -- Moody's Investors Service slashed Nigeria's rating deeper into junk and placed the nation in review for another downgrade as the government finances deteriorate. The agency cut Nigeria's score by a notch to B3, the sixth lowest score, and on par with Angola and Mongolia. The ongoing fiscal and external weakening could accelerate, hindering the government's capacity to service debt and thereby increase the nation's risk of default, according to a Moody's statement from Friday.
