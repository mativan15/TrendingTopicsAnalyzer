Almost half of the team monitoring compliance with regulations at the Palo Alto offshoot of the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance UAB, reportedly quit this year over concerns that it wasn't giving them the time needed to conduct money laundering checks.

In a "special report" on Monday, Reuters said the turmoil at Binance.US, whose legal name is BAM Trading Services Inc., can be traced back to its relationship with Binance UAB, which the news service said set up the Silicon Valley startup in 2019 as the crypto giant was coming under scrutiny by U.
