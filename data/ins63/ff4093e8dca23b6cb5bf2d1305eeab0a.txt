Dogecoin has launched its blockchain explorer service on Polygon Edge, giving its holders access to Web 3 and DeFi and enabling them to write smart contracts, launch dApps, build blockchain games and even create non-fungible tokens (NFT).
"One of the early adopters of @0xPolygonEdge is rolling closer to the moon every day. #Doge chain is now live #onPolygon. It joins 40+ other projects built using the #PolygonEdge framework," Polygon announced on Twitter.
