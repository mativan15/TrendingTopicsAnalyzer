Plus-size e-tailer Dia & Co. is expanding.

The fashion platform has entered into a deal to acquire fellow plus-size e-tailer 11 Honoré for an undisclosed amount. Like Dia, 11 Honoré — which was founded by Patrick Herning in 2017 — carries a number of brands, including its own label, but at premium to luxury price points. (Think Beyond Yoga to Diane von Furstenberg and everything in between.)

'Patrick and I have met a lot of times in the last couple of years and I think what became very clear was that the offering that we can build together — truly offering our customers everything from Madewell to Carolina Herrera in one place — is in a very fundamental way (and I say this speaking as both a plus-size consumer and the CEO of a plus-size business) the ultimate dream shopping experience come true,' Nadia Boujarwah, cofounder and chief executive officer of Dia & Co.
