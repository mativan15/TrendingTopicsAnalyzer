Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker admitted Sunday that he gave his ex-girlfriend a check for $700 that she claims was used to pay for an abortion — but denied knowing anything about the procedure.
Walker, who maintains that he is 'a Christian' and 'pro-life,' has been roiled by charges by his ex that he both urged her to have and paid for the procedure in 2009.
'It's a lie,' the former University of Georgia football star told NBC News in an interview that aired on Monday. 'You want me to answer something that's a lie, and everyone's trying to trick me and make me respond.
