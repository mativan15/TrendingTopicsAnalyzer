Spain's draft bill on gender self-identification has divided the government, with the ruling Socialist party raising concerns that it could 'erase women'.Popularly known as la ley trans (the trans law), the bill would allow people legally to change their name and gender without the present need for a medical report or a requirement to undergo two years of hormone treatment. Anyone aged 16 and over would be allowed to request the change without parental consent. Children aged 14 and above would need parental consent and those aged 12 and above would need to secure authorisation from the courts.
