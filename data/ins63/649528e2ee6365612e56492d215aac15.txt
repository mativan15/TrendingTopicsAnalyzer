WhatsApp may soon bring a feature that will let you edit sent messages, just like iPhone iMessage after the iOS 16 update.
 Apple recently rolled out its latest iOS 16 version for all iPhone users, which rolled out a bunch of nifty features. One of them is a boon for those who make frequent typos or even send messages accidentally. With the arrival of iOS 16, iPhone users can make changes to sent messages and even unsend the message itself. Now, WhatsApp is on way to bring a similar feature. WhatsApp's update tracker, WabetaInfo has confirmed that WhatsApp is now working on bringing the ability to edit messages in a future update of the Desktop app.
