TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - Denso Corp (6902.T), Japan's largest auto supplier, was bullish about its prospects in a business presentation on Wednesday as demand for automotive chips expands and it tackles semiconductor shortages that have frustrated Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), its biggest shareholder and customer.Chief Technology Officer Yoshifumi Kato said Denso expects demand for auto chips to be around a third higher by 2025 than it was in 2020, as the key component is increasingly used in fossil-fuel cars, electric vehicles and autonomous drive technology.
