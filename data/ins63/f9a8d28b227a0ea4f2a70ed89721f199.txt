Published: 03:24 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 05:09 EDT, 17 October 2022 Two Just Stop Oil protesters have climbed to the top of a major road bridge linking Essex and Kent, forcing police to close it to traffic. Essex Police said officers were called shortly before 3.50am on Monday to a report that two people had climbed on to the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Dartford Crossing and were 'currently at height'. Just Stop Oil said in a statement that two supporters of the group had scaled the structure 'to demand that the Government halts all new oil and gas licences and consents'.
