Abuja, Nigeria – In February 2019, Eat'n'Go, the Nigerian franchisee of popular pizza maker Domino's, introduced a miniature version of the pizza boxes the market was familiar with, for 550 naira ($1.50).
Smaller in size and far cheaper than the medium-sized pizza which costs N3,900 ($9), this new version was designed to be affordable for everyone.
It was a necessary decision given the economic instability at the time, CEO Patrick Michael told Al Jazeera.
'The Nigerian market is diverse, and the potential for profit remains high,' he said.
