Tilda Swinton has quit Adam McKay's adaptation of Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.
The film scooped four accolades during the 2020 Oscars ceremony, being the first non-English language film to win the best picture prize in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.
Succession's McKay is helming the English language limited series, which is set to launch on HBO with six, hour-long episodes. 
It was reported that Tilda had joined the cast with Mark Ruffalo in talks to play the male lead.
‘I don't think I'll be a part of it, but I'm very happy to be a cheerleader,' Tilda revealed to Variety.
