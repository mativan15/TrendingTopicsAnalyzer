The Biden administration apparently wants SpaceX to support the anti-government protests in Iran – by providing Starlink satellite broadband to the Mid-East nation after its religious rulers restricted internet access.
The uprising began mid-September after a 22-year-old Iranian woman was arrested and reportedly beaten to death for not wearing a hijab. The ensuing civil unrest was followed by a brutal crackdown by Tehran on its own people, resulting in more than 200 deaths. 
The Iranian government has shut down internet access across several regions of its country in an attempt to block social media and communications.
