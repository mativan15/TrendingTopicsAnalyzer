It hasn't been the best quarter for Argo Blockchain plc (LON:ARB) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 19% in that time. But that doesn't displace its brilliant performance over three years. Over that time, we've been excited to watch the share price climb an impressive 662%. As long term investors the recent fall doesn't detract all that much from the longer term story. The only way to form a view of whether the current price is justified is to consider the merits of the business itself.
