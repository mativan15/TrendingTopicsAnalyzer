A controversial former owner of Comet, the defunct electricals chain, is among the suitors vying to take control of Matalan, the value-based retailer.Sky News understands that OpCapita, which is led by Henry Jackson, is expected to table an indicative proposal to buy Matalan before a bid deadline on Friday.
OpCapita attracted opprobrium a decade ago when it briefly owned Comet, saw it collapse and then recouped tens of millions of pounds even as taxpayers were saddled with a £70m bill.Since then, it has expressed interest in buying British retailers including Homebase and Majestic Wines, although its solitary current UK-based investment is The Football Pools.
