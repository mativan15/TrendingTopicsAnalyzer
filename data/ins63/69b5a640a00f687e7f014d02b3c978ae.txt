The United States further expanded sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, with targets including prominent Russian government officials and business leaders with close ties to President Vladimir Putin.
Among those designated is an oligarch who heads a major steel producer, a yacht management company, the spokeswoman for the country's foreign ministry and a cellist the US Department of the Treasury says acts as a middleman for the Russian leader.
The US will continue 'to impose severe costs' on Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday in a statement.
