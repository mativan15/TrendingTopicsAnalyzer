 Focus: HOPEDetroit, Michigan 2:02 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Governor Whitmer.  I — we really have a — a champion in Governor Whitmer, in terms of making real the promise of all that we have achieved so far when I think about it in the context of the work that we have done through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, the work that we are doing because of the CHIPS and Science Act, and, as the governor mentioned, also the Inflation Reduction Act.    This work, which will culminate in over $10 billion coming to the state of Michigan, will only be real, it will only hit the streets and — and directly uplift and impact the people when we have partners like Governor Whitmer who are so committed to the people of Michigan and to seeing it through, to working through the details of what is necessary to promote and support the kind of work like what is happening here.
