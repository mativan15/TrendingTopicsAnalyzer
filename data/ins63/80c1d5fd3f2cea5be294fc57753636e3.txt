Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes were teamed up together at 'The Match' last week because of one moment: 13 seconds.
In last year's playoffs, Allen's Bills lost to Mahomes' Chiefs in a back-and-forth showcase. One for the history books.
After the golf outing on TNT where Mahomes and Allen lost to Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers, a roundtable chat featuring all four QBs ensued. During that, Mahomes and Allen reflected on what took place after Mahomes won that postseason football game.
The two shared an embrace that both recalled fondly.
