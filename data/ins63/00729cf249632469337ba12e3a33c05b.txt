Harley-Davidson Inc.'s top executive Jochen Zeitz on Monday said the company will 'repurpose' its historic 500,000-square-foot headquarters on Milwaukee's west side later this year, but didn't provide specifics for the plan he referenced in an interview with Bloomberg.

The statements by Harley-Davidson's (NYSE: HOG) chairman, president and CEO may send shockwaves through Milwaukee's political, commercial real estate and business leadership. The city suddenly could encounter a de-emphasis of a major landmark and economic force in a city of Milwaukee neighborhood facing economic and social challenges.
