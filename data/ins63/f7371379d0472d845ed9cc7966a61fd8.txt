Considering Gangs of London season one kicked off with Sean Wallace (Joe Cole) dangling a burning man off a London skyscraper, it's no surprise season 2 features an equally jaw-dropping moment.
We join the blood-thirsty criminals operating in the capital's underbelly following the complete disintegration of the Wallace empire, with new mob bosses The Investors in charge.
But it appears the murder and all the bloodshed gets too much for Alex Dumani's (Paapa Essiedu) conscience as, rather than continue to fight for power against rival gangs, he jumps off an office block building.
