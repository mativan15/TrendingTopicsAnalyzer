Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a "super bad feeling" about the economy – so much so that he's directing company executives to freeze hiring and cut staff, according to an internal email seen by Reuters. In the email reportedly titled "pause all hiring worldwide," Musk said Tesla needs to cut its staff by around 10%, or the equivalent of about 10,000 jobs.
