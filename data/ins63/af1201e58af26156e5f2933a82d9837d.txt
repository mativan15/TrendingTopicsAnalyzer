My children read the entire Harry Potter series of books by J.K. Rowling long ago, and their review said Rowling did an awesome job of universe-building. In the HP movies, however, her characters seem to have been turned into stereotypes. Then came her crime fiction, written under a thinly veiled pseudonym (the copyright is in her real name), that became a series of novels featuring the detective Cormoran Strike.  The Ink Black Heart is the latest instalment in the series starting with  The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), and at 1,012 pages, it is formidable.
