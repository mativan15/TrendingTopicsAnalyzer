South Africa's energy provider Eskom will continue Stage 3 nationwide load shedding until further notice. The utility company issued a statement Oct. 20 indicating that the continued load shedding was due to a delay in bringing generating units at several power stations back online, as well as breakdowns of units at Kusile and Komati power stations. Stage 3 load shedding was originally slated to end at 05:00 Oct. 21.

Temporary commercial and communications disruptions are possible while load shedding and unscheduled interruptions are taking place.
