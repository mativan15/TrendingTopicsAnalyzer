[Note: BBBY fiscal year ends February]

After a massive 54% decline in the last six months, at the current price of around $8.50 per share, we believe Bed Bath & Beyond stock (NASDAQ: BBBY), the home goods retailer, could still go down. BBBY stock has declined from around $18 to $8.50 since the beginning of 2022, much steeper than the 11% decline in the S&P index. This stock decline can be attributed to the current macroeconomic environment and the company's poor financial performance. The retailer saw its sales decline 15% year-over-year (y-o-y) in fiscal 2021.
