After days of political turmoil, Prime Minister Liz Truss took to the Downing Street podium to declare to the nation that she was standing down from her role. She noted that she would stay in her role until a successor was found. It marked the end of a bruising few weeks for her, only having been introduced as Prime Minister in September 6. While her time in office saw some of the world's most difficult events — the death of Queen Elizabeth II, renewed efforts by Russia in its war against Ukraine — her premiership will likely be remembered for the multiple disastrous U-turns she was forced to make.
