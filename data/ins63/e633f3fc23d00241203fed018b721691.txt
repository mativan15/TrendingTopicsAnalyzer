In an embarrassment to BJP in Bihar, one of its MLAs has been accused of hurting Hindu sentiments by pointing out that even those who did not worship Goddess Lakshmi and Saraswati and Lord Hanuman, were not denied the attributes that the worship of these deities was expected to bestow. Lalan Paswan, who represents Pirpainti assembly seat in Bhagalpur district, while announcing his decision not to hold a feast in the memory of his mother who died last week, purportedly rationalised that those who do not worship these Hindu deities, still enjoyed wealth, education and power.
