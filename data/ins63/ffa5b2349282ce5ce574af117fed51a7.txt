Published: 12:36 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 12:36 EDT, 21 October 2022 Treasurer Jim Chalmers is putting the finishing touches to his first budget which he says will deliver on Labor's election promises while being "sensible and suited to difficult times". While the Morrison government handed down an early budget in March, the election win for Anthony Albanese's Labor team on May 21 meant it was not delivered. Since the election, Dr Chalmers and Finance Minister Katy Gallagher have been plugging "wasteful" coalition government promises into their calculators.
