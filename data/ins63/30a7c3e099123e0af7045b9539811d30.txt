S. Korea's sovereign wealth fund posts US$28.4 bln loss this year SEOUL, Oct. 19 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's sovereign fund posted US$28.4 billion in losses in the first eight months of this year as global stock and bond markets suffered turmoil, and the fast-weakening local currency resulted in a decline in the valuation of its offshore holdings, its chief said Wednesday. In a parliamentary audit, Jin Seung-ho, head of the Korea Investment Corp. (KIC), said the fund's return on investment had declined to minus 13.
