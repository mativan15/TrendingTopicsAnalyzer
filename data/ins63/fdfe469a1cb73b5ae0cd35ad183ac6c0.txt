'It's tough to say,' said rightfielder Aaron Judge, who is 1–for–8 in the American League Championship Series.

'I'm at a loss for words right now,' said outfielder Matt Carpenter, who is 0-for-5 with five strikeouts.

'I think we're gonna go into this off day and kind of take a step back, take a breath and reflect on what we need to really work on and adjust to get going again,' said catcher Kyle Higashioka, who is 0–4 with four strikeouts.
