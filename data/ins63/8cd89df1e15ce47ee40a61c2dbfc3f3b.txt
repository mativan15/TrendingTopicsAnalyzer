Contraband cellphones are invaluable to inmates, but in the hands of Arthur Lee Cofield, who is serving a 14-year sentence for armed robbery at a Georgia state prison, a mobile phone turned out to be worth $11 million, federal prosecutors said.From the prison in Butts County, about 45 miles south of Atlanta, Cofield called Charles Schwab Corp. in June 2020 and impersonated a billionaire named S.K., who was later identified as Sidney Kimmel, according to a federal indictment.Cofield spoke with a company representative about opening a checking account.
