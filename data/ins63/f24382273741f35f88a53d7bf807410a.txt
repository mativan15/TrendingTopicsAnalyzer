A SPAC that counts former US House Speaker Paul Ryan as chairman became the latest vehicle to be bailed on by investors who want their money back.

Executive Network Partnering Corp. saw roughly 95% of its investors opt to swap their shares for $10 when they voted on a tie-up with oil and gas company Granite Ridge Resources Inc. The deal will leave a little more than two million of the initial 41 million shares outstanding ahead of the merger's closing.
