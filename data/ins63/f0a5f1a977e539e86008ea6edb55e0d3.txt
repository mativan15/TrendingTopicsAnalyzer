Win McNamee After the release of a somewhat mixed Q3 earnings report, Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares closed at $208.16 (down ~6.25%) in the after-hours session. In Q3, Tesla's non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 came in slightly ahead of street estimates; however, Tesla missed on the top-line with revenue coming in at $21.45B (est. $21.98B, ~2% (or $500M) miss) and auto gross margin of 27.8% (est. 28.5%) also fell short of expectations. Further, Tesla reported an operating margin of 17.2% for Q3 on the back of strong operating leverage, which was somewhat offset by FX and Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin ramp-ups.
