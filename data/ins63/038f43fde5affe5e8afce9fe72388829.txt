HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii an Airlines will operate 10 cargo planes for Amazon.com starting next fall under a deal that could eventually involve more planes and give Amazon a 15% stake in the airline.

The airline's parent company, Hawaiian Holdings Inc., said Friday that it will fly and maintain an 'initial fleet' of 10 leased Airbus A330-300 jets for the retail giant. The fleet could grow 'depending on Amazon's future business needs,' the company said.

Hawaiian said it issued warrants that Amazon can exercise over the next nine years and acquire up to 15% of Hawaiian stock.
