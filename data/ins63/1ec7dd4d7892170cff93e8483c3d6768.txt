Dr Kambiz Boomla (Letters, 2 June) says: 'I am not a Christian, but my understanding of Christian theology is that confession comes before forgiveness.' I am a Christian priest, and my understanding of Christian theology is the exact opposite – that forgiveness comes before confession. According to Luke 23:34, Jesus said, even as he was being crucified: 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' God's forgiveness, at least, is not 'earned' by confession, but is always freely available.
