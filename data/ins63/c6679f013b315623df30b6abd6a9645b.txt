(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's quarterly report on Wednesday will likely show whether the Elon Musk-led electric-vehicle maker is facing any weakness in demand that is starting to weigh on the wider auto industry.

Decades-high inflation, rising energy bills in Europe and signs of a weakening China market have raised doubts among some analysts about whether Tesla can buck an economic slowdown and continue to raise prices without hurting its sales.

Although Musk has said Tesla "does not have a demand problem", the company's latest report on deliveries showed that it made 22,000 more EVs than it delivered to customers in the third quarter.
