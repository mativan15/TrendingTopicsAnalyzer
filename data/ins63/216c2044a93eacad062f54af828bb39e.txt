The demand for industrial space is still strong in South Florida, but rising interest rates have made it more expensive for investors to buy or build warehousing properties, a CBRE broker told the Business Journal.

Tom O'Laughlin, an executive director at the South Florida office of CBRE Group (NYSE: CBRE), said interest rate hikes have slowed the pace of new industrial space development and may effect value in the future.

"The money everyone uses to construct the buildings, to buy the buildings is more expensive than it was previously," said O'Laughlin, who specializes in industrial properties.
