Jamie Carragher believes that Newcastle could pose a 'big problem' for Arsenal, tipping Eddie Howe's side to soon challenge for the Champions League places.Powered by significant spending in January after the completion of the Saudi-backed takeover of the club, Newcastle enjoyed a strong end to the Premier League season, climbing out of a relegation battle to eventually finish 11th.The summer transfer window is likely to provide opportunity for further recruitment as Howe plots continued growth at St James' Park.
