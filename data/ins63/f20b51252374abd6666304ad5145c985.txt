Despite being more than 4,000 miles and an entire ocean away, San Antonio leaders have set their sights on Europe as a target ripe for corporate and travel recruitment.

Multiple San Antonio groups are aligning to launch the courtship that will coincide with the Alamo City's heightened push for expanded international airline access.

'For the first time ever, in November Visit San Antonio will be opening an office in Europe,' Marc Anderson, the organization's president and CEO said.

The office, which will serve as a recruiting hub for San Antonio's outreach efforts, will be in London.
