Big pharma Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) formally opened its second Gateway Labs facility Tuesday in South San Francisco

The first Gateway Labs — fittingly in another Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. property on Gateway Boulevard — totaled 65,000 square feet. The second site, at 201 Haskins Way, doubles the incubator's space. But the company, whose Loxo at Lilly cancer R&D unit also resides in the Haskins Way building, reportedly is on the hunt for 300,000 square feet in the Bay Area.

We sat down with Lilly Chairman and CEO Dave Ricks to talk about innovation, real estate, the company's recent acquisition of a hearing loss gene therapy company and its future in biotech hubs like the Bay Area.
