Expect innovation and collaboration to take center stage at Lowe's Tech Hub in South End.

Mooresville-based Lowe's Cos. Inc. (NYSE: LOW) recently opened the $153 million, 25-story tower at 100 W. Worthington Ave. Its 367,000-square-foot space can house up to 2,000 employees — about half of which have been hired to date.

'Our biggest asset remains our associates — and what the building does is it enables them to do their best work,' says Seemantini Godbole, executive vice president, chief digital and information officer for Lowe's.
