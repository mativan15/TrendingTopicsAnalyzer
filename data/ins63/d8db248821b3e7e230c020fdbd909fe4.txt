CNN hopes it can warm people up to its new morning program. The Warner Bros. Discovery-backed outlet has released a suite of fresh promos for 'CNN This Morning' that show hosts Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlin Collins hanging out over coffee, a first look at the trio and their chemistry as the network bets on a new A.M. format to help vie more competitively in one of the most competitive time periods for TV news. 'We want familiarity in the morning,' says Ryan Kadro, the CNN development executive who has been working on the program.
