Nazem Kadri reached the pinnacle, then he left the group chat.

Kadri was an instrumental part of the Colorado Avalanche's 2022 Stanley Cup victory, recording the best individual season of his career with 87 points before averaging nearly a point per game in the postseason. In an ideal world, there would be no reason to leave, but the Avalanche couldn't afford Kadri's price tag, so he decided to head to their primary threat in the Western Conference.

Kadri inked a seven-year, $49-million contract with the Flames in August, effectively signing a lifetime deal as the new pact keeps him in Calgary through his age-39 season.
