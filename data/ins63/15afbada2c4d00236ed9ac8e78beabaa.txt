ANKARA, Turkey — Kazakhstan and Turkey have signaled plans to develop 'long-term strategic cooperation' that would involve the co-production of satellites and other space systems.

The agreement came as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Kazakhstan on Oct. 16 with his chief defense procurement official, Ismail Demir, who stopped by the Central Asian country's national space center.

Demir, who leads the government's Presidency of Defence Industries, met with Mussin Bagdat, Kazakhstan's minister for digital development, innovation, space and aviation.
