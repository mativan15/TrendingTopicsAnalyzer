ITV's share price spiked today following news the UK network is considering selling part of its production and sales arm ITV Studios.

	Shares are trading at 66.9p, having closed at 61.4p (0.69¢) a share on Friday. This follows a report in the Financial Times that claims the Love Island owner was mulling its options and would entertain selling part of ITV Studios to jumpstart its share price, which has been tanking this year, down nearly 37%.

	The FT reported ITV has already fielded expressions of interest in the division, which is also behind the likes of Bodyguard, I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! and popular British soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale.
