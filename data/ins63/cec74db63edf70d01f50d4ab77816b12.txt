'Kwasi is a very nice man but he was out of his depth as Chancellor,' says one member of Staines Conservative Club of their local MP's brief tenure in 11 Downing Street.This view is repeated by others, both at the club and among non-Tory voters in Kwasi Kwarteng's Surrey constituency of Spelthorne, two days after he was sacked as Chancellor by his close friend and ideological ally Liz Truss.Peter Andrews, 61, adds that despite viewing Mr Kwarteng as being 'out of his depth', he still thinks he was 'thrown under the bus by Liz Truss'.
