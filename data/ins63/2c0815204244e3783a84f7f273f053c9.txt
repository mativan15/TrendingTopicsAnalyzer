INGLEWOOD, Calif. — For one quarter, Russell Wilson and the Denver Broncos offense appeared to have turned things around.

Wilson was a perfect 10-of-10 passing for 116 yards and tossed a 39-yard touchdown to rookie tight end Greg Dulcich. The Broncos stormed out to a 10-0 first-quarter advantage. Then the offense started to unravel and revert back to what we've seen from them the previous five games.

Wilson completed just five passes after the first quarter as the Broncos lost 19-16 Monday night in overtime to the Los Angeles Chargers.
