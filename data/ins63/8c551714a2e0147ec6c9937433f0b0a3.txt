Eddie Redmayne's children aren't that impressed by his acting career. So he was caught off guard when his six-year-old daughter asked him if he was a wizard. Though she has never seen any of the 'Fantastic Beasts' movies, in which Redmayne stars as Ministry of Magic employee Newt Scamander, she had just caught a bit of a trailer. Redmayne tells Variety‘s Awards Circuit Podcast that he wasn't sure how to respond. 'That's one of those moments in life where, partly you want to be the cool dad and go, ‘Yeah, I'm a wizard!' and the other part of you doesn't want to lie to your children and set them off in the wrong direction,' Redmayne recalls.
