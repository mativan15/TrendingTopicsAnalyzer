 Kylie Jenner has reflected on having the ‘baby blues' after giving birth to her second child. The make-up mogul welcomed baby number two with Travis Scott at the beginning of this year, but has yet to confirm their son's name after changing it from Wolf. Following his arrival, the 25-year-old spoke candidly about struggling with postpartum, revealing that she had found her experience ‘very hard'. In the new episode of the Kardashians, on Hulu, she could be seen discussing the tough period with her older sister, Kendall Jenner.
