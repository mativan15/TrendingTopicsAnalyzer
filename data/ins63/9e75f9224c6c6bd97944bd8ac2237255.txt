ivanastar Back in 1990, seventh graders at the St. Agnes School in Arlington, Massachusetts, were asked to put together a portfolio of stocks for a model portfolio. The goal was to see if they could beat the brightest minds on Wall Street. The rule was that they had to pick companies whose products they could readily explain to the class.
