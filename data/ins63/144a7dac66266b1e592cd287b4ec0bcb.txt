A federal appeals court on Friday temporarily halted President Biden's student debt relief plan, preventing the government from moving forward with the debt cancellation it had said could start as early as next week.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted a temporary stay in response to an appeal filed by six attorneys general from Republican-led states after a district court judge dismissed their case on Thursday for lack of standing.

The ruling puts any debt cancellation on hold until the court can rule on the states' request for an injunction preventing the government from discharging debts.
