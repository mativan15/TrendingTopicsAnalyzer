On Cuomo Monday, rapper Kanye West doubled down on the anti-Semitic sentiment he's espoused as of late. Ye's Twitter account was locked in response to an anti-Semitic tweet he posted, and anti-Semitic comments were reportedly edited out of a recent interview he did with Fox News's Tucker Carlson. On Monday, Ye offered the media uproar about him wearing a White LIves Matter t-shirt as a legitimate reason for his slander against the Jewish community. 'When I wore the White Lives Matter t-shirt, the Jewish underground media mafia already started attacking me,' Ye said, before referencing canceled concerts, and public tiffs with Pete Davidson and Trevor Noah.
