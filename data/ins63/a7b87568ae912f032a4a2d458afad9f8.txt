(Bloomberg) -- India's Congress party elected its first leader from outside the Nehru-Gandhi family in over two decades, but the move is unlikely to help the already decimated party pose a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 general election.Some 9,000 delegates voted in the election to pick veteran lawmaker Mallikarjun Kharge, 80, as party president. He defeated diplomat-turned-politician Shashi Tharoor, the head of the party's election authority said Wednesday.  The Congress party is struggling to reclaim lost ground after suffering its worst-ever defeat in the 2014 elections that brought Modi to power.
