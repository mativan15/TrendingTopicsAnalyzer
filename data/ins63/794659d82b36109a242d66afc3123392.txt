"Since founding, DynaRisk has been at the forefront of mitigating risk for personal and commercial cyber insurers, reinsurers and MGAs" said CEO Andrew Martin. "Being able to offer our clients new ways to protect their policyholders in this increasingly fraught cyber landscape is central to our mission. We couldn't be happier to have the backing of our investors to continue growing our product suite."

DynaRisk partners with clients like Chubb, Canopius, Hiscox, Ascot and BOXX Insurance to improve loss ratios while engaging insureds and streamlining renewals.
