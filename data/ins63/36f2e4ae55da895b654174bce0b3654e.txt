Alyssa Healy is likely to lead Australia in the tour of India in December after the star wicketkeeper-batter was named the vice-captain of the women's team on Thursday. Healy takes over from Rachael Haynes, who retired from international cricket last month. With World Cup-winning captain Meg Lanning still on her indefinite break, Healy could be donning the skipper's cap for the team's upcoming assignments that include five T20s in India before the home series against Pakistan and the T20 World Cup in South Africa next year.
