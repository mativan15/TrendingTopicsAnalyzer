Hours after Liz Truss announced to the nation that she was resigning as Prime Minister, Newsnight aired on BBC Two, hosted by Victoria Derbyshire.
In a moment that's been described as ‘unexpected', ‘iconic' and ‘brutal', the programme began with a video montage looking back on Ms Truss' historically short tenure in office.
To rub even more salt into the wound, the compilation of clips was set to the tune Take a Bow by Rihanna, with lyrics including ‘you look so dumb right now' and ‘don't tell me you're sorry ‘cause you're not'.
