ATHENS (Reuters) -Aegean Airlines, Greece's largest carrier, reported a smaller loss in the first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, as passenger traffic recovered from pandemic travel restrictions. Aegean, a member of the Star Alliance airlines group, reported a net loss of 38.5 million euros ($41.22 million) in the January-to-March period compared to a loss of 44.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Chief Executive Dimitris Gerogiannis said the airline managed to shrink its loss in the first quarter despite the doubling of fuel costs compared to 2019 and the prevalence of the Omicron variant.
