There was yet another late rally by the opponent, but after a phenomenal start by Jake Bennett, the Sooners held off the Texas Tech Raiders and won 6-3. OU will move on to the Big 12 semifinal to face the winner of the Texas Tech-Kansas State game. The Raiders and Wildcats will play on Friday and the winner of that game will play the Sooners on Saturday.
Redshirt Sophomore Jake Bennett pitched an absolute beauty. 7.2 innings of two hit, one run ball. The lefty gave the Sooners the pitching they needed to upset the 2-seed Red Raiders and move on with that loss still in their back pocket if they end up needing it.
