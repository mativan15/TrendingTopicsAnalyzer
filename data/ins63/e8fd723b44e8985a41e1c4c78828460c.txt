 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said if the Aam Aadmi Party is voted to power in Gujarat, it will build a government school at every four kilometres in eight cities within a year. Mr. Sisodia, who was on Monday questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for more than nine hours with the Delhi Excise policy scam case, also said he is ready for everything, even to go to jail, but the construction of schools will not stop in Gujarat.
