The trial of the man accused of killing Kristen Marti four years ago and dumping her body in a San Luis Obispo creek got underway Wednesday with opening statements and the first witness testimony.

Robert Koehler, 40, of Arroyo Grande is accused of slashing Marti's throat and weighing her body down with rocks in a flowing Prefumo Canyon creek in January 2018. He is charged with one count of murder with a sentencing enhancement for using a deadly weapon — a knife. Koehler entered a not guilty plea to the crime in June 2018.
