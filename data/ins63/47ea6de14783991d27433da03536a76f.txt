I can't help feeling sorry for Donald Trump. A man of such selfless kindness and generosity, he has done so much for so many and gotten so little appreciation. Like the Jews. Look at all he's accomplished for Israel. No one has done more. So much, in fact, that the Israeli people would easily elect him prime minister.

At least that's what he told us Sunday in a posting on his failing oxymoronic Truth Social site, which was later posted on Twitter, where he's banned from direct posting. His lament came with a threat.
