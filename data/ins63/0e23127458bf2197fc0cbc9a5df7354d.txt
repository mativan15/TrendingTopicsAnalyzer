As the Nets tip off the season Wednesday, they have a lot to prove. And arguably none of them have more proving to do than Kyrie Irving.
The All-Star point guard is a lightning rod, for better or worse. Last year was for worse, Irving's absence hurting Brooklyn's season and his contract drama unsettling their summer. Now present and motivated coming into opening night against New Orleans, this year he hopes it's for the better.
'[Irving] is bringing a totally different energy this year. He's definitely been locked in.
