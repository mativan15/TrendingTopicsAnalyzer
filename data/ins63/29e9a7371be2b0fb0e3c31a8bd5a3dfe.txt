DEAR DEIDRE: I CONTACTED you when my fiancé's family were making my life hell.
They hated me when we first met four years ago and tried to turn him against me.
You made me see we were dealing with narcissists who were never going to change
For more Dear Deidre content, and to meet the team behind the infamous agony page, follow us on: 
I'm 38 and he's 40. 
They accused me of being manipulative, of cheating and of being money-grabbing.
My partner always took my side. He knew what they were like.
