They say classical music is good for your health. Sir Robert Mayer would be inclined to agree. The co-founder of the London Philharmonic Orchestra lived until the age of 105 and spent decades championing British music, especially amongst the younger generation.
Sir Robert was born in Germany in 1879 and nurtured a passion for music from an early age, although was encouraged by his brewer father to pursue business. 
He arrived in London in 1896 and although he continued musical studies on the side, the next two decades were preoccupied by his career in banking and serving in the British Army during the First World War.
