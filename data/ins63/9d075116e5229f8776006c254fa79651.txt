After a mass shooting at Santa Fe High School in May 2018, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick responded by suggesting 'too many entrances and too many exits' played a role.

Almost exactly four years later, Patrick made the same argument after the massacre in Uvalde, Texas.

'We can do a lot of things, and Texas has done a lot of things after the Santa Fe shooting. Obviously we have to do more. We have to harden these targets so no one can get in ever except from one entrance,' Patrick, a Republican, said on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight" just hours after the elementary school shooting.
