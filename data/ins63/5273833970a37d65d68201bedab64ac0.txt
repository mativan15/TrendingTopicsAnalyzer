According to the nonprofit Kids and Cars, 23 children died last year of heat stroke from being left in a hot car. Automakers have rolled out a number of different systems in order to combat these tragic situations, and Toyota's latest concept takes it one step further in the hopes of eliminating these kinds of deaths once and for all.Toyota Connected this week unveiled its Cabin Awareness concept. It relies on millimeter-wave radar to detect small movements in the cabin in order to determine whether or not a living being is inside, at which point it can alert the driver via an app or call emergency services as needed.
