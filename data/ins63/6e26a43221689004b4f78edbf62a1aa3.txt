Multi-CEO and internet jester Elon Musk has sold 30,000 bottles of a perfume meant to smell like your head is on fire, 'Burnt Hair.' Described by Musk as both 'the essence of repugnant desire' and 'the finest fragrance on Earth,' the 'unique, limited edition, collector's item' is now sold out, Musk announced on Twitter late Tuesday.What seemingly started off as an internet joke in late September quickly turned into reality last week, when Musk launched the perfume and began selling it for $100 a bottle on The Boring Company's website.
