A 29-year-old Randolph man was sentenced to 10 to 12 years in state prison last week following his conviction in Middlesex Superior Court on charges of human trafficking and profiting from prostitution after he was caught in a 2018 sting at a Newton hotel, officials said Thursday. Dirisu C. Alasa Jr. was sentenced May 17 to seven years in state prison for trafficking persons for sexual servitude and three to five years, to be served after the first sentence, for deriving support from prostitution, according to a statement from the Middlesex district attorney's office.
