T.J. Dillashaw has responded to Dominick Cruz's recent remarks regarding his title shot.
In an interview on 'The MMA Hour,' two-time UFC bantamweight champion Cruz claimed Dillashaw (17-4 MMA, 13-4 UFC) getting the next shot at reigning champion Aljamain Sterling was a 'hook-up' from the UFC.
Cruz pointed to Dillashaw's failed drug test for recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in 2019, which resulted in a two-year suspension from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and him voluntarily relinquishing his bantamweight title.
