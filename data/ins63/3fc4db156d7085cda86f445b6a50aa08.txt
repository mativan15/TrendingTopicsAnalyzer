A look at the shareholders of WiseTech Global Limited (ASX:WTC) can tell us which group is most powerful. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

WiseTech Global has a market capitalization of AU$14b, so it's too big to fly under the radar.
