Homeowners and governments losing out on important funding
CHICAGO, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- A new study from the Cook County Treasurer's Office reveals that hedge funds, private equity firms and others are exploiting a loophole in Illinois' property tax law to make millions of dollars in profits, mostly at the expense of Black and Latino communities.
These investors, known as tax buyers, have helped shape the arcane section of the property tax law they now use to their advantage. They have drained nearly $280 million from Cook County taxing districts over the last seven years.
