Matthew Wolff is a senior from Ridgway, Pennsylvania, majoring in history with a minor in political science. He interned over the summer at the Altoona Railroader's Memorial Museum. 

I have always had an interest in the railroads, and I saw the opportunity to intern at the museum as a perfect way to combine my love of history and the rail industry. I was able to do a mixture of everything at the museum. Some days I worked in the gift shop and others I worked with the director of digital outreach on social media.
