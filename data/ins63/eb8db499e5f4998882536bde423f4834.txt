Indiscriminate dumping and burning of garbage is a common sight in Crawford, and residents have grown accustomed to the stench that emanates from the dump. A piece of land on Anbu Nagar Main Road, which has been unoccupied for decades, has turned into a burning site, polluting the air in the vicinity.Despite the fact that sanitary workers transport waste from most of the identified dumping sites, it is alleged that, depending on the situation and convenience, some garbage collectors set fire to the garbage mounds.
