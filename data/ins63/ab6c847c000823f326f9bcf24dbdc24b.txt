Trump has long been frustrated that he has not drawn more support from American Jews, particularly when as president, he moved the US embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and his Jewish son-in-law, Jared Kushner, helped negotiate new treaties between Israel and some of its Arab neighbours.LoadingIn Sunday's post, Trump wrote that his support among people living in Israel is 'a different story'. 'Highest approval rating in the World, could easily be P.M.!' he wrote, contrasting his popularity in the foreign country with his support among American Jews.
