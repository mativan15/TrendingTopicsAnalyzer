Mikel Arteta prioritised a move for the Brazilian over long-standing interest in Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans during the dying embers of the transfer window and saw a number of late bids rejected.Luiz has since signed a new long-term deal at Villa Park, seemingly putting an end to any suggestion Arsenal could make a move in 2023, when his contact was due to expire.Still, with Arteta failing to add a central midfielder to his squad and clearly keen on Luiz to some degree, former Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor believes a move could still happen should Arsenal lodge a big-money bid.
