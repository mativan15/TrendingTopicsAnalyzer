In John Harbaugh's long tenure as head coach, the Ravens have not been a team that typically gives up double-digit leads — especially in the fourth quarter.

But the Ravens have lost twice this year when holding a double-digit lead in the final period. And the team held a 20-3 advantage over Buffalo in the second quarter of Week Four before failing to score another point in the 23-20 loss.

Baltimore won its Week Five matchup over Cincinnati with a late field goal.
