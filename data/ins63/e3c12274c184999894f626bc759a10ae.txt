The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said it is "far from certain" that Ms Sturgeon's plans of joining the EU would boost growth, according to the Scottish Daily Express. David Phillips, associate director at the IFS, said: "The Scottish government's new paper on post-independence economic plans makes all the right noises on how the public finances would be managed, emphasising achieving fiscal sustainability. But it skirts around what achieving sustainability would likely require in the first decade of an independent Scotland - bigger tax rises or spending cuts than the UK government will have to pursue.
