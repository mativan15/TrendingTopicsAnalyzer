(Bloomberg) -- Mercedes-Benz Group AG still has its sights set on delivering solid returns next year even if the global economy continues to take a turn for the worse.'If we end up in an economically-challenged environment, our goal is to still, in that environment, produce robust financial results,' Chief Executive Officer Ola Kaellenius said Monday in an interview at the Paris car show. 'Whether it's rain and thunder and a hailstorm at the same time.'In May, the luxury-car maker outlined operating margin goals of 14% in a favorable environment by 2025 and no lower than 8% in poor conditions.
