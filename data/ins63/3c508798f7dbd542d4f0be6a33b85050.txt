Boxing legend Prince Naseem Hamed is locked in a bitter family feud over his parents' £12million fortune, according to his brother Ali. The former featherweight world champion has been communicating with his siblings through only lawyers amid a row stemming from money he gave to his parents during his heyday. He gave his family funds to invest in property, which has now amassed a massive £12million value. And the former boxer believes that he is owed all of that money after his mother passed two years prior.
