Observer strives to be the essential source of news, data and insight about the powerful forces that shape the world.
Founded in 1987 as The New York Observer, we believe in an informed public that is empowered to hold the powerful to account. Accordingly, we hold ourselves to the core principles of accuracy, fairness, honesty and independence as journalists.  We know that our mission is not achievable without a diversity of voices, and so we seek to include those who have historically been excluded.
