AgenciesHeardle is a new game, a musical version of the trendy well-accepted word game Wordle. Here, the players will listen to a particular part of a song, based on which they would have to guess the song's name and its artist. There would be six chances, and the players will get to listen to 16 seconds of the song. If the player cannot guess till the sixth chance, they would be out of luck! The players will get to listen to some more portion of the song every time they assume it incorrectly. Each day Heardle will refresh itself and challenge you with a new song.
