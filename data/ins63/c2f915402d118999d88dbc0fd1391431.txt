Calm, the subscription-based mindfulness app, today announced its first foray into a clinical mental health offering: Calm Health. Offered through payers, providers and self-insured employers, Calm Health includes condition-specific programs designed to 'bridge the gap between mental and physical healthcare,' according to the company.
Calm Health both replaces Calm's previous employer offering, Calm for Business, and builds off of Calm's acquisition of tech startup Ripple Health Group in early February.
