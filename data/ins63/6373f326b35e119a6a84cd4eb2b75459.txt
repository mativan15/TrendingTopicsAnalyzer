The world's second richest man has sold his private jet after being tracked by Twitter climate activists.

Bernard Arnault - the CEO of luxury goods company LVMH and co-founder of Louis Vuitton - is worth an eye-watering €140 billion.

But he's not immune to the criticisms of the Twitterverse.

The billionaire's company has sold its private jet after a social media account started tracing his flights and tallying his carbon emissions.

'Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it," Arnault told France's Radio Classique.
