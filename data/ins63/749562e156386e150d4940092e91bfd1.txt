BioFit's next-generation, dual-use FS-3 ergonomic footrest, shown with the standalone-use rocker platform (R) detached from the base (L). They can be combined to form a height-adjustable unit. While the rocking platform functionality is all new to our footrest product mix, designing it to be used with our adjustable-height base component literally takes it to the next level. BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (PRWEB) June 01, 2022 BioFit Engineered Products, a global leader in the design and manufacture of ergonomic furnishings, rolled out a combination-use footrest today designed to promote fidgeting, which encourages blood flow, and other healthful user benefits.
