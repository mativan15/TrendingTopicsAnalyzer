At the Georgia Senate debate Friday night, GOP candidate Herschel Walker denied the recent allegations that he paid for an ex-girlfriend's abortion, and he challenged 'pro-choice pastor' and incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock to square the high black abortion rate in the state with his support for 'Black Lives Matter.'

'He told me Black Lives Matter,' Walker said of his opponent. 'There's more black babies aborted than anything, so if black lives matter, why are you not protecting those babies?'

Walker was asked to address the bombshell report, released by the Daily Beast last week, of an anonymous woman who claimed Walker paid for the abortion of a child they conceived together.
