Oct. 15—After completing an unbeaten regular season on Friday night, the Northwestern Tigers received an unwelcome surprise on Saturday morning.

The Tigers' 9-0 record was not enough to get a top seed in Division 5, according to brackets released by the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association. Instead, the top seed in Group A is St. Croix Falls (8-1), who the Tigers beat 36-28 on Sept. 9 in Maple.

The WIAA's electronic seeding formula criteria includes winning percentage, opponents' winning percentage, defeated opponents' winning percentage, defeated opponents' opponents' winning percentage, historical conference and team playoff performance and other factors.
