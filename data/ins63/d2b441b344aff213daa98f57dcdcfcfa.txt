Following a six-week trial, a jury found Anthony Zottola, Sr., and Himen Ross guilty of hiring Bushawn Shelton to kill 71-year-old Sylvester Zottola. They also unsuccessfully tried to have Anthony's brother, Salvatore, killed. Sylvester Zottola survived several assassination attempts before he was gunned down while getting coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru in the Bronx in October 2018.
