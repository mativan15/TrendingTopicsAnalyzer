Every investor in Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

Rekor Systems is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$103m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors.
