WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House said Thursday that the U.S. has evidence that Iranian troops are 'directly engaged on the ground' in Crimea supporting Russian drone attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure and civilian population. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Iran has sent a 'relatively small number' of personnel to Crimea, a part of Ukraine unilaterally annexed by Russia in contravention of international law in 2014, to assist Russian troops in launching Iranian-made drones against Ukraine.
