JESSICA TAYLOR / AFP It was the second departure in barely a week. On Wednesday, October 19, British Prime Minister Liz Truss lost her home secretary, Suella Braverman, five days after dismissing her chancellor of the exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng. In the evening, after Downing Street tried to force the hand of Conservative elected officials to vote in favor of controversial hydraulic fracturing (rock gas extraction), several media outlets reported that Wendy Morton, the party's head of voting enforcement, was also wavering on whether or not to leave.
