By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:15 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 23:45 EDT, 30 May 2022 Wests Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis says coach Michael Maguire's job is safe pending football boss Tim Sheens's mid-season report on the struggling NRL club. The Tigers' 44-18 capitulation to South Sydney - their ninth loss of the season - appeared to sound a death knell for Maguire. They beat the Rabbitohs by a point in round seven but have only managed one win since, against cellar dwellers Canterbury, to sit 15th on the ladder.
