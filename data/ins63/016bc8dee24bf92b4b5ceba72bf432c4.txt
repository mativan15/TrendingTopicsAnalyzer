The Last Baron: The Paris Kidnapping That Brought Down an Empire Dutton. 368 pp. $28. - - - A chauffeur-driven Peugeot sedan was following a man on a scooter down Avenue Foch in Paris one day in 1978. The scooter started zigzagging before tipping over. "He's completely crazy, this idiot," the chauffeur muttered. And then four men with automatic weapons emerged from a nearby parked car, placed the Peugeot's passenger in handcuffs, put a black hood over his head and injected a sedative into his arm.
