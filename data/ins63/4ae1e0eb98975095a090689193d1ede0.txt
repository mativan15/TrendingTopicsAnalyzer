Taco Bell will be making its Mexican Pizza a permanent feature on its menu after announcing on Tuesday that it severely underestimated demand. The fast food chain brought back the Mexican Pizza as a limited time menu item in May, but didn't purchase nearly enough supply to meet the demand. Taco Bell announced on Twitter that it would have had to purchase seven times more ingredients to meet Americans orders. Now the item is temporarily off the menu.
