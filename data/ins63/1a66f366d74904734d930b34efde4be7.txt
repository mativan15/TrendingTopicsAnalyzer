Landscapers working in the yard of a $15 million ($A23.5m) mansion in Silicon Valley have discovered a car filled with bags of concrete – which was giving off a smell of human remains – that had been buried decades ago.

The vehicle was unearthed Thursday in the exclusive San Francisco suburb of Atherton – populated by tech CEOs and millionaires – police stated in a news release.

Cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains, but none had been found more than 12 hours after the car was dug up, according to Atherton police commander Daniel Larsen, NY Post reports.
