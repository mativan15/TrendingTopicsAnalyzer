The sentencing of former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala in a disproportionate assets case on Friday further compounded the sagging fortunes of his political outfit, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD).The INLD, which was once a potent political force in Haryana, gradually started wilting after Chautala's 2013 conviction and sentencing in the JBT teachers' recruitment case.INLD was the prime challenger to the ruling Congress in 2013, having given the latter a run for its money in the 2009 assembly elections.
