If you are a Russian soldier, you cannot rely on body armor to protect you. Because there is a good chance that it is either inadequate, missing or even, due to chronic corruption, a replica made for Airsoft play — paintball wargaming — with no actual bullet resistance. Back in 2017 the Russian army proudly announced that it had received 200,000 sets of advanced Ratnik-2 ('Warrior-2') body armor, and that by 2020 deliveries had reached over 300,000 sets, enough for the entire force. Ratnik-2 is a modern design, similar to Western body armor.
