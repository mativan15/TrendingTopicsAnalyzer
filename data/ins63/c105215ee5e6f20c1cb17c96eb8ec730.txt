Oct. 22—MINNEAPOLIS — For more than 58 minutes, UND did just about everything it needed to beat the No. 1 team on the road.

It scored early and played with the lead.

It won the special teams battle.

It got a sensational goaltending performance by fifth-year senior Drew DeRidder.

But in the end, UND was left with little Friday night in 3M Arena at Mariucci.

Minnesota forward Mason Nevers scored an extra-attacker goal with 1 minute, 24 seconds left to tie it, then Matthew Knies scored just 21 seconds into overtime to give the Gophers a 3-2 victory in the series opener in front of 10,418, the seventh-largest crowd to watch a game in the 30-year-old building.
