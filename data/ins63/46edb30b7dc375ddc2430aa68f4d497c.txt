Team NEO and its partners, which include Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, are farming out some of their efforts to attract new and keep existing companies in Northeast Ohio in a more strategic way.

Allegro Real Estate Brokers & Advisors, Verdantas, McCabe Cos. and Chicago Title have been chosen to identify and recommend the best three to five sites in each of Cuyahoga and Summit counties to host new or expanding companies, the Cleveland-based economic development organization said Friday.

The team members were selected for their more than 15 years of experience working together to develop real estate strategies that support economic development, Team NEO said.
