MIAMI — With Celtics center Robert Williams expected to be sidelined for 1-2 more months after undergoing September knee surgery, there is added focus on the durability and availability of 36-year-old Al Horford.The Celtics are expected to do what they can to preserve Horford for the postseason, when he is needed most.
