Suella Braverman lasted just six weeks as home secretary and left the post a day after an outburst against 'tofu-eating wokerati'.In the 43 full days she was in office, Ms Braverman attracted attention on several occasions for her provocative statements.The latest came on Tuesday when she accused opposition parties of being a 'coalition of chaos', during a debate in Parliament on the Public Order Bill, which aims to crack down on disruptive protests like those carried out by groups such as Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil.
