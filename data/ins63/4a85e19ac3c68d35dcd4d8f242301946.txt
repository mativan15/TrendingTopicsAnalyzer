The cruise line has added something that neither Carnival nor Royal Caribbean offers onboard.

For many cruise passengers, their trip does not start until they get the first drink from one of the many bars onboard. That has led the major cruise lines to invest heavily in creating unique drinks and bar concepts.

Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL) - Get Carnival Corporation Report literally has a brewery onboard the Carnival, a first at sea. The Redfrog Pub and Brewery brews three beers onboard including ThirstyFrog Port Hoppin' IPA, FriskyFrog Java Stout, and ThirstyFrog Caribbean Wheat.
