As you begin your journey with Linux, you'll find things are far easier than you originally assumed. This is especially so on the desktop, where everything is a point-and-click affair and you could go your entire life without ever having to touch the command line. That's a far cry from when I first started my Linux journey (back in '96), at which point the terminal was an absolute necessity.
