Last year companies went public at a record pace. This year it seems like nobody wants to go public -- not as long as the market looks the way it does.
Investment banks are vital in helping companies go public and have seen a drastic drop in earnings after a record year in 2021. Morgan Stanley (MS 2.98%) is one company feeling the pressure, seeing its top and bottom lines shrink in its recent earnings report.
Investment banks have gotten beaten up this year, but I think they could be excellent stocks to buy in the coming months.
