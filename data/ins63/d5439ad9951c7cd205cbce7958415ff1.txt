Like the mountains of Aspen, Colorado, Aspen Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZPN) is displaying some serious elevation.

The large cap software company continues to climb to new record highs, leaving struggling industry peers at the bottom of the slope. It is up 63% year-to-date and all but certain to finish higher for the eighth consecutive year. Over the past 10 years, it has steadily ascended to a 10-bagger.

And yet somehow it remains a relative unknown among investors.

How could a proven winner fly under the radar for so long? For one, it operates in a corner of the software industry we simply don't hear much about.
