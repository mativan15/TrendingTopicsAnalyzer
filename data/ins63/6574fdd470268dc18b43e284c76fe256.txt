MacKenzie Scott, who was formerly married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is a highly regarded philanthropist and known for her generous donations and grants to non-profits and community-focused initiatives.

And her latest donation is breaking records.

On Tuesday, The Girl Scouts of the USA revealed that Scott had donated $84.5 million to the organization and 29 local branches, marking the largest single donation the company has ever received in its over 100 years of existence.

The Girl Scouts plan to use the funding to help make up for lost funding during the pandemic — as an organization that thrives on in-person fundraising and events, memberships took a major hit during the age of COVID protocols.
