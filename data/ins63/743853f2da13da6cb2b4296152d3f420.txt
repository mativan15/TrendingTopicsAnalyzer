Los Espookys may take place in a world of cursed mirrors, parasitic water demons, and forcibly brainwashed female TV hosts, but those freaky phenomenon have nothing on the show's true terror: Sonia (River L. Ramirez). This season, the mean, manipulative, and relentlessly lazy woman moved in with Los Espookys leader Renaldo (Bernardo Velasco) and spent most of her time tormenting her unassuming dad, Tico (Fred Armisen), and pretty much everyone else she encountered.

In the season 2 finale, Sonia's latest money-making scheme — buying up celebrity website domain names and then reselling them at an exorbitant mark-up — almost pays off.
