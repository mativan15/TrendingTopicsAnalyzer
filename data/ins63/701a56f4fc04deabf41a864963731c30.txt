TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee on Saturday lashed out at "1 per cent of the judiciary" for ordering CBI investigation in "every case" in the state. Addressing a rally in Haldia in Purba Medinipur district, Banerjee said he has avenged the "harassment" by central agencies by inducting two BJP MPs into the TMC. "I feel ashamed to say that in the judiciary, there are one or two people who are in hand in gloves and have a tacit understanding, and are ordering CBI investigation in every case. This is just 1 per cent of the judiciary," he said, without clarifying his allegations.
