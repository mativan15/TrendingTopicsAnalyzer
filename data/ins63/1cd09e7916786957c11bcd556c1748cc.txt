Aaron Rodgers and his Packers have a lot to prove this season.
After losing a squeaker to the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs last season, Rodgers and the team are hoping to turn things around in 2022-23.

That's where you come in.
If you haven't yet secured tickets to important home games at Lambeau and want to help the squad return to glory — you still can, and for cheap.
