Please help me. I am a 68-year-old woman married 17 years to the love of my life. Our finances have always been separate, and I signed a prenuptial agreement acknowledging that his son will inherit his estate held in a living trust (about $3 million). I get our home, and he is leaving me $350,000 in his will.
The husband took a lump Social Security payout before we met. We have always lived debt-free, and I have a nice 2020 vehicle. While I live a modest lifestyle, his health has prevented us from enjoying a vacation for eight years.
