A Shakopee man is the 50th person to be charged so far in the Feeding Our Future-related fraud scheme, the largest pandemic fraud in the country.

In a federal indictment unsealed Wednesday, Abduljabar Hussein, 42, was charged with wire fraud, federal programs bribery, money laundering and other charges for his involvement in what prosecutors say is a more than $250 million scheme to steal money meant to feed needy children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hussein is the husband of Mekfira Hussein, 38, also of Shakopee, who was charged and arrested last month.
