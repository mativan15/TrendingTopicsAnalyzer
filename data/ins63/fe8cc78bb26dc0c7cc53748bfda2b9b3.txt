A San Francisco tech startup broaching unicorn status has conducted layoffs just months after boasting a massive funding round — and at least one worker appeared to be angry about how the layoffs were conducted.

AtoB, a financial technology company launched in 2019 whose core product is a fuel card for trucking and other transportation services, laid off 32 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to SFGATE on Tuesday. The company employed 107 employees before the layoffs, meaning that 30% of the company was given pink slips.
