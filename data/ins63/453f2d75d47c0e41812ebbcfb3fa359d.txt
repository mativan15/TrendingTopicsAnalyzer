Published: 09:06 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 09:12 EDT, 18 October 2022 The Tennessee Titans and city of Nashville have announced plans for a new $2.1 billion domed stadium that will be ready for the 2026 season. By replacing the team's 23-year-old Nissan Stadium, the city hopes to host future Super Bowls, College Football Playoff games, and Final Fours, all of which can generate hundreds of millions in tax revenue. The Titans and Nashville Mayor John Cooper announced the agreement Monday with $760 million in bonds issued by the Metro Sports Authority in a deal that still must be approved by the Metro Nashville City Council.
