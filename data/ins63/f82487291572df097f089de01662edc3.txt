Oct. 16—For the first time in nearly a decade, there will be a new Missouri state senator in District 12.

Rusty Black and Michael Baumli are facing off for the spot after Dan Hegeman leaves the Legislature. One factor highlighted by both candidates was education.

Thinking about education on a state level means making sure there are enough educators in place. It would be the first priority of Republican candidate Black if elected, who is a former teacher and the state representative for Missouri's 7th Representative District.
