By Will Feuer Shares of Big Lots Inc. fell more than 20% in premarket trading after the big-box retailer posted a surprise first-quarter loss and issued downbeat guidance. The company said same-store sales were strong in February and March, but slowed in April, prompting the company to mark down prices. Chief Executive Bruce Thorn blamed the slowdown on inflationary pressures reducing discretionary spending. "We expect the environment to remain challenging and we remain highly focused on managing the business prudently," he said.
