Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesThe topline of Comerica Inc. (NYSE:CMA) is highly sensitive to interest rate changes; therefore, the rising interest-rate environment will prove to be quite beneficial for the company. Further, elevated provision reversals will likely keep the net provision expense below normal this year. Overall, I'm expecting Comerica to report earnings of $6.63 per share in 2022, down 21% year-over-year. Compared to my last report on Comerica, I have significantly increased my earnings estimate as I have revised upwards my margin estimate and reduced the net provision expense estimate.
