The Rangers' power play is currently operating at roughly a 33 percent success rate, having scored on five of 15 man-advantage stretches through the first four games of the season.
Three of those power-play tallies came Monday night in a 6-4 win over the Ducks, in which they had four man-advantage opportunities. And even on the one when they didn't capitalize, the Rangers scored almost immediately after it expired, when Filip Chytil fed Alexis Lafreniere for his first goal of the season and the 4-2 lead at 17:39 of the second period.
