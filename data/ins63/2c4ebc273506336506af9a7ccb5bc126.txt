Shares of credit card issuers like American Express and Capital One could provide upside despite recession concerns, BofA said.

Credit losses should be mitigated in part by healthy balance sheets among consumers who saved money during COVID lockdowns.

"We think that valuations on Card stocks already reflect a healthy dose of cyclical concerns in the market."

The slide in stocks this year partially reflects expectations the US will drop into a recession, but shares of American Express, Capital One and those of other credit card companies could weather a potential downturn in the consumer-driven economy, according to Bank of America.
