The stakes just got a lot higher in the race to become London's next mayor. Premier Doug Ford recently announced his government intends to grant additional powers to the mayors of Ontario's largest cities that would shift the balance of power at London city hall. Moving to a so-called ‘strong mayor' system of municipal government would provide political powers that candidates Josh Morgan and Khalil Ramal both say— they don't want. 'I'm not sure this is solving a particular problem the way the legislation is formulated,' explains Josh Morgan inside his campaign office.
