Stocks bounced off bad news on inflation last week and have been rising in the kind of broad-based rally that suggests the move higher could endure. But the surge in stock prices has also been accompanied by higher bond yields, and that worries strategists who follow stock charts. The closely watched 10-year yield has been hovering around 4% and was trading above that at 4.03% at midday Tuesday. Yields move opposite price. As yields rose from just under 4% Tuesday morning, the stock market rally lost some steam.
