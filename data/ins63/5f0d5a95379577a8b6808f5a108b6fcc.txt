The Proclaimers, the band behind the 1980s massive hit I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), are coming back to Australia in 2023. Scottish pop duo Craig and Charlie Reid have announced to tour the country in February and March following a sold-out 35-date UK tour.
The Proclaimers duo have announced that they are glad to be heading back to Australia, a country with great audiences who have been supporting them since their first tour to the country in 1989. Embarking on a 14-month World tour with the key stage performance at the Isle of Wight Festival in June 2022, followed by a string of regional concerts and summer festivals, the Scottish rock duo has almost sold out all dates.
