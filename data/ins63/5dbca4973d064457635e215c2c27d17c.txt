Trading 30% from its highs, investors will want to pay attention to Albertsons ACI fiscal Q2 earnings on October 18. Albertsons is one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States. Albertsons Companies operates Albertsons, Safeway, and Jewel-Osco, among others.

Kroger Merger

Today's announcement revealed that Kroger KR is expected to pay $34.10 per share for Albertsons. However, Wall Street may not see the agreement getting done as this would be a considerable premium with ACI trading at $26 a share.
