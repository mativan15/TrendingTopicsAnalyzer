Maria Vonotna Introduction There is no need to recount the market turmoil in 2022, higher inflation and the sharp rise in interest rates as a result of Fed moves and market action. As of this writing, the 10-year treasury bond yield sits at just below 4.0%, up from 1.8% at the start of 2022. This steep rise has led to a decline in all classes of fixed income, with the highest quality corporate bond indexes down over 20% this year (e.g. NYSEARCA:LQD, iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF). While we cannot predict where inflation and interest rates are headed next, we believe that most, if not all, of the "bad news" related to these factors has been priced into bonds.
