Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY -3.91%) fell 12.2% this holiday-shortened week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, part of a long, steady slide. This helped one analyst come to the conclusion that the home goods retailer may need to "begin to seriously consider 'endgame' scenarios."
Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba told investors a bankruptcy reorganization may be in the cards because it will be too hard to swim against the tide of worsening economic conditions, a deteriorating financial position, and a management team not up to the task of salvaging the business.
