The knives aren't the only things that are out in 'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.' Benoit Blanc, the protagonist detective of the 'Knives Out' franchise played by Daniel Craig, is officially queer, according to writer-director Rian Johnson. While a brief scene and cameo in 'Glass Onion' heavily implies Benoit's sexual orientation, Johnson outright confirmed the character detail at a press conference for the sequel at the London Film Festival (via Entertainment Weekly). 'Yes, he obviously is,' Johnson said when asked if Benoit is queer due to a scene in 'Glass Onion' in which he has a live-in male lover.
