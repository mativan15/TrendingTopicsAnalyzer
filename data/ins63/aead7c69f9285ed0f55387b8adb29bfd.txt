A NewsMax host asked Zelenskyy if Russia's invasion may have been prevented with Trump as president.

Zelenskyy said it was not important which party was in power in the US.

He apologized to host Rob Schmitt for "saying something that you don't like."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shut down a NewsMax interviewer who prompted him to say that there would be no war in Ukraine if former President Donald Trump were still US president.
