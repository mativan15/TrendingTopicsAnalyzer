Japan's accredited self-regulatory body for the crypto industry is simplifying a complicated screening process that digital tokens must undergo before being listed on local exchanges.

These rules will come into effect in December and have been approved by Japan's top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency.

But a Bloomberg report saying the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) is trying to remove all coin screenings by 2024 is not entirely accurate, according to the body's Vice Chair Genki Oda.
