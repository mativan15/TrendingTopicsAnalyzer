After public spats with Twitter and Instagram, Rapper Ye – formerly known as Kanye West – is buying social network Parler, an alternative micro-blogging site often associated with far-right extremists, conspiracy theorists, and others booted from mainstream platforms.
Ye, who was briefly banned from Twitter and Instagram earlier this month over perceived anti-semitic tweets the platforms said violated their terms of use, said he was buying the self-proclaimed "pioneering uncancelable [sic] free speech platform.
