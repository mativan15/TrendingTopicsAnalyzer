MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble strengthened to a one-week high against the dollar on Monday, supported by the start of a favourable month-end tax period, as oil prices edged lower and the spectre of geopolitical risk continued to lurk over Russian markets.

By 0848 GMT, the rouble was 1.1% stronger against the dollar at 61.41 , hitting its strongest point since Oct. 10. It gained 0.6% to trade at 60.35 versus the euro and firmed 1.6% against the yuan to 8.47 , a near two-week high.

"The tax period, which has formally started, will gradually gain momentum, and with it volumes of foreign currency sales by exporters for tax purposes," said Dmitry Polevoy, head of investment at Locko Invest.
