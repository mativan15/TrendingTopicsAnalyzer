Diablo Immortal, the free-to-play mobile entry in the Diablo franchise, released early worldwide on Wednesday -- except for the Netherlands and Belgium. The reason those countries don't have access to the new game? Laws preventing the selling of loot boxes. A post on the Diablo Immortal subreddit from May 23 had a screenshot of a reply from a Blizzard Entertainment employee in Europe who confirmed that players in Belgium and the Netherlands won't be able to install the game when it's released. Dutch tech site Tweakers confirmed the game's unavailability because of those countries' anti-gambling laws, which also restrict loot boxes, as first spotted by GameIndustry.
