Southern Cross Austereo's largest shareholder has said it may not make its money back from a long-term investment in the company if the radio sector continues to lose listeners to subscription-music platforms like Spotify.Allan Gray managing director Simon Mawhinney said Southern Cross shares currently looked 'very cheap' but there was still a question mark over whether the company could continue to generate earnings when it competed with online music platforms. Allan Gray owns more than 19 per cent of Southern Cross, which owns the 2DayFM, Fox FM and Triple M radio networks.
