Mayor Adams' chief tech honcho is being squired around town by an NYPD security detail — prompting political and law enforcement observers to question why he needs one and why taxpayers are footing the bill for it.

Chief Technology Officer Matt Fraser is protected by at least two NYPD detectives — Steve Gordon and Victor Robalino, according to three sources familiar with the situation who spoke to the Daily News under the condition of anonymity.

One of the sources who confirmed the existence of Fraser's detail and spoke anonymously out of fear of retribution pointed out that there's no precedent for someone in his post to be provided with a protective unit.
