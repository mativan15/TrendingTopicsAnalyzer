Four days after Elijah Moore tweeted in response to a comment about his lack of a single target in the Jets' win over Green Bay, the second-year receiver was missing from practice on Thursday.
With speculation ramping up about what might be going on since Moore has not been on any injury report, Jets head coach Robert Saleh walked over to the sideline early in practice and explained to reporters that Moore had been excused for the day due to a personal matter that involved his family.
There's definitely been some smoke here – or perhaps it's mere coincidence.
