Michael Bublé concertgoers have been urged to show up early at the Scotiabank Centre in Halifax Friday night. 'We just want to make sure that people have lots of time to get into the venue,' said Erin Esiyok-Prime from Events East. Events East also took to social media to ask ticketholders to, "arrive no later than 7:15 p.m. to ensure they are in by show time.' The issue is the recent installation of 18 metal detectors which are slowing people down when entering the venue. 'They are located at all of the entrances in the venue," said Esiyok-Prime.
