Kim (played by Claire King) has been busy organising her wedding to Will Taylor (Dean Andrews) recently on Emmerdale, unaware of the storyline which has been going on behind her back. Gabby Thomas (Rosie Bentham) told Will about her suspicions Jamie Tate (Alexanders Lincoln) could still be alive and he has had this confirmed after contacting one of his old friends, who turned out to be a crooked private investigator. The character called Mike managed to find out Jamie was still alive but when it seems Kim will find out what's been going on in upcoming scenes on the ITV soap, she will be gunning for revenge.
