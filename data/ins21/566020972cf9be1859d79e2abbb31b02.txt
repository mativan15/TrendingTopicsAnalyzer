JacobH Just under two weeks ago, I wrote a piece about Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) in which I upgraded the stock from a Sell to a Buy. The change in rating was based on several factors that included improving industry fundamentals, the restart of McArthur River Mine, changes in the long-term contract portfolio, and the completion of a cap raise that I suspected would be used to buyout the remainder of Cigar Lake Mine. But like most of the market, I was rather surprised when I heard Cameco had agreed to purchase the Westinghouse Electric Company from Brookfield's private equity arm, Brookfield Business Partners (BBU).
