Jun. 1—EAU CLAIRE — Local school bus company Student Transit will host a driver recruiting event this week to aid in their goal of hiring and training as many drivers as possible in the next few months — just in time for the new school year.

The company's first annual Driving for Drivers event will be held from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday at the Student Transit-Eau Claire, Inc., campus, 3339 Fehr Rd.

The event will offer prospective hires the opportunity to talk to current bus drivers about what they do, learn about the extensive employee benefits available to them and test-drive a school bus with an on-site trainer.
