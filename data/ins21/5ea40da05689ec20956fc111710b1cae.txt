'These days, apparently, I have to offer trigger warnings for you snowflakes,' the screenwriting maestro Robert McKee declared the other day, addressing the participants in 'Story,' a three-day seminar he was conducting, at a Westin near LAX, for approximately the four-hundredth time. 'First of all, language. I use profanity because I like to. It keeps my energy level up.' Other potentially offensive topics: politics, religion, sex. 'Writing, ideally, is rooted in reality, and if you can't see things for what they are you'll never write anything worth shit,' he said.
