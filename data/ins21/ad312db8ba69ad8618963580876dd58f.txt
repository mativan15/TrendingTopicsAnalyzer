Another pitch to build up Kitchener's skyline has been made to city council. A proposal for a 26-storey condo tower, as well as two mid-rise buildings standing at four and six stories, was made by the Zehr Group at a Monday night meeting. The potential Ottawa Street North location would create 476 residential units. The developer says they'll be making a $350,000 affordable housing donation as part of the project. "We also know though that, even a huge amount from a personal point of view, $350,000, is a lot of money, but we know also that it doesn't go a very long way in putting a dent can be built," said Coun.
