The Los Angeles Rams defense was extremely stingy against the Carolina Panthers in Week 6, allowing just 10 points and 203 yards in the matchup. Their exceptional team effort was evident on film, and the stat sheet reflected how involved their unit was, with seven players tallying four or more tackles in the game.

Linebackers Ernest Jones, Bobby Wagner, and Leonard Floyd accounted for 18 total tackles as a group, with A'Shawn Robinson, Marquise Copeland, and Aaron Donald pitching in for another 16 from their spots on the defensive line.
