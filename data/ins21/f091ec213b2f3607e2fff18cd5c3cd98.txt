Sue Fox, chairman of the Durham County Federation of Women's Institutes, said the Queen had not listened to the plea, despite being a loyal WI member and branch president, and had worked very hard for all these years. Mrs Fox, a retired journalist, was speaking at Beamish Museum in County Durham, where members in 1950s gear paraded through the site to mark the jubilee.
