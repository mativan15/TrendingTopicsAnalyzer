The Delhi High Court on Saturday stayed the trial court direction permitting a lawyer to remain present, at a distance, during the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) interrogation of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) minister Satyendar Kumar Jain, who was remanded to the central agency's custody on May 31 till June 9 in a money laundering case.
'Since there is no apprehension [of threat or coercion] raised in the present matter, hence as a matter of right such direction ought not to have been given in the recording of statement,' said Justice Yogesh Khanna in the order.
