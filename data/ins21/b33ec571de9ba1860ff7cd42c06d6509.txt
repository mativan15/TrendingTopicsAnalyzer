A Tory MP has submitted a letter to the 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, demanding a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.William Wragg, who is vice chairman of the influential group of Tory backbenchers, told MPs in the Commons on Wednesday he would like to vote with Labour to ban fracking because he is opposed to it.However, because the vote is being treated as a 'confidence motion' in Liz Truss's embattled Government, he decided not to because he would lose the whip and his letter of no confidence in the PM would 'fall'.
