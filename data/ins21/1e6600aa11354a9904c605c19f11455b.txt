Piers Morgan has strongly implied he is ready to enter the world of politics. The former Good Morning Britain presenter took to social media in the wake of Liz Truss' resignation to seemingly offer his services to the country - telling his 7.9million Twitter followers has it may well be 'time' for him to enter 10 Downing Street, complete with a preview of how he could look in power. Piers joined comedian Joe Lycett in reacting to the news this afternoon that the Prime Minister will step down from her position, following a disastrous 45 days in power, with multiple U-turns and gaffes marring her brief reign as the Conservative Party leader.
