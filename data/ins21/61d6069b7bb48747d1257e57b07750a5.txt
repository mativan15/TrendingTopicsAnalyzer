The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Domain Holdings Australia Limited (ASX:DHG) share price is down 33% in the last year. That's well below the market decline of 3.7%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 0.9% in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 15% in the last three months.
