If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. To wit, the Wilmington plc (LON:WIL) share price is 20% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market decline of around 3.4% (not including dividends) in the same period. So that should have shareholders smiling. However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 10% in the last three years.
