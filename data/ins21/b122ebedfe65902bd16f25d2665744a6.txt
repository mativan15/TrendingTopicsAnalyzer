An anti-corruption court in Lahore this week quashed a Rs 16 billion money laundering case against the prime minister and his son Hamza Shehbaz. Their acquittal came on the heels of the Islamabad High Court exonerating Maryam Nawaz, vice president of the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz party, in a high-profile corruption case.
Aitizaz Ahsan, a former interior minister and an estranged leader of Pakistan Peoples Party, commenting on the acquittals said this week that the 'establishment' helped the Sharif family get clear of the cases of corruption.
