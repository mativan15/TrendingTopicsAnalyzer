NEW YORK (AP) — Federal authorities in New York charged seven people Thursday, including five in the People's Republic of China, with a campaign of harassment against a Chinese national and his family living in the U.S., trying to force him to return home.

They face charges including acting as agents of a foreign government, violations of the Travel Act and money laundering conspiracy.

The U.S. attorney's office alleged the threats and harassment continued for years and were part of what the FBI has dubbed 'Operation Fox Hunt' and characterized as an illegal global effort by China to locate and repatriate alleged fugitives who flee to foreign countries.
