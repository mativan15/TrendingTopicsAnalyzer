HYANNIS – A pair of scuffed boots, a gun standing ramrod straight behind them with a helmet resting on the stock of the gun was the real focus of the 18th annual 'Troops in the Spotlight,' event on Sunday.

The battlefield cross signifies a soldier killed in action. On a makeshift wall covered in camouflage netting behind the cross hung 14 photographs. Some were official military photographs, uniforms clean and pressed, the flag behind them. Others were taken in the field. One soldier stood in front of a mountain range, another before a bunker, another at the ready with his gun on his lap and his helmet on his head.
