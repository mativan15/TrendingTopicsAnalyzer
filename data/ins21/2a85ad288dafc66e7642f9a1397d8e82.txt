MONTREAL—There really wasn't much any of the players fighting for the final Raptors roster spot could have done here Friday night.It was the overall body of work — a combination of practices and games and scrimmages — that would determine who ended up on the team and who will be seeking employment elsewhere.'I think they're all pretty well aware that they need to have good performances. This one's probably not any different than any of them,' Raptors coach Nick Nurse said before Toronto finished its pre-season with a 137-134 victory over the Boston Celtics in overtime at the Bell Centre.
