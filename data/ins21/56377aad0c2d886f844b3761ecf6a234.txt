(Bloomberg) -- Bankrupt Sri Lanka can't tap a $1.5 billion credit line from Beijing as China is concerned the International Monetary Fund may force delays in repayment.'There is a condition in relation to the months of import cover that we need to have in order to be able to draw on that money,' said Indrajit Coomaraswamy, a former central bank of Sri Lanka governor who is advising the government.It's difficult for China to waive off the condition 'because this is a three-year swap, it might be termed a loan and there may be pressure from IMF and others to include it in the stock of debt that we reschedule and therefore clearly that would be a disadvantage to the Chinese,' he said at a central bank event Thursday.
