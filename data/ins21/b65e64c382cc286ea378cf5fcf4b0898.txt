Small-cap stocks are having a difficult time, even by this year's bear market standard. But Goldman Sachs ' Peter Oppenheimer believes the worst could be over for smaller companies, and names several stocks he likes within the space. "Small caps are down 34% year-to-date. They have underperformed large caps by 20%. This is the worst start since the turn of the century," Oppenheimer, Goldman's chief global equity strategist, wrote in a note on Oct. 14 with colleagues including Guillaume Jaisson. There are several reasons for this, they said, including the impact of a weak domestic currency (such as the euro or British pound), lack of exposure to outperforming sectors and high cyclicality.
