SAN DIEGO —

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was 'surprised' and 'a little taken aback' by New York Mets manager Buck Showalter's request to have Padres pitcher Joe Musgrove checked for foreign substances before the sixth inning of San Diego's 6-0 National League wild-card clinching win in Citi Field on Sunday night.

Musgrove was nearing the end of a dominant seven-inning, one-hit, five-strikeout effort when Showalter asked crew chief Alfonso Marquez to check the pitcher, who had his glove, hands and sweaty ears thoroughly rubbed in what seemed like a desperate attempt by Showalter to disrupt Musgrove's rhythm.
