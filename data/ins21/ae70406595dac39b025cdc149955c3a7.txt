Tokyo: Japanese tech giant Sony is prepping on raising the production of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) gaming console along with expanding its games portfolio as well. The announcement arrives as the issues with the supply chain subsides, reports GizmoChina. Despite the PS5 console launching back in November 2020, the tech giant has been struggling with its production due to the ongoing global chip shortage and other supply constraint issues. "We are planning for heavy further increases in console production, taking us to production levels that we have never achieved before," Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan, was quoted as saying.
