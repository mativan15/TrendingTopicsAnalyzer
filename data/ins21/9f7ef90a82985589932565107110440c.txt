Interpol this week unveiled what it has called a Metaverse for police around the world while signalling a lawless virtual universe will not be tolerated.
The Interpol Metaverse is "fully operational" and available from the international police force's cloud service, we're told. To us, it seems to be a shared virtual reality space that you connect into using a suitable VR headset. Once in, you can visit a virtual version of the organization's headquarters in Lyon, France; interact with other cops' avatars just as they can interact with yours; and take training courses, such as learning all about forensic investigations.
