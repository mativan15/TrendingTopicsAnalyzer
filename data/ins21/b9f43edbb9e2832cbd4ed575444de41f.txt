The National Football League is entering week seven, but before we get there, we have to highlight what some former Tar Heels did this past weekend.

UNC's presence in the NFL is steadily growing as some former Heels have become star guys for their respective teams. In Pittsburgh, Mitch Trubisky came in for an injured Kenny Pickett and led the Steelers to a 20-18 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Linebacker Cole Holcomb filled up the stat sheet again for Washington, and running back Michael Carter got the chains moving in the Jet's win over the Greenbay Packers.
