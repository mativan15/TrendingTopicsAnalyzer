India's private sector investment announcements soared 66% between July and September to nearly ₹5.7 lakh crore, compared to the first quarter of 2022-23, even as there was a worrying dip in the execution rate for outstanding projects already committed to. Though the first quarter (Q1) of the year had reported a 20.5% sequential dip in new investments, the second quarter (Q2) was boosted by super mega projects like Vedanta's ₹1.54 lakh crore plans to manufacture chips in Gujarat, driving a sharp 41% jump in overall investment projects, investment monitoring firm Projects Today said.
