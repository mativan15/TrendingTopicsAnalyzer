It's past 11pm in the UK – mid-afternoon in LA – when The Rock, aka Dwayne Johnson, rocks up via Zoom to talk Black Adam, the latest superhero venture from the DC Extended Universe. To say he's excited is a colossal understatement.
‘I just want to say this – Black Adam wasn't a sequel. It wasn't an existing intellectual property that everyone was familiar with. All these characters are coming to life for the very first time ever in cinematic history,' he says. ‘It makes me so proud.' 
Johnson, 50, is wearing a pastel-coloured shirt, stretched to ripping point by his enormous frame.
