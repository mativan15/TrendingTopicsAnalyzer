While Kanye West has long had a tempestuous relationship with social media, recent days have seen him unleash a barrage of misleading and particularly offensive statements, some of them deleted by Twitter and Instagram. His most disturbing ideas, however, are finding an eager audience on TikTok. At the root at the rapper's latest controversy is his decision to ally with right-wing influencer Candace Owens in calling the Black Lives Matter movement a scam. The pair wore 'White Lives Matter' shirts at Ye's latest fashion show in Paris, provoking criticism from music mogul Diddy, among many others.
