A key deal maker behind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus is leaving the company after more than a decade. "After almost 12 incredibly fulfilling years at Meta/Facebook, I have decided to leave the company," Amin Zoufonoun said in a Facebook post. The departure comes amid a tech M&A crackdown by U.S. and European regulators. On Tuesday, Meta said it was divesting its purchase of Giphy after it was blocked by the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is suing to block the acquisition of VR fitness app maker Within Unlimited.
