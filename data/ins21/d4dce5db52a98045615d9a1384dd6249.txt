Endemic low pay represents a threat to the very future of the NHS, the head of the biggest union representing health staff has warned ahead of an expected wave of strike action this winter.Strike action over pay seemed 'inevitable', said Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison, even though a formal ballot of staff in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only opens later this month, while the process is ongoing in Scotland.Unison was likely to coordinate with other unions in the NHS to increase the impact of any stoppages, and could also liaise with strikers in other sectors such as transport, she warned.
