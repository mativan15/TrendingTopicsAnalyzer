Though still more than six months from final approval, testing has started on the NASCAR Next Gen Camaro slated to race in the 2023 24 Hours of Le Mans.

IMSA president John Doonan told NBC Sports that multiple drivers have been testing Chevrolet's DIL (Driver in the Loop) simulator in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

'That includes current NASCAR drivers, current sports car drivers with lots of Le Mans experience,' Doonan said. 'It includes former NASCAR drivers that are retired. So I think there is a great anticipation on my part and everyone's part on who's going to drive it.
