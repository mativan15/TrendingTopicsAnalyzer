Snap issued a revenue warning late on May 23 — not so unusual this earnings season — but the company used some harsh words, saying 'the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further and faster than anticipated.' Many retailers also are warning of a worsening economy. Getty Images Shares of Dollar Tree jumped 22% on May 26 after the discounter blew past estimates for sales and earnings. Rival Dollar General saw its stock pop by 14% after raising its guidance for same-store sales growth. Macy's said its quarterly profit nearly tripled from a year earlier, sending its stock up 19% on May 26.
