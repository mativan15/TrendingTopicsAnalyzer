New Zealand and Australia will look to 'strengthen' joint military capabilities and compare notes on major reviews of their defence forces. Defence Minister Peeni Henare met Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles in Geelong, Australia, on Monday afternoon. The ministers, in a joint statement, said they agreed to a 'reinvigoration' of aspects of the trans-Tasman military alliance. 'The ministers reaffirmed the strength of the Australia–New Zealand defence alliance in an increasingly complex security environment,' the statement read.
