Lower Taxes Retirement Income

This means that many will need to start turning investment assets into cash in order to pay for living expenses once they've hit retirement age. This can lead to many unexpected tax expenses that prompt a larger sell-off than originally planned for, shrinking how long your assets may last. There are guidelines you can follow if you're selling off assets in your retirement account that will maximize your earning potential while lowering your overall tax bill, even if you've already hit retirement age.
