Silvio Berlusconi was reportedly told to 'keep his mouth shut' by Italy's prime minister-in-waiting, Giorgia Meloni, as she prepared to formalise the country's most right-wing government since the Second World War.
Mr Berlusconi, known for his gaffes and unpredictability, leads Forza Italia, one of three parties which will make up the new government, along with the hard-right League and Brothers of Italy, led by Ms Meloni.
He proved himself to be a liability to the coalition this week after audio recordings emerged in which he boasted of having received 20 bottles of vodka and 'a very sweet' letter from Vladimir Putin for his 86th birthday last month, in the midst of Russia's war against Ukraine.
