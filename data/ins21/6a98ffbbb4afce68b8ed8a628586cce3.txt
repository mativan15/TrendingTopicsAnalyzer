Condemning the alleged 'anti-teacher approaches' of St. Xavier's College, Palayamkottai, a section of the teachers of the college and the members of MUTA staged dharna in front of the college on Tuesday.The protesting teachers said a professor of Department of Economics of the college, who retired from service on July 31 last, could not get retirement benefits as the college administration did not send records to the Joint Director of Collegiate Education. While the junior faculty members are not given due promotions, the senior professors are not appointed as the heads of departments.
