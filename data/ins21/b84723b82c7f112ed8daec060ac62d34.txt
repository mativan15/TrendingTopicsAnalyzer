BBC Radio 1Xtra presenter Nadia Jae has described the late Jamal Edwards as an ‘angel' after he helped launch her career a decade ago. 
SBTV founder Edwards died in February at the age of 31, leaving behind a legacy that saw both him and his popular music platform help propel the likes of Ed Sheeran, Little Mix and Jessie J to global fame. 
Nadia, who now fronts 1Xtra's breakfast show, was one of the many rising stars Edwards helped over the years. 
After having a ‘really love in-depth conversation' when Nadia was working at another station, Edwards specifically requested that she host an event he was appearing at after being impressed by her interviewing skills.
