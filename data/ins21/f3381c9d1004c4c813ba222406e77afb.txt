PROVIDENCE — The Rhode Island Department of Education said it received the RICAS test result data file on Sept. 12, but cautioned that the scores weren't final.

'RIDE received the data file that was not validated or final from the vendor on Aug. 25 last year and Sept. 12 this year,' RIDE spokesman Victor Morente said Monday.

The release of scores from the Rhode Island Comprehensive Assessment System has blown up into a major campaign issue following WPRI's story Friday that the vendor already provided the data to the education department.
