The new Chancellor has reversed almost all of the tax cuts promised in last month's mini-Budget, denying taxpayers of thousands of pounds in savings. 
In a statement this morning Jeremy Hunt cut short support for households struggling with soaring energy bills, and shelved plans to cut dividend tax and reform controversial tax rules for the self-employed. He also scrapped the planned 1p cut in income tax "indefinitely", which was expected to come into force in April. 
The only two policies to remain intact was the recent cut to stamp duty and the reversal of the National Insurance hike.
