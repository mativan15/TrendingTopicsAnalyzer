Rich Kelleman is the co-founder and CEO of Bond Pet Foods, a Boulder, Colorado-based company that's making meat in a novel way for the pet food industry — brewing chicken, turkey, and beef instead of harvesting it conventionally on farms and fields.

The company is using precision fermentation, a food technology that has been used for more than half a century to produce a variety of commercial ingredients (think enzymes for cheese production, vitamin B12 and lactic acid.)But they're reassembling the process to instead harvest high-quality meat proteins that can serve as the foundation of nutritionally complete pet food recipes.
