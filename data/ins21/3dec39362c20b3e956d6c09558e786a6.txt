Francis Chmelir says St. Louis software firm LashBack has operated under the radar in St. Louis.

Before joining LashBack as its vice president of operations in 2017, Chmelir had his finger on the pulse of the city's technology industry as the leader of startup support group ITEN. But he says he still didn't have much familiarity with LashBack, which launched in 2003 and provides email compliance software.
