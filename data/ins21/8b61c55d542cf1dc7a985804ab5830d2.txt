Prime minister Narendra Modi, along with several captains of India Inc, will attend UP government's third 'ground breaking ceremony' on Friday to mark the beginning of commercial operations of about 1,400 industrial projects representing Rs 80,000 crore investment. The government claims the investments would generate 5 lakh employment opportunities, something that is expected to strengthen the claim of the Yogi Adityanath government of an improved investment climate in the state that has seen a 12 position jump in the ease of doing business rankings in 2020 to grab the ambitious second spot.
