KnowBe4 CEO Stu Sjouwerman is set to gain $112 million from the sale of his Clearwater-based cybersecurity company.

The company announced last week week it accepted a $4.6 billion take-private deal from Austin, Texas-based Vista Capital Partners, roughly a month after speculation about the sale began.

KnowBe4's sale itself is exceptional in that it continues to shine a light on the talent of Tampa Bay's tech scene. But more noteworthy is the potential for Sjouwerman to continue investing in the ecosystem — a move that has built other tech hubs into what they are today, including Silicon Valley and Boston.
