FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) -The German government needs to pump tens of billions of euros of additional funding into Uniper to weather a European gas crisis after a previous scheme to help the stricken gas importer was scrapped, two sources said on Thursday.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz agreed to nationalise Uniper in September, committing 29 billion euros ($28.4 billion) to prop up Germany's largest gas importer and prevent what it feared could be a Lehman style collapse of energy firms.

His ruling coalition had planned to supplement that support with funds raised through a gas levy that was subsequently scrapped, meaning the government will now have to commit additional funding separately.
