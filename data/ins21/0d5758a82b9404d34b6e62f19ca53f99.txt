As its final buildings complete construction, nearly all of the 1.1 million-square-foot Metro East Valley Commerce Center in Mesa is leased.

The recently completed phases three and four added five buildings and 406,000 square feet to the industrial park built by Tempe-based Metro Commercial Properties near U.S. 60 and Mesa Drive in Mesa. The five buildings ranged in size from 58,399 square feet to 112,097 square feet and are the final buildings planned at the park, which has been in the works since 2016.
