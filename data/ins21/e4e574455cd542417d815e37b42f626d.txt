UNLV was sailing along with a 4-1 SU/ATS through its first 5 games, including a nice 58-27 win over North Texas, unbeaten in Conference USA play, back on Sept. 17. However, the Rebels have been outscored 82-14 in their last 2 losses, bringing back those old feelings of frustration for the fanbase while casting doubt for bettors.
