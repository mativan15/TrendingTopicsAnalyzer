Ricky Yiu Poon-fai heads into Happy Valley on Wednesday night confident he can continue his impressive run of form. Champion trainer in 2019-20, Yiu is up to 41 winners for the campaign after Robot Warrior and Shining Gem saluted at Sha Tin on Sunday and he has sent out eight winners at the past seven meetings as he looks to finish the season strongly. 'The first half of the season was just average but I'm pretty satisfied with the second half,' Yiu said. With six runners at the midweek meeting, Yiu will be hopeful of gracing the winner's enclosure again with Nimble Nimbus, who is looking to continue his recent good form in the Class Three Caine Handicap (1,650m).
