MONTREAL - The head of BRP Inc. says supply chain woes crimped sales in its latest quarter, with more input obstacles expected on the Ski-Doo maker's path for the rest of the year.First-quarter revenues held steady but net income dropped by half from a year earlier due partly to plunging Sea-Doo and off-road vehicle sales prompted by supply disruptions.'The retail decline does not indicate the lack of consumer demand. Instead it reflects limited product availability,' CEO José Boisjoli told analysts on a conference call Friday.
