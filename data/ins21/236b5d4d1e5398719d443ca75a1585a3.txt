An eye disease drug from NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc. failed a mid-stage clinical trial, the company said early Monday, sending shares of the South San Francisco company falling to a new 52-week low ahead of an option decision by its Big Pharma partner.

The drug, called NGM-621, is part of a $450 million research-and-development deal with Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) originally signed in 2015 with a focus on NGM compounds in obesity, diabetes and the fatty liver disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH.
