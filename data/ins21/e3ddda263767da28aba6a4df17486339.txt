Till now it was believed that humans will get at least 17 hrs or more of warning time to prepare for a destructive solar storm. Now, it looks like a solar storm will hit without any warning. We have been reading or listening about the increase in solar activity over the last few months. NASA has reported a massive coronal mass ejection (CME) in early 2022. Space weather forecasts are expected to give us a day or two prior warning to prepare ourselves for the resultant solar storm. However, recent research suggests some massive solar storms could appear with no warning at all, New Scientist reports.
