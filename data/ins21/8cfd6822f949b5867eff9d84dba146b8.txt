Head of Republic Crypto Andrew Durgee reacted to predictions of a cryptocurrency market downturn on "Mornings with Maria" Friday, arguing there's "more pain to come" as the industry "matures" and starts to parallel traditional markets. CRYPTO ‘WINTER IS HERE': EXPERTANDREW DURGEE: I think there's potentially still some more pain to come. If you believe that there's going to be a further downturn in global markets at all, especially over the next couple of years, maybe until the next election cycle, I think that it's highly probable that the crypto markets will continue to follow suit with some of the traditional markets.
