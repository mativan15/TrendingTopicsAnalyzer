Amherstburg Town Council is discussing a $20,000 ask at a Monday meeting related to stepping up security when the Admirals hockey team play on home ice. A report [link: https://pub-amherstburg.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=9341 ]on the agenda says a group or groups of youth have been causing problems at the Libro Centre during the games since the last leg of the 2021 season. That problem is apparently getting worse and worse through time. Harassment of staff and patrons as well as vandalism of town facilities being perpetrated by a group, or groups, of youth, the report theorizes.
