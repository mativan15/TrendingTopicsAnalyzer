Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down as the Chief Operating Officer of Meta, 14 years after she joined the Facebook parent company.

The 52-year-old made the announcement in a post on her Facebook page Wednesday, explaining she plans to leave the company this fall but will remain on its board of directors.

"When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years. Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life," Sandberg wrote in the post, adding that she plans to marry her partner, Tom Bernthal, this summer.
