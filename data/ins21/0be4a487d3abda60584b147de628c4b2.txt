Next month in Davies Symphony Hall will begin its programming with both conductor and soloist making return visits to the San Francisco Symphony (SFS). Pianist Behzod Abduraimov made his SFS debut in March of 2018, performing Sergei Prokofiev's Opus 26 (third) piano concerto in C major under the baton of Michael Tilson Thomas. Juraj Valčuha, on the hand, has been visiting Davies since May of 2013, providing audiences with stimulating programming with a particular emphasis on Eastern European composers.
