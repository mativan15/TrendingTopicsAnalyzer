Collider.com The first look of Michael B Jordan and Jonathan Majors from the highly anticipated Creed III has been released, and they look chiseled and menacing, to say the least. In the first poster, we see Jordan sitting in the ring looking directly at us as the tagline declares 'You can't run...'; Majors as Anderson Dame takes a similar stance in his poster which reads "...from your past". While the character and plot details are currently being kept tightly under wraps all we can say is Dame looks like a fierce opponent for Creed.
