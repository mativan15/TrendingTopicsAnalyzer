Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in jail Friday for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House investigation into the Capitol riot, the first such sentence in over 50 years. He was also hit with a $6,500 fine.
Bannon has stated he intends to appeal the conviction because a federal judge ruled he could not argue at the trial that he considered his actions protected by Donald Trump's claim of executive privilege. Bannon was not remanded into custody on Friday, as the judge allowed him to file his appeal before serving the sentence.
