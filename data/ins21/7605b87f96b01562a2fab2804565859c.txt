The owners of Christopher's Restaurant announced Thursday they will be closing their doors next month.

The Kettering restaurant has been in business for 31 years.

According to the Facebook post, they will be closing the restaurant on East Dorothy Lane on June 15, 2022.

The decision comes after the owners could not reach a mutual agreement to renew their lease with the building's landlords.
