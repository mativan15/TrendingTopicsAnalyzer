U.S. airlines have committed to be carbon-neutral by 2050. That means finding sustainable aviation fuel sources.

But a new partnership announced last month could see "green" aviation fuel derived from Tar Heel State trees helping connect cities and countries around the world.

Last month, Enviva, which turns trees and wood products into pellets that are burnt for energy, announced a deal with Alder Fuels to supply up to 750,000 metric tons (2,204 pounds each) of wood biomass to the privately owned green crude producer beginning in 2024.
