Fashion house Balenciaga ended their collaboration with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, on Friday, according to the fashion house's parent company Kering, as a result of the music artist's recent controversy over his antisemitic rhetoric.

'Balenciaga has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist,' Kering told WWD.

West initially collaborated with Balenciaga earlier this year for a Yeezy Gap clothing line, CNN reported. West also said that he ended his collaboration efforts with Gap.
