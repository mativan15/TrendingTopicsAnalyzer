Dutch Princess Catharina-Amalia, the future queen of the Netherlands, has moved into a palace in The Hague and "can't really go outside" in a sharp reversal from her plans to attend college and live like a "regular student."

"It has enormous consequences for her life," Queen Maxima said at a news conference Thursday during a state visit to Sweden. "It means that she's not living in Amsterdam and that she can't really go outside."

The princess has made efforts to try and live a more normal life, such as foregoing her entitled allowance when she turned 18, a sum of roughly $1.
