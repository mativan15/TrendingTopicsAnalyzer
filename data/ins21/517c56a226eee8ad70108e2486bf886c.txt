The King of Rock 'n' Roll is the latest musician to get the biopic treatment - with his story told on screen for the first time with permission from his estate.It means the movie is chock full of Elvis's hits, but the darker side of his career also unfolds as the tale is told from the point of view of his manipulative manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who is later revealed to not be who he claims.
"Elvis was always in my life, but I had to find a way that I can make it useful for now," director Baz Luhrmann told Sky News at the film's London premiere on Tuesday.
