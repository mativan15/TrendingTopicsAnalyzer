A Portsmouth woman who caused a crash that killed a man and permanently disabled the man's wife as she fled from police during a high-speed chase last year was sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison.

Portsmouth Circuit Judge Johnny E. Morrison also placed Ciara Elliott on five years probation and ordered her not to drive for the first three years after her release.

Elliott, 29, pleaded guilty in February to involuntary manslaughter. The crime carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
