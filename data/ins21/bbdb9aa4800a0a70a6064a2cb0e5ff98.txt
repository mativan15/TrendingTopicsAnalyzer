Darwin Núñez is finally finding his scoring touch in his first season at Liverpool – just in time for the World Cup, too. With his first-half goal in a 1-0 win over West Ham in the Premier League on Wednesday, the Uruguay striker has now netted in three of his last four games for his best scoring run since joining Liverpool from Benfica. Núñez is showing he has the ability to score different types of goals, his latest seeing him get in between defenders to rise and glance home a fine header from a left-wing cross by Kostas Tsimikas in the 22nd minute.
