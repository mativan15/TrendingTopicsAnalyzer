NEW YORK, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street turned sharply lower on Wednesday in a decisive reversal of its recent multi-session rally, and Treasury yields resumed their ascent as dismal data and cautious corporate guidance dampened investor risk appetite.

All three major U.S. stock indexes were in the red, while the benchmark Treasury yield shot up to touch a new 14-year high.
