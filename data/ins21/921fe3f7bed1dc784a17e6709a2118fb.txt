MEDIA NOTE
OFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON
The United States is pleased to join the Freedom Online Coalition's consensus Joint Statement on Internet Shutdowns in Iran.
Begin Text:
We, the members of the Freedom Online Coalition, are deeply alarmed by and strongly condemn the measures undertaken by Iran to restrict access to the Internet following the nationwide protests over the tragic killing of Mahsa Amini. In furtherance of what has become a longstanding pattern of censorship, the Iranian government has to a large scale shut down the Internet yet again for most of its 84 million citizens nationwide by cutting off mobile data; disrupting popular social media platforms; throttling Internet service; and blocking individual users, encrypted DNS services, text messages, and access entirely.
