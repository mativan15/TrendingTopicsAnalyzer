Not all the bad guys in Georgia's Andersonville prison camp (as mentioned here Wednesday) were on the Confederate side of the American Civil War.The suffering of Union soldiers incarcerated there was compounded by the evildoing of fellow inmates. And the worst of those, reflecting the make-up of the prison population generally, included several Irishmen.Among the six eventually hanged for their crimes was a Sarsfield, a Sullivan, and a Delaney. There was a Collins too, although he had been born in England.
