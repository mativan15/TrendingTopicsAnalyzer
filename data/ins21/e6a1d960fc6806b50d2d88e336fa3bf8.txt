Tech giants like Facebook and TikTok should be given Ofcom safety ratings, says the mother of a 13-year-old boy murdered by teenagers in a plot hatched on social media.
Amanda Stephens, whose son Olly was lured to his death in a park by the teenagers, has worked with a leading think tank to produce a blueprint to protect children who are being routinely exposed to violence online.
The research by Crest Advisory, a specialist crime think tank, found that 31 per cent of under-18s had seen content showing fights, one in five (19 per cent) had experienced threats of assault or knife violence and one in seven (14 per cent) had viewed content about gangs.
