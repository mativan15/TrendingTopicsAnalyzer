BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Ernesto Valverde, the last coach to lead Barcelona to a Spanish league title, will make his first return to Camp Nou on Sunday in charge of Athletic Bilbao.Valverde was fired by Barcelona in January 2020 despite having won two consecutive league titles and with the team top of the standings. In 2 1/2 seasons, the mild-mannered Valverde was lauded for keeping Barcelona above Real Madrid in Spain despite the departure of Neymar, but his team's performances in knockout competitions led to his downfall.
