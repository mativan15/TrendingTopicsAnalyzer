Published: 02:00 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 02:00 EDT, 15 October 2022 The Diamonds have reportedly taken a stand against Netball Australia's new sponsor, mining giant Hancock Prospecting, after being addressed by former skipper Sharni Norder. The team, in New Zealand for the Constellation Cup series with game two in Tauranga on Sunday, are said to be concerned about the sponsor being branded across their uniforms. Late last month the cash-strapped organisation trumpeted a multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart.
