[JOINT PRESS CORPS] The Democratic Party (DP) forced a bill through committee that will prop up the rice market, which is the midst of a glut that could prove to be a state of permanent oversupply. On Wednesday, the National Assembly's Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Ocean and Fisheries Committee voted in favor of an amendment to the Grain Management Act that obligates the government to purchase excessive rice from local farms when rice production exceeds 3 percent of estimated consumption or when the price drops more than 5 percent from the average.
