The West Bengal government is planning to amend the law to remove Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar as 'visitor' of private universities in the state and appoint the education minister in his place, a senior official said on Saturday. A discussion in this regard was held during Thursday's state cabinet meeting and the process has already been started, he said. The development comes amid the state cabinet's decision to make Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee the chancellor of state-run varsities, replacing the governor.
