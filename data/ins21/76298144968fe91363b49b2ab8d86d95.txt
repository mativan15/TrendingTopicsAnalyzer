Sens. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) are calling on lawmakers to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) nationwide.
'This is an important moment to come together and finally treat health care above the neck the same as health care below the neck,' the senators wrote in a USA Today op-ed.
CCBHCs, which operate as non-profit organizations or part of a local government, provide a range of mental health and substance use disorder services and are particularly aimed at helping vulnerable individuals.
