'Don't take life so seriously, it isn't permanent'. So said a T-shirt sold by secondhand trader Rory Bruton at Portobello market in London. On a busy Friday, the stalls were awash with people swapping, selling and buying slogan T-shirts. 'They always sell really quickly,' says Bruton. 'The slogans are mostly pretty stupid but that's the appeal I suppose.'Bruton is one of the many retailers at the heart of a trend for vintage statement tees from the 70s, 80s and 90s. The Face magazine says they are 'all the rage at the moment' and i-D is calling them 'iconic'.
