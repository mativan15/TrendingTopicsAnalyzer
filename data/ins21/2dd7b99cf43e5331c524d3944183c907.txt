David Beckham was the ultimate big kid as he looked even more excited than daughter Harper during a trip to Disney World.
The former England star, 47, and wife Victoria Beckham, 48, took their two youngest children to the magical theme park in Florida this week as they enjoyed a family holiday together.
Spice Girl and businesswoman Victoria and footballer David were joined by Harper, 11, and Cruz, 17, on the trip, though Brooklyn, 23, and Romeo, 19, were absent.
Mum Victoria gave a shoutout to her sons as she posted snaps on Instagram however, writing: ‘Missing you!' as she posed in a Minnie Mouse headband with Harper giving the peace sign beside her.
