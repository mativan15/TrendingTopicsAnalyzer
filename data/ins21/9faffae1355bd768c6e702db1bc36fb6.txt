Mohammed Haneefa Nizamudeen Earlier this summer, I concluded that Alphatec (NASDAQ:ATEC) did not have my back, even as it has regained commercial traction within its spine business. Strong growth is unfortunately accompanied by poor margins, substantial losses and lack of operating leverage, which is creating real headaches given the prevailing cash burn and limited financing options. A Recap Alphatec is a smaller medtech player which operates in the global spine business, a huge business which is still dominated by industry giants like Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer (ZBH).
