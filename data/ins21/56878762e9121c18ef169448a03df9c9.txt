Microsoft is quietly making another round of job cuts to clip costs as even the biggest technology companies react to the financial storm clouds gathering over the global economy.
In the latest move, first reported by Axios, Microsoft is understood to be laying off fewer than 1,000 people across the organization at all levels, teams and geographic locations. The company didn't specify numbers or areas where the reduction in personnel is taking place.
"Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis ands make structural adjustments accordingly," said Microsoft in a statement.
