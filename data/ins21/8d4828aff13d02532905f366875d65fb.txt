SOBR Safe (NASDAQ:SOBR) stock stock climbed 15.8% premarket on Wednesday after the firm said a west coast commercial construction company will implement SOBRcheck as its new front line alcohol screening solution for its over 400 employees.
The construction firm is an established customer of SOBRsafe distributor Butterfield Onsite Drug Testing.
"With this first customer we launched our touch-based detection offering. Given the regional prominence of the customer, we expect this engagement will open doors to broader adoption," said Butterfield Onsite Drug Testing owner and CEO Tracie Butterfield.
