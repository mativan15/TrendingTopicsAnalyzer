MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The Antonio Conte effect is truly taking hold at Tottenham.

A 2-0 win against Everton on Saturday secured Tottenham's best start in the English Premier League era after 10 games.

Their 23 points moved Spurs level with second-placed Manchester City and represented their highest tally at this stage since 1963.

Spurs keep looking more like a genuine title contender, supported by their recent good record against City. Their first scheduled league meeting last month was postponed following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and Conte wasn't disappointed.
