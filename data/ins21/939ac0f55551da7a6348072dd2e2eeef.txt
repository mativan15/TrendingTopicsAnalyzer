Sigourney Weaver can't wait to see Selena Gomez's upcoming Working Girl movie.
 
Speaking to PEOPLE at Elle's Women in Hollywood Celebration in Los Angeles Monday, Weaver, 73, voiced her support for the "awesome" news of Gomez, 30, remaking her iconic film.
 
"I think she should do that," Weaver says. "I think it's time to bring it back for a new generation. And I think all of us who were in it will be very, very excited about seeing it."
 
A source confirmed news of the Gomez-led project back in August, revealing that the singer and Only Murders in the Building actress would produce a reboot of the Melanie Griffith-starring 1988 comedy classic.
