The Home Office is offering to fly asylum seekers back to the conflict zones they escaped from if they do not wish to be sent to Rwanda, the Guardian has learned.Documents issued to the first group of asylum seekers facing removal to the east African country state that the Home Office voluntary returns service can help them go back to their home country.The document adds: 'You have the option to leave the UK voluntarily. However, should you be removed it will be to Rwanda.'All of those who face being sent to Rwanda have had their asylum claims deemed ‘inadmissible' by the Home Office because of their method of reaching the UK – generally crossing the Channel in a dinghy.
