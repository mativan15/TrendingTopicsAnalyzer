The S&P 500 index has declined by 22.7% year to date, but strategists at Goldman Sachs think it's still too expensive. The large-cap index started the year with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21, a 91st percentile valuation since 1980, Goldman Sachs' strategists led by David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note dated Oct. 14. While the P/E ratio has since dropped to 15.8, it still stands at the 66th percentile. 'Despite elevated recession risk, geopolitical tension, and a generally murky macro outlook, the earnings yield gap — a common proxy for the equity risk premium — trades close to the tightest levels in 15 years,' the strategist team wrote.
