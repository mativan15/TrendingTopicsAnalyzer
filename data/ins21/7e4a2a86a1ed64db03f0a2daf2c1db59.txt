(NYSE:HIMS) lost ~4% pre-market Monday after Piper Sandler downgraded the digital health platform to Neutral from Overweight, citing its challenges in meeting Wall Street projections amid macro uncertainty. Despite HIMS' performance in Beauty & Wellness, "we have hesitations around a need for greater marketing spend limiting management's ability to scale and reach profitability when the Street is hoping for," the analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer wrote.
