FRANFURT/LONDON (Reuters) -Merck KGaA does not anticipate that a projected decline in smartphone sales this year will weigh on its semiconductor chemicals business any time soon, CEO Belen Garijo told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of mobile phones, the biggest driver of the microchip market, are forecast to fall 7.1% this year as consumers put device upgrades on hold due to inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China. The German conglomerate is a supplier of chemicals and materials used in making semiconductors.
