U.S. consumer confidence dipped in May after a slight increase the month before in the latest signal that Americans expect inflation to stick around for a while. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index released Tuesday indicated the May index dropped to 106.4 from 108.6 in April. The organization's Expectations Index – which assesses consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions – also declined, dropping to 77.5 to 79.
