Under the MOU, Standigm will accelerate its drug discovery research by adopting Merck's AI software SYNTHIA™. which can help Standigm's novel compound synthesis. SYNTHIA™ is a computer-aided retrosynthetic design tool and unites network theory, modern high-power computing, and expert chemical knowledge to rapidly design synthetic pathways.

"Applying AI to the drug discovery process can dramatically reduce time in discovering novel drug candidates and finding optimized synthesis paths," said Sojeong Yun, co-founder and CEO of Standigm.
