By PA Media Published: 04:54 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 04:54 EDT, 19 October 2022 Fire Brigades Union (FBU) chiefs have warned firefighters are being 'forced' to go to food banks and are struggling to pay their energy bills as they recommend members reject the latest 5% pay offer. The FBU consultative ballot will open on Monday, October 31 and close on Monday, November 14. If rejected, there will be a further ballot for strike action. Firefighters in Scotland will also demonstrate outside the Scottish Parliament on October 27 in what will be the largest FBU demonstration in many years.
