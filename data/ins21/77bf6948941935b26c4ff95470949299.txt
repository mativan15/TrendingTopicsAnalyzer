No one knows the travel landscape better than Condé Nast Traveler's Top Travel Specialists. That's why we, as editors, go to them for expert advice, trend forecasting, and for on-the-ground intel to find the people and places worth talking about. Our relationships with them is part of what makes our brand such an authority that has come to be one of the most trusted travel brands in the world.

So you might want to perk yourself up to read what was discussed in Condé Nast Traveler's fifth annual travel summit, Points of View—where our Top Travel Specialists gathered with Condé Nast Traveler editors and other prominent industry folks to discuss all things travel, from industry firsts to where people are traveling (and why!) to how to be more sustainable as a global citizen and a traveler.
