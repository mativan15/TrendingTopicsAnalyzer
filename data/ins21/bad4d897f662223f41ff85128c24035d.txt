The district sessions court in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram Wednesday dropped the charge of murder framed against IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman, who has been charge-sheeted for causing the death of a journalist in a drunken driving case in 2019.
The court acted upon discharge petitions moved by Venkitaraman and his co-accused Wafa Firoz, who was travelling with him on August 3, 2019, when the accident took place. The victim, K M Basheer, 35, was serving as the bureau chief of Siraj daily.
As the district court dropped Section 304, which is a non-bailable offence with up to ten years of imprisonment, of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the pending trial would be held in a chief judicial magistrate court.
