VPanteon Digital Turbine, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPS) has continued to underperform by -6.57%, since our previous Hold analysis in June 2022. In the meantime, with the worsening macroeconomics and analysts continually slashing estimates, we expect the stock market to remain pessimistic for a while longer. Other software/ mar-tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) have both embarked on cost-cutting strategies while laying off workers. Evidently, top-line growth continues to be impacted post-reopening cadence.
