A MAN who scooped thousands on the lottery claims his success was thanks to the unique and random way he picks his numbers.
Michael Jones, 52, won a whopping £22,350 on the Pick 5 lotto draw on October 8 after paying just 45p to play.

The electrician, from Baltimore, Maryland, said he had to do a double-take when he saw his numbers come up during the evening draw. 
He played the Pick 4 and Pick 5 games twice a day before his persistence finally paid off.
