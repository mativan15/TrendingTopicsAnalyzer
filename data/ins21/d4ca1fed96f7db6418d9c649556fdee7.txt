Plenty has been made of Tua Tagovailoa's arm strength, and whether or not the Miami Dolphins' starting quarterback has the ability to stretch the field with longer throws.
Even though Tagovailoa connected on a half dozen or so deep passes last season, his critics continue to question if his supposed arm limitations will limit Tyreek Hill's effectiveness.
Tagovailoa and Hill did their best to silence those concerns by connecting on two long passes during the 11-on-11 periods of Thursday's mandatory minicamp practice.
