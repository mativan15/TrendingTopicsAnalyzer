Liz Truss could abandon the state pension triple-lock to help plug the fiscal black hole after her disastrous mini-budget, leaving more than 12 million pensioners facing a real-terms cut in their incomes in April.The prime minister's official spokesperson refused four times on Tuesday to commit to keeping the pensions guarantee despite it being a key 2019 manifesto commitment and Truss confirming she would stick with it just two weeks ago.In contrast, Truss has backed off a plan to scrap the government's commitment to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030 – after the defence ministers Ben Wallace and James Heappey threatened to quit.
