BLACKSBURG, Va.— Hayden Schott belted a three-run home run in a five-run fifth inning and third-seeded Columbia thumped second-seeded Gonzaga 8-2 on Friday in the Blacksburg Regional.
Locked in a 1-1 tie, the Lions (31-16) had four straight hits, with an RBI single by Weston Eberly preceding Schott's blast, his 12th, to right field off of Bulldogs starter Gabe Hughes (8-3). Joshua Solomon had an RBI single after EJ Kreutzmann's double to make it 6-1.
Columbia will face the winner of Wright State-Virginia Tech, the fourth overall tournament seed, on Saturday after Gonzaga plays the loser.
