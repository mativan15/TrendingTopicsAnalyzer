General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the large adult son of Uganda's authoritarian president has threatened to invade Kenya, supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine and even offered 100 cows as dowry to marry Giorgia Meloni, Italy's new right-wing Prime Minister.

The tweets to his 600,000-plus followers have on occasion left Ugandan authorities playing damage control.

Even now that his father, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, has intervened and told him to stop, General Kainerugaba is still tweeting at a rate that would impress Donald Trump.
