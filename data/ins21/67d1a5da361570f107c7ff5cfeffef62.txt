WHATSAPP is making a huge change to the way you make phone calls.
Voice calls have been available on the app for years – but the feature is being tweaked.

The company is now testing a new update that lets you create links to join a call.
This allows WhatsApp to rival "meeting" apps like Google Meet or Zoom.
You can plan a call in the future at a certain time, rather than having to set it up in the moment.
The change was spotted by the tech investigators at WABetaInfo who found evidence of it in the beta trial version of WhatsApp.
