South Korean tech conglomerate Samsung has quietly announced a new entry-level smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy M13, and it's not part of the incredibly successful A series. According to GSM Arena, the phone is part of the much more confusing and less well defined M family. As the first digit strongly implies, this is a basic smartphone which should be rather affordable, although Samsung hasn't actually unveiled a price for it. The phone comes with a 6.6-inch FHD+ screen with a V-shaped notch, the Exynos 850 chipset at the helm, 4GB of RAM, 64 or 128GB of expandable storage, and a 5,000 mAh battery.
