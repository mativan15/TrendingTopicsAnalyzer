The first director of Minneapolis' Office of Violence Prevention, Sasha Cotton, will soon leave her job with the city to work for a national organization promoting similar programs. Cotton, who led the office through its creation and rapid expansion, will become deputy director for the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College of Criminal Justice based in New York City. In that role, she'll help other communities across the country and abroad build out programs that aim to stop cycles of violence before they repeat.
