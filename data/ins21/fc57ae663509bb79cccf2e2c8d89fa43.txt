Abseiling protesters have closed Wellington's Mount Victoria tunnel by dropping a sign into traffic. Police closed the road just after 9am after abseiling protesters from the group Restore Passenger Rail lowered a banner into traffic. Four police officers are talking to protesters. Group spokesman James Cockle said there was an expectation from the protesters that police would block the road if they were hanging above it as they now were.
