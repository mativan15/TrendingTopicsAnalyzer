According to the Hindu calendar, Diwali or Deepawali falls on the 15th day in the month of Kartik and this year the festival of lights will be celebrated in India on October 24. While diyas, fairylights, lamps, firecrackers and rangoli are common sights on Deepawali, the Hindu festival is celebrated in varied ways in different parts of the country.For Hindus in Northern India, Diwali symbolises the return of Ram with wife Sita and brother Laxman to Ayodhya after being exiled for 14 years. When he returned, Ram was welcomed home with diyas and fireworks which were lighted throughout the kingdom since it was a new moon day in the month of Kartik season and it was dark all around.
