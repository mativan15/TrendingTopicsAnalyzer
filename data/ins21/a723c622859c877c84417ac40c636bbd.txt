A popular device used to locate lost items like keys, a wallet, or a bag, is being used by some Americans to track their loved ones with dementia, a report says.  "Caregivers have turned to Apple's tiny, $29 tracking devices after finding other methods of monitoring people with dementia aren't a fit, or are too expensive. Many tracking apps require people to have their phones with them. People with dementia might forget them when they leave the house, say caregivers. They do tend to remember keys and wallets, however, to which the AirTags were designed to attach," The Wall Street Journal reports.
