President Joe Biden has pledged he will refrain from meddling on interest-rate policy ahead of a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Biden said he would stand aside and let the Fed do its job — though he also put the blame for rising prices on the institution. 'The Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation. My predecessor demeaned the Fed, and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation,' Biden wrote.
