Superhero fans on the far-right political spectrum have one less movie to get excited about, putting their options for hateful heroes to—well—none. As first reported by The Daily Beast, a movie that was set to give us a big-screen rendition of an 'anti-woke superhero' is shuttered, and the thousands of dollars fans invested in the project likely won't be coming back to them, according to a video sent to fans and posts on the creator's blog.The film, called Rebel's Run, was headed by exemplar of right-wing harassment campaigns Theodore Beale, who goes by 'Vox Day' online.
