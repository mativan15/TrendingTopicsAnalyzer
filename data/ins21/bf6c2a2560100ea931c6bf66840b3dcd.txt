Even the best stock pickers will make plenty of bad investments. Anyone who held The AZEK Company Inc. (NYSE:AZEK) over the last year knows what a loser feels like. In that relatively short period, the share price has plunged 50%. We wouldn't rush to judgement on AZEK because we don't have a long term history to look at. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 25% in the last 90 days. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted.
