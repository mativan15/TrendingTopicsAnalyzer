PHILADELPHIA -- Both the Padres and Phillies entered this year's National League Championship Series with their rotations lined up perfectly -- but that doesn't mean there won't be some tough decisions in the days ahead.
In a typical best-of-seven series, a club's Game 3 starter is available to start a potential Game 7 on regular rest, with the Game 4 starter also an option on short rest. But without an off-day between Games 5 and 6 (if necessary) in the LCS this season, that's not the case.
Neither Padres manager Bob Melvin nor Phillies manager Rob Thomson named a Game 4 starter during Thursday's workout day at Citizens Bank Park.
