Defending her actions in Telangana and the Union Territory of Puducherry, Telangana Governor and Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Thursday maintained that she was 'not interfering' in the administration.
While hitting out at Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao, she said her action of taking a train to the flood-affected Bhadrachalam in July forced the Chief Minister, who was 'sleeping' in his bungalow in the State capital, to visit there.
