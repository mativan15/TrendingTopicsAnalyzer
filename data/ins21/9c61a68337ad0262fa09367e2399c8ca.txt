Investors in US stocks on Friday put an end to the market's longest weekly losing streak in more than 20 years amid fresh signs that inflation is finally easing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which has been in a bear market , secured their first weekly advances after seven weeks of losses. The S&P 500's run lower was the longest such streak since 2001. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its first weekly win after eight weeks of declines. Stock trading in the US will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.
