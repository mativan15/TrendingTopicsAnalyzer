A couple in England had the surprise of a lifetime when they discovered a stash of rare coins underneath the kitchen floorboards during a renovation project.Gregory Edmund, an auctioneer and British coin specialist at Spink and Son, said that the coins were discovered by the North Yorkshire couple, who initially thought they had stumbled on a piece of electrical cable while working on their 18th century home in 2019.'Why they decided to touch it who knows, but when they did, they realized it was a gold disc and there were hundreds more beneath!' Edmunds said in an email.
