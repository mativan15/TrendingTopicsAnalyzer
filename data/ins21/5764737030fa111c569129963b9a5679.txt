The partner of an Australian journalist detained in China says she is not allowed to speak to her family.Cheng Lei's partner Nick Coyle says her health has deteriorated because of a poor diet inside prison.Discussing restrictions imposed by Chinese authorities, Mr Coyle said: 'She's been able to make no phone calls with anybody. She's had maybe three visits from her lawyer, just to prepare for the trial.'She's had not one phone call with family, with her children. Nothing. nada.'She joked with me in one of the consular visits in one of her messages to me that my Starbucks coffee, I spent more on that, than her week's worth of food.
