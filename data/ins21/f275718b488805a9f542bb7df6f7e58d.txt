Fox Business Network celebrated its 15th anniversary last week, forever changing the way business news is consumed as the launch of FBN coincided with the ability for investors to educate themselves on social media.  "There's definitely been an information boom," FBN host Charles Payne told Fox News Digital. "There's a race to get out the information. There's also a race for eyeballs," he continued, adding "in some respects, financial media in general has made it tougher for investors" due to having so much information available on their phones.
