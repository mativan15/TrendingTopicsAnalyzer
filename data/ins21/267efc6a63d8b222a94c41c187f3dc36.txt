DETROIT – Cadillac is testing the limits of its brand allure and pricing power with the 2024 Celestiq – a large, bespoke electric car that will start at more than $300,000.

The vehicle – unveiled Monday night – launches the General Motors brand into the ultra-luxury segment against the likes of Bentley and Rolls-Royce. It's something no American brand has successfully done in modern times.

Executives say the vehicle is more about creating a "halo car" that helps burnish Cadillac's image, rather than fueling overall sales or profits.
