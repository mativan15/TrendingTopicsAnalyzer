Nets star Kyrie Irving pushed back on the notion he is attempting to change the narrative surrounding him as a bad teammate.

Even though he said that narrative cost him on Media Day.

One day after starting center Nic Claxton said Irving 'is ready to change the narrative on himself,' the All-Star guard said there's a 'very small level of focus over here, if any, on changing the narrative.'

'My focus is not there,' he told reporters at Nets practice on Tuesday. 'I can't even pour energy into that.
