Jun. 4—At the corner of Stadium Way and Grand Avenue, Dissmore's IGA has been a part of the Pullman community since the first half of the 20th century. Having been in operation for 85 years, the store has become a Pullman landmark, watching Washington State University grow and seeing parts of the town develop around it.

The store has been sold to Rosauers Supermarkets, Dissmore's announced on its Facebook page Friday. The space will undergo extensive remodeling this August to prepare for its new life as a Rosauers store.
