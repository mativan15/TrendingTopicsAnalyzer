Bam Adebayo reiterated going into Wednesday night's Miami Heat opener against the Chicago Bulls at FTX Arena that getting to the foul line more often stands as a prime priority.

'Just assaulting the rim, really forcing the refs to make a decision,' the Heat center said. 'I just keep constantly putting that assault on the rim. You know, obviously doing it in an intelligent way. You know, when we're in the bonus, get sneaky fouls and just trying to, I guess you would say, manipulate the game.'

Adebayo averaged a career-high 6.
