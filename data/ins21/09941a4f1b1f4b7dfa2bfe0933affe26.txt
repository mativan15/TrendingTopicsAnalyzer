Drew Angerer/Getty Images News Investment Thesis NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is slated to report its FQ1'22 earnings release on June 9, as investors anticipate the company's Q2 guidance given its recent May 2022 delivery update. We discussed in our previous article (Buy rating) that the market has already been looking forward to its H2'22 recovery, despite facing significant challenges in April due to the onset of the COVID lockdowns.
