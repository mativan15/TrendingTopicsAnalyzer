Jun. 5—The roof of the Newton YMCA is almost completely covered by solar panels. As CEO Lucas Hughes and property manager Kevin Clark navigate their way through the maze of machinery late Tuesday morning, they say there are more than 500 panels installed. Simultaneously, they check their phones.

Using an application called SolarEdge, the two can see just how much of an impact the new solar panel project has had on the facility. Clark loves to check the data every morning. The overcast skies on this particular morning meant the panels were not producing as much energy, but the facility is still saving money.
