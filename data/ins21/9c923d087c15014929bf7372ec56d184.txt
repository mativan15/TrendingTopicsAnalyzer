 Republican senators have put forward a bill that would make it illegal for app stores in the US to offer software that accepted payments made with China's new digital currency over national security concerns.The ‘digital Yuan' or ‘e-CNY' is a centralized, cash-like digital currency with a value tied to the physical Yuan and was launched by the Chinese government earlier this year as an alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies.Consumers are promised the same convenience and anonymity that cryptocurrencies promise but, because it still controlled by a central bank rather than a distributed ledger, authorities still retain control over value and can obtain enough data to tackle illegal activities such as money laundering.
