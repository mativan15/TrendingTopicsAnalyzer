A restaurant specializing in breakfast, lunch and mimosas is taking over a vacant space in a Cameron Park shopping center.

Burke Junction is a Western-themed town center located off Highway 50 in Cameron Park that features a combination of restaurants, retailers and offices.

Bill Glasser, a managing partner with the shopping center, said a new restaurant tenant signed a lease last week to take over the former Sister's Cafe space at 3300 Coach Lane in Cameron Park. The former cafe ceased operations about two weeks ago, he said.
