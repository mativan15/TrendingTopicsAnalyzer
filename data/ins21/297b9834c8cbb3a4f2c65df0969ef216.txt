"Top Gun: Maverick" soared to the top of the box office this past weekend, smashing a 15-year record for Memorial Day Weekend — but one AMC (AMC) bear is still not changing his outlook quite yet."At this point, it doesn't really change our view," Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon, who maintains an underperform rating on the stock with a 12-month price target of $6 a share, told Yahoo Finance in a new interview (video above)."We're sticking with our forecast for 2022 and 2023," the analyst added, noting how May's total box office figures lagged pre-pandemic levels by 30% with the theater chain's Q1 revenue dropping 35% compared to 2019.
