Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose on Thursday even as investment firm Evercore pointed out that growth in App Store revenue is still "muted" and the company will need "new drivers" for its services business to boost growth. DKart/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Analyst Amit Daryanani, who rates Apple (AAPL) shares outperform with a per-share price target of $210, noted that App Store revenue grew just 4% in May, citing third-party data, compared to the 9% growth seen in April, below the firm's expectations as comparisons should start to get easier.
