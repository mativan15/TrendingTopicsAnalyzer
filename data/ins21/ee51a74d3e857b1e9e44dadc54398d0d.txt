It was a double mitzvah, the New York Post concluded: A couple tuned in online to Shabbat services at their Minnesota synagogue, then stripped and started engaging in sexual activity.

The tabloid's story about the May 14 incident broke this weekend and immediately went viral among Jews and others who delighted in the writer's use of 'Debbie does Deuteronomy.' (The week's Torah portion was actually from a different book of the Bible, Leviticus, but who's counting?)

'I'd like to nominate this story as a candidate for journalism's sorely-needed distinction in pun-writing prize,' tweeted Erin Einhorn, a Jewish journalist in Detroit.
