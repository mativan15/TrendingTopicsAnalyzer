Liz Truss threatened disciplinary action against Tory MPs who failed to back her in a crunch Commons vote as she sought on Thursday to restore authority to her crisis and chaos-hit Government and to stay in No10.However, her future as Prime Minister remained in severe doubt after a major revolt on fracking which the whips said was being treated as a 'confidence' motion in the Government, the axing of Home Secretary Suella Braverman, and suspension of a senior No10 aide who allegedly briefed against former Cabinet minister Sajid Javid.
