A food safety watchdog is warning against eating food past use-by dategetty
In the midst of the UK's current cost-of-living crisis, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has warned consumers against eating food past its use-by date and switching off their fridge or freezer to save money. The food safety watchdog (whose remit covers England, Northern Ireland and Wales) has discovered Britons are taking more risks due to rapidly-snowballing financial pressures. A survey found 32% of people had eaten food past its use-by date at least once in the past month because they could not afford to buy more, while 18% had turned off a fridge or freezer to save money as energy costs rise.
