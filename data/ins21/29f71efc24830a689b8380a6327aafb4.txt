"Indonesia's tier-2, tier-3 cities, and rural area's GDP per capita are 3-5 times lower than Jakarta, yet the cost of consumer goods is higher by 20-200%. In fact, more than 30% of Indonesia's GDP came from East Java, Kalimantan, and East Indonesia. Super is going after a huge untapped market; thus, we will deploy this investment to enable equitable access for people in Kalimantan, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Papua over the next few years. We will help more multinational, and provincial FMCG suppliers tap into new markets in rural areas and empower more community leaders to optimize their income and have a better quality of life," said Steven Wongsoredjo, CEO and Co-Founder of Super.
