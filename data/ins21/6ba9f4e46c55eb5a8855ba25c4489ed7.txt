Wheat flour manufacturers have demanded that the government announce the open market sale of 4 million metric tonnes of wheat in November and begin the tendering process in December to keep wheat prices under control. The Centre stopped the sale of wheat in the open market for the first time in more than a decade, as government procurement fell by about 56% in the 2021-22 marketing season. Representatives of Roller Flour Millers' Federation of India (RFMFI) met officials of the food ministry and Food Corporation of India (FCI) on Tuesday where the demand was raised.
