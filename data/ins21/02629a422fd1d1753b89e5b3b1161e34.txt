India's competition regulator has ordered Alphabet Inc's Google to change its approach to its Android platform and fined the United States tech company 13.38 billion Indian rupees ($161.95m) for anti-competitive practices.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday said Google leveraged its dominant position in markets, such as online search and the app store for Android, to protect the position of its apps like Chrome and YouTube in mobile web browsers and online video hosting.
CCI also restricted Google from certain revenue-sharing agreements with smartphone makers, noting that such practices helped Google to secure exclusivity for its search services 'to the total exclusion of competitors'.
