Zach Wilson and the Jets ought to know what's coming when they face the Broncos on Sunday in Denver. 
If the Denver defense doesn't stack the box to stop the Jets rushing attack and dare Wilson, the Jets quarterback to beat them, it will be a shock to everyone. 
The 4-2 Jets, winners of their past three games, have won with the run and stout defense. Wilson has been a passenger along for the ride, having thrown only 18 passes last week in Green Bay, completing 10 for just 110 yards. 
And he's fine with those numbers as long as the team keeps winning.
