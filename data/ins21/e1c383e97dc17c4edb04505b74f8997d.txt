Home Secretary Priti Patel has announced the first deportation flight to Rwanda will leave the UK on June 14. A group of asylum seekers have been sent formal notices by the Home Office advising they will be relocated to the east African country, officials have said. It comes after the Government announced a deal with Rwanda last month, which will see asylum seekers processed in the east African country. However, various concerns have been raised about the plan, and the policy will likely come under legal challenge.
