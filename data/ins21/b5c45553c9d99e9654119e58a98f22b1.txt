NEW DELHI: Giving support to IT heavyweights such as Infosys and Wipro that are opposing the concept of moonlighting, C N Ashwath Narayan - Karnataka 's minister for IT, electronics & skills development - has said that paid freelancing beyond office work hours is "literally cheating" and professionals wanting to do that should shift out of the state."As a policy and ethically, how can moonlighting be allowed? It is not fair in any way to have moonlighting. That's not the way forward... It is literally cheating," Narayan told TOI while taking a jibe at those looking to work the extra hours beyond their regular jobs.
