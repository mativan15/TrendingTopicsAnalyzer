By James Glynn SYDNEY--The Reserve Bank of Australia slowed the rate at which it has been raising interest rates earlier this month, but it could still outpace its global central bank peers over coming months if conditions warrant, RBA Deputy Governor Michelle Bullock said Tuesday. "The Reserve Bank Board is making monetary policy decisions 11 times a year so it is regularly discussing the evidence on the economy and has more flexibility on the size and timing of rate increases," Ms. Bullock said in a speech to a finance industry conference.
