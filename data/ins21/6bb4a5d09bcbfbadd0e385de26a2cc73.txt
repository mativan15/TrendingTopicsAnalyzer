Mikel Arteta has defended the decision to play Bukayo Saka in Arsenal's Europa League win over PSV Eindhoven.

The England forward had missed just 179 minutes of club football this season before the 1-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium put the Gunners into the knockout stages.

Granit Xhaka scored the only goal of the game, with Saka once again the bright spark, although there was cause for concern when he went down injured shortly after the hosts had taken the lead.

With the World Cup kicking off in two months, Saka's form and fitness will continue to be closely monitored by England supporters.
