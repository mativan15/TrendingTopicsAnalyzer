The Jets will be without one of their top receivers against the Broncos Sunday.

Elijah Moore will not travel with the rest of the Jets to Denver it was announced a day after his trade request. He will stay in Florham Park and train with the performance team and will rejoin the team on Monday.

'To ask him to play a football game from where he is from a mental standpoint wouldn't be fair to him, in my opinion,' Jets coach Robert Saleh said. 'But that is strictly my decision.'

It's been an eventful week for Moore despite the Jets' surprising 4-2 start.
