As with any new technological advance, there isn't going to be a straight, upwards trajectory of growth in the metaverse, says Venus Dhuria, co-founder of app developer AppyHigh. Among the things that could keep that arrow from trending upwards are universal questions that have faced new technologies since, probably, the taming of fire: What will it be used for, and how will experience providers keep users safe? How will the quality of experience be standardised? How many will pay for this new advance, and how often? What is certain is that the metaverse is a chance for a do-over in the virtual world.
