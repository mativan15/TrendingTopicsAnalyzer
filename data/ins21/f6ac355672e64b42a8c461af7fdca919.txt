Hollyoaks fans had better stock up on the tissues, as Luke Morgan's (Gary Lucy) final scenes are rapidly approaching. 
Luke, as fans of the Channel 4 soap know, is battling Frontotemporal dementia, FTD, after being diagnosed over two years ago. 
His behaviour has noticeably changed, and recent scenes have seen him act impulsively and show zero signs of remorse for his actions, which is a symptom of the condition.
Gary Lucy, who has played Luke on and off since 1999, has his own personal experiences with dementia, as his Nan has battled the illness for 12 years, something this largely inspired his character's storyline.
