BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Monday approved a military training mission in Europe for thousands of Ukrainian troops and a plan to provide around 500 million euros ($486 million) in extra funds to help buy weapons for the war-torn country. The mission, which will have a headquarters in Brussels and be under the command of French naval officer Vice Adm. Herve Blejean, will initially run for two years with a budget of almost 107 million euros ($104 million). EU headquarters said in a statement that the mission's aim is to allow the Ukrainian armed forces to 'effectively conduct military operations,' so that Ukraine can 'defend its territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, effectively exercise its sovereignty and protect civilians.
