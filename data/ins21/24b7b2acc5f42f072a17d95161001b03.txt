WuXi Biologics (OTCPK:WXXWY, OTCPK:WXIBF) We had previously owned shares in the China-based provider of outsourced research and manufacturing services for biotech firms but sold it in the second quarter of 2019 on concerns that potential US trade restrictions might hamper its ability to compete for contracts from US firms. We bought back shares after a sharp price correction in the first quarter of 2021. Because the company has enjoyed burgeoning demand for its services, it has achieved extraordinary revenue and earnings growth in the past few years.
