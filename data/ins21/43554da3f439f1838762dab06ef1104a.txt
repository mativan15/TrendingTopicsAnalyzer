(Bloomberg) -- China's factory activity in May contracted from the previous month as both production and new orders fell, although the slowdown wasn't as fast as in April, a private gauge showed Wednesday.The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.1 last month from April's 46 -- still below 50, the dividing line that separates expansion from contraction, Caixin and S&P Global said in a statement. That was worse than the marginal improvement to 49 that economists had expected in a Bloomberg survey.
