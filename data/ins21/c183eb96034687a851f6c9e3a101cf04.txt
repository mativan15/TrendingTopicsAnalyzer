Bengaluru: The non-compete clause in its offer letters is to ensure business confidentiality and is a common practice among information technology (IT) companies in India, said in a letter dated May 24 to the deputy chief labour commissioner in New Delhi. This came in response to calls for discussions on the issue after Pune-based labour union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate urged the labour ministry in April to ask the Bengaluru-based IT services provider to remove the clause in its employment contracts.
