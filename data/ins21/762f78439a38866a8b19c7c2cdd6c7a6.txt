One of the biggest knocks on Washington Commanders quarterback Taylor Heinicke is his arm strength. Heinicke's lack of arm strength limited Washington's playbook in 2021, despite the quarterback's knowledge of offensive coordinator Scott Turner's offense.

With starting quarterback Carson Wentz sidelined for at least a few weeks with a fractured finger on his throwing hand, Heinicke is back in the lineup. He met with the media after practice Wednesday and believes being thrust into the lineup in Week 1 last season benefitted him.
