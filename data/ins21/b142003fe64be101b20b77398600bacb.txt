ATHERTON – A sunken yacht. Made-up Asian mobsters. A history of murder. A neighbor who complained about 'all that excavating.'
As police swarmed a $15 million Atherton mansion on Friday where a landscaping crew dug up a buried Mercedes a day earlier and cadaver dogs hit on 'possible human remains,' intriguing details of a past owner were unearthed as well.
Johnny Lew, who neighbors say built the 12,000 square-foot French-style estate in the early 1990s on Stockbridge Avenue and died years ago, had a history of violence and skullduggery.
