Early voting is underway in Georgia for the general election on Tuesday, Nov. 8. Now, all eyes are on a tight race that could shift power in the U.S. Senate.

It's between Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, who is currently involved in a scandal relating to claims he paid for a woman's abortion more than a decade ago.

Action News Jax was at a Camden County early voting site in Kingsland, where several voters took advantage of the option to cast their ballot now.
