Jeremy Hunt insisted on Sunday that Liz Truss is still in charge of her Government, as he signalled plans to effectively scrap the economic vision that brought her to power.

The new Chancellor, brought in to replace the sacked Kwasi Kwarteng and restore credibility to Downing Street, is now widely seen as the most powerful figure in Government as he attempts to reshape the Prime Minister's own economic plans to reassure the markets.

He told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Ms Truss remains 'in charge' and insisted voters can still put their faith in her.
