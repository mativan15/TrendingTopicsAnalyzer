Phone scammers pretending to be with the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office have been targeting the county's sex offenders, according to the sheriff's office.

'The targets of the scam, mostly registered offenders, were called and told they needed to resubmit a DNA sample or face 90 days in jail,' the sheriff's office said in a news release. 'The scammers then offer to waive the jail time and testing if the individual pays a fine.'

In an email, Lt. Benjamin Blick said the scammers would ask for $5,000.
