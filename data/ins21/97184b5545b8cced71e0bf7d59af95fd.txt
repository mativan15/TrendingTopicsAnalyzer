Lord's FA stunned Gokulam Kerala 5-2 to win the Kerala Women's League here on Sunday. Win Theingi Tun was the architect of Lord's victory against the reigning Indian Women League champion.It was also a sweet revenge for Lord's, which had gone down 1-5 to Gokulam, the home side, a few days ago. Lord's thus has qualified for the Indian Women's League.Win, the striker from Myanmar, scored four goals, including an old-fashioned hat-trick. It was Gokulam that took the lead though, in the 22nd minute, with Vivian Adjei shooting a rebound into an empty net.
