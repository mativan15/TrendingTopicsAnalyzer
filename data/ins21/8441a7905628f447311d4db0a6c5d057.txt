Sen. Charles Grassley is calling on the FBI to disclose records that he says will show the Biden family engaging in potentially criminal pay-to-play business deals in China.

The Iowa Republican says it's not clear whether those records have been shared with the federal prosecutor investigating presidential son Hunter Biden.

In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, Mr. Grassley said several whistleblowers have contacted him about specific potentially incriminating documents that the FBI possesses.
