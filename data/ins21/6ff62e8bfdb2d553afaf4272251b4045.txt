The all-new "watchlist" functionality sends alerts and helps to identify possible risks with VASPs for banks and FIs.

AMSTERDAM, Oct. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Crystal team is introducing new functionality in BETA that allows for VASP checks. This all-new feature will enable users (typically financial institutions) to add VASP entities for detailed activity monitoring to identify possible risks. The new tool has a watchlist, two compliance risk alerts, activity monitoring alerts, and stats. A watchlist is a set of entities selected by the user, for each of which constant checks are carried out by the rules specified by the user in Alert Settings.
