foto_abstract/iStock via Getty Images In July 2020, Preferred Bank (NASDAQ:PFBC) piqued my interest as the bank provided additional clarity on one of the larger loans that suddenly became non-performing. And almost exactly one year ago, I argued it made sense to move to the sidelines as the shares returned in excess of 70%. We are now one year and three days later and Preferred Bank is trading at almost exactly the same share price as in May 2021. Sure, the share price has reached a high of almost $82, but the recent share price decrease makes this bank more appealing thanks to is strong loan book and very strong and conservative underwriting policy.
