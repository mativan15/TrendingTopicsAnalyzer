It seemed unlikely that the conclusion to last season's Women's National League title race, when Shelbourne pipped Peamount United on the final day, would ever be topped, but the current four-way chase for the crown is shaping up to be even more dramatic.With two games left to play, Wexford Youths hold the advantage at the top, but they are just a point clear of Shelbourne and three ahead of Peamount and Athlone Town.All four teams won their games on Saturday, a Kylie Murphy hat-trick sending Wexford on their way to a 5-2 win at home to Sligo Rovers.
