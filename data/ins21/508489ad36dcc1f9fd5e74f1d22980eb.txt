Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.66%)(BRK.B 0.88%) CEO Warren Buffett has a knack for making money. Since taking the reins as CEO in 1965, he's created more than $690 billion in value for shareholders (himself included), and overseen an aggregate return of 3,641,613% for the company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of Dec. 31, 2021. That's a 20.1% annualized return over 57 years, for those of you keeping score at home.
Considering how successful the Oracle of Omaha has been as an investor, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Wall Street and Main Street closely monitor the stocks he buys and sells.
