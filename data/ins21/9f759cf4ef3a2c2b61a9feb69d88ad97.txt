At TechCrunch Disrupt, Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu dropped two bits of news about the streaming giant's foray into games. Verdu said that Netflix is "seriously exploring a cloud gaming offering." The company will also open a new gaming studio in Southern California.

"It's a value add. We're not asking you to subscribe as a console replacement," Verdu said on stage. "It's a completely different business model. The hope is over time that it just becomes this very natural way to play games wherever you are.
