Looks like Elon Musk is not a fan of remote working, giving Tesla employees an ultimatum — come into the office or leave.
In a leaked email sent on Tuesday, the billionaire told Tesla's executive staff that they could only work remotely if they put in 40 hours a week in the office.
‘This is less than we ask of factory workers,' Musk said in the alleged email.
For ‘particularly exceptional contributors', the billionaire said he would review and approve them himself.
The email also stated that the ‘office' must be a main Tesla office and not a remote branch office that was unrelated to job duties.
