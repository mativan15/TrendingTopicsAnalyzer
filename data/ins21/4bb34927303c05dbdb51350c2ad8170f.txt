Messaging service provider, Snapchat has released a host of features just ahead of Diwali. Its community-driven entertainment video platform, Spotlight is hosting a #LightUpSpotlight showcase where users can share their Diwali-themed videos. The theme could be your favourite sweets, gifts, group of friends, dance videos, or almost anything and everything Diwali. All tabs in the app also have something related to the Diwali festival. A user can photograph a shop in his locality that delights the family with delectables and light up the shop in the photograph by sticking diyas or fireworks.
