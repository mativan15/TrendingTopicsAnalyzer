NAIROBI -The chair of the African Union on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ethiopia's Tigray region and urged parties in the two-year-old conflict to agree to direct peace talks.

The Ethiopian government and its allies have been fighting Tigray forces on and off since late 2020. The violence has killed thousands of civilians and uprooted millions, with hundreds of thousands now facing possible famine.

Both sides have blamed each other for starting the conflict.AU chair Moussa Faki said he was following reports of escalating violence in Tigray with grave concern.
