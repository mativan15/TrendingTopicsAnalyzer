Russia's central bank has hinted that it will allow the use of cryptocurrency for international payments, indicating that this must come as a possible relaxation of its opposition to digital assets. 
"In principle, we do not object to the use of cryptocurrency in international transactions," the central bank's First Deputy Governor Ksenia Yudaeva said in a press briefing on Tuesday, as per a Reuters report. 
However, Yudaeva emphasized that the bank, as a regulating authority, will continue to see the wider use of cryptocurrency in Russia as a financial threat.
