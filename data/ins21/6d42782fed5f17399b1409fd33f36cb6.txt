At least 21 people were killed in two separate bombings in the central Hirshabelle state of Somalia, officials said.
A powerful car bomb exploded in Jalalaqsi town when soldiers operating a security checkpoint intercepted a vehicle. The checkpoint is near local government buildings and a military base belonging to African Union peacekeepers from Djibouti.
'At around 2:30 p.m., a vehicle arrived at the checkpoint, one of the soldiers collecting taxation pointed a gun and stopped it,' said Mire Hussein Siyad, deputy district commissioner of Jalalaqsi.
