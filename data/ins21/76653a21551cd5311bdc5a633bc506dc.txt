The triple lock on the state pension looks safe — for now. But that does not mean future changes are not afoot.On Wednesday the then prime minister, Liz Truss, said the government remained 'completely committed' to the triple lock, which guarantees to increase the state pension by 2.5 per cent, the rise in average earnings or inflation, whichever is highest. But after her resignation the following day and the likelihood that we will be getting a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister, there may well be time for another U-turn yet.
