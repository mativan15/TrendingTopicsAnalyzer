A small restaurant opening inside UTSA's new School of Data Science and National Security Collaboration Center belies large ambitions for a local catering company.

The Eatery, a concept from the Johnny Hernandez -led catering company True Flavors,is set to open alongside the UTSA facility in January.

It's a small space — about 1,300 square feet — that's expected to punch above its weight as a strategic key for business growth: If you like their food while grabbing a quick lunch at work, you might be enticed by the larger, flagship restaurants of sister company Grupo La Gloria, which has locations all over the city.
