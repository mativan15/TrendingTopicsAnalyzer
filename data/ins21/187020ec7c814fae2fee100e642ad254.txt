HUNDREDS of perfectly preserved mummies inside painted sarcophagi have been unearthed in Egypt's "city of the dead".
A cache of sarcophagi and bronze statuettes – including one of pioneering architect Imhotep – were unveiled by Egyptian authories on Monday at the Saqqara archaeological site south of Cairo.
