An undercover comedian crashed the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Houston, Texas, and sarcastically thanked the organization's president for his repeated 'thoughts and prayers' following deadly mass shootings across the US over the years, including one just three days previously where 21 people were killed at a school across the state.Jason Selvig of the Good Liars, which pranks public figures, stood up to speak when NRA members were allowed to address the group's chief executive since 1991, Wayne LaPierre, according to a social media video posted by the comedy group.
