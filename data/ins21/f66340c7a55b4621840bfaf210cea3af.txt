Bernie Williams' advocacy for liver disease patients is inspired by a very important family member.
 
The former New York Yankees player, 54, is working with the One Liver to Love initiative to raise awareness about liver cancer, in part because of his mother, Rufina Williams.
 
Noting that he has "a personal connection with liver disease," Williams tells PEOPLE exclusively that his mother "had hepatitis from a blood transfusion, and she had to get medication for it early on when I was a kid."
 
"She didn't even know about it until she started getting sort of symptoms, and being treated for it was certainly something that impacted our lives," he continues, adding that his grandfather and uncle deal with liver issues as well.
