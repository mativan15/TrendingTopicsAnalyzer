Texas filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming the tech giant captured and used residents' biometric data without their permission.

In the lawsuit, the state alleges Google collected biometric identifiers such as voiceprints and records of face geometry through products and services like Google Photos, Google Assistant and Nest Hub Max.

'Google's indiscriminate collection of the personal information of Texans, including very sensitive information like biometric identifiers, will not be tolerated," said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement.
