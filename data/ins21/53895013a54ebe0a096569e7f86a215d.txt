The Biden administration is looking into policy recommendations to lower the energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining and reduce the carbon footprint related to the entire process. 
Most critics of the crypto industry have expressed concerns regarding cryptocurrency mining, saying the activity poses a threat to the U.S. climate goals and strains the power grid. To elevate the concerns regarding the same, the Biden administration will release a draft on Bitcoin mining.
'It's important, if this is going to be part of our financial system in any meaningful way, that it's developed responsibly and minimizes total emissions,' Costa Samaras, principal assistant director for energy for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told Bloomberg Law.
