"Despite all the challenges facing our communities, we were proud to open 20 new locations and provide essential financial services," said Rob Stuart, President and Chief Executive Officer, OnPoint Community Credit Union. "Access to in-person financial services and education is more important than ever as our communities continue to navigate an increasingly complex economy. Working with a community pillar like Fred Meyer allows us to meet members where they are and connect with them on a deeper level, so we can fully understand their challenges and create a roadmap to help them accomplish their goals.
