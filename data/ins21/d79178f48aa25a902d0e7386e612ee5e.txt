Dua Lipa rubbed shoulders with the Queen Consort at the Booker Prize awards ceremony on Monday night, before the winner was announced.
The New Rules singer, who delivered a speech at the event, which took place at the Roundhouse in London, was seen having a good laugh in conversation with literature fanatic Camilla.
During their chat, Dua appeared to say ‘no singing tonight', although PA reports she later led a rendition of Happy Birthday to shortlisted author Alan Garner, who turned 88.
Camilla greeted the shortlisted authors and presented the winner, Shehan Karunatilaka, with his prize in what was the first fully in-person Booker Prize awards ceremony since 2019.
