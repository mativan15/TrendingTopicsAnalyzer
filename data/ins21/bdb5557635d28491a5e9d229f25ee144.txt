Billionaire tech bro Mike Cannon-Brookes has seemingly cleaned up Australia's biggest polluter, with AGL Energy abandoning plans that would have kept it burning coal for another 20 years.AGL on Monday morning announced that its top brass would be resigning and it would no longer attempt to split its coal assets following a sustained period of pressure from Mr Cannon-Brookes and other investors.The Atlassian co-founder has been the figurehead of a push to direct AGL away from producing coal-fired power, which it would have done had it managed to split its heavy-polluting coal and gas assets into a new company.
