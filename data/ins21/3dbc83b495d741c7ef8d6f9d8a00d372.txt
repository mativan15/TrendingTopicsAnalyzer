The stars of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic in Austin Butler and Tom Hanks took to the red carpet of the film's premiere at Cannes this week. Even The King's ex-wife Priscilla Presley joined them and the director along with Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling. The new film focuses on the relationship between Elvis Presley and his Machiavellian manager Colonel Tom Parker, who has always been a subject of debate. On the one hand, some fans and historians believe that without The Colonel's ruthless business strategy, Elvis never would have been as big as he was.
