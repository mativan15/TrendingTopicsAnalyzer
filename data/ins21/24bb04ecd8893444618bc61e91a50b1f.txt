Conte's Bike Shop will open a new store early next year in Amazon's second headquarters in Metropolitan Park in Arlington.

Based in Virginia Beach since 2002, the family-owned business has been on a smooth, steady and methodical ride since its founding as a small neighborhood bicycle repair shop in Newport News in 1957.

Co-owned by David Conte and Wayne Souza, the bicycle sales and service retailer has grown its footprint throughout Virginia and beyond. Today, it boasts a total of 18 stores in Virginia, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Washington D.
