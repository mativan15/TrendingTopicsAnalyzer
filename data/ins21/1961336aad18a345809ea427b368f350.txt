Chemical company DGL Group, led by controversial businessman Simon Henry, is delisting from the New Zealand stock exchange because its board believes there is no benefit from remaining listed in New Zealand. However, Mark Peterson, chief executive of New Zealand's market operator, NZX, said the move was 'a clear reaction' to events that transpired after Henry made comments in an interview with the NBR about My Food Bag brand ambassador Nadia Lim. Shares in DGL lost a third of their value after Henry, the company's chief executive, founder, majority shareholder and a director, described the celebrity chef as 'a little bit of Eurasian fluff' and accused her of 'showing some cleavage' and 'showing off her sensuality' to sell My Food Bag shares.
