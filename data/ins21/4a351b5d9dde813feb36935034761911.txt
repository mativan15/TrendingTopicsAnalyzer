NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams today celebrated the state Legislature's passage of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) Public Housing Preservation Trust legislation, A7805D/S9409A. The bill passed the New York State Senate today on 38-25 vote, after passing the Assembly yesterday on a 132-18 vote.
'For decades, NYCHA residents have been promised repair after repair that never materialized, but, with the Public Housing Preservation Trust, we will finally deliver on those promises and offer NYCHA residents the dignity and safe, high-quality, affordable homes they deserve,' said Mayor Adams.
