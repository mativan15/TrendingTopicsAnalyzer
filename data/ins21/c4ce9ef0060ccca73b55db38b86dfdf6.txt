Ethiopian nationals residing in the United States may apply for work permits and temporary protection from deportation because of the escalating conflict in their homeland, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

A 1990 federal immigration law allows the U.S. government to grant "temporary protected status" to people from countries engulfed in war, natural disasters or other "extraordinary and temporary conditions."

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement that it is unsafe for people to return to Ethiopia, Africa's second most-populous country, because of the internal conflict and a broadening humanitarian crisis that has put civilians at risk of murder, rape and detention based on their ethnicity.
