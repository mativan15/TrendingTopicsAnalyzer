Ford announced a new $3.7 billion investment Thursday across three mid-western states to build a new yet-to-be-revealed Mustang and to ramp up production of trucks and vans, including new electric models.
 

 The Michigan-based automaker will invest $2 billion in its home state, an investment that will create 2,000 new jobs, Ford said in an announcement. The funds will be used to increase production of the F-150 Lightning electric plckup, built at a factory near Ford's Dearborn headquarters, to 150,000 trucks per year.
