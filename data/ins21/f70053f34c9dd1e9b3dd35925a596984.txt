DUBAI, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD (ENBD.DU) has won a lead spot on all Dubai initial public offerings this year, boosting its fees and reviving a long-dormant business in the face of stiff competition from local and international banks.Dubai's biggest lender, majority owned by Dubai's government, helped run the IPOs of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, business park operator Tecom and toll-road operator Salik, which have collectively raised over $7.
