England head coach Simon Middleton has shuffled his deck for Sunday morning's final World Cup pool game against South Africa in Auckland — but it was not a case of pressing the panic button or being short of aces.The Red Roses XV shows 13 changes from the one which started in the 13-7 win over France in Whangarei last week, when Middleton admitted they got a reality check.Saracens flanker Marlie Packer, who captains the side for the first time in her 86th international appearance, and fly-half Zoe Harrison are the only survivors from that game, which ensured England made it through to next week's quarter-finals.
