Microsoft (MSFT) on Wednesday debuted its latest low-cost laptop for students and workers looking for a compact, Windows 11-powered system that won't break the bank.

Starting at $599, the Surface Laptop Go 2 is the follow-up to 2020's Surface Laptop Go and gets faster performance and new replaceable components that Microsoft says will extend the usefulness of the Go 2.

Microsoft's latest laptop isn't going to knock your socks off in the performance department, especially compared to the likes of the mighty Surface Laptop Studio.
