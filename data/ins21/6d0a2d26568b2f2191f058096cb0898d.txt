A system malfunction at Elections Ontario caused political parties to be unable to see which voters had cast their ballots for several hours on Thursday, which could hurt voter turnout overall.An internal data portal that parties are legally able to access to see who cast ballots was down until 2 p.m. Thursday.Typically, parties use this information to contact voters and get them to the polls before they close at 9 p.m.Sources from some of the major political parties told the Star that the flow of information is supposed to update every 15 minutes.
