After the Boston Celtics were out-rebounded 67-56 by the Toronto Raptors in Montreal on the way to a 137-132 overtime loss in the Celtics' final preseason game of their 2022-23 slate, it's looking like the team needs some help on the glass.

The solution could very well be on the roster already, but with interim head coach Joe Mazzulla electing to play big man Noah Vonleh less than 10 minutes of game time and reserve center Luke Kornet no time at all, it could signal a lack of faith in those options while starting big man Robert Williams III remains out healing up his surgically-repaired knee.
