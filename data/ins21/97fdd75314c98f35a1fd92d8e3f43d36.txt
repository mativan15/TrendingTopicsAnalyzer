The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked Texas from immediately enforcing a new state law that aims to prohibit large social-media platforms from suppressing users' posts based on the content of their speech. The court, in a brief written order, granted an emergency request by a pair of leading tech-industry trade groups to put the law on hold for now while they challenge it in court.
