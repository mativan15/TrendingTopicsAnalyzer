Just in time for the stress of the World Series, Major League Baseball has sanctioned a Colorado company as its official CBD brand.
MLB announced the multi-year partnership last week with Denver-based Charlotte's Web, which will supply CBD to professional players through December 2025. The announcement coincides with the launch of a new line of products, called SPORT – Daily Edge, designed specifically to help athletes recover from the impact of playing sports. The packaging features the MLB logo.
