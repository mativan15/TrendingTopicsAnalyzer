On Saturday in South Bend, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish host the Stanford Cardinal for their annual head-to-head, and these teams are heading in opposite directions.

Head coach David Shaw's Stanford arrives at this contest losers of four in a row, with three of those losses coming against ranked Pac-12 sides. On the other hand, head coach Marcus Freeman's Notre Dame has won three in a row, including last week against No. 16 BYU, to recover after an 0-2 start to this season.

Historically, Notre Dame owns the head-to-head edge in this rivalry.
