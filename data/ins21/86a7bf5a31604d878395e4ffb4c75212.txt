During its election campaign this February, one of the Aam Aadmi Party's key poll promises in Punjab was to revive the old pension scheme in the first month of coming to power.  Seven months since, despite Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann's assurance to implement the scheme by September, it remains in the 'ongoing discussions' stage.
Since October 10, 37 employee unions have been protesting demanding fast-tracking of the process and are planning to take their protest to poll-bound Himachal Pradesh, where AAP has said that, if elected, it would implement it within three months.
