The airport in India's diamond hub, Surat, is all set for a makeover with the Airport Authority of India developing it at a cost of Rs 353 crore. Surat Airport serves a vast number of businesses around the country, since it is directly linked to 16 cities across the country.
The airport's new world-class terminal building will improve connectivity to this industrial city, boosting the region's overall growth. The project entails expanding the existing terminal building from 8474 sqm to 25520 sqm.
