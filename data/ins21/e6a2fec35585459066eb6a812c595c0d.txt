Travel Alberta wants to double pre-COVID-19 pandemic spending by visitors to the province to more than $20-billion annually by 2035.
Destination development manager Andi Dzilums believes the Lethbridge-Medicine Hat region holds plenty of potential to help foster that growth.'We have an amazing opportunity for highlighting some of the cultural, historical and even culinary assets that already exist in the region,' Dzilums said.One focus for Travel Alberta is increasing traffic in areas outside typical destinations like the Rocky Mountains, Edmonton and Calgary.
