Art is painful and unpredictable in Crimes of the Future, David Cronenberg's latest film. As a work of art itself, though, Crimes of the Future has a remarkable amount of polish. The movie brings Cronenberg back to science fiction for the first time in two decades, and it melds his signature squishy body horror with a luxuriant retro-futuristic aesthetic and a murky but carefully traced story about artists at the end of the world — or the birth of a new one. It's a film whose tagline is 'surgery is the new sex,' but the results are less shocking and more pleasurable than they might sound.
