Minnesota United coach Adrian Heath's belief in Jonathan Gonzalez was validated when the recently acquired midfielder scored last Sunday's second goal in a playoff-clinching 2-0 shutout victory over Vancouver.

Gonzalez has appeared in eight games — seven as a second-half sub, one as starter — since the Loons signed him for defensive-midfield help in early August. He's on loan from Mexican Liga MX club Monterrey until season's end .

Which could be as soon as Monday night. That's when the sixth-seeded Loons enter the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season, this time at third-seeded FC Dallas.
