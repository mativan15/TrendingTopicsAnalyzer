Vodafone has announced it is migrating its SAP S/4HANA ERP platform from an on-premises installation to Google Cloud.
In a statement released today, the global telecoms provider, which boasts revenue of around €45.58 billion (c $44 billion), said it had been running on on-premises for 15 years, "during which time it has significantly grown in size, making this one of the largest and one of the most complex SAP migrations in EMEA."
The company is in the top five mobile network operators in the world, and is the biggest outside of India and China, with 300 mobile subscribers across 21 countries.
