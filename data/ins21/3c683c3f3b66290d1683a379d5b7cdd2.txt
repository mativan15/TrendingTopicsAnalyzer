By Mike Cherney SYDNEY--The casino regulator in New South Wales state has hit Star Entertainment Group Ltd. with a fine of 100 million Australian dollars (US$62 million) and suspended the company's casino license after an inquiry found it wasn't suitable to run its casino in Sydney. The regulator will also appoint a manager to oversee the casino, said Philip Crawford, chief commissioner of the NSW Independent Casino Commission. That means the casino will remain open, Mr. Crawford said, noting that an outright cancellation of Star's license could have led to a shutdown of the casino and caused employees to lose their jobs.
