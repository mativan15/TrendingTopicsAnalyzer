One of the most out-of-favor sectors in the stock market this year is the mortgage space. We saw major lenders go bankrupt or close up shop as volume fell off a cliff. Mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs), which invest in debt, not property, have also been sold off as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates. The damage is widespread.
However, investors are starting to ask whether REITs (especially mortgage REITs) have been beaten up enough that they are now a buy.
My first thought is, not yet.
