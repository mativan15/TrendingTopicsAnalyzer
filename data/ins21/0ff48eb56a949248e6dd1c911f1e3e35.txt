US stocks dropped Tuesday as investors grappled with signs that high inflation will stick around, though both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed out a volatile month of trading flat. Rising oil and a record high in eurozone prices renewed inflation concerns, which sent the 10-year Treasury yield surging. But despite the wild swings in May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 finished virtually even. The Nasdaq lost 2% for the month.After stocks sold off sharply to start the year, investors are looking for signs of a bottom.
