Mario Tama Investment Overview Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the world's largest healthcare company with a market cap - $434bn at the time of writing - that is >$100bn larger than the next largest U.S. Pharma - Eli Lilly (LLY). While Lilly's valuation trades more on the promise of revenues to come - in the form of its Diabetes / Obesity drug Tirzepatide, which analysts expect to become the world's best-selling drug, and an Alzheimer's Therapy, Donanemab, expected to win an accelerated approval - Johnson & Johnson is more focused on the here-and-now.
