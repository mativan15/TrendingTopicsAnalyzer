Why mess with success?

The National Rifle Association announced Monday that two of its top leaders would remain in their roles during the organization's annual meeting.

The NRA said that during its board of director's meeting, Charles Cotton was re-elected as president of the board and the embattled Wayne LaPierre was re-elected as CEO and executive vice president.

The day prior, the organization also based a resolution that offered universal support—'past, present and future'—for LaPierre, who has held the positions since 1991.
