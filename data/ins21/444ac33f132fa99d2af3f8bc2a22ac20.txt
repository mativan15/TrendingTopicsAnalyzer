United Kingdom Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday after less than two months in office amid pressure following a reversal of economic policies that led to economic instability.Truss made the announcement a day after she defiantly declared that she is "a fighter and not a quitter." Ultimately, however, she said that circumstances have changed."Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party," Truss said. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.
