Ange Postecoglou was pleased with what he saw at Fir Park, especially given the five changes he made from the weekend win against Hibs."I thought the way Motherwell set up they really tried to be aggressive in terms of pressing us when we tried to play out from the back," he told BBC Scotland."I just thought we handled it really well and once we played through their press we created good opportunities and could have finished the game off a bit earlier. But overall, really pleased."﻿In the games where we've kind of struggled is it's taken us a while to get the first one or we've missed some opportunities.
