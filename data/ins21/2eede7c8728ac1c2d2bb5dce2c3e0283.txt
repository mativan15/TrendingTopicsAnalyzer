Texas Dow Employees Credit Union, the largest credit union in the Houston area, is eyeing growth by adding new leadership roles and additional banking locations.

TDECU recently created the market president position and named its first two leaders for the new roles. Josh Brian, who has been with the credit union since 2008, was named market president for Lake Jackson and Brazoria County in June. Will Warren joined TDECU in September from The Woodlands-based Starfox Financial Services to become the Montgomery County market president.
