A Lincoln County man bought three $1 Cash 5 tickets in a tribute to Dale Earnhardt and is now $235,000 richer.

Luther Dowdy, a NASCAR fan, won the prize of exactly $235,001 in Monday's drawing.

'It was the first time I've ever played Cash 5,' Dowdy said. 'I chose Quick Pick three times for Dale Earnhardt.'

Dowdy, a 63-year-old grave digger, said he has always been a race ran, which is why he chose to buy three tickets to pay homage to the No. 3 on Earnhardt's race car he made famous in the 1990′s.
