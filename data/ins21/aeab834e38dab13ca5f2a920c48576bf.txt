Facebook's parent Meta says it will start providing more details about how advertisers target people with political advertisements.
The company's recent announcement follows years of criticism that social media companies are not open about how campaigns, politicians and special interest organizations target specific groups.
Critics have expressed concern that the groups have been targeted with ad messages that are misleading or seek to politically divide citizens.
Meta said it will start releasing details in July about the demographics and interests of people targeted with ads running on its Facebook and Instagram networks.
