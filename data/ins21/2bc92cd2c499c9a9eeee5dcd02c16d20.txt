The remaining employees of Judith Neilson's embattled journalism institute will leave their positions by the end of the year as the billionaire philanthropist continues a review into the way her money should be spent.Sources inside the Judith Neilson Institute, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said they were informed last Wednesday of the decision to make all staff redundant. Some employees have left the not-for-profit organisation immediately, but others will work until the end of the year.
