iStockMortgage-backed securitisation loans remain the largest segment among asset classes.Securitisation volumes have jumped 48 per cent to over Rs 75,000 crore for the first half of the fiscal, a domestic rating agency said on Tuesday. In a report, Crisil Ratings attributed the jump to continued faith of investors in retail loans amid the macroeconomic headwinds. It can be noted that securitisation activity, wherein a lender transfers its future receivables on a loan to other financier against a cut, had suffered a lot during FY22 because of the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic which made loan recollections difficult.
