Abu Hanifah/iStock via Getty Images SIGA Technologies (NASDAQ:SIGA) is a notable decliner among companies that benefitted from a recent monkeypox outbreak after the World Health Organization said that the rare viral disease is unlikely to cause a pandemic. More than 300 suspected and confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported outside Africa, where the disease is usually found. Asked whether the outbreak could develop into a pandemic, Rosamund Lewis, technical lead for monkeypox from the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said: "We don't know but we don't think so," according to Reuters.
