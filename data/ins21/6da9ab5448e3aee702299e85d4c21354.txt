Last week, inflation reached a 40-year of nine percent with many experts believing it could reach even higher. In response, the Bank of England has increased the base rate to mitigate the impact of inflation on consumers and savers. However, many banks and building societies have been criticised for not passing down this rate rises to their savings accounts.Despite this, Nationwide has been one of the few to increase the interest rates on its savings and ISA products.The building society launched new issues of two popular savings accounts earlier his month: the One Year Triple Access Online ISA and the One Year Triple Access Online Saver.
