Published: 09:34 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 09:35 EDT, 18 October 2022 Calls from worried mortgage-holders surged by 30% in the week after the former chancellor's mini budget, Santander has said. The fiscal plan, which has been largely ripped up by new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, triggered turmoil in the financial markets and average mortgage rates shot up. The average five-year fixed-rate mortgage currently stands at 6.29%, its highest level since the 2008 financial crash. On Monday, Mr Hunt reversed a swathe of policies in Kwasi Kwarteng's economic plan which is hoped to have lessened the need for aggressive interest rate hikes by the Bank of England.
