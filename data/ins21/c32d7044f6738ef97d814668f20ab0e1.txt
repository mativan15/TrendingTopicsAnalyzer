Liberal critics of Big Tech have a new target they want to see smashed to bits: Ticketmaster.

They think Democrats have neglected antitrust issues for too long and intend to force the Biden administration to take action against the ticket distributor via the #BreakUpTicketmaster campaign that is being spearheaded by American Economic Liberties Project.

The campaign includes a video in which writer Cory Doctorow says Democrats bear some of the responsibility for the monopolies he sees growing all around him.
