The Ukrainian government on Thursday placed restrictions on electricity usage nationwide following a barrage of Russian attacks on power plants just before the winter sets in.Power supply will be restricted between 7 am and 11pm, government officials and grid operator Ukrenergo said, while temporary blackouts are possible if people do not minimise their use of electricity.The curbs on energy usage are the first introduced since Russia's invasion and are initially limited to Thursday.The BBC reports that Ukrainians have been urged to stock up on water, ensure they have 'warm socks and blankets', and charge all phones, torches and power banks.
