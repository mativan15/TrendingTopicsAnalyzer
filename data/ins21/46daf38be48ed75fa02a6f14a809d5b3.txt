The clock is ticking down on the Kentucky career of Christopher Rodriguez. When Saturday morning dawned, UK's redshirt senior running back was down to his final six regular-season games in Wildcats blue and white.

Having missed the first four contests of UK's 2022 season due to an eligibility-related suspension, 'C-Rod' had every reason to feel urgency.

So on Saturday night, against a Mississippi State defense that had twice shut him down in the past, Rodriguez played with ferocity. The 5-foot-11, 224-pound back ran for 197 yards and two touchdowns to lead No.
