When the three Democratic candidates for Illinois secretary of state gathered Thursday for a forum in Chicago's Loop, the moderator made it clear the event was not intended to be a debate.The candidates — former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, Chicago City Clerk Anna Valencia and Chicago Ald. David Moore, 17th — were invited to the Union League Club to answer questions about their vision for the office. All three put forth modernization ideas ranging from creating digital driver's licenses to creating digital license plates.
