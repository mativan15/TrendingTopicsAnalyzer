Leanna Clark, CEO of Girl Scouts Colorado, has been sitting on some big news for several months now.

'It's been killing me to not be able to talk about it,' Clark told the Denver Business Journal.

The big scoop? Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott gave Girl Scouts of Colorado the largest single donation from an individual or entity that the Colorado youth organization has ever received: $2.8 million.

That $2.8 million is part of an even larger donation — a record-breaking $84.5 million — from Scott that went to Girl Scouts of the USA, the umbrella organization encompassing more than 100 Girl Scout councils across the U.
