Blackstone's third-quarter profit faltered as wild markets and rising borrowing costs chilled the pace of deal making at the world's largest alternative-asset manager. Distributable earnings in the quarter ended September 30 fell 16% to $1.37bn (R25bn), Blackstone reported on Thursday. That measure of earnings available to shareholders amounted to $1.06 a share, beating analyst expectations of 99c. The results promise austere times for an industry that minted wealth and amassed reach across the economy during an era of low interest rates.
