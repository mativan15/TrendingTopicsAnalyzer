Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick is showing no signs of slowing down.
The Paramount and Skydance tentpole, starring Tom Cruise, is doing massive business in its second weekend. If estimates hold, the sequel will earn a total of $85 million or more in its sophomore outing to boast the smallest decline ever — 33 percent — for a movie opening to $100 million more and finish Sunday with $290 million in domestic ticket sales. On Friday, it earned $25 million to finish the day with a jet-fueled domestic total of $230 million.
