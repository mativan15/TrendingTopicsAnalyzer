The major averages closed lower this holiday-shortened trading week as investors weighed the possibility that inflation is peaking against the potential for slowing economic growth and a recession in the near future. The pullback follows last week's rally, which came after several consecutive losing weeks. Taking a cue from the action, we have been encouraged by the potential that a bottoming process is underway. Just consider the market's reactions over the past week to earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and Salesforce (CRM) — both of which moved higher despite unfavorable forward guidance.
