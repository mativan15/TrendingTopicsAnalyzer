All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday took a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the district administration of Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh auctioned 5,400 bicycles of migrant labourers from the state and Bihar during Covid-induced lockdown over two years ago.

Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Sadar in Saharanpur Kinshuk Srivastava said ₹21.2 lakh collected through the auction of the bicycles was deposited in the state exchequer. 'It is now the discretion of the state government how to utilise the money,' the SDM added.
