Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter overcame another hurdle on Friday after the social media company said that a regulatory waiting period that is required for an antitrust review has expired.
The 30-day review period during which the Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice's antitrust division were tasked with looking into the deal came and went on Friday, Twitter announced..
The development comes as Musk said last month that the Twitter deal was 'temporarily on hold,' while he sought more information about the proportion of fake accounts on the platform.
