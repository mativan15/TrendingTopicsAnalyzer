It's been nearly four months since the historic Kirkwood Block caught fire and was left in ruins, but it is now starting to be taken down. The 110-year-old building, located at Portage Avenue and Langside Street, was deemed a complete loss after the fire. On Saturday crews started taking it down. The company in charge of the demolition told CTV News the entire project will take a couple of weeks to finish. Business residents inside the building previously told CTV News that seeing the building burn down was heartbreaking.
