Netflix has issued a decree about The Crown's take on real-life events.

The new trailer for season 5 of the Emmy-winning series includes a disclaimer about the accuracy of the program's retelling of the British royal family's lives following Dame Judi Dench's scathing critique of the show for taking creative liberties while chronicling actual people's experiences.

"Inspired by real events, this fictional dramatisation tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that shaped her reign," reads the trailer's description on YouTube.
