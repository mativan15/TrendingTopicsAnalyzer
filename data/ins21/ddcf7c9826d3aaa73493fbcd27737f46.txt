As an American, I know Britain doesn't appreciate the BBC nearly enough

I first fell in love with the UK by visiting Walford in East London. As a child growing up in a working-class community in the American Rust Belt, my only entertainment was often the big box TV my parents put in the bedroom I shared with my brother. It was on PBS that I first met Dot Cotton, the chain-smoking Christian grandma, and the other denizens of Albert Square. 'EastEnders' was only the second time I'd seen people like me – proper working-class people – depicted on television (the first was 'Roseanne').
