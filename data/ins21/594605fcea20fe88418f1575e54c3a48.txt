Michael Avenatti, the former attorney to porn actress Stormy Daniels, was sentenced to four years in prison on Thursday for bilking Daniels out of nearly $300,000 in book proceeds. 
District Judge Jesse Furman reportedly called Avenatti's actions "craven and egregious," arguing that the disgraced attorney was motivated by "blind ambition."
Prior to his sentencing, Avenatti said that he had "disappointed scores of people and failed in a cataclysmic way."
