MPs have voted against Labour's proposal to ban the controversial practice of fracking – in a vote seen as a test of Liz Truss's government.Some 230 MPs voted for banning fracking while 326 voted against the proposal.The vote was brought to the Commons by the Labour Party during an opposition day debate and was seen as a vote of confidence in the government.But there were immediately questions over whether the chief whip had resigned.Shadow Leader of the House Thangam Debbonaire asked in the Commons as a point of order whether chief whip Wendy Morton had quit.
