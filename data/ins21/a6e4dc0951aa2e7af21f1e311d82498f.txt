A highly chaotic day in parliament and the resignation of home secretary Suella Braverman dominate UK front pages on Thursday.The Guardian says 'Braverman's bombshell puts Truss on the brink', after a 'chaotic fracking vote brings fresh revolt from mutinous Tories'.The report says that the prime minister now risks 'the sort of mass exodus of ministers that forced Boris Johnson to quit'.Braverman announced she was stepping down over the misuse of her personal email, although furious allies on the Conservative right told the paper she was forced out by Truss and her new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.
