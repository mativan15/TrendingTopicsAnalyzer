The Colorado Avalanche and Edmonton Oilers waited 20 years and 16 years, respectively, to reach the conference finals.And now, the matchup could be one for the ages.The key will be the play of two former No. 1 overall draft picks: Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon (2013) and Edmonton's Connor McDavid (2015), McDavid has 26 points in 12 games and MacKinnon had a spectacular end-to-end rush to cap off a hat trick.Edmonton's Leon Draisaitl is tied with McDavid in points while linemate Evander Kane leads the playoffs with 12 goals.
