American writer Jennifer Egan's fascination with human reactions to technology sits at the heart of her novel 'The Candy House.' Told in a dizzying array of narratives and styles, 'The Candy House' is an exploration of our interconnectedness, but also our desire for real connection. How much does technology alter human behavior? It's a question that invites a deeper debate on the nature of connection and communication. 
The book delves into the dangers of mass surveillance, the performative pressures of social media, and the consequences for 'eluders' – those who go to great lengths to reject this brave new world.
