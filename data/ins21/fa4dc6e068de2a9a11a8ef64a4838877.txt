Keep reading for a look at where each of Altuve's postseason home runs stack up.

23. 2019 ALDS Game 3 vs. Rays (No. 10)

Altuve playoff home runs tend to coincide with Astros victories, with Houston going 16-5 in postseason games in which he goes deep. This is one of the exceptions to this rule. Game 3 of the 2019 ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays marked the most lopsided playoff loss during which the star second baseman has hit a home run, as the Astros were trampled 10-3 after Altuve put them up 1-0 early with a solo home run in the first inning.
