It comes just two days after the former Transport Secretary said Liz Truss is unlikely to last in the post.

Ms Braverman was removed from the role after admitting that she had sent a secret document to an unvetted MP via email.
The Sun understands the friend that Ms Braverman was emailing Home Office material too was Sir John Hayes, an ex security minister and long term backer.
