Three panellists debated the future of the monarchy while speaking to GB News host Mark Dolan, who asked, 'is the monarchy not part of the UK's branding upon which you cannot place a price?' Over the Platinum Jubilee weekend, Mr Smith tweeted that 'only 14 percent [of Brits] are interested in celebrating and 27 percent want to abolish the monarchy'.The Republic CEO said: 'There's no evidence that our Monarch makes any difference in terms of diplomacy or trade and the last time we had royals going overseas with Edward and William going to the Caribbean, they put their foot in it time and time again and they caused a huge row.
