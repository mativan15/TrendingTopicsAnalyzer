Rupert Murdoch wants to combine News Corp and Fox, recreating the conservative-leaning media goliath that he split apart nine years ago. The move would likely consolidate power in the hands of his son Lachlan, the CEO of Fox.So far none of the Murdoch clan, which includes Rupert's six children, have spoken publicly about the deal, which the companies acknowledged was in the works on Friday. Rupert's son James Murdoch, a former executive at the family media empire, resigned from the News Corp board in 2020, citing disagreements over news judgment and strategy.
