While most commercial real estate is showing signs of slowing demand, the industrial real estate segment is still very much booming. Lack of supply and high demand is causing rents and occupancies to soar.
Yet despite the segment's strong performance, share prices for nearly all industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) are down notably in 2022. For example, STAG Industrial (STAG 5.09%) is down nearly 42% year to date.
Based on the average price target among Wall Street analysts following the stock, however, STAG Industrial has as much as 49% upside potential in the near term.
