NEW YORK, June 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Almost a third of employees think their employer lacks a sufficient commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), and there is a direct connection between DE&I concerns and intent to quit, according to a new survey from Buck, an integrated HR, pensions, and benefits consulting, technology, and administration services firm.
Buck's 2022 Wellbeing and Voluntary Benefits Survey used data analysis to measure employee attitudes towards their employer to identify factors that impact employee retention.
