The ‘passive' method of investing is an increasingly popular means of gaining exposure to the stock market. It offers access to a wide variety of shares, often at a lower cost than ‘active' investment, the other main approach. With passive investing, the aim is to replicate, or track, the return achieved by a certain stock market index or other benchmark, using computers to maintain a stock portfolio that shadows the target index.  This might mean copying the performance of the FT-SE 100 index in London, or the S&P 500 in the US.
