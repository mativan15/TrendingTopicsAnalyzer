During the World Health Summit in Berlin, WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, formally launched the Tobacco Cessation Consortium, a group of partners in the private and public sectors to help people access essential cessation support and treatment to deal with tobacco dependence. This business coalition will support WHO's work on tobacco cessation and identify mutually beneficial ways for scaling up access for tobacco users to support for quitting tools and medications. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed the importance of working together and leveraging each other's resources and work in public health.
