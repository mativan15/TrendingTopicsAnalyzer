Real estate investor David Adelman grew up a Philadelphia 76ers fan. Now he's on the verge of owning a piece of the team.
 Adelman, 50, agreed to purchase a 10% stake in Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment, owner of the National Basketball Association franchise, Forbes has learned. Adelman purchased the stake in HBSE from Michael Rubin, chairman of sports merchandise giant Fanatics, who announced plans to sell in June.
