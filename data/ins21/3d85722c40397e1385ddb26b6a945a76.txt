TSMC and other chip makers are likely to face pressure to increase the proportion of production in the U.S. and U.S. allies.

TOKYO—Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering expanding its production capacity in Japan, people familiar with the matter said, in what would be a move by the world's largest contract chip maker to reduce geopolitical risk.

The Japanese government has signaled that it would like TSMC to expand in the country beyond a factory already under construction, but no decision has been made yet and TSMC is studying the feasibility, these people said.
