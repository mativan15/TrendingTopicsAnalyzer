Gold as an investment is worthy of its name. Even when it is simply sitting for years in the lockers and almirahs, it undergoes capital appreciation. Naturally, those who understand the worth of this asset utilise it as a smart investment. They make use of their idle jewellery or ornaments and fund their dreams by availing a loan against it. A gold loan refers to getting a monetary loan in return for pledging your gold ornaments and jewellery to a bank or an NBFC. A gold loan is one of the simplest, safest and quickest ways to raise funds.
