Downtown Faribault is poised for a major renewal with the commitment of $1 million in city funds to begin renovation of 13 dilapidated buildings in the city's core.

Last week, the city agreed to provide the money to an investment group through its Economic Development Authority and Housing & Redevelopment Authority. The total renewal project will cost at least $11 million, according to Nort Johnson, president and CEO of the Faribault Area Chamber of Commerce and general manager of the Faribault Industrial Corp.
