CNN —

Police officers stopped Eric André as he boarded a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles in April 2021 and, a few months earlier, the same thing happened to another Black comedian in the same place, a lawsuit alleges.

André and fellow comedian Clayton English filed the lawsuit claiming the stops were the result of racial profiling.

'Police officers came out of nowhere in like, almost like an ambush style and started, singled me out. I was the only person of color on the jet bridge at the time,' André said in a news conference Tuesday.
