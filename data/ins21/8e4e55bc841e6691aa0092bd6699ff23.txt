It's the second protest to affect traffic on Monday, with two climbers ascending Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Dartford Crossing which forced Essex Police to stop traffic from entering. Metropolitan Police said they are on scene after around a dozen protesters blocked Victoria Street and glued themselves onto the road just after 11.30am outside the BEIS ofices. Specially trainers officers will be working to unglue people from the road, the Met said. One person has been arrested for criminal damage.
