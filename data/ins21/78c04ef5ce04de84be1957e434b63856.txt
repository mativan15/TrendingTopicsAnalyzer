Palantir (PLTR 2.77%) has been a much-debated battleground stock since its initial public offering (IPO) a little more than two years ago. While many bulls remain steadfast in their expectations that the stock will go on to deliver incredible long-term performance, thus far, it's the bears winning the valuation argument. 
The data analytics specialist's share price has fallen roughly 16% since market close on the day of its IPO, fallen 56% across this year's trading, and is down 80% from its lifetime high.
