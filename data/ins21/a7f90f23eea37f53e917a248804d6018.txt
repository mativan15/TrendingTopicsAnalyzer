Alberta's premier is 'open to revisiting' an approved upstream flood mitigation project designed to protect the province's largest city.
Saturday morning on 'Your Province. Your Premier' on Corus Radio stations, a caller named 'Nick' asked Premier Danielle Smith to gauge her openness on revisiting the Springbank Off-stream Reservoir (SR1) approval, recalling her previous commentary as a talk radio host. Corus Entertainment is the parent company of Global News.'My inclination is to say yes,' Smith said.
