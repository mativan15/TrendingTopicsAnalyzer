Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global led the way last month in investing in U.S.-based startups—both in total rounds participated in, as well as rounds led or co-led.
Just like April, May saw only a half dozen firms invest in 10 or more deals announced in the month—down from May 2021 when 10 firms took part in double-digit numbers of rounds, according to Crunchbase data.
