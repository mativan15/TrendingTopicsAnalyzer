Oct 16, 2022 1:22 PM

The Orlando Magic have dealt with a lot of injuries over the last few seasons. They finally got good news with Jalen Suggs. After previously thinking Suggs might miss the start of the season due to a knee injury, Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said Suggs will be available for the season opener. Suggs was injured less than two minutes into Orlando's preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks on October 7. At the time, there was a thought the second-year guard might miss up to three weeks.
