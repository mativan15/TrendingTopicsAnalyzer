Swiatek will face either American Danielle Collins or Croatia's Donna Vekic for the title after their semi-final clash was suspended following three rain delays and scheduled to resume on Sunday. Collins was two games away from a hard-fought victory when showers forced players off for a final time with a 4-6 6-4 4-2 lead over Vekic.
