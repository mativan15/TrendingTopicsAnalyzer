Over nine months after he left Congress to join the SP, former MLA Imran Masood Wednesday quit the Akhilesh Yadav-led party to join the BSP. He joined the party in the presence of BSP chief Mayawati, who also announced his appointment as the coordinator for her party's western UP unit.
The development comes at a time when the BSP is eying to wrest Muslim votes from other parties ahead of the upcoming urban local body polls and 2024 Lok Sabha elections. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, 'The SP had not given either Masood or any of his associates a ticket in the 2022 Assembly polls.
