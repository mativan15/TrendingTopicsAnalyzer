A look at the shareholders of Polar Capital Holdings plc (LON:POLR) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

Polar Capital Holdings is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of UK£557m, which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors.
