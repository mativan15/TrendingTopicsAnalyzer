Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged Sunday to turn China into a 'great modern socialist country' that represents a 'new choice' for humanity, as he opened a Chinese Communist Party meeting where he is expected to secure a precedent-breaking third term.From a lectern onstage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi spoke without a mask for an hour and 45 minutes to open the twice-per-decade meeting that sets the national agenda for the next five years.Xi declared that the new 'core mission' of the party is to lead a country 'united in struggle' to be a powerful, modern socialist nation by 2049, a hundred years after the People's Republic was founded.
