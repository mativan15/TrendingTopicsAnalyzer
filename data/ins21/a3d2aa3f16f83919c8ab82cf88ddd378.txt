The family must also uncover the mystery of the Dowager Countess' (Maggie Smith) newly inherited villa in the South of France.Review: Known for its incredible cast led by the iconic Maggie Smith and witty script by Julian Fellowes, Simon Curtis' balmy sequel is a bittersweet nod to the passage of time. Reminiscent of the setting sun and a hopeful tomorrow, the writing draws parallels between the end of cinema's silent era and the adaptability of life.
