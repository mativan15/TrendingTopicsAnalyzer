Millionaire NBA superfan Jimmy Goldstein, who has season tickets to both the Clippers and Lakers, didn't have to choose between seeing either team on Thursday in the Clippers season opener.
He did, however, pick basketball at Crypto.com Arena over a Lady Gaga performance — at his own house.
Goldstein was caught on camera explaining his decisions to Clippers star Paul George.

'I'm very excited about the Clippers this year,' he said on video shared on the TNT broadcast. 'Right now Lady Gaga is performing at my house for a party and I gave that up to see you guys kick the Lakers' asses.
