Pacers star Myles Turner missed Wednesday night's season opener vs. the Wizards due to an injury he suffered during the pregame warm-ups.

The center apparently landed on a ball boy's foot during the warm-ups and suffered a left ankle sprain, per Jake Fischer of Yahoo Sports!. More details have yet to be released about the incident.

This untimely injury comes after Turner missed the final 38 games last season with a stress fracture in his foot.
