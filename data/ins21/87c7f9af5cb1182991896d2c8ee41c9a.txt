Japan's Toyota Motor Corp TM-N on Monday said it missed its global production target for April as COVID-19 outbreaks and a parts shortage slowed its post-pandemic recovery.The world's largest automaker by sales produced 692,259 vehicles last month, a 9.1 per cent drop from the same month last year, and falling short of an earlier plan of making about 750,000 vehicles worldwide.The numbers raise questions over the severity of the pandemic-hit supply chains and how the disruption will affect production in the coming months.
