A crowd of tattooed millennials, Generation Zers and a sparse handful of boomers surrounded the stage at Hotel Congress on Tuesday, Oct. 4 to listen to the sounds of the Viagra Boys and their openers, Shame and Kills Birds. While the headlining act was the band Viagra Boys, one of their openers, Shame, a post-punk band from South London, held their own in front of a crowd waiting for a spectacle: one that Shame full-heartedly delivered. 
Around 8:30 p.m. the first opener, Kills Birds — another punkish band from California — exited the stage, and the five members of Shame ascended four feet onto the stage, looking for all the world like young accountants following in the footsteps of their fathers.
