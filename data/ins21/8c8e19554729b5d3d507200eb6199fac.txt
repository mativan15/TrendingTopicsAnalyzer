With its catalytic converter stolen, an essential delivery truck for Food Depot Alimentaire in Moncton, N.B., is officially out of commission. "It's extremely frustrating, especially this time, because the robbery happened in broad daylight. So we caught them on camera, they were wearing masks, a hoodie. We filed a police report,' said executive director Stephane Sirois. 'It's very frustrating. It's costing time and money that's not going towards food.' 'The RCMP, we filed a police report and they're just overwhelmed with these cases,' she added.
