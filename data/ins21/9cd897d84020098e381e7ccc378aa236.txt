(Kitco News) – The Bitcoin price has fallen 60 percent over the year, but the crash is not over, said Ben Armstrong, Founder of BitBoy Crypto, who forecasts a bottom as low as $10,000. He added that the Federal Reserve, which has hiked interest rates by 300 basis points over the year, will pause its tightening in December, leading markets to then reach their bottom. 'The pressure from Cathie Wood, from the UN, from the world, and from countries that are having gigantic energy crises right now [will result in pressure] in December,' Armstrong said.
