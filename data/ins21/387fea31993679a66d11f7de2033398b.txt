AgenciesFILE - Education Secretary Miguel Cardona speaks during the 2022 National and State Teachers of the Year event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, April 27, 2022. The Biden administration says it will forgive all remaining federal student debt for former students of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges chain. 'As of today, every student deceived, defrauded and driven into debt by Corinthian Colleges can rest assured that the Biden-Harris Administration has their back and will discharge their federal student loans,' Cardona said.
