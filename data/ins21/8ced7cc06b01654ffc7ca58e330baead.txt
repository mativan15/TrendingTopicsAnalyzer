The All Blacks are regarded as national heroes in New Zealand and are one of the most successful teams in world sport JUAN MABROMATA AFP/File Wellington (AFP) – US private equity firm Silver Lake secured a NZ$200 million (US$134 million) stake in New Zealand Rugby and its famed All Blacks on Thursday after provincial unions overwhelmingly endorsed the deal following years of wrangling. The vote by 89-1 ended a heated two-year negotiation that pitted rugby bosses against the players' association and provincial rugby unions, amid concern about selling off part of the country's culture to foreign owners.
