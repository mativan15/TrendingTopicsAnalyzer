Dell said Wednesday that it has begun shipping its innovative Dell UltraSharp 32 4K Video Conferencing Monitor (model U3223QZ), which takes Dell's innovative UltraSharp 4K intelligent webcam and mounts it right within the frame. The price: an executive-caliber $1,600. The display, first announced at CES 2022 in January, is expressly designed as a videoconferencing display—optimized for presenting you to your coworkers in the best light possible. The integrated 4K UltraSharp webcam offers options to crop the field of view to varying degrees, and uses digital zoom, brightness, saturation and even framing to intelligently keep your face centered and well-lit.
