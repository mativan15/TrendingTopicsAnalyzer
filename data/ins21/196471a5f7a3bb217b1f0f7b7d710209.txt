It was Reverse Retro jersey day around the NHL Thursday and that included the Winnipeg Jets showing off the latest creation for the team. The latest jersey is paying homage to the 1990s-era team with True North Sports and Entertainment saying the jersey that inspired the new look debuted in 1990 and was worn by Teemu Selanne during his rookie year. The Reverse Retro jersey features the aviator blue palette on the logo, arm and body strips and around the neckline, all on top of a white base – which the team says reflects the Winnipeg Whiteout.
