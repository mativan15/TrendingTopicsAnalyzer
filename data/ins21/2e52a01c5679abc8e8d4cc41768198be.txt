The chief whip, Wendy Morton, reportedly resigned and then unresigned on Wednesday night, with a No 10 spokesman issuing a statement to say that the 'chief whip remains in post'.The events happened at the end of a busy day in Westminster during which uncertainty surrounded whether or not Conservative MPs would be expelled for defying the whip in response to a motion on fracking proposed by Labour.The motion, which was defeated, would have guaranteed Commons time to debate a new law to ban fracking once and for all.
