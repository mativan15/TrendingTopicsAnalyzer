Millions of Australian men juggle the demands of fatherhood with long work hours. This week those dads made a welcome appearance in political debate.

The Herald's David Crowe reported on Thursday that fathers will be given incentives to spend more time caring for their small children as part of a $600-million federal government plan to lift paid parental leave from 20 to 26 weeks. The new Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, which is advising the government on the overhaul, will push for a 'use it or lose it' rule to encourage fathers (or secondary carers) to increase the amount of paid leave they take to care for a new child.
