Companies embracing hybrid work, which gives employees the ability to work remotely part of the week, have changed the nature of demand for leisure travel, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said.

'There's been a permanent structural change in leisure demand because of the flexibility that hybrid work allows,' Kirby told investors on the airline's (Nasdaq: UAL) earnings call Wednesday. 'With hybrid work, every weekend can be a holiday weekend.

'That's why September, a normally off-peak month, was the third strongest month in our history,' Kirby said.
