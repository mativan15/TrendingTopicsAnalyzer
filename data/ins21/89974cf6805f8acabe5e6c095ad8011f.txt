Enlarge / Search through millions of vintage files with Discmaster. Today, tech archivist Jason Scott announced a new website called Discmaster that lets anyone search through 91.7 million vintage computer files pulled from CD-ROM releases and floppy disks. The files include images, text documents, music, games, shareware, videos, and much more. Discmaster opens a window into digital media culture around the turn of the millennium, turning anyone into a would-be digital archeologist. It's a rare look into a slice of cultural history that is often obscured by the challenges of obsolete media and file format incompatibilities.
