(CNN) — The Supreme Court of the United States temporarily blocked a sweeping Texas law that restricts the ability of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to moderate content on their platforms.
By a 5-4 vote Tuesday, the justices granted an emergency request from the tech industry to block a lower court order that would have allowed the law to take hold, pending legal challenges.
In an unusual alignment the five justices in the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor.
