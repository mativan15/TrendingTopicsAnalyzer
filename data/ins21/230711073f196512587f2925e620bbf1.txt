The 2022-23 NBA season begins this week, and at least 20 players from IHSAA high schools and/or Indiana colleges will dot NBA rosters.

Indiana University leads the way with six players, and Notre Dame has two. Butler, Evansville IUPUI, Indiana State, Purdue and Purdue Fort Wayne each have one.

Four IndyStar Mr. Basketball winners start the season on rosters: Eric Gordon (2007), Gary Harris ('12), Trey Lyles ('14) and Romeo Langford ('18).

Here's the list. Of course, rosters can change often, so others may join it.
