Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia came out in support of his cabinet colleague and health minister Satyendar Jain, who has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged money laundering case.'For the past eight year, a false case against Satyendar Jain is being investigated. He has been called by the ED several times. But the probe agency had stopped calling him as they didn't find any proof. Now, the case is reopened because Jain is the AAP in-charge for Himachal Pradesh elections,' Sisodia tweeted.
