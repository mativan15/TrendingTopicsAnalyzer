sankai/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Arch Resources (NYSE:ARCH) is a high-paying dividend stock that hasn't gone anywhere fast. In fact, ever since I recommended it, despite promising fundamentals, investors haven't been all that interested in this coal miner. The setup is very simple, 50% of its free cash flow comes back to shareholders via its dividend. The rest is either used for repurchases or capital preservation. That's it, no need to get distracted with coking or thermal coal. At the more nuanced level, a substantial amount of Arch's coal is tied up to the steel industry.
