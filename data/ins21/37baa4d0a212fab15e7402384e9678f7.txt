Thankfully it's easy to check for (and cancel) app subscriptions on iPhone and Android devices.
Sometimes apps will try to trick you into signing up for subscriptions.
Other times, you'll sign up for something and then forget to cancel it.
Maybe you want to claim a free trial, but cancel before the first payment is due.
