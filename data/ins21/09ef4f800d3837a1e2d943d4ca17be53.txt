At 8am on Monday, people will begin streaming into a white one-storey building on 24, Akbar Road in central Delhi – the headquarters of the 136-year-old Indian National Congress. Inside, set up in one room, will be a ballot box, with the election committee of the party handing out printed, black and white ballot papers with the names of the two candidates vying to be the next president of the party – former leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor.
