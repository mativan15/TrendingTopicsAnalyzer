Kate Hamley's youngest child's eighth birthday should have been a cause for celebration, but she was 'dreading it'.In March, with inflation starting to bite, Hamley, 34, was booted from the single parenting payment to the much lower jobseeker payment – all for a birthday.Under Centrelink rules, once a youngest child turns eight, parents are automatically moved from parenting to jobseeker payments.
