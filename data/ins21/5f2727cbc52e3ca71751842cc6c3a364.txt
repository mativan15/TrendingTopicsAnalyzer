Smaller oil traders are shifting Russian crude and making $20 million from a single cargo load — a massive increase from the roughly $600,000 they pocketed before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.They have jumped in to fill the void left by the exit of industry giants like Glencore and Trafigura from Russia, according to The Wall Street Journal.Russian Urals oil currently trades at just under $91 a barrel. That's a $25 discount to Brent crude, which is priced at $116 a barrel.These opportunistic traders aren't violating EU sanctions.
