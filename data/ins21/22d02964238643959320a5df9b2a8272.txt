Terming the current macro environment as "highly volatile" due to geopolitical tensions, supply chain stress and inflation, Ltd () MD and CEO Sunil D'Souza said the company is closely monitoring the near-term trends to see how these economic headwinds affect consumer behaviour. The company will be monitoring the global situation and inflation closely and put in practical and adequate mitigating measures, D'Souza said in the latest annual report of the Tata group's FMCG arm. Global supply chain stress and higher energy prices have led to widespread inflation, and geopolitical strains further exacerbated the situation.
