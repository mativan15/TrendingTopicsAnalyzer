Outgoing Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has reportedly sold a fortune in company shares during her 14-year tenure at the social media giant formerly known as Facebook.
Sandberg, 52, was a fixture at Facebook over the last 14 years and played a key role in developing the advertising business that transformed the social media site into a revenue juggernaut over that period. She announced her resignation from Meta on Wednesday.
The company's success also translated to a massive windfall for Sandberg – who has sold more than 75% of her after-tax shares in Meta through scheduled sale programs over the last decade, CNBC reported, citing calculations from analytics firm VerityData.
