OPINION:

Last Wednesday, Maryland's gubernatorial candidates squared off in a debate. It was a microcosm of the national election.

Republican Dan Cox recited the Democrats' mismanagement of everything that matters. The Democrat, Wes Moore, attacked Mr. Cox as 'an extremist election denier.'

Mr. Moore also professed to be anti-crime and a tireless defender of abortion. These are the cards Democrats are playing all over the nation: We are really moderates, except on abortion, which we love immoderately.
