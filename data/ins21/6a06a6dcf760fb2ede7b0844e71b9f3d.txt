"All night and all morning, the enemy terrorises the civilian population. Kamikaze drones and missiles are attacking all of Ukraine," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on the Telegram messaging app.
Russian forces have apparently obtained scores of the cheap, plentiful and potentially deadly Iranian-made drones. Like the Nazis in the Second World War, the Russians may hope these new weapons could turn the tide of the war in Russia's favour.
Made by the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Company, the Shahed-136 entered service last year.
