TV Insider The Peripheral arrives on Prime Video on October 21, and the cast — Chloë Grace Moretz, Gary Carr, T'Nia Miller, and JJ Feild — had a chance to talk about the show ahead of its premiere. Andrea Towers sat with them in the TV Insider and TV Guide Magazine New York Comic Con 2022 suite to discuss what attracted them to the sci-fi series, memorable moments on set, and who would survive the series' virtual setting in real-life. 'For me, it was William Gibson, Jonathan Nolan, and Lisa Joy — those are three incredibly hard hitters in sci-fi,' Moretz said about why she joined the cast.
