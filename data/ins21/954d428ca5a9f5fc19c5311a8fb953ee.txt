After six weeks, the AFC East has all four teams separated by just two games, with the bottom two tied.
The Buffalo Bills are still atop the division with a 5-1 record after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday. Josh Allen continued his MVP-level play, throwing for 329 yards and three touchdowns. They were also able to move the ball on the ground, which is a new development, with Devin Singletary rushing for five yards per carry.
