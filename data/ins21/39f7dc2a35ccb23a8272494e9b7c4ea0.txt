Not about the van life. Although my cousin and his partner are converting a van to do it. They are big travelers and have been all over the world. Now they want to travel through the US.

My ex wanted us to move into and live fulltime in an RV, with FOUR DOGS, and I was like absolutely the fuck not. He ended up doing it for a year after we separated and then went back to living his normal pre-RV lifestyle (i.e. renting a house, picking up his career where he left off, etc.)

If I had the kind of money I'd need to live a comfortable van life I'd just travel like a normal person and stay in nice hotels lol.
