ROME, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday he sees Italy's relaunched ITA Airways as a business destined to keep losing market share and require continued government support.

"We are Italy's flag carrier, so we hope the new government will recognise that and work with us, because we want to grow," he said at a news conference in Rome, describing ITA, the successor to Alitalia, as a "huge political problem".

ITA is fully owned by the state, but a consortium led by U.
