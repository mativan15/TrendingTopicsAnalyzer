Daniel Craig's Knives Out character Benoit Blanc is a member of the LGBTQ community, according to the film's director.
 
Over the weekend, filmmaker Rian Johnson and Craig, 54, appeared at a press conference during the London Film Festival, where the duo revealed that the actor's idiosyncratic detective is in a same-sex relationship.
 
According to Insider, a scene in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery — the sequel to 2019's Knives Out — indicates that Blanc is living with a man.
 
When asked during the press conference about the scene and whether Blanc is queer, Johnson, 48, replied, "Yes, he obviously is," the outlet reports.
