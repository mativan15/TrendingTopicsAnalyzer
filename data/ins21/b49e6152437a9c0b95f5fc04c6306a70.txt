A former minister in the Bolivian government pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes through a Miami bank in exchange for steering an inflated tear-gas contract to a South Florida company.

Arturo Carlos Murillo Prijic, 58, admitted in Miami federal court that he received at least $532,000 in bribe payments from a Broward-based company so it could secure a $5.6 million contract to provide tear gas and other non-lethal equipment to the Bolivian Ministry of Defense.
