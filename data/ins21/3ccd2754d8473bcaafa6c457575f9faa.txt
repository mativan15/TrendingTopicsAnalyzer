Wilmer Valderrama isn't just Special Agent Nick Torres on NCIS anymore. He's now a shareholder in iHeartMedia's "My Cultura" podcast — and fans couldn't be more thrilled for him.

The NCIS star, who has been on the CBS crime drama for the past eight years, took to Instagram to reveal the news on September 22. The "My Cultura" podcast (which translates to "my culture" in English) prioritizes amplifying Latinx stories, voices and content creators in English, Spanish and Spanglish.

The former That 70s Show actor wrote in his caption that he was "proud to finally announce" the exciting news, and naturally, many showed the excitement right back.
