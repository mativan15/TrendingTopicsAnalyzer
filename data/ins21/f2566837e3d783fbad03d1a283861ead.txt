Howdy, I'm your host, Houston Mitchell. Let's get right to the news.

With the normally open Darvin Ham holding things close for the past 24-plus hours, there was legitimate mystery as to what the team would do with Russell Westbrook.

At 6:30 Tuesday night, 30 minutes prior to the scheduled tip-off of the team's first game of the season, the Lakers and Darvin Ham made it clear – they're riding with Westbrook as a starter.
