Elon MuskTesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk thinks a recession will last until the spring of 2024, he tweeted on Friday, after saying earlier this week that "a recession of sorts" in China and Europe was weighing on demand for its electric cars."Just guessing, but probably until spring of '24," Musk said on Twitter after a user asked him how long the recession would last. It was not clear if Musk was talking about a global recession or expanding on the comment on China and Europe he made on Wednesday.
