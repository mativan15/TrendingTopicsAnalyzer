BRUSSELS —

European Union leaders Friday gave the green light to a plan to provide Ukraine with about $18 billion in financial support over the next year, after President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia is trying to spark a refugee exodus by destroying his country's energy infrastructure.

The aid plan, endorsed at a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, would see the 27-nation bloc match U.S. financial support for war-ravaged Ukraine in monthly installments.

'Ukraine is telling us that they need approximately 3-to-4 billion euros [about $3 billion to $4 billion] per month to have enough resources for the basics,' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.
