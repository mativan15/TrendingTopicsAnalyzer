The fate of NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet's promise to raise the Warragamba Dam wall will be decided under Commonwealth law by federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek, despite the state government's claim it may fully fund the project to make sure it is built.

Perrottet has nominated raising the western Sydney dam wall by 14 metres as a priority for his government and called on the federal government to split the funding for the $1.6 billion project.

NSW Premier Dom Perrottet on Tuesday raised the stakes by claiming NSW would foot the entire bill for raising the wall if it had to.
