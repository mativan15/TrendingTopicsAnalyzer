Smartphones and cases go hand-in-hand. After all, these pocket computers we carry with us everywhere are expensive and fragile; it only makes sense to protect them. Smartphone manufacturers like Google know this, and make their own cases to sell to you alongside one of their devices. However, when Google asks if you want one of their cases when picking up a new Pixel phone, say no. As reported by The Verge, there are dozens of complaints on both Reddit and Amazon surrounding Google's official Pixel 6 cases, surrounding three main issues that seem to be recurring with these cases: the material is yellowing; the cases don't fit the phones; and, if they do fit the phones, the case itself is warping, so the material juts out around the buttons.
