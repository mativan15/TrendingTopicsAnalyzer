Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the case against cabinet minister Satyendar Jain is "farzi (fraud)", adding that his government 'is honest and does not tolerate corruption'. 'We have faith in judiciary. This farzi (fake) case won't last. We are following the path of truth," Kejriwal told reporters. His remarks came a day after Jain was arrested in a money laundering case.
