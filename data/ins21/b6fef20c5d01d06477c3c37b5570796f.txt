My cousin told me don't waste money on those Athletic Greens or Daily Greens powders just make a fresh smoothie in a vitamix blender because he claims those powders could be toxic to the liver and kidneys is he right?

My cousin is a health not, he takes supplements but he told me not to waste money on Vegan protein or veggie greens powders he said just make your own smoothie at home. He told me you can buy fruits and veggies for cheap, and I told him but those are filled with pesticides you have to buy organic, and then he laughed at me and said and who is to say those Greens powders are safe and not from China with lead and toxic medals in them? He also showed me several news articles through out the year on supplements that were filled with toxic metals and a photo of some magnet near some Greens powder and the stuff inside standing and sticking to the magnet.
