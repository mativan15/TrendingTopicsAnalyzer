Monthly-rent deals top 50 pct of home rentals for 1st time in April SEJONG, May 31 (Yonhap) -- Monthly lease contracts exceeded half of South Korea's home rentals for the first time in April, government data showed Tuesday, due mainly to the impact of new laws that took effect two years earlier meant to protect tenants. The number of monthly home lease contracts, called "weolse" in Korea, came to 130,295 in April, accounting for 50.4 percent of the country's total home rental deals at 258,318, according to the data from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
