Soon, millions of Americans will hear better, for less money and at greater convenience.
Beginning this week, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids will be sold at local stores and online for the first time, making it possible for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to buy the devices without a prescription.
Major retailers, including Best Buy, Walmart, Walgreens and CVS, will begin selling OTC hearing aids on Monday, and smaller pharmacies are likely to follow in the coming months.
This new category of hearing aids was approved by the FDA in August, five years after Congress passed legislation requiring federal regulators to do so.
