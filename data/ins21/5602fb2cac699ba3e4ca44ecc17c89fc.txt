The Bay Area lost jobs in September, while California's overall employment gains slowed to a crawl, a state report released on Friday showed, an ominous yellow flag for the once-booming economies in the region and statewide.
The unsettling employment report suggests that the job markets in the Bay Area and California have begun to wobble in the face of soaring interest rates that federal officials have imposed in a quest to cool off skyrocketing consumer prices — and the economy.
The Bay Area lost 700 jobs in September, with nearly every metro center in the region suffering job losses or no gains, according to a monthly report released Friday by the state Employment Development Department.
