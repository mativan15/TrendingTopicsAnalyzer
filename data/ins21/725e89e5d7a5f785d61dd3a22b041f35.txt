LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Liz Truss described herself as 'a fighter and not a quitter' Wednesday as she faced down a hostile opposition and fury from her own Conservative Party over her botched economic plan.

Yet the grim faces of Conservative lawmakers behind her in the House of Commons suggested that Truss faces an uphill struggle to save her job. Within hours of Truss' appearance in Parliament for a regular session titled Prime Minister's Questions, she lost a senior member of her government

Home Secretary Suella Braverman left her job, though it was not immediately clear whether she quit or was fired.
