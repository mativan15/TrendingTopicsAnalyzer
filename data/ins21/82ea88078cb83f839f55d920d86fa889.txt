By Australian Associated Press Published: 20:25 EDT, 14 October 2022 | Updated: 20:25 EDT, 14 October 2022 Plans to extend paid parental leave have been welcomed as a major step forward for working women, but unions say the changes don't go far enough. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Saturday announced the government would boost paid parental leave from 18 to 26 weeks in a staged plan to be rolled out by July 2026. Eventually, all families with a new baby will be able to access six months of leave shared between two parents and paid at the rate of the national minimum wage.
