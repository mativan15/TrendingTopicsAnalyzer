Benitez has watched the north Londoners in depth and has been impressed with how Arteta has his team playing. He added: "I think they're doing well."Analysing the game, not just watching the game, analysing the games, they are doing a lot of things right. They press high, they have the possession, they move the ball very quickly, they have light players, very dynamic up front, as soon as they give the ball away they press and regain the ball quickly."They have good players in one-versus-one situations, they play wall passes, a lot of good things, the defenders are very high.
