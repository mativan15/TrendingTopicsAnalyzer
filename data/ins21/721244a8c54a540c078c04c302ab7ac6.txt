The Indian Space Research Organisation on Wednesday said Sankarasubramanian K has been designated as the Principal Scientist of the Aditya-L1 mission. Aditya-L1 is the first observatory-class space-based solar mission from India. "The spacecraft will be placed in a halo orbit around the first Lagrange point, L1, of the Sun-Earth system," the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency said in a statement. 
A satellite around the L1 point has the major advantage of continuously viewing the sun without occultation/eclipses, it was noted.
