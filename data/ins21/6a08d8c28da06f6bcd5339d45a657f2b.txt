Silvergate Capital (SI -0.33%) stock is sinking after it reported Q3 2022 earnings on Monday. The shares fell by more than 20%, even as the digital asset bank said its cryptocurrency customer base continued to grow. The rub? Crypto assets on balance decreased by a huge amount from last year. The company is also delaying the launch of a new blockchain product amid regulatory scrutiny. Silvergate remains a promising company if you believe crypto will eventually make a comeback. Signs in Silvergate's report point to a lot of big institutional investors believing as much as well.
