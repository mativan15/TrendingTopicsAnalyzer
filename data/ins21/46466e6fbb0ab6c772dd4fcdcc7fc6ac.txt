The number of open analytics and data science jobs spiked by 30% in April 2022 compared to April 2021, according to data from professional education firm Imarticus Learning. The report, titled 'Analytics & Data Science Jobs in India 2022', highlights the overall analytics and data science job landscape in India, how it was affected by the pandemic, and how it has recovered since then. 
In June 2021, India alone contributed to 11.6% of the total open jobs compared to 9.4% global open jobs. This growth is attributed to the continuous investments made by domestic companies to develop analytics and data science capabilities, the substantial shift of MNC and domestic IT and KPO organisations to India, an uptick in open jobs witnessed by captive centres, and the increased funding of AI and analytics-based start-ups in India.
