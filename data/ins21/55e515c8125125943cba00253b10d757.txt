"Maximus currently is our largest holding in the Focused SMID Cap strategy. Maximus operates health and human service programs on behalf of governments, primarily for state governments and the federal government in the U.S., but in select other countries too. Maximus functions as a government contractor, administering complete programs or portions of programs for its government customers.

Examples of this work might include running customer service call centers for Medicare, determining a citizen's eligibility for Medicaid and enrolling that citizen in their state's program, assisting a federal agency in modernizing its IT systems, or operating job-seeking programs for unemployed citizens, among many other things.
