Something for the Weekend WE BRING ENGLISH TO YOUR FEET! reads the email.
That's nice. I knew I was lacking something in the footwear department. A fine pair of bobby dazzlers, no doubt.
No, that can't be right. Let me run it through another translation app. Ah, how about this? WE BRING ENGLISH TO YOU! This makes more sense: it must be trying to sell English language lessons. It's at the top of a message I keep receiving but cannot understand. The original text is:
İNGİLİZCEYİ AYAĞINIZA GETİRİYORUZ ! I am ashamed to admit it but my command of Turkish leaves much to be desired.
