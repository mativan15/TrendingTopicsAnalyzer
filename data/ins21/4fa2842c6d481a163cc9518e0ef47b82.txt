Thousands of Amazon employees watched the company's biannual all-hands meeting on Monday, and one question loomed large: How will the economic downturn affect Amazon's spending going forward?CEO Andy Jassy gave a mixed response, according to a recording of the meeting viewed by Insider. He said Amazon is tightening its belt amid economic uncertainty but will still invest in long-term bets."It's on a lot of people's minds, and of course, none of us know for sure what's gonna happen, but there are a lot of signs that point to this being a difficult and rough economy ahead of us," Jassy said.
