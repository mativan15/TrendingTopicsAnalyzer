ISLAMABAD - Pakistan's elections commission on Friday disqualified former prime minister Imran Khan from holding public office for five years, accusing him of unlawfully selling state gifts and concealing assets, his spokesman and officials said. The move is likely to deepen lingering political turmoil in the impoverished country. Fawad Chaudhry told reporters that the Election Commission of Pakistan announced the much-awaited verdict in the capital, Islamabad. Chaudhry condemned the move. According to legal experts, Khan will lose his seat in the National Assembly under the verdict.
