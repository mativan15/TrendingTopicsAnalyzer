Published: 03:59 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 05:09 EDT, 20 October 2022 Liz Truss is battling to contain the fallout from a calamitous 24 hours for her premiership which saw a Cabinet minister resign and an open revolt in the Commons. Tory MPs are wondering how long the Prime Minister can go on following the chaotic events, but a Cabinet ally said 'at the moment' Ms Truss will still lead the party into the next election. Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the Government is seeking to provide stability and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt should be given the time to set out his financial plans at the end of October.
