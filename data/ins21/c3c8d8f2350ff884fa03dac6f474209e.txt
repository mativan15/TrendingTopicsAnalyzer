Shergold told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald a strength of the review was the absence of political constraints associated with any government-commissioned inquiry. The report, published on Thursday, has been presented to federal and state public service chiefs.'If we do not make a conscious effort to look back and assess what we got right, what we changed and what we got wrong, we will end up making similar mistakes in the future,' Shergold said.The report credits federal and state governments for getting many of the 'big calls right', particularly early in the pandemic, but notes much of Australia's success reflected starting advantages in being able to close international borders and rely on a strong economy and public trust in the pandemic response.
