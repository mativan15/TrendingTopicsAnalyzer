Published on Oct 20, 2022 05:16 PM IST The UK doesn't trust Truss, shows the latest survey, as the Rishi Sunak wave rises. A YouGov poll of Tory members found 55% would now vote for Rishi Sunak and not for UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, if they were able to vote again. The survey result has dubbed the shift in support as "buyer's remorse" among party members surrounding their September decision to elect Liz Truss as leader. YouGov also finds that a majority of members think Truss should resign as party leader and UK Prime Minister after a series of U-turns by her government.
