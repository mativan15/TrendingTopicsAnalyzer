The federal government will aim to pass legislation making companies far more culpable in the event of a customer data breach.Under the proposed changes, companies involved in serious or repeated breaches could face penalties of up to $50m – compared to the current $2.2m cap.Penalties could also take the form of 30 per cent of a company's adjusted turnover for the relevant period or three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information.Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said recent major data breaches at companies, including Optus and Medibank, had shown current measures to be insufficient.
