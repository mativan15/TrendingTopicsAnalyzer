Since the pandemic, Warren Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway have had a complicated relationship with bank stocks. They sold many of their bank holdings early on in the pandemic, concerned about their overall exposure to the sector. In the first quarter of 2022, Buffett and Berkshire began buying bank stocks again. But one bank stock has been steadfast in Berkshire's portfolio all along: Bank of America (BAC -1.39%).
In mid-2020, Buffett and Berkshire plowed more than $2 billion into the stock, which currently makes up close to 11% of Berkshire's nearly $347 billion equities portfolio.
