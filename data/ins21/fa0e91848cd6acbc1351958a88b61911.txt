The chief executive of Golf Saudi has made the astonishing pledge 'to set up our own majors' if the ‘big four' ban the LIV rebels from their historic events.

Majed Al Sorour is the businessman connected to the Saudi royal family who led the bid to take professional golf to the Kingdom – starting with the Saudi International on the European Tour three years ago – and who, alongside Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of the $600 billion (£530 billion) Public Investment Fund (PIF), has been instrumental in the formation of the breakaway league that has split the elite male game in two.
