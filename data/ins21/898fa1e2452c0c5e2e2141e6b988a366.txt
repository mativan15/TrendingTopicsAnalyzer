China is seeing huge outflows of cash from its financial markets as the yuan continues to depreciate, and a major chunk of that is likely leaving under questionable circumstances. In the first six months of the year, China saw a net $101 billion in outflows from stocks, bonds and direct investment, according to Reuters, on pace for the biggest annual investor exodus since 2016.But China labeled $45.2 billion in outflows as "errors and omissions," which likely indicates illegal or semi-legal channels, Reuters said.
