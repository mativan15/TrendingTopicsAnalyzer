Financial technology companies, more commonly known as fintechs, have been hit hard by this bear market for tech stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite index down almost 25% year to date. Two of the hardest-hit consumer finance companies are SoFi Technologies (SOFI 1.85%) and LendingTree (TREE 1.75%). 
While there are key differences between the two fintechs, one thing they have in common is that their stock prices are each down more than 50% year to date. Are these two stocks victims of the market and the economy, or are there bigger issues at play? If you were considering these two stocks, which is the better buy right now?
