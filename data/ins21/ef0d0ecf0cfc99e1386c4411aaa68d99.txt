Sir Sean Connery's Aston Martin DB5 is expected to fetch up to £1.4 million at auction.
The family of the James Bond star, who died in October 2020 aged 90, is selling the 1964 classic car to raise money for a philanthropy fund set up in his name.
The DB5, synonymous with the Bond franchise, has been listed as a ‘once in a lifetime opportunity' as it is the only car personally owned by Sir Sean.
The winning bidder will also get a personal drive in the car from world championship racer and fellow Scot Sir Jackie Stewart, who was a life-long friend of the actor.
