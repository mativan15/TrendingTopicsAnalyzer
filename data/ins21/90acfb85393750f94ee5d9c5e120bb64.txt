Almost 126,000 people are paying the full cost of their long-term care, according to official figures that reveal the true extent of the struggle to foot a bill that could reach £3,550 or more every month without government support.Just under 361,000 people were living  in care homes in 2021-22, with almost half of elderly residents paying their whole bill with no government contribution, data out this week from the Office for National Statistics shows.The average monthly cost of residential care currently comes in at around £2,816 a month, but if nursing care is required, for conditions such as dementia, typical bills are around £3,550 – a huge amount of money to cover for those who aren't eligible for state support.
