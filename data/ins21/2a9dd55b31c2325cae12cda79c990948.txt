Bergin's inquiry prompted a Victorian royal commission into Crown's Melbourne casino licence, which it retained under strict conditions.The Star inquiry has examined allegations it gave free rein to its major 'junket' high-roller tour partners and disregarded anti-money laundering procedures to avoid China's strict capital flight and anti-gambling laws.Star also refused to hand over to the financial crimes watchdog AUSTRAC a damning 2018 KPMG audit that found it was failing to tackle money laundering.
