Pittsburgh Steelers QB Kenny Pickett will not finish his second NFL start. After taking a big hit from Tampa Bay Buccaneers linebacker Devin White early in the third quarter, Pickett came out and was evaluated for a concussion. The team announced Pickett is now out with a concussion.

Pickett has been replaced in the starting lineup by Mitch Trubisky. Trubisky was benched after starting the first four games for the talented rookie and now will be asked to try and wrap up this win against Tampa and snap the team's four-game losing streak.
