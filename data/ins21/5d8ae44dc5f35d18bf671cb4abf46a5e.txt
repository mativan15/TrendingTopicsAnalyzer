Check your pockets and behind the couch cushions — you could be sitting on millions!
A century-old nickel — minted in 1913 — recently sold for a cool $4.2 million. It is one of only five known 1913-dated Liberty Head design five-cent denomination coins.
Two of these extremely rare coins are in museums.
The nickel once belonged to collector George O. Walton until he died in a car accident in 1962.
At the time of Walton's death, his family were mistakenly told the coin — which was found in the crash — was fake, resulting in it spending decades inside Walton's sister's wardrobe in Virginia.
