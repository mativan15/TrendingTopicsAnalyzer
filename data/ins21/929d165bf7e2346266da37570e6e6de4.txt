THE ELECTION of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), scheduled on October 20, has strained relations between the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after the former's Maharashtra unit president Nana Patole linked it with Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) withdrawal from the Andheri East by-poll. NCP leader Ajit Pawar on Tuesday advised him to not link cricket and politics.
On Monday, Patole said Maharashtra has witnessed three by-polls in the past and despite efforts, none of them were contested by the candidate unopposed.
