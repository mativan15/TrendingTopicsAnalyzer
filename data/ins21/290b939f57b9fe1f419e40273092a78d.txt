Scott Schreiber possesses some of the best raw power in the Astros system, though he hasn't gotten much of a chance to show it. He has played just 103 games over the past three seasons, losing 2020 to the pandemic shutdown and dealing with back issues the last two years.
After surgery in the spring, Schreiber feels healthier than ever. The first baseman/outfielder didn't get back on the diamond until August and is getting some extra playing time with the Surprise Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League.
