PUNE, India, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The New Report "Electric Delivery Van Market Size, Statistics, Trend Analysis, and Forecast Report, 2022 – 2032" shows insights and data published by Market Decipher. Asia Pacific and Europe dominate the worldwide electric van market, owing to a greater rate of EV adoption in the region on account of rising fuel prices and carbon emissions by transportation pollution. India's new vehicle scrappage policy, which permits old cars to be scrapped in exchange for low-emission vehicles, and other planned measures, will help it become the region's fastest-growing market for electric vehicles.
