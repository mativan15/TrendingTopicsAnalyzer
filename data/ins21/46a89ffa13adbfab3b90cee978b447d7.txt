Bonyhady will chair the first part of the review, which will look at the scheme's sustainability, design and operation. In the second part of the review, Paul will examine the disability support service providers and workforces.'I hope we can restore some trust and confidence and pride in the scheme not just for participants but for all Australians,' Paul said.The NDIS is the second-most expensive government-funded program after the age pension. Shorten said there was a 'real piece of microeconomic reform' to be done to fix the scheme after nearly 10 years of control by the Coalition government.
