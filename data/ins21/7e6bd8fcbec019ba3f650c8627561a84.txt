Transcend aims to 'create life from death.'Transcend
A bold, carbon negative alternative to caskets and cremation. That's how they put it at Transcend, a 'green burial company' that's planting people (and pets) as trees when they die. It's a means to reforesting the world, says Matthew Kochmann, founder and CEO in Brooklyn, New York. The startup launched earlier this month and is signing up people for $100 founding memberships. For that, you lock in a discounted total price of $8,500 at zero interest for 35 years and your choice of tree species and placement.
