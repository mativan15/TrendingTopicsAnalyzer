US Representative Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican told a Harvard audience Tuesday night that the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, will issue a subpoena 'shortly' to former president Donald J. Trump. 'We all felt that our obligation is to seek his testimony, that the American people deserve to hear directly from him, that it has to be under oath, that he has to be held accountable,' she said at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, explaining last week's unanimous vote by the panel to subpoena Trump.
