Former DOJ official Neal Katyal commented on Donald Trump's 14-page response to the DOJ.

Katyal said he did not think the response would help Trump unless he was trying to plead insanity.

He said Trump's response was "evidence" of an insanity plea.

Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official, thinks former President Donald Trump's written response to the House panel's intention to subpoena him looks like an insanity defense.
