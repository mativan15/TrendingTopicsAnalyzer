Taoiseach Micheál Martin will consider the establishment of a taskforce for the rejuvenation of O'Connell Street in Dublin but he warned that it was 'not a panacea'.Responding to Social Democrats joint leader Róisín Shortall, Mr Martin said that Dublin City Council must be at the heart of any rejuvenation of the capital's main street. It had to be the 'central driving force'.Ms Shortall called for the Taoiseach to head a multi-agency taskforce following RTÉ's Prime Time on Tuesday night about the violence, drugs use, and dereliction on O'Connell Street.
