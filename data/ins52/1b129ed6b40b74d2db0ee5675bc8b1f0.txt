Coinbase isn't just freezing new hires as it grapples with a rough cryptocurrency market. Protocol says Coinbase is now rescinding some of its already-accepted job offers. The company determined that it needed to take "more stringent measures" to slow its growth and limit expansion to the most important segments. This will improve the company's recovery from the tumultuous crypto market, Chief People Officer LJ Brock said.

Brock added that the firm would extend its hiring freeze for as long as necessary, and that the pause included "backfills" (that is, replacements) for all but the most essential roles.
