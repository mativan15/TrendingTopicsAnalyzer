Menacing graffiti targeting actor James Nesbitt is being treated by police as a hate crime.The message threatening the Cold Feet actor was daubed on a wall in the predominantly unionist town of Portrush in Co Antrim.It appeared weeks after Nesbitt was the keynote speaker at an event in Dublin organised by a campaign group advocating for a united Ireland.The threat to the Northern Ireland-born actor referenced the King and Crown and also included a hostile reference to the Pope.I fundamentally disagree with Mr Nesbitt's position on Northern Ireland's future but he has every right to express his political views in whatever forum he wishes.
