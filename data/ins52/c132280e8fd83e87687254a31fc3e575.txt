Construction in the area of Fort William Stadium and Delaney Arena in Thunder Bay has parents of the city's football and hockey players crying foul this fall, with some saying they're worried about hitting a child dodging traffic. The city recently began a large-scale project on Legion Track Drive, which runs to the stadium and arena from Victoria Avenue. The work includes not only repaving the road, but work to install new curbing, a new storm sewer, and the construction of a new recreational trail on the west side of the road.
