Paige Thorne has claimed Love Island producers stopped her from talking to Jay Younger in the villa.
The 24-year-old paramedic – who has confirmed her split from Adam Collard since leaving the ITV2 dating show – has insisted she wasn't allowed to speak to him ‘for a week' after he came into the villa, despite him being her ‘type to a tee'.
Appearing on the Saving Grace podcast, she said: ‘Jay came in, he was my type to a tee, and then I wasn't allowed to speak to him for a week. We just kept apart.
