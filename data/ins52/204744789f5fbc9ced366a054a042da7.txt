The Eagles are 6-0 on the season, a Super Bowl hopeful, and have one of the more complete rosters in the NFL.

Philadelphia will play 11 more games after the bye week, and with such a long stretch run, Nick Sirianni will look to increase the snaps and playing time for a select few.

On offense, the Birds have a talented pass catcher and a physical running back who can help wear down opposing defenses later in the season.

Defensively, a former All-American from Georgia and a physical safety highlight four defenders who've also earned an increase in snaps.
