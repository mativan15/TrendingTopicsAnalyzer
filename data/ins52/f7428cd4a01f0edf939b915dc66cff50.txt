Oct. 20—Lebanon, Wilson Central, Mt. Juliet and Green Hill will be together in Class 6A football beginning next year, according to the new classifications released by TSSAA on Tuesday.

Whether they end up in the same region remains to be seen.

Lebanon, with an enrollment of 1,840 (as of the 20th day of school in August), is Wilson County's largest school. Green Hill is up to 1,667 after being 5A two years ago when the school first opened. Mt. Juliet (1,637) and Wilson Central (1,578) are also moving up in class.
