The Wrap The 'House of the Dragon' season finale airs Sunday, and the trailer for Episode 10 promises the most epic showdown for the series yet.The penultimate episode of the season saw Queen Alicent (Olivia Cooke) maneuvering in the wake of King Viserys' death to position her son, Aegon, as the rightful heir to the throne after misunderstanding Viserys' dying words. Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) was wholly absent from the episode, but we see in the Episode 10 trailer that she'll very quickly learn that her claim is being usurped.
