The UK government has revamped its immigration system in a bid to attract what it considers to be the world's top graduates. Anyone who graduated from 50 of the world's top universities and colleges within the last five years can now apply for a High Potential Individual (HPI) visa. As Insider previously reported, they won't need to have a job offer lined up, and their families can join them too. Those holding a Ph.D. will be able to stay for three years — alumni with a bachelor's or master's degree can stay for two.
