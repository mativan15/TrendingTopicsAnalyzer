A California screen printer sued the U.S. Postal Service after it seized shipments of COVID-19 face masks bearing Black Lives Matter slogans.
​​Movement Ink owner René Quiñonez said in the lawsuit that the masks were shipped to D.C., St. Louis, Brooklyn and Minneapolis. But four boxes were labeled as 'Seized by Law Enforcement,' delaying the shipment by 48 hours, according to court documents. 
'The Fourth Amendment guarantees us the right to be secure in our papers and effects,' the lawsuit, first obtained by NBC, said.
