The Packers have some injuries at receiver, but Aaron Rodgers might have a new weapon back in the fold.

Some key players will be out of action this week while others return from the injured list to help their teams as the 2022 NFL season chugs along. One of the most beleaguered units, the Packers receiving corps, will be missing a couple of players but also might see the return of veteran wideout Sammy Watkins. Meanwhile, Amon-Ra St. V=Brown and (probably) D'Andre Swift are back for the Lions' matchup with the Cowboys.
