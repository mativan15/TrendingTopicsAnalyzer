June 3 (Reuters) - Micron Technology's stock (MU.O) received a rare "underweight" rating from a brokerage due to the memory-chip maker's heavy exposure to mobiles and PCs at a time when rising inflation forces consumers to rein in spending.Micron shares were down about 6% at $71.18 in early trading on Friday."With the global economy expected to face headwinds, we are concerned about Micron's more than 50% exposure to consumer-like markets such as PCs, mobile, and other," Piper Sandler wrote in a note to clients.
