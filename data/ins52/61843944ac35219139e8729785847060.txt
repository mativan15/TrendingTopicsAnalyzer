Thinkhubstudio/iStock via Getty Images As I explain in my book, The Intelligent REIT Investor Guide, "Data Centers are very specialized real estate facilities that house computer servers and network equipment within a highly secure environment. They come complete with redundant mechanical cooling, electrical power systems, and network connections. You can think of them almost as microwaves to "cook" all the data that's generated." Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) was the first data center REIT to complete an IPO in 2004.
