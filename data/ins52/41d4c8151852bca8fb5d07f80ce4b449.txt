The DualShock line of controllers ended with the PlayStation 4 generation, but if you've been looking for a mint-in-box version of the DualSense predecessor, you can grab one right now for a bargain. Over on eBay, the still-excellent controllers are on sale from a licensed Sony reseller for just $40. These are brand-new controllers, and Antonline is a Sony authorized reseller. It's hard to find DualShock 4 controllers at this price in general, so getting a new one at this price makes it even better.
