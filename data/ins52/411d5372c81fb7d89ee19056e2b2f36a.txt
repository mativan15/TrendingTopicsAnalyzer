HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 17, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apple in June this year was reported to be moving some iPad production out of China and shifting it to Vietnam, together with other tech giants such as Google, and Microsoft, making the country a hotter-than-ever destination in the wave of global shift away from Chinese production.

Vietnam has received increasing attention from global producers as many of them are searching for alternative supply chains in the face of China's zero Covid policy.
