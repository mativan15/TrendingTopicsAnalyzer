The importance of wealth creation can be summed up by a statement made by legendary investor Warren Buffet – 'If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will have to work till you die'. The quote explains that a person who survives on salary with no money left over between paydays will sadly work until the day they die or rely on assistance from others when they can no longer work. One must save, invest, and build an income stream that makes money regardless of whether you work or not.
