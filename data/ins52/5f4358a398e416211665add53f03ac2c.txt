The nation's capital is on track to become the next Democratic-led city to approve legislation that would allow noncitizens to vote in municipal elections, an endeavor that local leaders are racing to implement before a potential Republican takeover of Congress.

The D.C. Council sent a bill to Mayor Muriel Bowser this week that would pave the way for undocumented residents who have lived in the city for at least 30 days to cast ballots in local elections.

While federal law bars noncitizens from voting in federal races, states and local municipalities have the ability to extend the right that is typically reserved for citizens to those who are not.
