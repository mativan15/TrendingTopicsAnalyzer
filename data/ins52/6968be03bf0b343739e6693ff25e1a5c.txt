Catalent Inc. plans to spend $12 million expanding its facility in south Kansas City, adding two new laboratories and creating about 50 scientific jobs by February.

The New Jersey-based company (NYSE: CTLT) sees the two labs — one 3,000 square feet and the other 3,500 square feet — increasing Catalent's capabilities in product development and analysis, according to a release. The bigger lab will open this month, and the smaller one expects to be operational in the first quarter.

Specifically, the expansion will bolster the company's services in assaying pharmaceuticals, helping its clients accelerate their drug development programs and meet regulatory requirements, according to the release.
