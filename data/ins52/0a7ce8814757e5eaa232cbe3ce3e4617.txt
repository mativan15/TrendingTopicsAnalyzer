Protecting workers is more than a statutory obligation for the Labor Commissioner's Office (LCO). Our mission includes protecting the most vulnerable workers from labor law violations and helping law-abiding employers with unfair competition. If workers don't know their labor rights, they cannot exercise them. The Reaching Every Californian public awareness campaign focuses on underserved worker populations where labor law violations occur more frequently. This comprehensive, action-driven outreach program highlights the critical role workers and employers have in exposing exploitative working conditions that undercut law-abiding employers.
