S&P 500 Technical Analysis

The S&P 500 has rallied quite nicely during the trading session on Friday, showing signs of strengthening again. That being said, the area between 4100 and 4150 has been a massive support in the past, and now that we are broken below there, the question becomes whether or not it will offer resistance? Further compounding the situation is that the 50 Day EMA is currently at the 4190 level and dropping. In other words, it's possible that we could see some exhausted inter-the market rather soon.
