Oct. 18—After hearing concerns from downtown business owners related to the homeless issue and its negative impact on their bottom line, Middletown City Manager Paul Lolli said it's time to implement a "disaster operation mode."

He updated City Council members in an email after last week's meeting attracted more than 100 people, including city officials, law enforcement officers, social service agency representatives, business owners and a few homeless.

Lolli said business owners told stories of customers being confronted by "hostile homeless individuals" who made threats to their personal safety and damage to personal property.
