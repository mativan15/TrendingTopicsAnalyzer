Two important Knicks reserves are heading into the season opener with uncertain statuses.

Obi Toppin and Quentin Grimes were both partial participants in Monday's practice, with coach Tom Thibodeau claiming he's unsure if either will be available for Wednesday night in Memphis.

Toppin turned his ankle after stepping on a fan in the preseason finale Friday at MSG. The accident occurred while Toppin ran along the sideline, reiterating two things about NBA fans: the expensive seats are really close and players need to be spatially aware.
