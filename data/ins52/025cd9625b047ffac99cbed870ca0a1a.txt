Cadillac became the "Standard of the World" by hand-building over-the-top luxury cars with exceptional attention to detail. The 2023 Celestiq is the company's bold bet that it can use the same formula to retake its place at the forefront of luxury brands. It's aimed not at Lexus, BMW, or even Bentley. No, the Celestiq has its eyes on Rolls-Royce.

The model starts in the "low 300s," according to Cadillac, with bespoke commissions likely to put as-configured prices into the $400,000 range.
