Married At First Sight UK's Kasia looks destined to make a fortune following her stint on the E4 series.
The businesswoman was among the contestants to take part in this year's edition of the dating show, however, ended up leaving the experiment as a single woman after her marriage to Kwame didn't work out.
Despite not finding love, like the majority of her co-stars, Kasia is still set to rake in the coins as she is predicted to be the highest earner.
Kasia already has a huge reach on Instagram, with over 229,000 followers, making her extremely attractive to producers and brands for collaborations.
