Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the NWF Group share price has climbed 59% in five years, easily topping the market decline of 3.0% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 5.9% in the last year , including dividends .
