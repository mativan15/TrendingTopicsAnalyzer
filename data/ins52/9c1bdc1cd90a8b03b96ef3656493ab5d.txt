Memorial Day is a time for Americans to remember, honor and mourn U.S. military personnel who died in service to our country. There have been many, too many. America has suffered 506,952 deaths in its major conflicts since the beginning of World War II. We owe these honorable men and women our lasting gratitude for giving their last full measure to protect and preserve our freedoms and values.
Like many who served in one of our nation's wars, I always figured there was an unspoken pact between those who served and the folks at home.
