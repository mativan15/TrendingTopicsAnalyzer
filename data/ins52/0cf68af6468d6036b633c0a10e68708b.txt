If you've ever fantasized about giving supervillains the slip from behind the wheel of James Bond's iconic Aston Martin – and you have some spare millions of bucks lying around – you could be in luck this summer. The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 personally owned by the late actor Sean Connery is hitting the auction block on August 18, and it's expected to fetch between US$1.4 million and US$1.8 million, according to Detroit's Broad Arrow Auctions. Connery, who died in 2020, portrayed the iconic role of British super-spy James Bond in seven films between 1962 and 1983.
