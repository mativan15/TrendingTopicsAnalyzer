3/5 stars There's a moment in Black Adam where Dwayne Johnson's eponymous antihero burns down a poster of Superman in a kid's bedroom. The message is clear: The new guard are here. The latest blockbuster in the DC Extended Universe, Black Adam does not just introduce Johnson's vengeance-fuelled character, but also the JSA (the Justice Society of America). Called into action by Viola Davis' sharp-tongued Amanda Waller, the JSA must stop Teth Adam, to give him his ancient name, when he's released from a tomb after 5,000 years.
