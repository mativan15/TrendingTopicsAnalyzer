When Maurice Flynn and his partner were looking for a house to buy, it was a 'long process'. As a wheelchair user, he needed to find a house that would meet his access needs. The couple started their search in Hamilton, where they work, but soon found most houses had stairs which would require ramps to be installed, or that Flynn wouldn't be able to get into the bathrooms because they were too small. Luckily, the opportunity to build a house 'just came about', although it meant a switch from Hamilton to Ngāruawāhia, 20 minutes away.
