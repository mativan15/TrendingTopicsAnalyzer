Lexy has been a member of Love Home Swap for over six years and has been swapping her scenic family home in Scotland for other people's homes in Sardinia, Paris, Berlin and Holland. With half-term just around the corner, this could be a cost-efficient way for families to still go on holiday and make savings despite the rising cost of living. Lexi and her husband manage to save money on holiday (Image: Lexi )In an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk, Lexy said: 'When we ever think about renting a self catering place for a few days, we can't bring ourselves to do it as it seems so expensive compared to home swapping!'And, of course, with a home swap, you get lots of small extras such as the host's spice cupboard, dishwasher and washing machine tablets etcetera so you can eat in in real comfort and not spend quite a bit extra on getting in every single ingredient.
