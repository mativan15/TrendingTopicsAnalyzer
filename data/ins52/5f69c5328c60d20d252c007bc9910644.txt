This statement:
'Two summers ago, in the middle of a pandemic, we saw protests across the nation the likes of which you hadn't seen since the 1960s. They unified people of every race and generation. Athletes and sports leagues boycotted and postponed games. Companies and workers proclaimed ‘Black Lives Matter.' Students staged solidarity walkouts.'
— President Biden, May 25
We say: Biden must have been in his basement in summer 2020. Peaceful protests quickly turned into riots and looting, and Americans took notice: Their support for Black Lives Matter fell 12 points between June and September 2020, per Pew.
