designer491/iStock via Getty Images SpringWorks Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SWTX) has lost ~33% in the pre-market Friday after the clinical-stage biotech shared initial data from a Phase 1/2 trial involving its lead product candidate nirogacestat in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The trial sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was designed to evaluate if nirogacestat with GSK's (GSK) antibody drug conjugate BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) could lead to a similar efficacy and an improved ocular toxicity profile compared to single-agent BLENREP.
