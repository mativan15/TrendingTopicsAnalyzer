Gathering Place Brewing Co. will open its new Wauwatosa location at the site of the former Stock House Brewing on Oct. 29 with a grand opening event from 2-10 p.m.

The taproom location is 7208 W. North Ave. It is the second brewery to recently open in the Wauwatosa area. Neenah-based Lion's Tail Brewing Co. opened its new taproom, further west along North Avenue at 8520 W. North Ave. on Oct. 14. Lion's Tail had so much success in its opening weekend that it was running low on beer and had to close for a day on Sunday.
