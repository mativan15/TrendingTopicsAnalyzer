By Paul Homewood From Net Zero Watch: 
Back in March, the Energy and Climate Information Unit, a think tank funded by green billionaires, made a great deal of noise about so-called 'negative subsidies' paid out under the Contracts for Difference Scheme. With market prices for electricity having soared, generators in the scheme found that they were having to pay back large sums of money into the scheme, rather than taking money from it as they normally do.
The sums involved are not insignificant. The net repayment into the scheme was £133 million in the final quarter of 2021, and the ECIU declared, somewhat breathlessly, that consumers have benefited to the tune of £660million by April 2023.
