Before the pandemic, Japan was at the peak of a tourism boom, with inbound visitors reaching a record in 2019. Now, the island nation is one of the last remaining rich economies with strict border controls. That's set to change on June 10, when package tours from overseas will bring back tourists and their spending money, and the daily entry quota doubles to 20,000. Even so, only about half of the population is in favour of plans to ease borders, according a poll by the Yomiuri newspaper earlier this month.
