Published: 03:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 03:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 Online mattress retailer Eve Sleep has called in administrators after it failed to secure a buyer or fresh funding following a strategic review. The company, which floated on the stock market in 2017 with a £140 million valuation, has witnessed a slide in customer numbers and increased cost pressures in recent years. Eve's board said it has now hired Matthew Ingram and James Saunders of Kroll Advisory as administrators as a 'necessary step to preserve value for creditors'.
