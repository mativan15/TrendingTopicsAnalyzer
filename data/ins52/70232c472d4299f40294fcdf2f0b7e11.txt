A public relations firm that counts Fortune 500 companies and startups among its clients is opening its first office in South Florida.

New York-based Sloane and Company is searching for office space in the Miami area, with plans to hire locally in the near future, a representative told the South Florida Business Journal. With the expansion, the company will be better positioned to serve its clients in the region's growing financial services, technology and health care industries.

"South Florida has become a hub to large and midsize financial services firms, tech startups, key advisors to corporate America and the Latin America region, and many others, and we look forward to Miami becoming a significant office for us," said Darren Brandt and Whit Clay, co-CEOs of Sloane and Company.
