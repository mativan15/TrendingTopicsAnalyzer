Leon Neal/Getty Images NewsWhile Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) reported a good start to the year, the stock continues to trend downwards as investors weigh the appropriate balance of financial performance and valuation. During Q1, revenue growth accelerated to 21% and beat consensus expectations by nearly 4%. However, continued margin pressures weighed on profitability with FCF burn still around $20 million a quarter. In a time when investors are more cautious around high-valuation names in favor of stability and profitability, FSLY may take some time for their turnaround story to pay dividends.
