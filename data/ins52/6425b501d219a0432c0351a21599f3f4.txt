Russia's military leadership is 'increasingly dysfunctional' with the war in Ukraine being spearheaded by rookie officers as Putin's forces are beaten back on the battlefield. Four out of five of Russia's top generals have been sacked since the start of the war, Britain's Ministry of Defence said today, with Sergei Surovikin now in charge.'Their replacements have so far done little to improve Russia's battlefield performance', the MoD added, as Surovikin appeared to be preparing for a retreat from the southern stronghold of Kherson.
