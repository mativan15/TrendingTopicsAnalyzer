The Delhi government Friday gave an assurance before the Delhi High Court that cows succumbing to lumpy skin disease will be provided with a dignified burial, in a plea seeking a direction to the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to take remedial steps to eliminate lumpy skin disease in cows in the capital.
Referring to the burial of cows dying due to the disease, petitioner Ajay Gautam said before a division bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad that in the name of 'scientific disposal, cows are being skinned'.
