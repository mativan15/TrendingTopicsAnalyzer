Ford said Thursday it will invest $3.7 billion and add more than 6,200 new union manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri as part of the automaker's plan to sell 2 million EVs a year globally by the end of 2026.
The new investment will be used to hire union workers at factories in Michigan, Ohio and Kansas, provide healthcare to new hourly employees as well improve working conditions at these facilities. Notably, Ford said it made the hiring investment a year ahead of 2023 contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.
