The week-long public inquiry into the tragic death of 20-year-old Samwel Uko came to an end Friday afternoon, as jury members presented 20 recommendations to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA).
The recommendations are to help SHA ensure a similar death never happens again.It's been a deeply emotional inquiry process for the family as they've listened to a handful of witnesses that were there the day Uko died by suicide in Wascana Lake on May, 21, 2020.Uko drowned after visiting the Regina General Hospital (RGH) twice that day, in order to access immediate mental health supports.
