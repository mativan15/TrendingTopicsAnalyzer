Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH), which distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical products, and also manufactures, sources, and distributes products for medical, surgical, and laboratory uses, cleared a cup-with-handle buy point Wednesday.

That's a pretty impressive feat, considering the stock posted gains even as the broader market declined.

Does that mean it's time to buy?

The current base builds upon two earlier consolidations that began in April 2021. The stock broke out of the first consolidation a full year later, as the stock missed out on the 2021 broad market rally altogether.
