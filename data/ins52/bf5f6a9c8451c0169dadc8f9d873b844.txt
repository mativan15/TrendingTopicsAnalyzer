Hemp can help growers diversify farm revenue and provide a greener food crop alternative, says a Kiwi hemp grower. Brad Lake, co-founder of hemp growers and processors The Brothers Green, said at a recent Blinc Innovation seminar, that hemp needed less water, less pest and fungal control sprays and less fertiliser than most other food crops. There were a number of other environmental benefits that growers and farmers could benefit from if limiting regulations changed, Lake said. Hemp was regulated with THC containing cannabis by the Ministry of Health, but there needed to be a differentiation between the two products, Lake said.
