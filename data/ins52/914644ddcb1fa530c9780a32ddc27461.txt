Former Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette warned if the Biden administration doesn't increase oil production in the U.S., Americans will see higher gas prices. Brouillette made the argument on "Cavuto: Coast to Coast" on Tuesday as the national average of one gallon of gas was $4.62, according to AAA. Last year it was priced at $3.04 -- $1.58 less, as Americans continue to pay record gas prices at the pump. He suggested that the higher oil prices stem from the lack of energy production in the U.S., compared to other parts of the world.
