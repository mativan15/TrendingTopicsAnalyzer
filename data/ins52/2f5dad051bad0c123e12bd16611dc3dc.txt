Mumbai: The central bank's goal of reducing inflation to 4% would be a two-stage process, although repeated shocks are making the journey to the milestone harder, an assessment on the state of the economy by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) economists said. The latest assessment of inflation trajectory is a slight shift from the optimism last month as the core inflation (stripping off food and fuel) has turned sticky, although headline inflation could be coming off. Central bank economists have reacted with caution on the view that India is likely to be among the few emerging economies that would be left standing after the global hurricane has passed.
