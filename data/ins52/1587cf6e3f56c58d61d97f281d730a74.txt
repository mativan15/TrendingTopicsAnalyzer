The radical plan to flatten Australia's progressive tax system is the bastard child of base politics, the Faustian pact Labor made in its ruthless determination to win power.It is the base politics of Scott Morrison's division-by-design that summoned into being this brutal attack on egalitarianism, removing an entire tax scale so that people earning $200,000 would pay the same 30% rate as those on $48,000.It is base politics that convinced Labor that, after the bruising 2019 election, it could not win office if it was labelled the 'higher taxing party', even if that meant rubber-stamping $9,000 tax cuts to those earning $200,000 and above and just $900 cuts to an average nurse.
