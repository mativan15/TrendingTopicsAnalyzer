Florida State has one more chance to capture a marquee win in its most difficult stretch of the season.

After starting 4-0 for the first time since 2015, the Seminoles were scheduled to face three straight-ranked opponents. They fell in their first two games, losing to No. 14 Wake Forest (31-21) and No. 15 NC State (19-17) to begin October.

To end its three-game gauntlet, FSU (4-2, 2-2 ACC) will next host No. 4 Clemson (6-0, 4-0) at 7:30 p.m. Saturday (TV: ABC).

Under coach Dabo Swinney, the Tigers look primed for their seventh run to the College Football Playoff in the last eight years.
