The UK's media watchdog, Ofcom, has published a debut report on its first year regulating a selection of video-sharing platforms (VSPs) -- including TikTok, Snapchat, Twitch, Vimeo and OnlyFans -- following the introduction of content-handling rules aimed at protecting minors and others from viewing harmful user-generated video content online.

As well aiming to shrink the risk of minors being exposed to age-inappropriate content (an area the UK's data protection watchdog also has under watch), the VSP regulation requires in-scope Internet platforms to take steps to protect all their users from content likely to incite violence or hatred against protected groups or which would be considered a criminal offence under laws related to terrorism, child sexual abuse material, racism and xenophobia.
