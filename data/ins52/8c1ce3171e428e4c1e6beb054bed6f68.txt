Agencies"Apart from two-wheeler loans, our focus is going to be on the commercial side because that plays with our long-term definition of saying self-employed mid-market...there is plenty of space to grow," the company said. Credit, non-bank financing arm of $8.5-billion TVS Group, aims at a loan growth of 25 per cent during the current financial year, with the focus on underserved segments of the market. The company, which got NBFC (Non-Banking Finance Company) licence in FY10, started primarily with two-wheeler financing and subsequently forayed into used car, commercial vehicle and tractor loans.
