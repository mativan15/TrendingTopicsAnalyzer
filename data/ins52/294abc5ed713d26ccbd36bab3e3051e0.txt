Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday said the Centre's 'blunt' refusal to provide cash incentives to Punjab farmers to avoid stubble burning 'has impacted the entire campaign [against stubble burning] in the State'.Speaking at a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Rai said the Punjab government had come up with a plan to provide financial assistance of ₹2,500 per acre to its farmers to dispose of crop residues without harming the environment.
