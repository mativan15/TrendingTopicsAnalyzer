Obsidian founder Feargus Urquhart has revealed his intentions of working on a new Fallout, if the opportunity ever arose. Obsidian hasn't worked on a Fallout game since New Vegas in 2010, but many fans still see the spinoff as the best modern Fallout. After New Vegas, Bethesda Game Studios took back the reins of Fallout and has since developed Fallout 4 and the controversial 76. Fallout is a post-apocalyptic series in which you have to brave the atomic wastelands of various US cities. A big draw of the franchise is that its setting, characters and story will change from game to game.
