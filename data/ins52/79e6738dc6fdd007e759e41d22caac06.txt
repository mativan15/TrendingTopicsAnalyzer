Sean Gallup Thesis Summary Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most robust companies, but it has fallen alongside other Wall Street darlings. The general market has suffered a multiple contraction, due to the reduced liquidity in this tightening cycle. Though this has been priced in, Google and other companies now face an earnings recession. The American economy is now forecast to enter a recession in 2023 with a 100% likelihood (according to Bloomberg) which means lower demand.
