SIR – The hard work, dedication, imagination and superb logistical skill of those who organised the Platinum Party at the Palace contrast greatly with the idleness and inefficiency of the people who run our lives.
What a change there could be if the organisers were put in charge of airlines, railways, the Civil Service, local government and many industries and businesses.
David ThompsonCapel St Mary, SuffolkSIR – Thank goodness for the Platinum Jubilee concert. It represented Britain in the kind of positive way that no current politician could manage.
