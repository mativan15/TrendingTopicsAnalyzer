Fans of Johnny Depp gathering outside the Fairfax, Va. courthouse burst into repeated cheers as the verdict in the libel lawsuit between Depp and Amber Heard was read out by the jury. The jury ruled in favour of Depp and awarded him US$15 million. To each of the questions on whether Depp's lawyers had proven the elements of defamation, the jury repeatedly responded with a resounding "yes." "Every time there was a 'yes' and a 'yes' and a 'yes,' when the verdict was read out to each of the different questions that the jury had to answer, there were cheers in front of the courtroom," CTV National News Washington Bureau Chief Joy Malbon said from outside the courthouse on Wednesday afternoon.
