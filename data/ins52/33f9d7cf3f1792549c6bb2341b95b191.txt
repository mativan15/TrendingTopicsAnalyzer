Variety - Film News A jury was selected Thursday morning in Harvey Weinstein's Los Angeles rape trial, after almost two weeks of screening and juror questioning.The jury will be comprised of nine men and three women, many of whom said they didn't hold strong (or any) opinions about the #MeToo movement, which grew into a global reckoning following Weinstein's fall from grace in 2017. The former mogul was the first major figure to be convicted in the #MeToo era.
