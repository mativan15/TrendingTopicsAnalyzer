Every week throughout the season we'll give you a college football viewing guide by highlighting the five best games of the coming weekend. We will pick those five games against the spread and highlight some other matchups that caught our eye from a betting perspective.

We're in for another fun weekend in college football.

Week 8 may not have the elite matchups like the Tennessee vs. Alabama proved to be, but there are still five ranked vs. ranked games and a bunch of others that are very interesting for a variety of reasons.
