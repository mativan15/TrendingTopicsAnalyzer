Stockbrokers agreed that Oxford Metrics now looked too cheap. Numis, the company's own broker, had a price target for the combined group's shares of 157p before the deal was announced; it said it had 'previously assumed a £52m valuation for Yotta and it is very pleasing to see the group achieve this given the uncertainty in the market, and to receive this in cash'.
It added: 'We reiterate our buy rating and believe the group is strongly positioned to create further shareholder value.'
Admittedly the shares have risen since then to 99.
