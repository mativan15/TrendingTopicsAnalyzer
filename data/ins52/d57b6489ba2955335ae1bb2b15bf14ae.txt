iStockWhile the lockdown of Shanghai is slowly being lifted, the effects on production and supply chains will likely be felt for months.Daily operations at Shanghai's port have almost fully recovered from the effects of the city's Covid-19 lockdown, though the backlog from disruptions to the port and nearby factories will likely continue to cause shipping congestion well into the year. Daily container throughput -- a measure of cargo handling activity -- at Shanghai port has rebounded to 95.3% of the normal level, Ministry of Transport official Li Huaqiang said Thursday, according to Chinese state media.
