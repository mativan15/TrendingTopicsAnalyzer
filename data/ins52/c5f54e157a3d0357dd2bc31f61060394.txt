"Ghostly Tales" is set to return to the Old Parsonage of Andrew Tribble on the evening of Oct. 28.

"It's every year. It's always the Friday night before Halloween. It's always a different Kentucky storyteller each year," said organizer and Parsonage owner Rusty Rechenbach. "I just thought there was a need for it."

The event is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and this year's ghost stories will be told by Octavia Sexton of Rockcastle County. An experienced storyteller, Sexton has performed in schools, detention centers, professional development academies, addiction recovery programs, library programs, and community programs.
