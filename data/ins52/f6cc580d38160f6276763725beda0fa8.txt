The new chief executive of Asos has set out a turnaround plan after the struggling online fashion retailer reported a full-year loss.José Antonio Ramos Calamonte warned that Asos would continue to make losses in the first half of this year but said his strategy to reduce stock, slow investment in automation and cut costs would help it survive 'an incredibly challenging economic environment'.Losses at Asos fell to £32 million pre-tax for the year to August 31, down from £177 million the year before, with the company hit by worse than expected trading as consumers reined in spending.
