A new financial institution is coming to the Triad, with its regional team based in Winston-Salem led by a familiar face.

United Community Bank, based in northern Georgia and with executive offices in Greenville, South Carolina, announced Tuesday it is establishing a Piedmont Triad team led by regional president Stewart Holmes.

Holmes most recently was a corporate and commercial financial advisor and team leader for Pinnacle Financial Partners's Triad and Western North Carolina region. Before Pinnacle, Holmes worked with middle-market and corporate clients for mid-sized regional banks.
