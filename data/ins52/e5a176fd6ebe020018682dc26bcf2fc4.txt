The Chicago Cubs will work with just-launched Web3 platform Valence to develop branded NFT collectibles, the MLB team's own digital world and other key blockchain-based assets following investments in Valence by the team's executive chairman, Tom Ricketts, and other media and tech notables. Valence's software platform and infrastructure are designed to help brands and creators leverage the group of next-generation digital tools lumped together under the Web3 rubric. The tools can be used to build tighter relationships with customers, creating rewards and fan engagement in a variety of ways both in venues and beyond.
