Victims of fraud with mental health problems are less likely to get their money back and twice as likely to fall into debt due to scams, according to Which?

The consumer group surveyed more than 1,000 fraud victims and found that six in 10 (58%) with a diagnosed mental health problem got all or some of their money back.

This is compared to two thirds (68%) of victims with no mental health condition.

One in three (31%) had to borrow money from friends or family, compared to one in five (18%) with no diagnosed mental health condition, and were twice as likely to borrow money from a bank (11% compared to only 5%).
