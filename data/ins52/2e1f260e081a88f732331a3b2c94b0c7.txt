The Ascot Park racecourse's public car park is to be turned into 18 family or retirement homes in Invercargill. It is owned by the Southland Racing Club and president Sean Bellew said the car park got little use on most race days and was not needed any more. A lot of racegoers were parking behind the south grandstand or in areas close to the viewing of the horses. Some were also getting rides to the races, Bellew said.
