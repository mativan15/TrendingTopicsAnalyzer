Sri Lanka's parliament on Tuesday approved legislation allowing foreign competition in the local fuel market, ending a 19-year duopoly as the bankrupt island struggles to import oil. The move cleared the way for international oil firms to re-enter Sri Lanka for the first time since the nationalisation of oil companies in the early 1960s, with the exception of the Indian Oil Corporation which has operated there since 2003.

 "This will allow global suppliers to enter as retail operators," energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera said.
