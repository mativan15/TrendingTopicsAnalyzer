British Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced her resignation on Wednesday after taking the role just 43 days back when Liz Truss took charge at 10 Downing Street as the prime minister."I have made a mistake, I accept responsibility; I resign," Braverman said in letter to Truss posted on Twitter. Braverman said she had "serious concerns" about the government's commitment to honouring commitments it made to voters at the last election.
