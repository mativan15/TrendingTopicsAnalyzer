Microsoft (MSFT) was one of few big tech firms to give investors what they wanted this earnings season. With a solid beat and upbeat guidance, Microsoft stock was initially rewarded until the rest of the market dragged it lower again. Undoubtedly, it's hard for any non-energy stock to sustain positive momentum these days.

As the resilient big-tech titan looks to move further past the $2 trillion market cap mark again, it could provide the rest of this troubled market with a bit of relief. Microsoft isn't just an influential company; it's a leader that may prove too cheap at these levels, now down around 20% from its all-time high just north of $340 per share.
