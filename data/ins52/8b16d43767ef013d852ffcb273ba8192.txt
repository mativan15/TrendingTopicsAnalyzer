Sadio Mane intends to inform Liverpool of his plan to leave the club this summer, according to various transfer reports.

Mane is one of three Liverpool forwards out of contract in 2023, along with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Salah has already confirmed he will be staying for next season, whatever happens. It looks likely Firmino will do the same.

However, there has been more doubt about Mane. The Senegal international has promised to reveal his future after the Champions League final, which Liverpool lost on Saturday.
