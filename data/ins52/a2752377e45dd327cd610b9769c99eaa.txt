The pound and UK government bonds have rallied further as the financial markets were initially placated by new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's emergency statement.Yields on 30-year government bonds, or gilts, eased back further by around 10% as Mr Hunt set out plans to shave off billions of Government debt.The interest on long-dated bonds hit a low of around 4.32% shortly after the first announcement.The gilt market has been closely monitored since yields spiked to more than 5% after Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his tax-cutting mini-budget back in late September, and the Bank of England was forced to intervene with an emergency bond-buying programme.
