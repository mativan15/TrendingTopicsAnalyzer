NEW YORK — It's been a year of firsts for Yankees' lefty Nestor Cortes. He made his first All-Star team. He crossed the 100-inning threshold for the first time, then 125, then 150 before ending the regular season with 158 1/3 star-making innings. On Friday, he also made his first-ever postseason start, holding Cleveland to two runs in five innings during a game the Yankees eventually lost.With the help of Monday's rain washing out Game 5′s original schedule, the Yankees felt comfortable handing the ball to Cortes on three days' rest for the rescheduled Game 5 on Tuesday afternoon.
