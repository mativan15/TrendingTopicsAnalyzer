Rishi Sunak: I'll give £400 energy rebate to charity and other wealthy families should too

Rishi Sunak will give his energy rebate to charity he said on Friday, as he urged other wealthy families to do the same.

The Chancellor has announced every UK household, regardless of wealth, will receive a £400 payment to help with spiralling energy costs as part of his £15billion cost-of-living package.

It is being paid through a reduction in bills over six months from October, when energy bills are expected to rise by another £800.
