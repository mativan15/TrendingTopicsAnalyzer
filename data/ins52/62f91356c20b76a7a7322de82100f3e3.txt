Ole Miss Rebels' Jared Ivey discusses his play versus Auburn and his excitement to play in Death Valley.

OXFORD, Miss. — The Ole Miss Rebel came out on top 48-34 at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium versus Auburn this past Saturday, laying claim to the No. 1 spot in the SEC West for the time being.

The Rebels had a shaky start to season. Despite not losing a game, sometimes they played down to their competition, and other times their ground game was the only consistent part of the team. After shaking up the majority of their roster, this was to be expected, but now, the team seems to be putting everything together.
