Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has urged the DUP to reconsider its refusal to restore the Northern Ireland Executive in the wake of the political turmoil in London in order to avoid the triggering of new elections next Friday.Mr Coveney said that he understood DUP concern about outstanding issues over the Northern Ireland protocol, but the reality was that there was little chance of the European Union being able to resolve those matters without an effective administration in Westminster.
