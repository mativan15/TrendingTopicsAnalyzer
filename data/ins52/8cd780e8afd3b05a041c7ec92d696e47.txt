‘Will the last one to leave please turn out the lights' has been the message around Huddersfield ahead of potentially the greatest sporting weekend in the West Yorkshire town's history.
Huddersfield Giants face Wigan Warriors in the final of the Betfred Challenge Cup, a trophy they have not won since 1953, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday.
At Wembley on Sunday, Huddersfield Town take on Nottingham Forest in the Sky Bet Championship play-off final, where the winners will earn a promotion to the Premier League worth at least £170 million.
