Australia has reversed a decision to recognize West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, returning to its previous diplomatic position that the city's final status should be resolved as part of peace talks with the Palestinian people.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced the shift at a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday, saying the change by Morrison government in 2018 caused 'conflict and distress' in the international community.
