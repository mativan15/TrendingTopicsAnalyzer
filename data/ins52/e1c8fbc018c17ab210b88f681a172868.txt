The Western Australian government is spruiking the 'landmark' deal, with the jurisdiction the first in the nation to target officers across the three countries.

Under the agreement, police officers from the UK and Ireland will be able to move to Western Australia under the employer-nominated scheme, putting them on a pathway towards citizenship.
