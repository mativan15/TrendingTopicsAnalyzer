The cost of renting a car in European holiday destinations has almost doubled in the past three years, and experts predict prices will remain high as global shortages mean car hire firms are paying more for new vehicles.An analysis of car rental prices in six European destinations shows it cost an average of £675 to rent a car for a week at the beginning of August, up from £339 for the same week in 2019.According to figures from iCarhireinsurance.com, which provides policies to cover the excesses imposed by hire firms, renting a car such as a VW Golf or a Peugeot 308 in Faro, Portugal, will cost an average of £728 a week this year, compared with £428 in 2019.
