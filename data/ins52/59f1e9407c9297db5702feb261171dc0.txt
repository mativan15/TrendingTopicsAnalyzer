AgenciesThe upcoming couple of weeks may be quieter for the royal couple -- Prince William and Kate Middleton -- since they became the Prince and Princess of Wales. Both Prince William and Kate Middleton have been making frequent trips across the country to attend to business. In recent weeks, they have visited Wales and Northern Ireland. Kate Middleton also visited a maternity unit in Surrey, while Prince William went to St. George's Park, which is the training base of the England football team.
