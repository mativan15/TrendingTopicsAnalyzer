David Dimbleby hit out at the "unfair" TV licence fee which currently stands at £159 a year. The former BBC heavyweight warned that the broadcaster cannot continue to exist in its "present form" over the next 10 years. Speaking to LBC, Mr Dimbleby said: "All the arguments that are going on, to make people £159 for having a TV even though they don't watch it and risk being taken to the courts is not a system that can sustain."I think we have to find a way of making the rich pay a bit more and the poor pay a bit less.
