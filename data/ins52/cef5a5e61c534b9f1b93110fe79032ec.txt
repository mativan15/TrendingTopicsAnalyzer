The Hollywood Commission, an organization that collaborates with leading unions and guilds, academies and agencies to end workplace bullying and harassment, is launching its second entertainment survey. The initiative, which will release its results in 2023, is intended to provide a forum to people in the industry and offer insight about progress made in the past five years. Chaired by lawyer and educator Anita Hill and founded by board members Kathleen Kennedy and Nina Shaw, the Hollywood Commission was formed in 2017 to bring together entertainment executives, independent experts, and advisors with a focus on halting the culture of abuse and power disparity in the industry.
