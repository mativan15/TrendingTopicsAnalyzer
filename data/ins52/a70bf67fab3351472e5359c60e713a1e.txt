Everton manager Frank Lampard could sign his next Mason Mount in the form of midfielder Conor Gallagher this summer, with both players having a lot of similarities.

What's the story?

Speaking to GIVEMESPORT journalist Peter O'Rourke has said that there are many similarities between Gallagher and Mount and that if Everton were to get him it would be a 'huge signing'.
