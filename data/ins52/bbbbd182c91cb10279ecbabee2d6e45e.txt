Sheamus was decimated by The Bloodline on SmackDown and WWE has given an update on his condition after the attack.
The Celtic Warrior battled rising star Solo Sikoa in the opening match on Friday night, with The Usos and Sami Zayn at ringside proving too much for him to handle as he suffered a loss.
After the bell, Roman Reigns' family – including the Honorary Uce – went on the attack, dealing out a vicious assault to Sheamus and totally laying him out.
Following the beat down, WWE has issued an update on air and said the former world champion has been taken to hospital.
