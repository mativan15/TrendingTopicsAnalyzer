Indonesian President Joko Widodo 's recent move to publicly castigate hundreds of top police officials over a series of scandals signalled the extent of his wrath, but analysts say without structural reforms, the force will remain one of the nation's least trusted institutions. Widodo last Friday summoned senior officers from the regional and national levels to the presidential palace for an unprecedented dressing-down. They were instructed to show up without their attributes and to line up in a single file before entering the palace, bringing nothing but notebooks, with mobile phones and personal assistants banned from the meeting.
