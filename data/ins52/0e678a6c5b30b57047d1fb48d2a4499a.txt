Oct. 18—New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines aren't cheap.

A high-quality machine can cost up to $1 million or more.

So Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center has been actively looking to raise the funds to replace its 12-year-old machine. On Monday, the hospital got a check that may help it get its fundraising drive over the finish line.

"This is really incredible. How did you raise this much money?" Memorial President & CEO Joseph Ruffolo asked as he stared at a check for $12,000 delivered to him by the students, teachers and staff at Starpoint Middle School.
