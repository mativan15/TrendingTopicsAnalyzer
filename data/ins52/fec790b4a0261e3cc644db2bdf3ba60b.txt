Shares in Snapchat's parent company plunged more than 26 percent on Thursday on a quarterly earnings report that showed revenue was slowing as online advertisers tighten budgets.

In what could be a harbinger of pain to come for other tech firms like Google and Meta that rely on digital ads to make their money, Snap said that revenue in the recently ended quarter grew just 6 percent to $1.13 billion when compared to the same period the previous year.

Snap reported that it lost $360 million in the quarter, compared with a $72 million loss in the third quarter of last year.
