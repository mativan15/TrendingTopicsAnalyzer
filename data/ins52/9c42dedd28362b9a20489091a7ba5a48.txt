The U.S. Department of State is proud to announce the launch of the Global Emerging Leaders in International Cyberspace Security (GEL-ICS) Fellowship, in partnership with the Meridian International Center.  The fellowship will support the development of a diverse global network of future cyber policy leaders who share the U.S. and other likeminded partners' vision for cyberspace.  It is designed to equip emerging leaders from the governments of these foreign partners with the knowledge and global connections to be effective advocates of the non-binding framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace, which has been affirmed by the UN General Assembly.
