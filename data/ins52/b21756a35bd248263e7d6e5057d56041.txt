Michigan State football is trying to get in early on what appears to be an elite edge rusher in the 2026 class.
Tyler Atkinson of Loganville, Ga. announced on Tuesday that he's received a scholarship offer from the Spartans. Atkinson is a edge rusher in the 2026 class.
Atkinson is yet to be ranked by 247Sports, but that has more to do with him being in the class of 2026. When rankings do eventually come out, it appears he'll be a highly-rated prospect based on who already is showing interest in his talents.
