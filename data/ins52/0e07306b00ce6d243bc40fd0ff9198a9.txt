There is a phrase that crops up in the music business when anyone starts taking themselves too seriously: we're not exactly dealing with life and death. In the case of Ajimal, a falsetto-voiced singer who took second place in Glastonbury's Emerging Talent competition in 2020 and will finally be making his debut at the much-delayed festival this year, he really is dealing with life and death. When he isn't making exquisitely delicate, complex dream pop with shades of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, Ajimal is Fran O'Hanlon, a palliative care doctor from Newcastle who specialises in easing people's pain, physical and psychological, as they reach the end of their life.
