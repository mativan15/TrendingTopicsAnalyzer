It's almost two years since South Korea's Posco Group began expanding in earnest into the battery raw materials business as part of plan to play a greater role in the supply chain for cleaner cars.

By 2030, the Seoul-based steel giant forecasts it will have production capacity of around 605,000 tons for cathode-active materials, 322,000 tons for anode materials, 300,000 tons for lithium and 220,000 tons for nickel.
