NEW YORK (AP) — A New York man was convicted Wednesday of orchestrating the murder of his father in what prosecutors said was a plot to take over the older man's lucrative real estate empire.

A federal jury found Anthony Zottola Sr. and an associate guilty of conspiracy and murder-for-hire in the October 2018 killing of 71-year-old Sylvester Zottola, who was shot was he waited to pick up a cup of coffee at a McDonald's drive-thru in the Bronx. Anthony Zottola also tried unsuccessfully to have his brother, Salvatore Zottola, killed, according to prosecutors.
