After multiples cheating accusations – which at one point included the rumoured use of vibrating anal beads - US chess grandmaster Hans Niemann is now suing his rival Magnus Carlsen for $100m (approx. €102m) after the Norwegian world champion accused him of cheating.

This is the latest move in the ongoing scandal that has rocked the chess world, with Niemann saying that he has been conspired against by those seeking to destroy his reputation.

'My lawsuit speaks for itself,' Niemann tweeted along with a copy of the lawsuit.
