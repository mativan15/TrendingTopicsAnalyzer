In earlier research on solving the net-zero equation, we described the nine key requirements we believe must be met for an orderly energy transition. These fall into three broad categories: physical building blocks; economic and societal adjustments; and governance, institutions, and commitments. This article focuses on the first area, particularly on the ability to create at-scale supply chains and support infrastructure for key decarbonization technologies.

The energy transition is already well under way in Europe, but it will need to accelerate significantly to meet the European Union's Fit for 55 targets and deliver on REPowerEU, an energy security action plan developed in response to events in Ukraine.
