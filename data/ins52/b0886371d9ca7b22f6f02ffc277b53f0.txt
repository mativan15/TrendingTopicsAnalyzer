By Australian Associated Press Published: 18:05 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 18:05 EDT, 2 June 2022 Australian golf ace Minjee Lee has made a flying start to the US Women's Open in North Carolina to be right in the mix for the biggest pay day in her sport's history. Lee carded a four-under-par 67 at Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club to be tied second after her opening round. The in-form world No.4 rolled in seven birdies and briefly held the lead outright at five under before finishing the day two shots behind Swedish amateur Ingrid Lindblad.
