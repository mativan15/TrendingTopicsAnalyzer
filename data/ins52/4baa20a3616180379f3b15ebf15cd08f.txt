ARSENAL face a tough test soon after the World Cup.
That's because Amazon Prime are rescheduling their clash against title rivals Man City 'early in the New Year.'

The announcement was made as Amazon broadcast several exciting Premier League matches on Wednesday.
But Arsenal vs Man City, originally meant to take place today, was not among them.
It was postponed to accommodate the North London club's previous called-off Europa League clash with PSV Eindhoven.
