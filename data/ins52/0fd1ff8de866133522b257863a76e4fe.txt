Jordan Adderley, 32, was sentenced to eight years in prison Wednesday after pleading guilty to child sex trafficking, rape and other crimes, the District Attorney's office announced. Adderley, of Brownsville, Brooklyn, met a 16-year-old in September 2020 and manipulated her into thinking he could help her find freedom, the DA said.
