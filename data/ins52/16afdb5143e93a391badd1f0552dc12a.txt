LONDON — U.K. Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt used his first Monday on the job to announce that "almost all" tax measures announced by his predecessor would be reversed. It follows major reversals in recent weeks over the government's plan to scrap the top rate of income tax and ditch a planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%. On Friday, Prime Minister Liz Truss fired her Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng less than six weeks after the pair took office, appearing to blame the chaos sparked in financial markets by the budget he announced on Sept 23.
