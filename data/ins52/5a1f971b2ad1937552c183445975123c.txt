The festival of lights is less than a month away and celebrations are expected to be extra special this year after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic. Touted as India's biggest festival, Diwali is marked to observe the victory of good over evil. Elaborate decorations of homes, offices and public spaces with traditional clay lamps, paper lanterns, fairy lights, the bursting of firecrackers, exchange of gifts with loved ones, purchase of gold and other valuable items, and the preparation of delicacies are essential elements of the celebrations.
