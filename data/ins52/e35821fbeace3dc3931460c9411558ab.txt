Liz Truss is eligible for a taxpayer-funded allowance capped at 115,000 pounds ($129,000) a year for the rest of her life.

Despite her short time in office, Ms. Truss became eligible on Thursday for what's called the Public Duty Costs Allowance — a government reimbursement plan for staff and salary costs incurred by former prime ministers 'arising from their special position in public life' after they leave office, according to the government's website.
