The shake-ups continue at Minnesota Public Radio. This time it's the departure of MPR News managing editor Sarah Glover, who lasted just a little more than 13 months in the job. Glover, a former president for the National Association of Black Journalists, will become vice president for news and civic dialogue at WHYY, the public radio station in Philadelphia. Before coming to St. Paul, Glover had spent decades in Philadelphia, tackling a variety of jobs in print and TV newsrooms. "Sarah Glover's experience spans every aspect of contemporary news coverage, including broadcast and digital reporting, multimedia content and photojournalism," WHYY president and CEO Bill Marrazzo said on the station's website.
