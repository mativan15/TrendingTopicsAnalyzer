Commonwealth Charter Academy (CCA) is the biggest cyber charter operating in Pennsylvania. In business since 2003, it is a huge money maker. Cyber charters in Pennsylvania benefit from several laws. Most notably, cyber charters are paid based on the per pupil cost of the student's 'home' district; in most districts that means at least $10,000 per student, despite the fact that these online charters have far lower operating costs than brick and mortar schools. Common sense and independent studies suggest that taxpayers are overpaying for cyber charters.
