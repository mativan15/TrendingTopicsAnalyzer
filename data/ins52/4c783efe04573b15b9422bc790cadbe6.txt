The UK's secret property market generated £30 billion worth of sales last year amid the post-pandemic boom — the highest figure in well over a decade.Previously, buying off-market was the preserve of wealthy house-hunters, but amid the UK's severe supply shortage thousands turned to buyers' agents to try and hunt down a new home.In 2021, an estimated 98,235 homes were sold off-market, a 51 per cent increase on the previous year and the third largest annual total of off-market transactions in the last decade, according to research by real estate fund Alliance Fund.
