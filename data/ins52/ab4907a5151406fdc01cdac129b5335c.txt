Faulty lights and electrics are the most common reason for cars failing their MOT, Yahoo News UK analysis of Department for Transport (DfT) figures has found.

While many may be worried about obvious issues like worn tyres or brake pads, 26% of faults since 2019 that caused cars to fail MOTs were to do with 'lamps, reflectors and electrical equipment'.

The next most common reason for a failure was suspension (19%), while brakes was third (17%).
