The world was in shock after the Uvalde tragedy, where a mass shooting by a gunman left 24 dead in an elementary school and a similar incident in Buffalo, New York, where 14 students lost their life. These two events have intensified the debate on gun control and scrutiny of gun rights organizations. The former US president, Donald Trump, said this is the time to tighten the security of schools around the nation. He has called on lawmakers to make sure incidents like these don't happen again. 
Trump emphasized single entry points in schools with doors that can be locked from inside and hired security guards.
