Groundswell NZ is encouraging those wanting to join a nationwide protest from South Canterbury to join a convoy headed to Christchurch to help send a message to the Government. A nationwide protest was announced by Groundswell NZ a day after the Government released a document on October 11 proposing to tax farmers for emissions on food production. Groundswell NZ South Canterbury co-ordinator Roger Small said they had decided not to the hold a protest in Timaru, as they wanted to target New Zealand's main centres.
