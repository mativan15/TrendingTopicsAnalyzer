AMAZON has opened its first physical clothing store complete with secret dressing room doors that have a special feature to ensure your privacy.
The store in Glendale, California, has "back doors" in the dressing rooms where employees can hand you different items to try on, and the front door locks while they have access to the back for privacy reasons.
