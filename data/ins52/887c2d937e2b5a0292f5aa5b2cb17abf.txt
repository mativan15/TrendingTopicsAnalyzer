A pair of Sky Sports pundits joked about the biggest issue that will prevent Harry Kane from winning his fourth golden boot, and it's something the Tottenham striker can do nothing about.

Kane has three EPL golden boots to his name, winning the award outright or sharing it in the 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2020–21 campaigns.

He's started the current season in fine form, with his penalty against Everton on Saturday evening bringing his goals tally to nine.
