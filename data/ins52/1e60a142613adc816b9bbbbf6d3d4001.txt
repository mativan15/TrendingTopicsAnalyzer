If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That's the approach that the developers of Terra (LUNC) decided to take after the spectacular collapse of the token. 
That collapse resulted from LUNA's sibling stablecoin TerraUSD (USTC) losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The intense sell-off caused the underlying algorithm behind TerraUSD to go haywire, with LUNA losing nearly all of its value.
But the carnage isn't over for the Terra ecosystem. Here's why the new Terra LUNA token is crashing.
