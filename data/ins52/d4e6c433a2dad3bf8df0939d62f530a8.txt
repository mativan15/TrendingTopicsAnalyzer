Key Takeaways OPEC controls 40% of the world's oil production and accounts for 60% of internationally traded oil. This gives the organization massive control over the international price of oil, allowing it to keep prices high. Oil prices directly influence the value of oil stocks. When OPEC takes steps to increase oil prices, it can also boost the price of oil stocks.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced last week that it would cut production of oil by approximately 2 million barrels of oil per day.
