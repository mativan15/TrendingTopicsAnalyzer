The Oklahoma Sooners are one of the hottest teams in college baseball. Five straight series wins to close out the Big 12 regular season and a run through the tournament to capture their first Big 12 tournament title since 2013.

Apparently, that wasn't enough as the NCAA announced its 16 regional hosts before the Big 12 title game had reached its conclusion. Even with the Sooners up 8-1 heading into the final innings, the NCAA thought both Texas and Oklahoma State were more worthy hosts of an NCAA regional.
