Jun. 2—BOXFORD — A Boxford man who lost his plumbing license four years ago is now heading to federal prison for a year for failing to report more than $3.7 million in business income — a significant portion of which, federal prosecutors say, was obtained by defrauding customers, including elderly and disabled individuals.

Jared "Jay" Derrico, 35, of 24 Haymeadow Road, Boxford, was the owner of Derrico Services and The Pipe Surgeon — businesses he continued to run even after losing his plumbing license in 2018, court papers say.
