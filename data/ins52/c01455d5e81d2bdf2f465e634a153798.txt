Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digested quarterly corporate earnings amid continued political and economic uncertainty.

By 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% lower, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%, while CAC 40 in France edged 0.1% higher.

Data released earlier Thursday showed that German producer prices rose by a massive 45.8% on an annual basis in September, up 2.3% on the month, showing sustained inflationary pressure in the economic pipeline.
