Semafor, a new global news company, debuted Tuesday. The company is launching with $25 million in funding. Semafor is putting a new spin on the old-fashioned news article, including a distinct section for reporters to share their view of the issue at hand. Semafor, a new digital media company with a focus on global news for college-educated readers, debuted Tuesday with intentions to bring transparency and clarity to a news business its co-founders believe has become too polarized. Semafor has been preparing for its launch since January, when former New York Times media columnist Ben Smith and former Bloomberg Media Chief Executive Officer Justin Smith quit their jobs to start the venture.
