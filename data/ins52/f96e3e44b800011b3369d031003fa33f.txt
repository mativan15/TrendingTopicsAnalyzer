Andrea Mercedes Palacios, the girlfriend of Jeff Gladney, has been identified as the woman who died alongside the Arizona Cardinals defensive back in a car accident Monday morning.
Palacios has been identified by both her family and the Dallas County police.
'She was just a loving, selfless person,' Palacios' brother, John Paul Figueroa, told NBC Dallas Fort-Worth. 'Just outgoing. I know she loved Jeff because they were always together.'
Gladney and Palacios died early Monday morning after a two-car accident on the Woodall Rodgers Freeway in Dallas.
