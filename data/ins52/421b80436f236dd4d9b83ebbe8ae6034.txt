— Confirmation students at Calvary Lutheran Church in Willmar recently had the opportunity to get to know their diverse neighbors, taking a tour of different stores in downtown Willmar, eating ethnic foods, and hearing about the life of a Somali refugee who settled in Willmar with his family.

"I think it was good to get away from what you are used to to try something new and learn things that you didn't learn before about downtown, because I live here and I didn't know half the things," said seventh-grader Brooklyn Mathews.
