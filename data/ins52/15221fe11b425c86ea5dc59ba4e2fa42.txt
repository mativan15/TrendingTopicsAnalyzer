Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Chip stocks initially fell after market leader NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) cut numbers for the current quarter. Naturally, the market reacted negatively, selling off competitor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the process. However, that reaction wasn't rational, with the stock already down 50% from the highs. My investment thesis remains ultra-Bullish even after the stock has rallied to $99 following the market realization that the negative guidance from NVIDIA wasn't so bad.
