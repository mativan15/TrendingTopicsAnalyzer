If you want to know who really controls Chesterfield Resources plc (LON:CHF), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 34% to be precise, is public companies. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

While public companies were the group that benefitted the most from last week's UK£521k market cap gain, institutions too had a 30% share in those profits.
