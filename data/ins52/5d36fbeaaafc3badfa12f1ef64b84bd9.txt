Things get a little saucy when Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) comes to town. Is it her red hair? Is it that she wears designer high heel shoes instead of sensible sneakers? Who knows. What we do know is that she's on a mission to educate teenagers on the importance of safe sex, and she has Bailey (Chandra Wilson) and Jo (Camilla Luddington) flanking her in the conference room, surrounded by plastic displays of the female anatomy.

She also has a handful of interns on deck, ready to be filmed, because everyone knows that the only way to make sex ed cool is for a sex ed video to go viral.
