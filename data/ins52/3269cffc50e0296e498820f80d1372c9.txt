Biologists working with the Oregon Zoo last month had the chance to see polar bears Nora and Amelia Gray in a new light: a laser beam. Researchers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service tested their state-of-the-art laser technology by scanning the zoo's polar bears in their Polar Passage habitat. If effective, the laser scanning could provide a safe, non-invasive way to monitor bears in the wild. 'Currently the way we weigh bears is with a big metal tripod, and they have to be immobilized,' said Lindsey Mangipane, a polar bear biologist with the U.
