A Residency That's 'Making Waves'
Just because you're in the desert doesn't mean you can't enjoy some yacht rock! The Docksiders recently dropped anchor at Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino's new live music and entertainment venue, The Duomo, launching Las Vegas' first yacht rock residency. Led by three-time GRAMMY-nominated record producer Kevin Sucher, the eight-piece group plays an ever-changing set list of soft rock hits from the ‘70s and ‘80s, like 'Escape (The Piña Colada Song),' while getting audiences into an island frame of mind with their fun costume changes and visuals.
