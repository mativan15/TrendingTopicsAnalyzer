(Reuters) -Just Eat Takeaway.com, Europe's largest meal delivery company, said on Wednesday it made an underlying profit in the third quarter, sooner than expected, after cutting expenses on delivery costs and operations.

The average value of orders, known as gross transaction value (GTV), a common measure for e-commerce companies, rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting higher prices on menus, but the number of orders weakened, a trend expected by analysts.

The group said in September it expected to have positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the second half of the year.
