Selling in the stock market is set to resume and overpower buying pressure after last week's 7% rally in the S&P 500, which was the index's strongest week since April 2020.That's according to Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton, who highlighted in a Tuesday note that upside in the stock market appears limited as the overall trend remains down.Specifically, Stockton sees the falling 50-day moving average as a likely resistance zone for the S&P 500. That level currently stands at 4,270, which represents potential upside of just 3% from current levels.
