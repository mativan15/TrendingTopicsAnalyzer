As my colleague Graeme Wearden reports on his business live blog, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has criticised the decision to allow second home owners to get the £400 energy bills rebate twice. She claimed on Sky News that this would not have been necessary if the Treasury had not 'rushed through' its package. She said:If the government hadn't have been resisting Labour's calls for a windfall tax and this additional support for months, the government could have taken the time to get this package right.
