A jury on Friday found a Virginia Beach man guilty of murdering his ex-girlfriend in July 2018 during a violent argument over money that was witnessed by the couple's young twins.

The 10-man, two-woman jury deliberated for about 1½ hours before finding Lamont Johnson guilty of the second-degree murder in the death of Bellamy Gamboa. They also convicted Johnson of two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for leaving the couple's 20-month-old toddlers home alone while he disposed of their mother's body.
