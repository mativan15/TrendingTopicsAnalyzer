After peaking in Q3 FY2022, the turnover of home textile exporters moderated in the quarters ended March 2022 and June 2022 amid a slowdown in demand, said ICRA on Monday. Further, high and increasing raw material and logistic costs resulted in a consistent decline in operating margins since Q2 FY2022. Rising inflationary concerns, the resultant slowdown in consumer discretionary spending, uncertainty on economic growth outlook and cautious buying by retailers to manage inventories are affecting sales in key export markets.
