Photo: Getty ImagesEarly voting starts in Iowa today! I have never voted early in an election, but I will be today. I've explained the reasons why. Having said that, before today I have always voted on election day. I have never mailed in a ballot and I won't be doing that. I will vote in person and present my ID and exercise my right. I'm not against absentee voting, I just feel you should be... you know...absent! How about you? Will you be voting early or waiting until Election day? Take part in today's Poll.
