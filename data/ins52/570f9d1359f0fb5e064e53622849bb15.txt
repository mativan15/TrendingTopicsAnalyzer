The Waves Enterprise stack and further development of WE ecosystem will be managed not by a group of centralized companies but by an enterprise-grade decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The WE DAO seeks to decentralize the Waves Enterprise technology's power, jurisdiction, and management to a governing council and active members of the WE ecosystem.
