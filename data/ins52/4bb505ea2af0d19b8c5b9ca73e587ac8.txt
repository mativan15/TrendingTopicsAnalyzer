The European Commission denounced Hungary's poster campaign comparing EU sanctions on Russia to bombs as "inappropriate" on Wednesday.

The Hungarian government has been promoting a "national consultation" on the sanctions with a poster campaign featuring pictures of bombs as "sanctions".

"It is inappropriate to show pictures of bombs or of missiles in relation to the sanctions, thinking that the aim of the sanctions is precisely to stop the bombs from falling on Ukraine," Dana Spinant, the European Commission's deputy chief spokesperson, told reporters.
