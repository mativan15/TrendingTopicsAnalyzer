ATHENS, Ga. (PRWEB) October 19, 2022 The Clarke County School District ('CCSD') has engaged Griffin & Strong, P.C. ('GSPC') to conduct a Disparity Study to determine whether there is a significant statistical disparity between the availability of qualified, willing and able minority and women owned firms and the utilization of such businesses by CCSD. The Disparity Study will gather information necessary to determine whether all qualified firms have the maximum practicable opportunity to compete for and participate in CCSD's procurement of prime contracts and associated subcontracts and, if indicated by the evidence, will support the use of strategies to ensure such opportunities.
