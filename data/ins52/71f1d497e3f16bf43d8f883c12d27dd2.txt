SAN DIEGO —

The second postseason start of Tyler Anderson's career couldn't have gone much better. The Dodgers left-hander blanked the San Diego Padres on two hits through five innings, striking out six and walking two. He retired nine straight batters from the second through fifth innings.

His pitch count stood at 86 through five innings, with the left-handed-hitting Juan Soto, whom Anderson had struck out in the first inning and retired on a groundout in the third, due to lead off the bottom of the sixth.
