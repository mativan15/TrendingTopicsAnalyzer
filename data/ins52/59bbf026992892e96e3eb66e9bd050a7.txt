OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says there were times during the 'Freedom Convoy' protests last winter that the three levels of government were not working together as well as they could.

But he says what's important is that in the end, everyone came together to end the occupation of downtown Ottawa.

A transcript released Tuesday of a phone call between Trudeau and Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson shows that Trudeau accused Ontario Premier Doug Ford of 'hiding from his responsibility' to help with the convoy for political reasons.
