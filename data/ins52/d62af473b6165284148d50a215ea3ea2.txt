Newcastle striker Callum Wilson has insisted the pressure is on Tottenham as two of the Premier League's in-form clubs go head-to-head on Sunday.Third-placed Spurs have won all seven fixtures they have played on their own pitch to date this season, a run which includes Champions League victories over Marseille and Eintracht Frankfurt, although they will go into the game on the back of Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat at Manchester United.The Magpies, who are three places and five points worse off, are unbeaten in six and have won three of their last four either side of a creditable 0-0 draw at Old Trafford last weekend.
