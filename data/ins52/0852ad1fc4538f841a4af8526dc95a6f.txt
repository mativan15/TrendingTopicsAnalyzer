Twenty-four tournaments down. Three to go to determine a champion.

The PGA Tour Champions head to the three-event Charles Schwab Cup Playoffs this week at the Dominion Energy Charity Classic.

A total of 72 golfers qualified for the postseason but only 68 will tee it up this week at The Country Club of Virginia's James River Course in Richmond, Virginia.

From there, the field will be reduced to 54 and then only the top 36 in the standings will advance to the finale at Phoenix Country Club for the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.
