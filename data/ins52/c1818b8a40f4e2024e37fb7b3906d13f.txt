After the leaked recordings of racist comments from some of Los Angeles' most powerful Latino leaders upended the city over the last two weeks, it was clear healing wasn't going to come during Thursday night's hourlong town hall. But many Angelenos were determined to unite and move forward — starting with the resignations of the City Council members involved.

The most common message that came from dozens of residents at 'L.A. in Crisis: The Call for Change,' hosted by The Times and KTTV Channel 11, was that Councilmembers Kevin de León and Gil Cedillo should resign.
