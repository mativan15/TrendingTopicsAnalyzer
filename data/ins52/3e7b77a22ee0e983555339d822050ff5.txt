Form D Friday is an Atlanta Inno feature highlighting regulatory filings and tips about Atlanta companies raising capital. Form D reports are a type of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission form used to file a notice of exempt offerings of securities. The SEC requires companies file the notice within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering. These forms don't include a lot of details but can provide clues as to what investors and business owners are planning.
