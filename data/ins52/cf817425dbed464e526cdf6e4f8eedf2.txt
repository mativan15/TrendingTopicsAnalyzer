VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Once a province or state exceeds a certain population size, the government's role in the economy begins to grow, finds a new study released today by the Fraser Institute, an independent, non-partisan Canadian public policy think-tank. 'If the population grows past certain thresholds, the size of government compared to the economy also begins to grow, which can limit the economic opportunities for residents,' said Russell Sobel, professor of economics and entrepreneurship at the Citadel, senior fellow at the Fraser Institute and author of Population and the Fiscal Outcomes of Subnational Jurisdictions.
