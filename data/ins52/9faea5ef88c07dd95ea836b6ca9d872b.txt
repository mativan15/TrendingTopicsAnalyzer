Gerrard was on Thursday night dismissed less than two hours after Villa's 3-0 defeat at Fulham, which left the club with just nine points from their opening 11 games and placed precariously above the relegation zone.Villa owners Wes Edens and Nassef Sawiris are determined to appoint a big-name replacement for the former England midfielder and are prepared to give the new boss carte blanche to spend big in an attempt to transform the club's fortunes.Pochettino is understood to be a leading target for the job, with Villa hoping to tempt the former Tottenham boss into another long-term project to revive a sleeping giant.
