North Carolina Central University officials have noticed a change in students since a January bomb threat at the historically Black university: more depression, anxiety, and distress.

"With the recent bomb threats, we saw interruptions to how students felt safe and secure on our campus," said Charnequa Kennedy, director of the public liberal arts institution's counseling center.

NCCU received the bomb threat at approximately 5:30 pm on Jan. 4. The campus went into lockdown. Students were relocated.
