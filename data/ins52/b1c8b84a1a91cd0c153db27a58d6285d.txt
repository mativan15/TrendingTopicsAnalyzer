AgenciesIn 2023, Newcastle will host Magic Weekend once more, this time for a whole round of Betfred Super League games on the first weekend in June. On June 3 and 4, St James' Park will serve as the venue for a record-breaking seventh time, with all six games being broadcast live on Sky Sports. The announcement was made a day after England defeated Samoa 60-6 to begin the Rugby League World Cup in front of 43,119 people at Newcastle United's stadium. Rhodri Jones, the chief commercial officer, said that they are excited to announce that Magic Weekend will be returning to Newcastle.
