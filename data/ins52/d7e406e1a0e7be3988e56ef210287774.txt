A Nova Scotia graphic designer and Tragically Hip fan has raised thousands of dollars for the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada with a special tribute to Gordon Downie. Erin McGuire says he knew instantly he wanted to help raise funds and awareness when he learned of Downie's diagnosis. "In 2016, when I found out that Gordon was diagnosed with brain cancer, I was floored," said McGuire. "I wanted to do something." That's when McGuire created a poster called "By the Numbers." "'By the Numbers is a design that utilizes every numerical reference in every Tragically Hip song," he said.
