The abortion pill is now the most common method used to terminate U.S. pregnancies, but a newly released study finds that a third of women who take the drug find the experience more traumatic than anticipated.

A white paper issued this month by Support After Abortion found that 34% of those surveyed who obtained chemical abortions said their 'outlook on themselves or their decision changed negatively since their abortion,' in some cases years later.

In addition, 24% said they searched for help after their abortion, while 39% said they did not seek help but that they could have benefited from speaking with someone.
