Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Sunday said that the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has become synonymous with scams, and asked the party workers to expose its failures and scams before the people. Addressing a mega organisation meet at central Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, Nadda said the BJP will trounce the AAP in both municipal as well as assembly elections, setting the party's tone for the civic elections in Delhi that are likely to be held in December. Nadda also released a pamphlet about the central government's Delhi-specific schemes and initiatives, and the work done by the BJP in the municipal corporations during their 15-year term.
