We now have an idea of how much endorsement money a major college football program's players can collectively earn.

Ohio State coach Ryan Day said Thursday morning that he thinks it takes $13 million in endorsement deals to keep his roster intact. Day's remarks at a school business event were reported by Cleveland.com and he said that a top quarterback can request $2 million in endorsement deals.

From Cleveland.com:

Day said the Buckeyes have been gathering information by talking to recruits and their families and getting a sense of what other schools might be discussing with NIL deals.
