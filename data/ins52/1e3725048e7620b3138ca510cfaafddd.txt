Oct. 16—SENATE REPUBLICAN nominee Don Bolduc said the most-asked question he gets on the campaign trail is how his personality as a retired brigadier general would translate to Capitol Hill, where junior senators are often better off seen than heard.

"There are many people who don't know me, that judge me as a heartless general who stands up at the position of attention and follows orders," Bolduc said in his closing at the Greater Nashua Chamber of Commerce forum.

This is why he brings up volunteering with his wife, Sharon, during the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver Meals on Wheels in Manchester.
