In Week 7, 10 of the 14 Big Ten teams were in action. No Friday night lights this time as all five games took place on Saturday. It all began with Illinois improving to 6-1 on the season to remain in a tie for first in the Big Ten West with Purdue, who outlasted Nebraska.
Each game was relatively close with the exception of Michigan-Penn State. The game was close at the half but the Wolverines ran away with this victory thanks to the performances of the offensive line, the running backs, and a stifling defense.
