NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Enforcement Directorate on a plea seeking interim bail by former Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) CMD Kapil Wadhawan who has been accused of money laundering in the multi-crore Yes Bank fraud case. A bench of Justices K M Joseph and Hrishikesh Roy asked the agency to file its reply within a week. "Counsel for the respondent seeks time to file a response. Put up for hearing on November 2," the bench said. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Wadhawan, told the court that he had five surgeries and sought interim bail on medical grounds.
