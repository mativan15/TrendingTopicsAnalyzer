On 93% of leisure carrier Breeze Airways' routes, it has no competition.

That is one of the reasons CEO David Neeleman, a longtime aviation entrepreneur and the founder of JetBlue Airlines, picked Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and a nonstop flight to San Francisco for the 1-year-old airline's latest expansion. CVG currently has no direct connection to the Bay Area.

'We're trying to find these pockets of pain where people have to make a connection and pay high fares,' Neeleman told the Business Courier in an interview.
