A Black spa owner in Texas said she had to take matters into her own hands Sunday after being racially harassed by a white customer who claimed her 'race and class destroyed' his life.

'You ruined my life, my entire legacy of being a Christian,' the man told her in a video that's since gone viral.

The business owner, who requested anonymity for her own safety, said the incident was particularly unnerving in the aftermath of the massacre at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo, which was carried out by a gunman obsessed with the white supremacist 'great replacement theory.
