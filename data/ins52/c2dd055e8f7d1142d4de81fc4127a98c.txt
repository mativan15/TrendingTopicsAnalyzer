Israel has signed a free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates, its first big trade accord with an Arab state and a move aimed at boosting trade between the two Middle Eastern nations.
The pact was signed in Dubai by Israel's Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbivai and her counterpart, UAE Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq al-Marri, on Tuesday after months of negotiations.
'Done,' Israel's Ambassador to the UAE Amir Hayek said on Twitter, replying to another tweet he posted earlier saying 'the UAE and Israel will sign FTA in the next hour'.
