Saudi Arabia cuts oil production and the Biden administration says the country is 'siding with Russia' and announces intention to 're-evaluate the relationship.'
Iran actually sides with Russia, selling the country kamikaze drones that murder Ukrainian civilians, and the White House says . . . next to nothing.
Iran is even doubling down. Two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats have told Reuters that Tehran has now promised to provide Moscow with surface-to-surface missiles and even more drones, but as of yet we see no signs of a serious policy reevaluation in Washington.
