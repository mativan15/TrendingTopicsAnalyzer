May 29—Some business owners on Gray Street believe the eventual completion of a two-way road conversion could bring more patronage to the shops in the corridor, and others have concerns about future parking availability and how the project will affect their operations.

Norman residents here since the early 70s saw the transformation of Main Street and Gray Street to one-way, following a nationwide trend at the time.

Two-way Gray Street will make its return when the city completes a conversion project slated for Spring 2023.
