Nikki Magner from Peterborough had been looking for a savings account to save money towards car repairs and her MOT.While she was attracted by the chance to win a cash prize, she never thought she'd actually win.The 50-year-old holistic therapist said: 'I had literally only just opened the account, I went back into the account to check my transfer had gone through and there was £1,500 sat in there.'Initially I thought something had gone wrong and I had transferred too much, not thinking I had won.
