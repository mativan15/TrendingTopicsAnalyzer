Ricardo Pepi is loving life in the Netherlands.
The U.S. men's national team striker scored a 90th minute goal as Groningen strolled to a 3-0 win over FC Dordrecht in the first round of the KNVB Cup.
The tap-in marked his fifth goal in six games since moving to Groningen on loan from Augsburg. Pepi's instant success has made him an every-game starter for head coach Frank Wormuth, and he played the full 90 minutes as Groningen comfortably beat their second-division opponents.
While scoring the goal required little more than side-footing into an empty net from the doorstep, Pepi's work rate was the key to the chance ever happening.
