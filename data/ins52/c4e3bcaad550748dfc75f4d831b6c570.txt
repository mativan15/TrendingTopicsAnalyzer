In 2018, Atom Computing used its initial seed funding of $5M to secretly begin building a proof-of-concept quantum platform equipped with 100 qubits. On the strength of its technology and increased investor confidence, Atom took in another $15M in Series A funding in mid-2021 plus three grants from the National Science Foundation. The Series A funds were used to build a larger team of quantum specialists. Earlier this year, the company closed another $60M in Series B funding.
