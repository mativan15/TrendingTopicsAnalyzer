On the morning of December 11, 2018, hours before her government's fate was to be decided, former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje offered prayers at the Tripura Sundari temple in Banswara district.
The counting of votes polled in the Assembly elections began while Raje was at the temple's sanctum sanctorum. As the results came in, it became evident that the Raje-led BJP government had been voted out by the public.
On September 30, Raje — now out of power for more than three and a half years and in the middle of a power tussle within the Rajasthan BJP — once again visited the Tripura Sundari temple.
