May 28—A suspect police apprehended with the help of civilians earlier this month after he was accused of battering several people in the downtown area is a career criminal once charged with murder, according to court records.

Marcos Antonio Montoya, 43, was arrested earlier this month after police said he committed a string of violent batteries — including two at downtown hotels and one on West Manhattan Ave., where he was accused of pistol-whipping award-winning jeweler Lawrence Baca outside his studio.
