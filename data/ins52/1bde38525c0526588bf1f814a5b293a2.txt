Slash Film John Carpenter is a horror legend. Over his decades-long career, he has turned out classic after classic, even being awarded the Golden Coach Award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The likes of "Halloween" reinvented the horror genre, revolutionizing the slasher film while cementing chief antagonist Michael Myers as a horror icon to be reckoned with. Remakes such as "The Thing" were wonders of practical effects, and "Starman" proved that Carpenter could move hearts as easily as he could incite screams.
