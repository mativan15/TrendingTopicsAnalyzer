NEW YORK — Former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is expected to be called to testify as a defense witness in the trial of Colony Capital LLC founder Tom Barrack on charges of acting as an agent of the United Arab Emirates, a prosecutor said.

At a hearing outside the jury's presence, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Heeren said Wednesday that defense lawyers recently told prosecutors they planned to call Mnuchin. However, defense lawyers and prosecutors are jousting over how extensively Mnuchin can be questioned about possible bias, according to people familiar with the matter.
