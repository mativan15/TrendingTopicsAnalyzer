Richard joins Flume Health during a moment of pivotal growth. Flume has rapidly evolved since its launch in 2020 from a challenger third-party administrator (TPA) that serviced self-insured employers into Flume OS, a Health-Plan-as-a-Service platform, that makes it easy to build and run individualized health plans. Flume Health serves as an API-enabled utility layer for both established and emerging health insurers as well as care providers to launch health plans tailored to the unique needs of specific patient populations.
