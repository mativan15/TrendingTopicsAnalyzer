Months of heavy selling has crippled the growth-focused technology sector, prompting prominent investors to come to the conclusion that a slew of stocks are now ripe for investment.

To be sure, many also agree a bottom hasn't been priced in just yet, but stocks have toppled so far off their record highs that some battered names look like bargains. And the ongoing earnings season could serve as a catalyst that gets these stocks climbing again, at least in the short-term, they say.

"This is the most opportunity I've seen since Q3 of '08, so I would say it's foolish to completely ignore any sector — let alone technology — just because of macro headwinds," said Paul Schatz, founder and president of Heritage Capital.
