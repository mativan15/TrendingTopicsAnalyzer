While National Storage Affiliates Trust (NYSE:NSA) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 19% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 67% in that time. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 29% drop, in the last year.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
