The Arizona Department of Corrections announced Friday it awarded a prison health care contract to NaphCare, an Alabama based health care provider that settled with the United States Department of Justice over allegations of overcharging clients in 2021.

In a statement, the department said NaphCare was founded in 1989 and has provided health care services to the Pima County Sheriff's Office since August 2021. NaphCare currently provides health care services to local, state and federal clients in 32 states, the statement said.
