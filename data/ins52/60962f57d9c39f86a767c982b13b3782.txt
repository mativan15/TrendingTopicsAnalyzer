Futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% Wednesday after wavering between small gains and losses. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, while those for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 fell 0.1%, erasing gains from earlier in the day. On Tuesday, major U.S. indexes fell, leading the S&P 500 to end May roughly flat after a tumultuous month marked by major moves in both directions.
