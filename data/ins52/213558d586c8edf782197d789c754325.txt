The Financial Times editorial board called Tuesday on China to effectuate economic reforms or risk losing investment from companies abroad. "Signs that China's economy, the world's second largest, may flirt with recession in the second quarter this year are worrying for global growth. But they provide Beijing with an opportunity," the editorial board wrote. "It could use these sobering indications to reconsider not only aspects of its "Zero Covid" policy but also its treatment of foreign direct investors; what is good for them is good for China's own economy," the piece continues.
