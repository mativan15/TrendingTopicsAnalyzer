The average price of a UK home has topped £250,000 for the first time, but the proportion of sellers reducing their asking price and the time taken to sell a home have both increased, according to Zoopla's latest market index.The property company, which bases its monthly snapshot on a combination of sold prices, mortgage valuations and data for agreed sales, said the average cost of a home hit £250,200 in April, but that the pace of price growth was slowing.Annual house price inflation was down from 9% in March to 8.
