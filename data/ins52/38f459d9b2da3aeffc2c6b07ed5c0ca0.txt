Here is an underdog sports movie with the longest training montage I think I have ever seen – it pretty much had an interval. Hustle is co-produced by its star Adam Sandler and real-life basketball legend LeBron James, whose presence has essentially licensed a huge roster of real-life cameos from basketball stars, players and coaches, who are namechecked in the closing credits. The whole thing looks a bit like a corporate promo for the NBA, and certainly does not admit of anything unwholesome in the world of pro basketball.
