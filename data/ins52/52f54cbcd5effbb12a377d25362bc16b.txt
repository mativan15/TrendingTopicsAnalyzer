Voice actress Helena Taylor is calling on fans to boycott Bayonetta 3, claiming that developer PlatinumGames allegedly offered her only $4000 for the lead role.
Since the first Bayonetta 3 gameplay trailers, many have been curious why Taylor did not reprise her role as the title character. Over the weekend, Taylor explained why in a series of videos shared on Twitter.
'As an actor, I trained for a total of seven and a half years. Three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art Lamda with voice coach Barbara Berkery, and four and a half years with the legendary Larry Moss in Los Angeles,' Taylor said.
