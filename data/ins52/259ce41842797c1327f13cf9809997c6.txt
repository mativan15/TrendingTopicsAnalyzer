Ichabod/iStock via Getty Images Investing is a long-term initiative, not something that you can expect to benefit from immediately after buying into a security. Sometimes, it can take time for a prospect to pay off, and other times you end up not achieving the upside that you wanted at all. One company that I recently recommended as a valid opportunity is SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE:SEAS). Fundamentally, the business is performing quite well. On the other hand, investors have hit the firm nonetheless, with a loss in shareholder value that is meaningfully greater than the loss experienced by the S&P 500.
