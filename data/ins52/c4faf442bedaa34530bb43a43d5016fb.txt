However, the two arrived separately. According to TMZ, Kim arrived with North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, while Kanye showed up by himself. Kim and Kanye have reportedly not been on speaking terms since his recent "White Lives Matter" shirt controversy, his interview with Tucker Carlson, and his anti-Semitic rants that have got his accounts restricted on both Instagram and Twitter.
