Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money. Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.

On Tuesday, Dick's Sporting Goods' Director, William J. Colombo, made a $404,950 buy of DKS, purchasing 5,000 shares at a cost of $80.99 each. Colombo was up about 2.6% on the purchase at the high point of today's trading session, with DKS trading as high as $83.
