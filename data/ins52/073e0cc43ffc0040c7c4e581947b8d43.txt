 Punjab Congress president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring on Thursday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of failing to buy paddy from the state farmers. 'As a result, they (farmers) were forced to sell it in Haryana. This is an insult to our self-respect that Punjabi farmers have to sell their paddy in the neighbouring state,' he said in a statement.
