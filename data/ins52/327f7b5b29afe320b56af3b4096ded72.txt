Gamers have two choices for modern PC gaming — portability through gaming laptops, or upgradeability through gaming desktops. Either way, these machines usually don't come cheap because they come with powerful components to meet the hefty requirements of today's video games. Fortunately, there are gaming laptop deals and gaming PC deals from retailers like HP, so if you're in the market for either one, you'll be able to enjoy significant savings that you can sink into games or accessories.
There are a lot of offers from HP, so we've selected two options for you to consider: a $250 discount for the HP Omen 16 gaming laptop, which brings its price down to $980 from its original price of $1,230, and a $450 discount for the HP Omen 25L gaming desktop, which lowers its price to $1,300 from its sticker price of $1,750.
