Let's say you walk in the local grocery store and ask the butcher what looks good today. Without hesitation, he recommends the ribeye. He says it's from a farm in Iowa where the cows get daily massages and dine on organic, hydroponically grown grass. In fact, it's some of the best ribeye he's seen all year.
