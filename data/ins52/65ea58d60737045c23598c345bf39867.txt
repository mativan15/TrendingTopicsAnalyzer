Turkeys don't vote for Christmas and today's Tory party is dominated by those giant American agri-businesses-produced, genetically modified monsters. Someone needs to break its neck, for goodness sake. It'd be a kindness.But even brutalised, beaten up Tory beasts don't vote for that. Do they?

Maybe they can.
