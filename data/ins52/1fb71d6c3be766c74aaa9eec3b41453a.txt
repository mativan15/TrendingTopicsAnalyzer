West Ham were today set to make a late decision over whether Kurt Zouma is ready to ease their centre-back crisis ahead of tonight's trip to Liverpool.Zouma has missed the Hammers' last two games because of illness but returned to training this week and David Moyes is hopeful that the Frenchman could be fit to start tonight.Craig Dawson remains a more significant doubt, having suffered a dead leg during last Thursday's win over Anderlecht.Moyes said his side had been 'rocked terribly' by the pair's absences as he was forced to shift to a back-three for Sunday's 1-1 draw at Southampton.
