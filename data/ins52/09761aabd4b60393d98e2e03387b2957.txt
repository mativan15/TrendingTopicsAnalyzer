Twitch streamer ChocoTaco has called out gambling streamer Trainwreck after yet another large donation on the platform.
Streamer and full-time gambler Trainwreck has made a name for himself by donating hefty sums of cash, cryptocurrency, and gifts to various streamers. He has also recently announced that he's topped the $10 million mark on total giveaways.
However, Trainwreck's donations don't always appear to be in the best faith or to the best people. Recently banned streamer Destiny told the story of how Trainwreck offered him $100,000 after his controversial ban.
