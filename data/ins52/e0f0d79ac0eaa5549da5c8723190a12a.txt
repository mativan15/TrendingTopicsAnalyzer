A German Shepherd has melted hearts online after a video of it laying on a dishwasher door—disobeying its owners, who were trying to get it off of it—went viral on social media.The video, shared on TikTok by the pup's owner, under the username Hushangnaim, shows the dog peacefully laying on the dishwasher door, moving its paws in agitation when its owners told him to get off of there, ignoring them.According to Pet Backer, generally German Shepherds make the best family dogs. This is because they are highly intelligent, highly adaptable, loyal, protective, devoted to their families, easy to train and obey, and great with children, among other qualities.
