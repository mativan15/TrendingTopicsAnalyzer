There's a quiet digestion of last week's rebound rally to finish out a whipsaw month, with debate crackling about how much credence to give the surge off the May 20 low. The S & P 500 entered the week riding a 9% ramp of the intraday low of 3,810, up more than 6% last week alone and boasting three consecutive days of sharply skewed upside volume. That usually speaks of buyers' urgency and tends to improve the risk/reward balance a bit. Specifically, more than 80% of New York Stock Exchange volume each day between Wednesday and Friday was in advancing stocks — something that has only happened ten times since 1980.
