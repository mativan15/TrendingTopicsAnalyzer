Several companies are facing challenges in reconciling their financial statements due to a new rule introduced by Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). According to the new rules, companies are mandated to file their financial statements with rounded off values from FY22 filings onwards. As a result, auditors are required to prepare financial statements of their companies based on rounded off values. Compliance experts say, the change in rules has forced the auditors to prepare two sets of financial statements for this year.
