Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate General Election, saying the Tories have hit 'a chaotic new low' after Wednesday night's shambolic scenes in the Commons. 
The Labour leader said the Conservatives 'lack the basic patriotic duty to keep the British people out of their own pathetic squabbles' and the country needs new leadership. 
In an address to the Trade Union Congress said that even getting rid of Liz Truss will not be enough and pledged to repeal any new anti-strike legislation that her government passes.
