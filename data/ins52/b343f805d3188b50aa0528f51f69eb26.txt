Linda Carter's (Kellie Bright) life is on the line in EastEnders next week, when she ends up in a terrifying car accident. 
The landlady of the Queen Vic is reeling in the wake of having found that Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) conned Nancy (Maddy Hill) and Zack Hudson (James Farrar) out of their money to buy a space for their restaurant.
Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) encouraged her to tell Nancy the truth about Jannie's scheming, and she reiterates such a message next week, reminding Linda that it's the right move.
