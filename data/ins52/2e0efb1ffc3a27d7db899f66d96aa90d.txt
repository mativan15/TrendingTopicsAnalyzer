A 12-year-old is in custody after he allegedly robbed a Michigan gas station with his grandfather's gun, and fired a warning shot into the ceiling, police said.

The boy reportedly walked into a gas station in the town of Hartford around 4pm on Wednesday, and stood in line behind another customer before pulling out a 9mm handgun, according to a police statement.

The store's surveillance cameras captured the armed robbery, and showed the 12-year-old pulling the firearm from a black bag and pointing it in the direction of the clerk.
