(2nd LD) Rival parties rap Kakao over disruption, summon founder for parliamentary audit(ATTN: UPDATES with bill proposal)By Lee Minji SEOUL, Oct. 17 (Yonhap) -- The ruling and main opposition parties lashed out at tech giant Kakao Corp. on Monday, branding a massive service disruption that occurred over the weekend as a "digital platform disaster" and summoning its founder to a parliamentary audit. On Saturday afternoon, a fire started at a SK C&C building that houses the data center that Kakao uses, prompting a power outage that disrupted the company's namesake messaging service KakaoTalk, as well as ride-hailing and public services tied to the app that more than 40 million use.
