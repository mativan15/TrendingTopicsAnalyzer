(9988.HK) (NYSE:BABA) has gone through some turbulent times lately, hit hard by a regulatory storm that arrived in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. But things are starting to look up for the e-commerce giant. Alibaba's revenue increased 8.9% year-on-year to 204 billion yuan ($30.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 31 March, which marked the slowest growth for any quarter since the company went public in 2014, according to the company's latest quarterly results released last Thursday.
