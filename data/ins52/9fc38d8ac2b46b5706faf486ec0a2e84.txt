V2images/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Chinese tech stocks started the week on a mostly upbeat note as the likes of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Weibo (WB) and Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY) all rose, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) got some positive sentiment from Deutsche Bank analyst Leo Chiang. In a research note Tuesday, Chiang raised his price target on Baidu's (BIDU) stock to $156 a share on the grounds that the company should continue to show more signs of recovery following an upbeat quarterly report last week.
