Oct. 21—ROCHESTER — Two downtown Rochester businesses that have been under one roof will soon combine into one name as Scrub Your Butt Soap and its cohabiting partner Tulips and Truffles Florist will move from 117 N. Broadway Ave. to 611 N. Broadway Ave. and join together as one business at the Kismet Block.

After nearly 20 years owning her soap business, Cindy Senjem is retiring. The business, however, will continue with products sold under Tulips & Truffles Florist, owned by Heather Wright.

The outside of the new location will only feature the Tulips & Truffles name as it moves to its new location, hopefully, by the week of Thanksgiving.
