GAME BALLS

LB Za'Darius Smith: He was a disruptive presence in the Dolphins' backfield all day, getting two of the Vikings' six sacks and four of the team's 13 QB hits. He generated a team-high 10 QB pressures, according to Next Gen Stats.

S Harrison Smith: Playing his 150th career game, Smith grabbed a bouncing-ball interception to set up a field goal at the end of the first half and then forced a fumble that led to the Dalvin Cook TD that put the game away in the fourth quarter.

P Ryan Wright: Hard not to reward a long day's work for the Vikings punter, who kicked 10 punts, including six downed inside the 20.
