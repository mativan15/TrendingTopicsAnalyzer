Remember the dark days of the pandemic in 2020, when we couldn't go more than 5km from home? Back then, we were all saving what cash we could, partly because we had nowhere to spend it once the high of online shopping wore off, and partly because we had no idea how long this would all last, and if our jobs would survive it.Two years later and for some people at least, the lack of social and leisure spending has meant a serious increase in their savings. In Ireland, we are sitting on €135 billion in our bank accounts, and according to the Central Bank of Ireland, at least €15 billion of that can be classed as 'excess savings', ie it is there to be spent, rather than earmarked for something like a house deposit, holidays or essential home maintenance.
