Shares of AT&T Inc. recorded their best weekly performance since 2000 after the telecommunications company offered some reassurance to Wall Street with its latest earnings report. AT&T's stock T, +2.15% had been in Wall Street's 'penalty box' recently, a Cowen & Co. analyst wrote ahead of the company's Thursday earnings report, and the stock suffered its largest quarterly drop in 20 years during the third quarter. But investors — and at least one Wall Street analyst — seem to be warming to the stock more in the wake of AT&T's most recent report, which not only showed continued subscriber traction, but also offered a bit more optimism around the company's cash-flow picture.
