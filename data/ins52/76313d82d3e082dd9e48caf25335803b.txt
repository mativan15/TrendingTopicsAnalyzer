(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp on Thursday cut its fourth-quarter forecast for profit and revenue, citing a hit from a stronger dollar, sending the tech giant's shares down 3%.

The dollar has climbed about 14% against a basket of currencies over the last year, driven by a hawkish Federal Reserve and heightened geopolitical tensions.

A stronger greenback has pressured the profits of U.S. multinational companies that convert foreign currency into dollars, adding to corporate worries over soaring inflation and pushing some to more actively seek ways to hedge their earnings.
