A day after the forest department removed illegal constructions and planted saplings in Masol and Karoran villages of the district, the Chief Conservator (Hills), Harsh Kumar, on Friday wrote a letter to Punjab Additional Chief Secretary (forests and wildlife) to transfer two officers involved in Thursday's anti-encroachment drive as a complaint had been received against them.
Kumar said that the complaint was filed by one Devinder Singh Sandhu, who is the director of Worldwide Immigration Services.
