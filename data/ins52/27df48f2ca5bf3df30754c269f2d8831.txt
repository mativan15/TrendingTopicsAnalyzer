Jacqueline Fernandez, who is under the radar of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with her alleged links with conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar, has got the court's permission to travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from May 31 to June 6. Additional Sessions Judge Parveen Singh said, during this time, the Lookout Circular (LOC) against her issued in the case shall stand suspended.

Jacqueline, who wanted to attend an award ceremony in Abu Dhabi, had approached the Patiala House court, seeking its permission.
