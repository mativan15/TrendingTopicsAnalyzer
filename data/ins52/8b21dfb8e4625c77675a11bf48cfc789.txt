The former Italian premier claimed that President Putin only intervened under pressure from the Russian parliament and people.
'The war, instead of being a two-week operation, has become a war that will last for 200 years or more.'
The analysis was similar to remarks Mr Berlusconi made last month in which he claimed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended simply to install 'decent people' in Kyiv.
'The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv in a week, replace the Zelensky government with decent people and then come back after a week,' he told an Italian television programme.
