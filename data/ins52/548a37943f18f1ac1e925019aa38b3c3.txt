If you can cough up £16,745-a-night, you might fancy a stay at a hotel on Richard Branson's private Moskito Island.
The nine-bedroom estate – part of the Virgin Limited Edition portfolio – is called The Village and comes with a two-storey infinity pool, a slide, and a hidden DJ booth.
Richard owns three other estates on the island, which is near his Necker Island in the Caribbean.
The new one has stunning sea views and is on the furthest western tip of the island.
That hefty fee of £16,745-a-night is the starting price during low season, with the estate accommodating up to 18 guests.
