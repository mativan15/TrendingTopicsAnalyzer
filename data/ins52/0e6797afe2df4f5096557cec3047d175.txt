A former employee of a Colorado sheriff's office pretended to be a U.S. marshal, kidnapped a Vermont man and killed him as part of a convoluted, multi-state murder-for-hire plot, federal prosecutors allege.
The former Costilla County Sheriff's Office employee, 34-year-old Jerry Banks, pleaded not guilty to a kidnapping charge Thursday in Vermont's federal court as investigators continue to arrest more people in connection to the 2018 killing of Gregory Davis, 49.
