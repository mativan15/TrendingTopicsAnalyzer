Over 369,749 pageviews have accrued on the 2022 United Kingdom government crisis article, with a peak of 125,702 views on 7th July 2022, when Mr Johnson gave his resignation speech in Downing Street. 
Numbers remained steady between 500-850 views until increasing again on September 4th, two days before Liz Truss was elected as Prime Minister. 
Views peaked again on the day of the Queen's death, with over 4,500 visiting the site. 
Dozens of changes had to be made to the page to keep pace with the news cycle, with users editing multiple times a day on the fastest-moving days in July to cover the wave of resignations made by ministers in that month,  Owen Paterson's lobbying, the Partygate scandal, and Mr Johnson's subsequent departure.
