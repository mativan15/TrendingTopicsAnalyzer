The Patriots selected receiver N'Keal Harry with the No. 32 overall pick in the 2019 draft. But in three seasons with the franchise, Harry never lived up to that draft status.

So, the Patriots traded him to the Bears in July for a seventh-round pick.

Harry hasn't played for Chicago so far in 2022, as he's been on injured reserve with an ankle injury. But Harry is expected to be back this week when the Patriots play the Bears on Monday night.
