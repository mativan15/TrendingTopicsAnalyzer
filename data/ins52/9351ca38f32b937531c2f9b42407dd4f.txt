Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) is poised to receive an influx of $1 million for building improvements.

Col. Christopher Meeker, commander of the 88th Air Base Wing at WPAFB, said the funds, in part, will be used for facility improvements at the Wright-Patterson Club, as well as a facility near the Air Force Museum and other access improvements.

"We have a million dollars coming in that we're going to use to create places for industry, small business, civic leaders to connect with leadership from the base and our airmen," Meeker said.
