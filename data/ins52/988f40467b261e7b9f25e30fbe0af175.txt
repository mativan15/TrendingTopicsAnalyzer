Cannabis legalization measures will go before voters in five U.S. states on election day, Nov. 8, as the industry continues to grow.While smaller in population than many other U.S. states, the five states with measures on the 2022 ballot would still add about 13 million to the number of adults in the U.S. with the legal right to possess cannabis for personal use, if all of the measures pass. The ballot initiatives come after President Joe Biden earlier this month recommended the review of cannabis as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, although any changes could be years away.
