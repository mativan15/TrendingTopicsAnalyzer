By Megumi Fujikawa Toshiba Corp. said Thursday that it has received eight offers for privatization and promised to narrow down potential partners after its shareholder meeting on June 28. The company said it has also received two offers for capital and business alliance. Toshiba said it would make a comprehensive decision by examining domestic and international competition laws, national security issues and fundraising methods. Toshiba put itself up for auction in late April after the company's own restructuring plan to break up itself into two was rejected by shareholders.
