Jared Kushner's memoir of his time serving in his father-in-law's administration, Breaking History, succeeded as an exercise in spreading nasty rumors about his enemies, but not so much as a literary work. The New York Times Book Review memorably excoriated it, saying, 'Breaking History is an earnest and soulless — Kushner looks like a mannequin, and he writes like one — and peculiarly selective appraisal of Donald J. Trump's term in office.'
But could Breaking History be yet another example of Kushner's 'hidden genius'? Maybe it was never meant to be a memoir normal people read to gain insight into historical events but was instead a cleverly disguised Trump money-making scheme.
