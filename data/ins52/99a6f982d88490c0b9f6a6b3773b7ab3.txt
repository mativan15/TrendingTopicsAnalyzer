FreshSplash/E+ via Getty Images Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBRA) is for those investors who are looking for high yield irrespective of price growth. This senior housing operated portfolio (SHOP) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) focused REIT will consistently keep paying a 8-9% dividend - based on its historical records - even if it is not performing well. This is my first point. My second point is that SBRA has fallen into the bad habit of paying dividends beyond its earnings. While it has managed to continue this practice off-and-on almost since inception, this is not a sustainable practice.
