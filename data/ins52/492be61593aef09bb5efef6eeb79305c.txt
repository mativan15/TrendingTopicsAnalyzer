IT companies are currently facing a 'huge' challenge in building among their employees a sense of connectedness with the organisation, said Rishad Premji, executive chairman, Wipro. Of its 260,000-strong workforce, around 100,000 are new recruits who have joined in the last 30 months, Premji said. 'We have less than 10% of people coming in and we have 30% of our people living in tier II and tier III cities which are their hometowns,' he added, explaining why driving a sense of belonging was a challenge.
