Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly outraised his opponent, Republican Blake Masters, in the third quarter, according to Federal Election Commission Records.

Kelly's campaign went into October, weeks before the midterm elections, with almost six times the amount of cash on hand.

Kelly's campaign raised just over $21 million from July 14 until Sept. 30. Masters, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, brought in over $4.7 million over that same time period.

Kelly's campaign went into October with over $13 million on hand while Masters had just above $2.
