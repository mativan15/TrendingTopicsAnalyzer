CHARLOTTE - Rep. Madison Cawthorn is set to appear in Mecklenburg County District Court on a charge of carrying a loaded gun while going through airport security.

The right-wing Western North Carolina congressman will appear Jan. 13 on the misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon on city property, according to Assistant District Attorney Sheena Gatehouse. The new date was set at the courthouse after an Oct. 18 hearing in which Cawthorn did not appear. He was represented by his attorney, Missy Owen.
