A former senior Russian army officer has branded a US decision to send advanced rocket launchers to Ukraine an act of war.
Joe Biden confirmed the US is supplying the army with a small number of medium range weapons as part of a new package of lethal aid.
The president publicly said he would not provide ‘rocket systems that can strike into Russia' over fears it could contribute to a further escalation.
But despite US efforts to arm Ukraine without bringing the West closer to direct conflict with the Kremlin, hardliners are furious at the move.
