Motherwell boss Steven Hammell was left frustrated by his team's defending against Celtic, and says Saturday's game at home to Aberdeen in the league is an important one. Motherwell have only won twice in eight games at Fir Park this season."It's a tough one," he told BBC Scotland. "I felt we came up against a good team in a good moment just now."Losing the goal before half-time, you don't need to be an expert to know it changes things."Unfortunately again we've conceded a couple of really poor goals.
