Dan Loeb has taken a stake in Colgate-Palmolive and mooted a spin-off of its pet food unit.Third Point, the American activist investor's investment vehicle, did not reveal the size of the stake in the consumer group. It cited several reasons for the move, including Colgate-Palmolive's pricing power in an inflationary environment, as well as the strength of Hills, its pet food division.'There is meaningful hidden value in the Hill's Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate's consumer assets,' Third Point said in a letter.
