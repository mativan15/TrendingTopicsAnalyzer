Calgary Flames star Johnny Gaudreau avoided the distractions surrounding his pending unrestricted free agency as well as he evaded defenders this season.With contract talks on hold once the season began, Gaudreau helped lift the Flames to the Pacific Division title. He scored a career-high 115 points, which tied him for second best in the league behind the Edmonton Oilers' Connor McDavid, and had the Game 7 overtime winner against the Dallas Stars in the first round.With the Flames ousted in the second round, Gaudreau will talk to his agent this week to figure out what's best for him and his family.
