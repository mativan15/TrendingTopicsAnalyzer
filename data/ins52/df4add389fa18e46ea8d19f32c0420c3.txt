Bloomberg / GettyOctober 21, 2022, 12:52 PM ETThe famously logorrheic Steve Bannon finally found a reason to shut up, and it's going to get him locked up.Bannon, the former éminence grise (and grease) to Donald Trump, was sentenced today to four months in prison for contempt of Congress, stemming from his refusal to testify to the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection and Trump's attempts to steal the 2020 presidential election. He'll also be fined $6,500.The sentence is a landmark because no one has been sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress in decades.
