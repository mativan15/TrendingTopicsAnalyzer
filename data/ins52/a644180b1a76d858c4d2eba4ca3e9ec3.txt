Re ' Candidates Must Disclose Medical Issues,' by Lawrence K. Altman (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 30):

Dr. Altman correctly calls for the full disclosure of medical issues by major candidates, especially presidential. He has championed this cause for years, but his voice has gone unheeded.

The most famous candidate health cover-up was J.F.K.'s adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease. But John McCain's recurrent melanoma, Bill Bradley's atrial fibrillation, Joe Biden's cerebral aneurysm in his 1988 campaign and Bernie Sanders's significant coronary disease requiring a stent were all either downplayed or denied.
