MUMBAI, India — A Kashmiri photojournalist who was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize this May has been barred by the Indian authorities from traveling to the United States to receive her award, the latest case of brazen harassment of the country's news media.

The photographer, Sanna Irshad Mattoo, was awarded the Pulitzer for her role in coverage by the news agency Reuters of India's devastation last year during the second wave of Covid-19. She said immigration officers at the New Delhi airport had pulled her aside on Tuesday and stamped her airline ticket 'canceled without prejudice,' offering no explanation.
