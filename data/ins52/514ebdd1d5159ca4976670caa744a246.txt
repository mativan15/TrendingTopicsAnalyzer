By the end of the first day of BravoCon—a three-day convention for fans obsessed with anything and everything Bravo, the network responsible for giving the world The Real Housewives in all of its incarnations—there was a heightened sense of frenzy in the air. Given the events that had already transpired that day, it made sense. A stampede had broken out ahead of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills panel. At said panel, Lisa Rinna was booed by approximately 4,000 people. And, according to Twitter, there may or may not have been an orgy in 'the third floor toilet' of the Javits Center, where BravoCon was held.
