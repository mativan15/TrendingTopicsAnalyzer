Chris Bassitt's agents told the Mets that if they had to go to an arbitration hearing, Bassitt would not talk about an extension with them, but ultimately the sides agreed at $8.8 million. Good thing, as Bassitt looks like a personality fit for New York. 
Bassitt's target will be in the $23 million-$25 million range (ex-Mets Zack Wheeler/Marcus Stroman money). … The Mets' depth — better than most believed with Tylor Megill, David Peterson and Trevor Williams — is getting tested now. They scouted Tyler Mahle and Frankie Montas and other starters, but ultimately may target more relievers.
