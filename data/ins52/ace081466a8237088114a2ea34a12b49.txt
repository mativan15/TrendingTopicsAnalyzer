Lafayette Mayor-President Josh Guillory's most recent annual financial disclosure to Louisiana's Ethics Administration was supposed to shed light on his efforts to bolster his income while in office. But the report filed Friday raises more questions about the first-term mayor-president's side hustles than it answers.

Guillory's WM&N Equipment Rentals company, founded in August 2021, made headlines shortly before his return from rehab in August, after which he denied any impropriety or conflicts of interest at a brief press conference.
