A U.S. recession within the year is "effectively certain," a new Bloomberg Economics model has predicted, dealing a perhaps significant "blow" to President Biden's economic platform ahead of the midterm elections.

The latest modeling from Bloomberg economists Anna Wong and Eliza Winger predicted "a higher recession probability across all timeframes, with the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 hitting 100 percent, up from 65 percent for the comparable period in the previous update," Bloomberg writes.
