Des Moines Public Schools' Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will begin his role as interim superintendent a month ahead of schedule.

Smith, who accepted the position of interim superintendent in April, will take over for outgoing Superintendent Tom Ahart on Wednesday.

Ahart — who had been under fire in recent years due to district officials' COVID-19 pandemic response and other issues — announced his resignation earlier this year, after 10 years as superintendent. The fallout included a written reprimand from the Board of Educational Examiners last year for keeping students online at the start of the 2020-21 school year despite a state law requiring school districts to offer a 50% in-person learning option.
