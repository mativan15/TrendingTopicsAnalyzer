Wall Street's eyes are on Salesforce as it prepares to report earnings on Tuesday, with investors seeing it as a barometer for how hard the downtown will hit the entire cloud software industry. While cloud software companies like Salesforce, Zoom , and Atlassian all soared to new heights as the pandemic sparked a remote work boom, they've all been hard-hit in recent weeks amid a broader market downturn. As of market close on Friday, Salesforce was trading at some $165 a share — down about 35% in the year, and well off its 52-week high of $311.
