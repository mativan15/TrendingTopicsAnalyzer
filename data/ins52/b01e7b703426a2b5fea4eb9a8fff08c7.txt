mbbirdy Oppenheimer equity strategist Johns Stoltzfus is cutting his Street-high target for S&P 500 (SP500) (NYSEARCA:SPY) for 2022, with time running short for a monster broad-market rally. For year-end Stoltzfus still sees a rally, but not the highs predicted in July. He cut the price target for the S&P to 4,000 on Monday, a gain of about 12% from current levels, down from 4,800. That leaves J.P. Morgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas with the top Wall Street target at 4,800, according to a CNBC survey.
