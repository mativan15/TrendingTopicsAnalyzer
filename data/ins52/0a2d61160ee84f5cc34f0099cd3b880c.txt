Daniel Ricciardo has not delivered the results hoped for in Formula One, McLaren boss Zack Brown said after announcing that their IndyCar team had extended their agreement with Pato O'Ward who is eyeing a Formula One seat.

McLaren took care of a bit of business ahead of Sunday's Indy 500 by extending O'Ward's contract through the end of 2025 in a deal that will include some F1 testing for the 23-year-old Mexican and a new McLaren sports car as a signing on bonus.

McLaren's commitment to O'Ward will come as a warning to an under-performing Ricciardo, who has managed one points finish in six F1 races this season and had a nightmare start to the Monaco Grand Prix, which starts Sunday, crashing in Friday's practice.
