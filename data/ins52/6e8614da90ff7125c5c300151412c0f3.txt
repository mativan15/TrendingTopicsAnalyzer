Fans appear to have cracked the mystery of Hugh Sheridan's former spouse.

The actor revealed last week that they had been secretly married for nine years to a fellow entertainment figure, but stopped short of revealing their identity.

Flocking to news.com.au's Facebook comments, many speculated that the mystery actor to whom Hugh tied the knot was Dynasty star Rafael de la Fuente.

The Daily Mail came to the same conclusion, reporting today that Rafael and Hugh had been dating for several years, though Hugh had not publicly come out.
