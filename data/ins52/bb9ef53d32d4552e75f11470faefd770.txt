The race in California's 27th Congressional District marks another rematch between Republican incumbent Mike Garcia and Democratic former Assemblywoman Christy Smith.

Once solidly Republican, this northern Los Angeles County district has grown more favorable to Democrats, with its population becoming younger and more diverse as L.A. residents moved in seeking affordable housing. Redistricting made it even bluer by excising the conservative Simi Valley.

Who are the candidates?

Garcia, whose parents emigrated from Mexico, was born in the San Fernando Valley and raised in Santa Clarita.
