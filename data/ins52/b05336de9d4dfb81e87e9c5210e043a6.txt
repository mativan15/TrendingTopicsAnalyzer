(KTLA) – Authorities on Wednesday seized about 12,000 suspected fentanyl pills that were found packaged in several bags of what appeared to be candy at Los Angeles International Airport.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics detectives and DEA agents assigned to the airport responded to a TSA screening area around 7:30 a.m. after a person tried to go through with bags of candy and other snacks, officials said in a news release.

Authorities found the pills inside boxes of Sweetarts, Skittles and Whoppers.
