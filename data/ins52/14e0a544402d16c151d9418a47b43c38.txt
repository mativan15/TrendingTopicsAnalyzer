There's no doubt about it: keeping fit can be expensive. If you're a runner, you're going to want to replace your running shoes after a year or two of hard use. If you're a lifter, you might invest in a set of dumbbells and even a barbell if you have space, or commit to a monthly gym membership. Surfer? Board, wax, and expensive surf trips if you don't live near the sea. Climber? Forget about it. Cyclist? Bikes are fun, but they're not the cheapest hobby. In all cases, getting one of the best fitness trackers or smartwatches will also be on your list, as it's a great way to monitor your activity.
