Newly crowned Detroit Free Press Marathon women's winner Mary Beasley said she has nothing to hide and would willingly submit to any drug testing protocol after it came to light that she served a two-year ban from competition in 2013 following a failed drug test.

The 46-year-old Nigerian native now living in Gardenia, California, comfortably won the women's overall and Masters Division on Sunday in 2 hours, 42 minutes and 25 seconds, winning $6,000 in prize money.

But under the name Mary Akor, she was suspended by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after testing positive for Clenbuterol, a decongestant that has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list since 2011.
