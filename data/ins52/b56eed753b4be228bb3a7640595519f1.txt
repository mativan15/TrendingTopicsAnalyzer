Actor and playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda said Halle Bailey is the 'perfect' choice to portray the lead character Ariel in the new Disney 'Little Mermaid' film.

During an appearance on CNN's 'CNN Tonight with Jake Tapper,' host Jake Tapper asked Miranda, who was tapped to be one of the music composers for the film, about his thoughts on the backlash the film received for its casting decisions.

Disney released the official trailer for the live action adaption of the 1989 cartoon film last month. Some online criticized the decision to cast Bailey, a Black actress-singer, to portray the main character of Princess Ariel.
