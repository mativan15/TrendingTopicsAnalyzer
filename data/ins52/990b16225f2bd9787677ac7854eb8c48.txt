Jen Shah is not only taking her lawyer's legal advice, but she's listening to her words of wisdom when it comes to beauty, too.
 
In this week's episode of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Jen shares with the group that she's stopping botox injections per her attorney's direction.
 
"My lead trial attorney Priya [Chaudhry] said, 'I'm going to need you to not get botox,'" Jen tells some of the ladies during their cast trip in Scottsdale. "I'm like, What?'" she adds as castmate Heather Gay looks on in disbelief.
