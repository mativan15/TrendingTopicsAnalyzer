Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on Tuesday asked chief minister Bhagwant Mann to remove Satbir Singh Gosal from the post of vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), terming his appointment 'totally illegal'. State's agriculture minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, however, termed the governor's move 'unconstitutional' and accused him of acting at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The governor, who is the chancellor of the PAU, said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led state government had appointed Gosal without following the norms of the University Grants Commission, or seeking his (the chancellor's) approval.
