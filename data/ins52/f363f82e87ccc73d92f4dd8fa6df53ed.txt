Flying cars and robot dogs, metaverse meetings, and taxis but without the drivers, are just some of the technology that was on show earlier this month at GITEX (Gulf Information Technology Exhibition) in Dubai.

Omar Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Working System told Euronews, ' GITEX is the only place on earth that you can go to see companies from around the world flock to showcase the technology, the innovations.
