A national shortage of Adderall has left patients who rely on the pills for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scrambling to find alternative treatments and uncertain whether they will be able to refill their medication.

The Food and Drug Administration announced the shortage last week, saying that one of the largest producers is experiencing "intermittent manufacturing delays" and that other makers cannot keep up with demand.

Some patients say the announcement was a belated acknowledgment of a reality they have faced for months - pharmacies unable to fill their orders and anxiety about whether they will run out of a medication needed to manage their daily lives.
