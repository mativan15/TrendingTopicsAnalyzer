Much as he may wish to, the shadow of the Woodford debacle is impossible to escape. 
The fund's reliance on the backing of Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the UK's biggest investment supermarkets, was clear from the outset. 
When it was suddenly gated to prevent catastrophic redemptions, nearly 300,000 Hargreaves clients found themselves trapped in a total six of its multi-manager funds, equivalent to 44pc of the fund's £3.7bn under management. 
Its close ties with Woodford were a lucrative arrangement, generating more than £40m of fees.
