At the end of Route 114 in southeast New Brunswick you'll find the picturesque Village of Alma and Fundy National Park -- one of the province's true gems. There's also colourful fishing boats, larger-than-life lobsters, and delicious lobster roll meals. And of course, there's the famous sticky buns found at Kelly's Bake Shop on Main Street. "They're ooey, they're gooey, they're homemade, so you have that homemade dough in there and we only use a certain brand of cinnamon," says Angela Elliott, who owns the bake shop.
