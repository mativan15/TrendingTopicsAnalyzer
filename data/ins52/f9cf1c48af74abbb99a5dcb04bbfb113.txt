The games continue to come thick and fast for Arsenal, but this victory over PSV Eindhoven underlined how they are developing an uncanny knack for finding a way to win.For so long it had looked like this would be a night of frustration for Arsenal, who dominated possession but could not find a way past their Dutch opponents.They created good chances, especially through the lively pair of Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus, however they were thwarted time and again as the clock ticked towards the end.Granit Xhaka eventually stood up to be Arsenal's hero, firing home from Takehiro Tomiyasu's cross after the Japan international had overlapped well down the right.
