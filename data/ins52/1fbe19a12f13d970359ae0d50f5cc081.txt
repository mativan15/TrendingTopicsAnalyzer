Florida International University's board of trustees unanimously named Kenneth A. Jessell as the university's new president.

The selection, made on Oct. 16, still has to be ratified by the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees public universities in the state of Florida.

Jessell had been serving as FIU's interim president since January, following the resignation of Mark Rosenberg.

Following his resignation, Rosenberg, who had been president of the university for 13 years, issued a written statement that he "caused discomfort" and "unintentionally created emotional (not physical) entanglement" with another employee.
