Shares of Canadian utility Emera Inc. fell the most in more than two years after Nova Scotia's government proposed rules to cap electricity price hikes.

The owner of Nova Scotia's biggest electric utility fell as much as 10% in Toronto following a trading halt, before paring losses to close down 4.7% to C$51.68 in Toronto. It was the biggest one-day decline since April 1, 2020.
