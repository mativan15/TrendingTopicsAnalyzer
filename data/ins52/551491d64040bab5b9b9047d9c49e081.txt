Sri Lanka was on its way to eliminating extreme poverty until the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent economic crisis threw the country into disarray.  Between 2006 and 2016, extreme poverty—measured by the number of people living on less than $ 2.15 a day—had fallen from 11% to 1.3%, lifting almost 2 million people out of severe deprivation.
