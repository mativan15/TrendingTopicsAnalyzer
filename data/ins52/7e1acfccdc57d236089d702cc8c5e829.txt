As real-life touring continues to be plagued by cancellations, Soulja Boy, Dillon Francis and Ozzy Osbourne are turning to virtual worlds. The Metaverse Music Festival returns on Nov. 10-13 for its second year in Decentraland — an immersive digital world built using blockchain technology and owned by its users — with more than 100 artists across 15 stages. The event will be free to attend and no crypto wallet is required to participate. Set in a cyberpunk city of the future, Dillon Francis will open the festival with a 'mega club' experience projected on several screens, while Soulja Boy will perform through a virtual avatar.
