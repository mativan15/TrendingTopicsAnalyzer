(RTTNews) - The South Korea stock market on Wednesday halted the three-day winning streak in which it had spiked almost 90 points or 4 percent. The KOSPI now rests just beneath the 2,240-point plateau and it may open under pressure again on Thursday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests consolidation following recent gains and rising treasury yields. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to open in similar fashion. The KOSPI finished modestly lower on Wednesday as losses from the chemical and technology stocks were mitigated by support from the financials and oil companies.
