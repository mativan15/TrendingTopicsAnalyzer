Who does our staff think will win Saturday's game between the Buckeyes and Hawkeyes?

After being the only team in the country to win its first six games by double digits, Ohio State returns to action on Saturday against Iowa (12 p.m. on FOX), which has one of the nation's best defenses despite a 3-3 start.

The Buckeyes still remember what happened the last time these two teams met, with the unranked Hawkeyes ending their playoff hopes with a 55-24 route in Iowa City in 2017, and revenge is certainly on their mind.
