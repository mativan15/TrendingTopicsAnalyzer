As the New York Giants entered free agency, general manager Joe Schoen was equal parts determined to shed $40 million in cap space and improve the team's roster depth.
With little money to work with, big splashes were absent during free agency. The Giants added depth along the offensive line, but their only 'high-profile' move was the signing of guard Mark Glowinski.
The good news for Schoen & Co is that they had nine picks in the 2022 NFL draft. And those picks eventually became 11 picks over the three-day event, with the very first being used on Oregon edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux.
