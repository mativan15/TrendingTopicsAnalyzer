Competition judges from the Berks LaunchBox Advisory Council and other advisers are experienced business professionals who rated pitch presentations based on customer understanding, product market fit, competitive advantage, and business model. They also asked pointed questions to the teams and provided feedback and ideas for next steps.
Lawrence N. Bonino, senior business adviser with Marathon Capital Advisors, states, 'Each entrepreneur's level of preparation was very impressive. Their presentation skills, ability to concisely convey product and market knowledge, and consistency of their rubric were all indicators of the LaunchBox team's exceptional expertise, support, and guidance in helping them prepare for the competition.
