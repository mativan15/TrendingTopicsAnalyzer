More than two years after COVID-19 locked down offices, some big companies are now closing the leeway for telecommuters.However, the list of those tightening grips on remote work does not include Twitter—which was among the first to declare a work-from-home-forever policy in the early days of the pandemic, circa May 2020.'We can confirm that Twitter continues to allow for permanent work from home as was shared in 2020, with no plans to change this policy,' a Twitter spokesperson told Fast Company in an email.
