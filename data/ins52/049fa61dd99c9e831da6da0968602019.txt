Coleen Nolan strongly agrees with James Corden being banned from a restaurant over ‘rude behaviour'.
The Loose Women presenter made the comments on today's episode of the show when the panel was discussing reports that The Late Late Show host had been abusive to staff at a New York restaurant.
After apparently receiving the wrong food order at Balthazar restaurant, its owner Keith McNally said that Corden demanded two rounds of free drinks to make up for the mix-up.
