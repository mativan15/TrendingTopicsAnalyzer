First, despite the decrease in traffic in stores, the company is able to raise product prices and demonstrate positive revenue growth at a time of pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. In addition, despite the increase in input costs, the company is able to control the main operating costs in order to maintain profitability. Also, I believe that at the moment the company continues to trade below fair value and has potential for growth.
