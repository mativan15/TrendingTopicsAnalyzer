Ministers are pressing ahead with a dual crackdown on climate protests and strike action, a controversial move that followed a day of direct action in London including clashes with the public and milk poured on the floor of Harrods.Home secretary Suella Braverman will unveil plans on Sunday to grant police new powers to take a more 'proactive' approach to counter tactics favoured by climate activists such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion.Confirmation also arrived that the government is pursuing legal moves to introduce minimum service levels during strikes by transport workers after months of industrial action by railway workers in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.
