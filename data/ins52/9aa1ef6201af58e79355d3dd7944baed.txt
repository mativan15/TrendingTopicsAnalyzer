The Orionid meteor shower is likely to peak on Friday night, generating up to 25 meteors per hour and being visible until the early hours of Saturday. The Orion constellation, one of the brightest clusters of stars in the sky, inspired the phenomenon's name. One of the reasons that make this meteor shower especially remarkable for some, according to Jake Foster, a public astronomy officer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, is that each meteor represents a little piece of Halley's Comet.
 Meteoroids from Halley's Comet hit the Earth's atmosphere at 148,000 mph, exploding in streaking blasts of light.
