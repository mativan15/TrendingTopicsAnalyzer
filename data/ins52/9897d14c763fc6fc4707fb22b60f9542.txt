I hate to pick against the Chiefs, but my gut tells me it's the right call this week. Not that the Chiefs are incapable of winning this one — I won't be surprised if they do. But I think Buffalo has a slight edge.
The Chiefs' defense is missing linebacker Willie Gay Jr. and cornerback Rashad Fenton, and will likely be without CB Trent McDuffie as well. That'll leave two rookies — fourth- and seventh-round picks — starting at cornerback. Jaylen Watson, the seventh-rounder, has actually been good this season, while Joshua Williams has had just 17 defensive snaps.
