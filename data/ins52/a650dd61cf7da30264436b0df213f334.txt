Amazfit's range of rugged T-rex activity trackers, the first of which was released in 2020, are intended for outdoor adventurers on a budget, and the company is hoping to continue that tradition with its latest smartwatch.While the brand isn't as popular as say, Garmin, who has its own series of rugged activity trackers, the company has found its niche by making them affordable. Similar rugged fitness trackers, like the Garmin instinct 2 (£281.32, Amazon.co.uk) always feel like they cost a little too much for what they offer.
