The Fujifilm X Summit is the company's annual celebration of its much-loved mirrorless cameras, and is usually a good bet for a product announcement or two. But this year Fuji's fest promises to be extra-special, which means it's well worth tuning into the show later today to see what photographic treats it brings.Earlier this year, Fujifilm celebrated ten years of the X-Mount, which arrived back in 2012 with the Fujifilm X-Pro1.
