Akon was live on an interview on "The Bootleg Kev Podcast" program, where the rapper spoke about his amalgamations with rap stars. Eminem and Dr. Dre were discussed, and Akon recalls how the former landed up producing his hit single "Smack That." Akon says that this was the only number he hadn't produced, whereas all his songs are produced by himself. 
Akon remembers that he had sought out the rap star, and Eminem, at that time, was in Detroit, and he mentioned a collaboration. Akon informs us that the Slim Shady singer gave him around 30 tracks to listen to.
