Crypto wallet BitKeep was hacked for over $1 million worth of BNB Chain and Polygon-based tokens in early Asia hours on Tuesday, developers said.

BitKeep supports tokens from over 30 mainnets, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and BNB Chain, and claims to have over six million users.

The wallet's Swap product was hacked early on Tuesday. 'Our development team managed to contain the emergency and stopped the hacker,' the team said in a tweet this morning, adding that it would compensate all user losses.
