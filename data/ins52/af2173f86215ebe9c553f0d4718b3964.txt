The members of the municipal council (MC) of Sri Hargobindpur Sahib city in the border district of Gurdaspur have strongly warned drug dealers of dire consequences by putting up boards at three entrance points of the city. 'If anyone is caught selling or moving with Chitta (heroin), smack and other drugs in the town, he will be responsible for himself for any harm caused,' read these boards.
