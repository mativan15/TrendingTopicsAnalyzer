The police checkpoint scene is a staple in films about refugees. These scenes are always tense, and invariably involve the humiliation and harassment of characters in the final stretch of their dash for freedom. In Mississippi Masala — director Mira Nair's second of three collaborations with screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala — Sharmila Tagore's character must endure similar indecencies as she flees her native Uganda with her husband and their young daughter, ousted by decree of Idi Amin.
Blending politics, romance and — and this might seem odd — broad fish-out-of-water humour, Mississippi Masala's themes of generational trauma, familial conflict and the clash of cultures would go on to become a staple of Nair's cinema.
