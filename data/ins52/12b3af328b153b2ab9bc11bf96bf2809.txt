G4 is shutting down — again. Comcast Spectacor, the cable and entertainment giant's sports and esports division, told G4 TV employees Sunday that the gaming network was shutting down effective immediately. The decision has resulted in 45 staff members of G4 TV losing their jobs. In a memo, obtained by Variety, Comcast Spectacor chairman and CEO Dave Scott cited low viewership and said the network had not achieved 'sustainable financial results.' 'Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership is low and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results,' Scott wrote.
