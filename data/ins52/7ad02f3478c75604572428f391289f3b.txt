Ukraine has confirmed that Russia is using 'suicide drones' to bombard Ukrainian cities. A recent attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv using these drones on Monday left at least four dead, which was one of the several attacks that the Kremlin unleashed with the new weapon. The new suicide drones Russia's using are called Shahed drones or Kamikaze drones. The drones are the latest addition to the Kremlin's arsenal, and their acquisition is a matter of great concern for the western allies. Shahed drones are different in functionality than predator drones commonly used in war.
