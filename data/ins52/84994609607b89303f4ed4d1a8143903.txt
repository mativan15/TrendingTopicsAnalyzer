KaylaBy Kayla ThomasOct 17, 2022Ladies beware! Your sports bra could be the reason you keep getting sick! A very toxic chemical called BPA that is used to make plastics recently has been found in sports bras and other athletic clothing, according to the Daily Beast. If you have bought from brands like Nike, FILA, PINK, Athleta, Asics, The North Face, Brooks, and All in Motion in the last 6 months, be careful! BPA is known to cause illnesses like asthma, obesity and even heart disease. We all hate to waste money, but you might want to throw some things out just in case.
