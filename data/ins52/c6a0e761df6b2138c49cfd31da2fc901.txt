This Halloween, Great America in Santa Clara has traded tricks for treats as it's shifted from being a horror-heavy amusement park aimed at teens and adults to one that emphasizes more kid-friendly fun.

The October overlay to the 46-year-old amusement park is part of what's become a regular, seasonal shift that allows what was once a spring- and summer-only park into a nearly year-round destination. Besides the five-week Halloween run, the park also has a five-week season from Thanksgiving to New Year's called WinterFest.
