Having journeyed from England and now finally seen from afar Jerusalem's skyline, medieval mystic Margery Kempe was convinced she was hearing God and was seized by an ecstatic tremor, so much so that she nearly fell off her donkey.

'Two German pilgrims went to her and kept her from falling off' and one of them 'put spices in her mouth to comfort her,' she recalled in The Book of Margery Kempe. It was the first account of what today psychiatry diagnoses as Jerusalem Syndrome, a mental disorder that makes the city's visitors think they are hearing God, or that they are one of the biblical prophets, or the Messiah, or even God himself.
