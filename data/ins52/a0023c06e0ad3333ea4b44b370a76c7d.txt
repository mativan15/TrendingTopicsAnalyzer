ATLANTA – Too much drama has unfolded in the 49ers' history with the Falcons for this Sunday's affair to be a humdrum, run-the-ball matchup.
Before rehashing old tales, this is the here-and-now situation:
The 49ers (3-2) are seeking a third straight win, and, for the third straight year, they're looking to sweep both games of an East Coast swing that included a week-long layover in West Virginia.
The Falcons (2-3) are 5 ½-point home underdogs, ready to welcome in a former NFC West rival (1967-2001) for its maiden voyage into the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which opened in 2017.
