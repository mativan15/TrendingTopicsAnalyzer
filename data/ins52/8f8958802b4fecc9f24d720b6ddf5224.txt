UC Davis Children's Hospital has a new partnership with a San Joaquin County hospital, aimed at preventing more premature babies and their parents from needing to come to Sacramento for medical treatment.

UC Davis Health on Monday announced a new affiliation with St. Joseph's Medical Center, a Dignity Health hospital in Stockton, to collaborate on neonatal care. Under the partnership, doctors and staff in St. Joseph's neonatal intensive care unit will be able to consult with UC Davis' pediatric subspecialists, and receive education and training on best practices and the latest innovations in technology and treatment.
