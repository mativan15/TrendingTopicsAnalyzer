I'm lining up for a shot in mini-golf. I'm playing table tennis. I'm putting together a 3D puzzle. I'm shooting undead creatures with a bow and arrow. These are the things I usually do with a Meta Quest 2 VR headset, but this time I'm doing them strapped into the Pico 4, and it feels very much the same.The Pico 4, made by Bytedance (parent company to TikTok), feels like the very first true competitor to the 2-year-old Quest 2 VR headset from Meta (formerly Facebook). It's a possible sign that standalone VR headsets in the next few years may see more hardware options.
