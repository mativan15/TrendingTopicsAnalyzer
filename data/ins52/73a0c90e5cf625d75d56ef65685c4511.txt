The world of baseball lost an iconic voice when beloved longtime Dodgers commentator Vin Scully died in August, and now, his mystifying mansion has landed on the real estate market in Hidden Hills, California.

The estate, appropriately named Home Plate, is listed for $15 million and has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms over 11,615 square feet. According to the Los Angeles Times, Scully bought the country French chateau for $12.4 million in 2009.

'Our home was full of so many beautiful memories, love and laughter, but as my dad used to say, there is a season and a time for everything in life,' listing agent Cat Scully, Vin's daughter, said in a news release.
