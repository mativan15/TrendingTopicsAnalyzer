High streets and shopping centres felt the heat of Britain's cost of living crisis last week, according to bleak new figures indicating the country could be heading for a recession.

The number of shopping visits plunged more than 20 per cent last week compared to the same period in 2019, polling firm Ipsos found.

Good weather failed to tempt consumers out, with footfall down sharply in every region of the UK.

"The high street is really beginning to feel the heat from red hot prices with bills mounting all over the place,' said Susannah Streeter, senior investments and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
