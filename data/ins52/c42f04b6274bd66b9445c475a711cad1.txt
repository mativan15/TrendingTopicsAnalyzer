World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says there is a 'very narrow window now to prevent genocide' in his home region of Tigray in northern Ethiopia.
Tedros, who previously served as Ethiopia's health minister and foreign affairs minister, has been sharply critical of Ethiopian authorities throughout the two-year war.
The government has, in turn, accused him of trying to procure arms and diplomatic backing for rebel forces – charges he has denied.
In his sharpest comments on the war yet, Tedros told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday that food and health care were being used as weapons of war in Tigray, which is largely cut off from the outside world.
