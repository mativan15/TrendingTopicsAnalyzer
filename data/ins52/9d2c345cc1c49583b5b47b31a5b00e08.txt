Attacking the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur Saturday alleged earlier an "Italian woman" used to "insult" Prime Minister Narendra Modi now "an Italia is insulting his mother". Though he did not name either, the apparent targets of his tirade during election rallies in Gujarat were Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who was born in Italy, and the AAP's Gujarat unit head Gopal Italia. He also claimed there is a "huge BJP wave" in Gujarat and "this time we are going to break all previous records".
