(Reuters) - Russia sees charges brought by the United States against five Russian nationals for alleged sanctions violations as an attempt to intimidate the business community in Russia and abroad, its foreign ministry said on Thursday.

U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday charged the five with sanctions evasion and other violations related to shipping military technologies bought from U.S. manufacturers to Russian buyers. Some of the electronics obtained through the scheme have been found in Russian weapons platforms seized in Ukraine, prosecutors said.
