Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain's lawyer will not be present, either at visible or audible distance, during his interrogation by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering case, the Delhi high court said in an interim order on Saturday even as the investigating agency said that Jain has only been called for questioning and cannot be called an accused until he is named in an FIR. Justice Yogesh Khanna accepted ED's contention that since there is no FIR or prosecution complaint by the agency against Jain, and that he has been called only for questioning, Jain cannot claim the right to have the presence of his lawyers during the course of recording of his statement under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
