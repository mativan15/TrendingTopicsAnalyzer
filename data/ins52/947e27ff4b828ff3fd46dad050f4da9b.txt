Strictly Come Dancing star Jayde Adams has shared the last photo she has with her sister before she died.
Jenna Adams died 11 years ago after doctors discovered a brain tumour following an out-of-the-blue seizure.
The comedian, 37, performed an emotional American smooth on Strictly this weekend to Wind Beneath My Wings by Bette Midler, which she dedicated to her late older sister.
Speaking on the BBC dance show on Saturday night after reducing head judge Shirley Ballas to tears, the former Adele tribute act became incredibly tearful herself as she recalled her promise to her sister that people wouldn't ‘forget' her.
