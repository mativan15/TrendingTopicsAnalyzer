Dara Ó Briain joked the country is in a ‘far more stable' position than when the first episode of Mock The Week aired as he drew the long-running series to a close.
The comedian commemorated the BBC show, which launched the careers of Russell Howard and Frankie Boyle, on its final instalment on Friday but couldn't resist making jibes about the chaotic government.
Mock The Week's final outing comes several months after it was announced the beloved comedy programme was being axed after 17 years and 21 series and a total of 232 episodes.
