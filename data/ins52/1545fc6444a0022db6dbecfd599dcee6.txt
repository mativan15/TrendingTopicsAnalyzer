For just the second time in seven games, Kentucky football had both Will Levis and Chris Rodriguez on the field together for Saturday.

With both offensive stars available, the No. 22 Wildcats overcame a sloppy first half to record their second win over a ranked opponent this season with a 27-17 victory over No. 16 Mississippi State. With the victory, Kentucky remained alive in the SEC East race in advance of a much-needed off week before a trip to undefeated Tennessee.

Playing in his third game since completing a four-game suspension, Rodriguez rushed 30 times for 196 yards and two touchdowns.
