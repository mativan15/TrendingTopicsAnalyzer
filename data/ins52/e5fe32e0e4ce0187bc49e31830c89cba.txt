abuja, nigeria — 
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation says that weeks of an intense crackdown on oil thieves have significantly reduced the scale of oil theft in the oil-rich Niger Delta and that the country will soon boost overall oil production.
However, critics say the deeper problem of corruption has not been solved and question whether those behind the theft will be prosecuted.
NNPC Director Mele Kyari, speaking Tuesday during an energy and labor summit in Abuja, said that because of recent raids and collaboration with local security agencies to combat theft, he was optimistic that Nigeria would have access to more crude oil and revenue in the coming weeks.
