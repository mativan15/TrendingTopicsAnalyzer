We get our word "pantry" from the Middle French word "paneterie," meaning a place where bread was stored. The term evolved to describe a small room, closet, or cabinet where non-perishable food items and beverages (and sometimes cleaning supplies, extra dishes and glassware, and other things) were stored.

Today, though, "pantry" has acquired a metaphorical sense, too, describing not necessarily a place where things are kept but the accumulation of things cooks find essential to the way they like to eat, regardless of where they're stored -- a cupboard, a shelf, a kitchen counter.
