SAN JOSE – The Sharks struggled to generate many scoring chances and had puck management issues for most of the last two periods of Friday's home opener against the Carolina Hurricanes.
But it was a defensive mistake in the final two minutes that prevented the Sharks from earning their first point of the season, as they gave Carolina Hurricanes forward Sebastian Aho enough space in front of their net to redirect a shot from Brett Pesce past goalie James Reimer.
Aho's goal, which came after Erik Karlsson failed to block him out in the slot, happened with 1:58 left in the third period and handed the Sharks a 2-1 loss in front of a sellout crowd of 17,562 at SAP Center.
