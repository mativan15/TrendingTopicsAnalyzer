A 12-year-old coder from London named Benyamin Ahmed is set to earn over US$400,000 after spending his school holidays working on his own line of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – which are basically works of art in the form of crypto tokens that give buyers digital ownership of each piece.bAhmed's father Imran explained to news outlets that his son, alongside his brother, had picked up coding at the age of five, first learning basic languages such as HTML and CSS. Eventually, his passion for coding led him to experimenting on more complex projects.
