Last month, Starwood Property reported strong 1Q-22 earnings, and the trust's real estate holdings provide a natural hedge against inflation. Starwood Property also easily outperformed its dividend with distributable earnings in the first quarter, establishing STWD as a highly reliable dividend-paying trust in the future.
