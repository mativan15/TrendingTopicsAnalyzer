Raj Thackeray, the chief of Maharashtra Navirman Sena (MNS) on Sunday wrote to Maharashtra Deputy CM and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis not to field his party's candidate for the upcoming Andheri East Assembly constituency bypoll. In the letter posted on social media, Thackeray said the MNS will not be contesting the November 3 byelection to show its reverence for late MLA Ramesh Latke, whose death has necessitated the election.

Latke, the sitting MLA from Andheri East, passed away following a cardiac arrest in May 2022.
