TL;DR: As of June 2, a lifetime subscription to the Degoo Premium Mega Backup Plan (50TB), worth $14,400, is on sale for just $299.99. That's savings of 97%.The more devices we add to our tech arsenals, the more storage space we need to accommodate the files, photos, videos, and documents from those devices. But constantly adding more gigabytes to your cloud storage account for the rest of time, and paying the subsequent monthly or annual fee that comes along with it, is far from ideal.
