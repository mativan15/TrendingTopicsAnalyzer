Gary Vaynerchuk is warning people to start making smarter spending choices now to prepare for a looming recession in the coming months. In a recent TikTok, the entrepreneur, who has counseled and invested in more than 50 tech startups including Twitter, Uber, and Venmo, says people are underestimating "how scary it will get in the next 3 to 6 months." Recent data shows that Americans have already burned through a third of their savings cushion. And CEOs are preparing for the economic downturn with layoffs and spending cuts.
