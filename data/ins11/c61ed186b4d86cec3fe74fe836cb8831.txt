The UK has been issued a stark warning over Jeremy Hunt's Halloween budget, with a former Treasury minister saying that the new Chancellor will be forced to introduce £30 billion worth of tax rises and "painful" spending cuts. This comes as the Government rows back on the plans made in its September mini-budget. Yesterday, Mr Hunt announced that almost all of the measures announced in Ms Truss' mini budget will be reversed.But former secretary to the Treasury David Gauke warned that matters could get even worse at the October 31 budget.
