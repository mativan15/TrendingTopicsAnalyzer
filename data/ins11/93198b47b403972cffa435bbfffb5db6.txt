If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But investors can boost returns by picking market-beating companies to own shares in. For example, the Reef Casino Trust (ASX:RCT) share price is up 30% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 2.5% (not including dividends). If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 12% in three years.
