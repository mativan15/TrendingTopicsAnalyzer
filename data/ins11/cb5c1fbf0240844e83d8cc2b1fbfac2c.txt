primipil/iStock via Getty Images Olaplex Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:OLPX) sells a specialty line of hair care treatments including shampoos and conditioners. If you haven't been following the latest trends in beauty products, Olaplex has shaken up the industry in recent years through a string of Hollywood celebrity endorsements while also capturing a buzz on social media. The brand momentum helped launch the company's IPO in 2021 supported by impressive growth trends. While shares of OLPX have been highly volatile this year amid the broader market selloff, we think the stock looks interesting at the current level nearly 20% below its IPO price and also down 40% from its peak valuation.
