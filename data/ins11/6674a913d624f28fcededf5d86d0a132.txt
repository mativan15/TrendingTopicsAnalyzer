A record-setting seizure of methamphetamine by Winnipeg Police is good news for officers, and bad news for criminals — but advocates say those on the streets will feel the duality of such a bust.
On Oct. 12, police raided an apartment building in the 800 block of Sterling Lyon Parkway.Behind that door was the largest quantity of methamphetamine the Guns and Gangs unit has ever seized — 63 kilograms.Inspector Elton Hall says at $10 per dose, it represents $6.3 million in street value.'From a criminal organization perspective, this is $6 million that will not be going back into organized crime,' he told media at a news conference Thursday.
