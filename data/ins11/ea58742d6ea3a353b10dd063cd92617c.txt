Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will miss his side's top-of-the-table clash with Bundesliga high-fliers Freiburg on Sunday due to ongoing problems with his shoulder, coach Julian Nagelsmann confirmed. "Manuel won't play, he is still in pain. I hope he can be back next week, but Freiburg will be too early for him," said Nagelsmann, whose team will now be without their captain for a second game in a row. "It's annoying, but that's how it is," he added.Neuer missed Bayern's 4-2 Champions League win over Viktoria Plzen in midweek with a bruised shoulder, but had played every single minute of the league season so far.
