‘I'm a man of simple pleasures': I live with my girlfriend, 59, who owns several homes and has saved $3 million. I pay utilities and cable, and do repairs. Is that enough?

I think I am being more than fair relative to sharing expenses while living in my girlfriend's house, but I could use a little perspective.My 59-year-old retired girlfriend is well-off. Her lakefront home with an extra buildable lot, her Florida condo, and her residential and commercial rental properties are all paid off, and she has over $3 million in cash and investments. She is also collecting alimony from her ex for a few more years. I am 62 and employed, and have just under $1 million in cash and investments.
