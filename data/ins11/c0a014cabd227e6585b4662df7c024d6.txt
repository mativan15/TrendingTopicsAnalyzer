By Reuters Published: 11:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 11:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 The Florida Panthers will place defenseman Aaron Ekblad on long-term injured reserve, general manager Bill Zito said Wednesday morning. Ekblad, 26, sustained a lower-body injury during the second period of Florida's 5-3 loss to the Boston Bruins on Monday. He is required to sit out at least 10 NHL games and 24 days by being placed on long-term injured reserve. "He'll be back. It's not season-ending," Zito said.
