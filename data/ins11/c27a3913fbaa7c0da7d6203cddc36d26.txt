Target shares could bounce 24% from current levels, says Jefferies, which put a buy rating on the retail giant, citing its ability to withstand a tough economic environment marred by inflation. Shares rose as much as 8% to $161.13 on Tuesday, boosted by the report. Jefferies' newly set price target of $185 marks a 24% upside to Monday's close.Target's rating was upgraded to buy from hold. Walmart also received a buy rating. "We think the current macroeconomic backdrop, while admittedly challenged given the interest rate/inflationary environment, is one in which both Walmart and Target can outperform," analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in assuming coverage of the companies.
