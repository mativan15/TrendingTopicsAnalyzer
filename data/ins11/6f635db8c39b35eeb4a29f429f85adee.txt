The Philadelphia 76ers had a tough night in Boston on Tuesday as they fell to the Celtics 126-117 on opening night. It was a disappointing result for a team with a ton of expectations and they want to be able to compete for a title in the Eastern Conference.
However, it is just one game. There are 81 games left for Philadelphia and this will give them an opportunity to figure it all out so they can be better when the time calls for it.
A huge positive for the Sixers is the play of James Harden. The Beard put in a lot of work over the summer and it shined on Tuesday as he had 35 points with eight rebounds and seven assists.
