New Delhi: United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called for low cost finance to be made available for developing countries like India to allow for the renewable energy revolution to succeed. "Today we have a dramatic situation. Already 20 countries are paying interest rates ten points above the American Treasury bills. So the only way to allow for a renewables revolution in the developing countries is reducing the cost of capital in developing countries," he said, speaking on the India-UN partnership on India's 75th anniversary at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay.
