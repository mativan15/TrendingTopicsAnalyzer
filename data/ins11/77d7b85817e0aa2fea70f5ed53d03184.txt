Some of the losses seen by insiders who purchased UK£937k worth of Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) shares over the past year were recovered after the stock increased by 3.9% over the past week. However, the purchase is proving to be an expensive wager as insiders are yet to get ahead of their losses which currently stand at UK£51k since the time of purchase.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
