Interim head coach Jim Leonhard and the Wisconsin Badgers (3-4, 1-3 Big Ten), who were seven-and-a-half point favorites, failed to win back-to-back games for the first time this season, losing a 34-28 heartbreaker in overtime at Spartan Field on Saturday afternoon.

Sputtering offense, losing the turnover battle, getting penalized eight times for 72 yards, and consistently poor tackling isn't a recipe for success – who would have thought?

One week after Wisconsin's best offensive performance of the season, the Badgers took steps backward, mustering 283 total yards (131 passing, 152 rushing) on a mere 4.
