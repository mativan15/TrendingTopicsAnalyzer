Pension savers may see the value of their retirement pots jump by tens of thousands of pounds after new estimates take effect.
A shake-up of forecast calculations means a saver's predicted pot size at retirement age will dramatically increase in value in some cases.
Pension statements tell savers how much money is in their pension pot, how much this will likely grow by the time they retire, and how much of an income that would translate to in retirement.
Providers have been free to choose their own growth assumptions, but new regulations mooted by regulator the Financial Reporting Council would introduce a standard across the industry.
