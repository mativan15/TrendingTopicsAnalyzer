Egyptian livestock farmers are culling chicks amid a shortage of feed imports, as soaring costs exacerbate a historic food crisis.

About 1.5 million tons of corn and 500,000 tons of soybeans -- the main components in chicken feed -- are stuck at ports, Mohamed El-Shafei, vice chairman of the Poultry Producers Union said in a televised interview on Saturday. The goods are waiting for government-required letters of credit from importers so that they can be released.
