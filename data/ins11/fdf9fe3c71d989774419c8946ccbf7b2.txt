Following decreasing sales and an executive's nose-biting incident, Beyond Meat Inc., a producer of plant-based meat substitutes, is making sustainable changes in leadership, including a new CFO, and is also shrinking its workforce.  Douglas W. Ramsey, Beyond Meat's chief operating officer for less than a year, had his last day on the job on Oct. 14, according to the company's 8-K document. Ramsey had been on suspension since Sept. 20 after being arrested following a college football game in Fayetteville, Ark.
