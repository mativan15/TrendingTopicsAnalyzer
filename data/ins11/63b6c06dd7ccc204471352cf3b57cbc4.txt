BNY Mellon, the oldest bank in the United States, said on Tuesday that it would soon custody cryptocurrencies for its clients. In September, private equity behemoth KKR made part of its health care fund available on layer-1 blockchain, Avalanche. The string of news follows closely on the heels of a partnership between $10 trillion asset manager, BlackRock, and Coinbase. "Our institutional clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital asset markets and are focused on how to efficiently manage the operational lifecycle of these assets," Joseph Chalom, BlackRock's global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships, said in an August blog post.
