Collider.com The final season of Derry Girls, Netflix's hit comedy about spirited Northern Irish teenagers Erin Quinn (Saiorse-Monica Jackson), Orla McCool (Louisa Harland), Clare Devlin (Nicola Coughlin), Michelle Mallon (Jamie-Lee O'Donnell), and "wee English fella" James Maguire (Dylan Llewellyn), debuted this October. Featuring guest stars from Liam Neeson –– playing a beleaguered Royal Ulster Constabulary officer –– to Chelsea Clinton, the series ticks along at a more frenetic pace than usual, at times appearing unfocused and frantic even amid its trademark absurdist humor.
