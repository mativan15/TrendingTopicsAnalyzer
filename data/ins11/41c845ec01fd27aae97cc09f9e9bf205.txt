HOUSTON – It is amazing how quickly, even more than four decades later, that George Brett is back there. As if Hal McRae is wiping out Willie Randolph with a slide at second right in front of him now or he is squaring off against Graig Nettles or he cannot believe the damn Yankees are building another roadblock to his dream.
Brett brings it all up in a phone call once you ask him to step back, once you put him in the time machine and ask him what it feels like to be a baseball Sisyphus and keep pushing that boulder up the mountain just to have the same group push you back before you reach the summit.
