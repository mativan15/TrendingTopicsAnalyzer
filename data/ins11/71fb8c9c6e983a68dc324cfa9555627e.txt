Ottawa police say a man and a woman from Montreal are facing fraud charges in connection with so-called 'grandparent scams' that have allegedly defrauded victims of more than $46,000. The fraud involves someone calling an elderly person and claiming to be a grandchild who is in serious trouble and needs money immediately, usually for bail. The caller is often pretending to be crying, making it harder to understand them, and there is a sense of both urgency and secrecy around the demands. The targets are then encouraged to withdraw cash, which is later picked-up by a courier.
