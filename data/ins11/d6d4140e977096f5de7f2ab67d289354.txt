Malaysians will go to the polls in a month as the shaky coalition government of Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob attempts to win a solid mandate and bring an end to the political manoeuvring that has seen the country through three prime ministers in nearly as many years.
The federal election, which was not due until September 2023, will take place on November 19 after two weeks of campaigning, the Election Commission announced on Thursday. Elections for assemblies will also be held in some of the country's 13 states.
