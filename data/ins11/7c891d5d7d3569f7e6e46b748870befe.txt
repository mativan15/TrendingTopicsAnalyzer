If Christian McCaffrey, traded from the Carolina Panthers to the San Francisco 49ers late Thursday, gets on the field right away for his new team, it will mark his second career appearance against the Chiefs.

And like the first one, it would come as a bit of a surprise to the Chiefs.

In 2020, while he was still with the Carolina Panthers, McCaffrey had missed six straight games battling a high-ankle sprain. His first game back came at Arrowhead, and McCaffrey rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown.
