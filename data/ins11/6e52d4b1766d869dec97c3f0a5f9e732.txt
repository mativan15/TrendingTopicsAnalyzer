EY is exploring a stock market listing or partial sale of its global advisory business as part of a radical restructuring that could lead to a huge windfall for about 12,000 of the firm's global partners.The business, which was formerly known as Ernst & Young and is one of the Big Four accountancy groups, along with KPMG, PwC and Deloitte, is being advised on its planning by JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, according to the Financial Times.The banks declined to comment last night, as did EY.The firm's senior partners have yet to make a proposal to partners on whether to proceed with a restructuring and exactly what form it should take.
