Since opening in 2018, Hope Awaits Ministries has housed 120 men experiencing homelessness in North Bay. The shelter helps the men relearn skills and abilities to achieve success. It has space for seven men to stay overnight and a clothing bank. Saturday it is hosting the third annual Homeless Night Challenge, encouraging the community to come together at the Kiwanis Bandshell and to learn about what homeless men go through. "I think there's a lot of different bias or ideas of who the homeless are, what they face, how they can stop being homeless," said Nicole Millage, the agency's executive director.
