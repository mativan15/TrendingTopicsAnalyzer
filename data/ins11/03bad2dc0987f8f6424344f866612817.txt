President Joe Biden on Friday sounded dismissive when a reporter asked him about a much-discussed report that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said he had a 'super bad feeling' about the economy. Biden responded to the question by saying companies such as Ford F, -2.74%,  Intel  INTC, -2.52% and Chrysler's parent  STLA, -3.56% were making investments in the U.S. economy. 'So you know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon,' the president said, referring to the SpaceX and Tesla boss. Musk said in an email to executives at Tesla that he had a 'super bad feeling' about the economy, and that employee headcount at the electric-vehicles giant needed to be cut by 10%, according to a Reuters report.
