Amber Heard says she plans to appeal after Johnny Depp was awarded $10.4 million in his bombshell defamation case Wednesday – but experts say it'll be a while before she has to pay any money.
A jury in Fairfax, Virginia Wednesday found Heard liable for defaming Depp, 58, in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse. The jury also found Heard was defamed by one of Depp's lawyers but only awarded her $2 million in damages.
'No one will be writing any checks until the case is finally resolved – whether it's on appeal or motions for new trial, but there is going to be more litigation before we know who's getting paid what,' former California judge and current criminal defense lawyer Halim Dhanidina told The Post.
