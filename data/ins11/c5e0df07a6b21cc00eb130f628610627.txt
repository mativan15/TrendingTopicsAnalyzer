(RTTNews) - Indian shares rallied on Thursday despite mixed global cues as inflation and recession worries persisted. Domestic markets opened on a flat note before seeing a surge in the afternoon, tracking positive cues from European markets. Declining oil prices also boosted sentiment. Both Brent and WTI crude futures fell over 2 percent after the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia was prepared to pump more oil to compensate for any Russian output loss because of the Western sanctions imposed on it.
