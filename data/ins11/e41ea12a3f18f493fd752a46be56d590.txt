Mayor of Topeka Mike Padilla shakes hands with Gov. Laura Kelly before signing a bill outside of local businesses in downtown Topeka Thursday.

Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill Thursday granting property tax relief to retail storefronts affected by government public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"There is no better place to sign bipartisan legislation supporting our small business owners that right here in the heart of revitalized downtown Topeka," Kelly said, standing in front of storefronts along Kansas Avenue.
