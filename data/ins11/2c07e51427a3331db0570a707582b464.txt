While the latest jobs report shows a robust labor market, a glance at the the tech and startup industry is telling a different story.

Over the last few months, a number of technology companies or venture capital–backed firms have announced plans to either freeze hiring, rescind accepted offers, or lay off employees.

This week, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk ordered a hiring pause worldwide, citing a "super bad feeling" about the economy, according to an email obtained by Reuters. His comments came just days after JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon warned of an economic 'hurricane" ahead as the Federal Reserve continues its process of normalizing interest rates.
