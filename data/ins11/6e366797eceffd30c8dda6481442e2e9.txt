Published: 01:14 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 01:14 EDT, 19 October 2022 The Florida Panthers are just three games into their season, but they are already facing an emergency. Florida, which will play host to the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday night in Sunrise, Fla., is dealing with injuries to defensemen Aaron Ekblad, Brandon Montour and Matt Kiersted. After Ekblad went down Monday during a 5-3 loss to the Boston Bruins, the Panthers played with just four defensemen. On the penalty kill, the Panthers used star forward Aleksander Barkov as a defender.
