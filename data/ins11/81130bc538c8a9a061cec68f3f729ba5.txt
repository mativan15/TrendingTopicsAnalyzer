A year ago, the housing market was on a roll.

Sales of existing homes rose 7% in September from the prior month, reaching an annual pace of 6.29 million. Prices of a median home, meanwhile, were up 13.3% from a year earlier.

This week, the housing market will see a new round of economic data for September and the picture is vastly different. On Thursday, the existing home sales report is expected to show sales have fallen to 4.7 million annually – a drop of 25%.

The culprit? An aggressive program of interest rates from the Federal Reserve designed to arrest inflation that has led to mortgage rates of 7%, more than double a year ago.
