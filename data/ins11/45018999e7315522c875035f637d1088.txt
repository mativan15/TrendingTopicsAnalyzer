At $2.10 a litre in the Sydney, N.S., area, and higher in some more remote parts of Cape Breton Island, gas prices continue to flummox people as often as they fluctuate. "It just seems we're being left out in the cold. After all this time, we're trying to support the economy, we're hiring people," said Jason Leblanc, the owner of the Coastal Restaurant along the Cabot Trail in Ingonish, N.S. Leblanc said vehicle traffic so far during the first weekend of June wasn't quite what he expected. He says numbers at his business during last weekend's Cabot Trail Relay Race were also down more than 20 per cent, compared to pre-pandemic years.
