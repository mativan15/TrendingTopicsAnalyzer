IPEF members will get first look from American companies for investment: RaimondoBy Byun Duk-kun WASHINGTON, May 31 (Yonhap) -- The countries that sign on to the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) will receive priority consideration for any future investment from American companies, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Monday. Raimondo also insisted that U.S. businesses seeking to relocate out of China will look first look at those countries. "This is a perfect concrete example of the potential power of the Indo Pacific Economic Framework, because if we get this right, IPEF will create a platform that strengthens our economic relationships in the region, keep standards around labor and environment high," she said in a telephonic press conference following her recent trip to South Korea and Japan with U.
