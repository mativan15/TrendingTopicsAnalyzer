Published: 09:47 EDT, 5 June 2022 | Updated: 09:59 EDT, 5 June 2022 Elon Musk has questioned why billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's client list has not been released by the 'leaking' Justice Department.Musk, 50, shared a meme of 'things I'll never see in my life,' showing pictures of a dragon, a dinosaur, a unicorn, and text reading 'The Epstein/Maxwell client list.''Only thing more remarkable than DOJ not leaking the list is that no one in the media cares. Doesn't that seem odd?' Musk tweeted.
