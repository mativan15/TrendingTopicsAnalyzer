After a two-year absence because of the pandemic, the California Interscholastic Federation state track and field meet returns this weekend to Veteran's Memorial Stadium in Clovis. Dozens of athletes from the Bay Area News Group's coverage area who survived league and sectional meets this month will be among those competing on the state's premier stage in the 102nd edition of the showcase. Los Altos distance runner Lauren Soobrian and Dublin pole vaulter Jathiyah Muhammad are BANG's only top qualifiers.
