S&P 500 Technical Analysis

The S&P 500 contract rose slightly in the futures markets on Monday, to reach the 50 Day EMA. That being said, we have also pulled back from it to form a bit of a shooting star. Regardless, I would not read too much into the candlestick other than it shows that simply going straight up in the air from here is going to be a bit more difficult than some people would have imagined. With that in mind, I think it's probably only a matter of time before we sell-off, and quite frankly there's not much going on out there that tells me the market rally should continue.
