Jose Alvarado may have signed a multi-year contract extension with New Orleans in March, but the man still knows when it's time to rein in expenses. That was the case leading up to Wednesday's regular season opener in Brooklyn (6:30 p.m., Bally Sports New Orleans, WRNO 99.5 FM), as the catalytic reserve point guard dealt with ticket requests for his return to his native New York City.'I didn't (get as many tickets for friends) as last year, because that price last year was no joke,' a smiling Alvarado said of buying seats in Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center during the same mid-January road trip.
