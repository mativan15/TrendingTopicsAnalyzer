In a paper released on Tuesday, scientists have announced that they have discovered the largest-known clone on the planet—a giant seagrass plant.While it's not quite a massive Dolly the Sheep, the clone is actually a single, widespread polyploid clone of the seagrass Posidonia australis, spanning at least 180km (a little over 110 miles) in Shark Bay, Western Australia. According to co-author Dr. Elizabeth Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the School of Biological Sciences & Oceans Institute, University of Western Australia, the previous record-holder was only around 50km across.
