It seems like everyone's in a crabby mood today, making it a good idea to lay low and wait for the bad vibes to pass. The day is best spent at home or in our own quiet little bubble. For those of us looking to chase away the blues, nostalgic movies, TV shows or music can be a source of comfort. Keeping busy with household tasks can also provide a healthy distraction from stress and worry. Of course, finding an appropriate place to vent our feelings is also encouraged, as sometimes the best thing to do is let it all out.
