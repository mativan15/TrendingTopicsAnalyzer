Oct 18 (Reuters) - Austria launched the first ever green T-Bill on Tuesday, issuing 1 billion euros of the new to debt to attract shorter-term investors to buy environmentally friendly assets.

So far, governments and companies selling green debt, a fast-growing market which funds environmentally friendly expenditure, have sold bonds with much longer time horizons.

But with central banks and a wider group of investors interested in green investments to bolster their sustainability credentials, interest in shorter-term green debt is growing.
