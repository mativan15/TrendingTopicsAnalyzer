May 27—A local company that offers nutritious options for homemade baby food continues to expand its offerings and where its products can be found.

Taste-T-Love Baby Food founder Kourtney Terry said she started off her college career going into the culinary arts, but when she learned she was pregnant with her now-16-year-old daughter, she changed her major to "something more practical," eventually ending up as an internal project manager for a local health care system.

But in 2018, after her third child was born, she found her passion: creating baby food.
