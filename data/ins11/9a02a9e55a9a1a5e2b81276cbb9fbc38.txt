The CMA is investigating. Britain's competition watchdog said on Wednesday that it was launching an investigation into BT Group's deal to merge its sports TV business in the U.K. and Ireland with Warner Bros. Discovery in a joint venture.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) set a July 28 deadline to make a so-called phase 1 decision on whether the planned  venture would also result in lesser competition. It said its probe would look at whether the venture 'may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.
