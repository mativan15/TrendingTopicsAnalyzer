Federal prosecutors have said a Trump confidant tried to secretly sway foreign policy in favor of the United Arab Emirates, but that accusation was undermined Thursday in testimony by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mnuchin said Thomas Barrack, a billionaire friend of former President Donald Trump, advocated for one of the UAE's top adversaries during a regional foreign policy crisis. Mnuchin said Barrack sided with Qatar when it was blockaded by its neighbors, whom the Trump administration supported.
