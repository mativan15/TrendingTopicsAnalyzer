Protestors in Cuba who have been taking to the streets after Hurricane Ian damaged the island's already faltering power grid could face criminal charges, Cuba's Attorney General's office said Saturday. In a note published in the island's communist party newspaper, Granma, prosecutors said they were investigating cases of arson and vandalism of state property, streets closures and "insults to officials and forces of order." Additionally, parents of minors who take part in the protests could face charges of child endangerment, according to the note.
