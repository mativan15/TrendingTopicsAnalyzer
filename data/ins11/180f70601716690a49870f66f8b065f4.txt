OTTAWA—A week before the Trudeau government invoked the federal Emergencies Act, Canada's spy service told Ottawa police and federal officials the so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protests did not have substantial connections to foreign actors, documents at an inquiry into the unprecedented use of the law now show.A memo tabled Tuesday summarizes a Feb. 6 call among federal, provincial and city government officials and reveals for the first time that CSIS was looking for but did not find substantial connections to foreign fundraising or organizers among the convoy protesters at that point.
