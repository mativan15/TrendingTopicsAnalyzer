Buy someone a book as a gift, and they have... one book. Buy someone a book-reading device, and they have access to almost any book ever published. I especially appreciate how E Ink readers have remained largely single-function devices, focusing on reading (and occasionally note-taking), rather than branching out into games, video chats or work apps. The most famous digital book reader is Amazon's Kindle line, which uses E Ink displays and supports Amazon's ebook storefront.
