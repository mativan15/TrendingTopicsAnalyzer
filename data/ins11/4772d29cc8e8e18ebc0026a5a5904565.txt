Meredith Whittaker is the president of Signal, the popular messaging app that offers encrypted communication. You might recognize Meredith's name from a different context: in 2018, she was an AI researcher at Google and one of the organizers of the Google walkout, during which 20,000 employees protested the company's handling of sexual misconduct. Meredith also protested the company's work on military contracts before leaving in 2019.Now she's at Signal, which is a little different than the usual tech company: it's operated by a nonprofit foundation and prides itself on collecting as little data as possible.
