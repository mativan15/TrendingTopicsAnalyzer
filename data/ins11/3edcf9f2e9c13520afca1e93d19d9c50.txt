By Reuters Published: 00:44 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 00:44 EDT, 18 October 2022 Oct 18 (Reuters) - China has asked its state-owned gas importers to stop reselling liquefied natural gas (LNG) to buyers in Europe and Asia as it seeks to ensure its own supply for the winter season, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. Halting LNG resales could create more supply issues for Europe, which has benefited from redirected cargoes to make up the shortfall after pipeline gas supplies from Russia have been curtailed amid the Ukraine conflict.
