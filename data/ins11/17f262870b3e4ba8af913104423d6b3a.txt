Atlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith's offensive concepts have drawn praise from Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor ahead of their Week 7 battle.

Atlanta Falcons second-year coach Arthur Smith arrived in Jan. 2021 with a reputation.

Smith spent the previous two years as the Tennessee Titans' offensive coordinator, leading a top-3 rushing offense in both campaigns and fielding the third-best overall offense in 2020.
