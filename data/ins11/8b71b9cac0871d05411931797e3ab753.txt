Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced that the country will be looking to regulate the digital assets industry but will prefer that regulations are guided by a tech-driven framework.
In a report by the Economic Times, Sitharaman disclosed India's position to journalists ahead of her meetings with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) while adding that despite the pining of stakeholders for softer regulations, 'the technology will not be misutilized.'
'We would definitely want to collate all this and do a bit of study and then bring it on to the table of the G20 (Group of 20) so that members can discuss it and hopefully arrive at a framework or SOP (standard operating procedure) so that globally, countries can have a technology-driven regulatory framework,' said Sitharaman.
