Jacinda Ardern has spoken out against the online 'scourge of disinformation' in an address at Harvard University, in which she also won standing ovations for her government's gun control laws, diversity and decriminalisation of abortion. The New Zealand prime minister was honoured by the American university , making the annual commencement address to more than a thousand students on Thursday from the same stage as figures such as Winston Churchill, Angela Merkel, Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey.
