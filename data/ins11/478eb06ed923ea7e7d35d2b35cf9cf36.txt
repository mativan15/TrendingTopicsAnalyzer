Stephanie Thacker, who is known as @sillysteph01 on social media, has been working as a DoorDasher while documenting her struggle with homelessness on TikTok, where she has more than 90,000 followers. On September 19, she posted a heartbreaking video of herself hysterically crying outside a home in Georgetown, Kentucky, after realizing she had been swindled out of her life's savings.
