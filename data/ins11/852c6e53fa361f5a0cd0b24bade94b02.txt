Tired of waiting any longer, Nikola Jokic tossed Jamal Murray a life preserver and yanked him out of the fray.
Murray was five minutes into his interview with assembled media on Tuesday, the day before he was set to return from his 18-month ACL rehab for the season opener at Utah, when the reigning two-time MVP lumbered to the outskirts of the circle and informed his point guard the interview was over.
'He said I'm done,' Murray joked, exchanging spots with Jokic in front of the cameras.
Frankly, what Jokic had to say was more interesting than Murray, anyway.
