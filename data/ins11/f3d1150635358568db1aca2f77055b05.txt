The Parliamentary Standing Committee presented its report (bit.ly/3S1cp4E) on the promotion and regulation of ecommerce in India in June. Its recommendations will affect every stakeholder in the economic development sphere, especially smaller sellers and their inclination to join the digital retail network. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) recognises the need to sync with established ecommerce platforms, thereby recognising the contribution these platforms are making towards widening the spread of market, giving real-time feedback to manufacturers and, thus, triggering growth for MSMEs.
