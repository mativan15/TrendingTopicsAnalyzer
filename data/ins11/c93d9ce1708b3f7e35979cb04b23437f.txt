Indian Oil Corp is in talks with US energy firm Tellurian Inc for a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply deal as well as an equity investment in the latter's Driftwood project, according to people familiar with the matter. Indian Oil has grand ambitions in the natural gas segment but a turmoil in the international market has made it harder for it to source affordable LNG. Indian Oil, Petronet LNG and GAIL are all seeking long-term contracts but have been unable to lay their hands on any deal that can bring supplies ahead of 2026 when large global liquefaction capacity is expected to come onstream, easing the current crunch.
