I did a comparison of Procter & Gamble and The Clorox Company (CLX) in my prior July 14, 2022 article, and I came to the conclusion that PG was "a better dividend stock" than CLX. The current article shines the spotlight on Procter & Gamble's most recent Q1 FY 2023 (YE June 30) financial results announcement. PG's organic sales expansion, operating profit margin, and bottom line for the first quarter of the current fiscal year exceeded analysts' expectations.
