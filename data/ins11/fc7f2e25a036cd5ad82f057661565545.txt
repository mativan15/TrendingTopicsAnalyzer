Astronauts will be able to abandon their sterile drinking straws and sip from glasses of sparkling champagne under a project endorsed by the French space agency.After five years of development, including tests in weightless flight, the GH Mumm company has perfected a traditional champagne for zero gravity, complete with bubbles, that is dispensed from a high-tech bottle. Astronauts capture small spheres of wine as they float in the air with the open coupes, albeit made from plastic.The company claims that its Cordon Rouge Stellar, the space bottle, and the glasses meet the exacting standards of the champagne appellation and have been approved by the National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) while also preserving the festivity that goes with the drink.
