The Golden State Warriors and guard Jordan Poole have agreed to a four-year, $140 million contract extension, his agents, Drew Morrison and Austin Brown of CAA Sports, told ESPN on Saturday.The extension comes ahead of Monday's deadline for members of the 2019 NBA draft class. It also comes in the aftermath of Draymond Green's punch of Poole during a recent practice session that shook the franchise.Poole, 23, has emerged as one of the best young guards in the league, and the extension represents a commitment to him as one of the Warriors' cornerstones for years to come.
