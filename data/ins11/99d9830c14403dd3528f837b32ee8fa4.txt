R﻿oss County defender Callum Johnson says building momentum is key as his team bid to rise off the bottom of the Premiership with victory at Kilmarnock on Saturday.T﻿he Staggies are unbeaten in their last two games, drawing 1-1 with Dundee United after defeating Livingston 1-0, and trail the Tannadice side and Killie on goal difference.'Momentum is probably underrated in football," said Johnson.'The hardest part of a run is getting on to one. If we can make it three or four unbeaten then with that confidence and belief, we can hopefully get on a bit of a run between now and the break.
