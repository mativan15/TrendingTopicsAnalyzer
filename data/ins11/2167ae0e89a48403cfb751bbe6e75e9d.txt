The walls of the Martello tower were made of granite and seven feet thick. It was a fort containing three circular rooms, two bathrooms, and a kitchen built into the walls. The livingroom was like a granite igloo with a proud hollow for a fireplace, another opening on to a solid-stone winding staircase leading to what can only be described as the lookout we slept in. A lighthouse. A glass room from which we could look out over the promenade of the seaside town of Bray.I'm not sure you would call it a house, but it was the first dwelling Ali and I owned and lived in, and it felt wildly romantic after having previously been holed up in the band's rehearsal room on the beach in Sutton.
