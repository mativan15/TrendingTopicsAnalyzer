MIAMI — A week after a fraternity got kicked off the University of Miami campus for chanting at a pool party about having sex with a dead woman, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity brothers apologized Friday for the misogynistic lyrics and denied allegations of drugged drinks.'The brothers of the former Florida Gamma Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon are deeply sorry for the chant prior to the October 1st event,' they said in a statement provided to the Herald about the Oct. 1 pool party that led to the national board suspending the UM chapter last Friday.
