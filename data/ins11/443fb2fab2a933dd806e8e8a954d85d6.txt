A NUMBER of Southampton communities could see new investment in their areas to "help them thrive".

Councillor Satvir Kaur, the Labour leader of Southampton City Council who took power at the May election, said she will be investing in high streets, district precincts and shopping centres.

No full details have been given on the plans but Cllr Kaur said she will be reinvesting into Bitterne precinct, Lordshill and other high streets "to help them thrive."

Cllr Kaur said her vision for Southampton is a family city that is "safer, greener, and more affordable" in a bid to bring back pride to those that live here.
