CHUNYIP WONG Beijing has come up with a clever solution to aid small businesses that are critical links in complex supply chains as it faces pressure to jumpstart economic growth: Providing them with financing backed by receivables from their deep-pocketed state-owned buyers. Beneficiaries of that campaign include Linklogis Inc. ((OTCPK:LNKLF, OTCPK:LNKLY); 9959.HK), which reported its business received a strong boost in the first nine months of the year as a result of the new policy. Since the end of last year, the entity that oversees big state-owned companies has required those companies to use technology platforms to assist in financing for their suppliers.
