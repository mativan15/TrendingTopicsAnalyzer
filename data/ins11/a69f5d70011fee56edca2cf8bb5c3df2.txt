AgenciesIn a highly unusual move, China's National Bureau of Statistics has announced to defer the release of critical economic data for an indefinite period. China has delayed the release of economic data indefinitely as country's President Xi Jinping continues to push for his Communist party's progress. The world's second-largest economy made this announcement on October 17 without any further explanation. Notably, China was supposed to release its economic data on the morning of October 18. According to analysts, this delay by the country's National Bureau of Statistics was highly unusual.
