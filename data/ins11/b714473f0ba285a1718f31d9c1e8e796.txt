I'm not thinking of applying myself to a tobacco firm. But I was just wondering if tobacco firms have to in todays health, ethics, sustainabilty conscious world pay a premium salary for employees and how big is the salary premium?

For example a business controller could work in what ever company they wish, why would they choosee a tobacco firm other than better company culture, pay and benefits?
