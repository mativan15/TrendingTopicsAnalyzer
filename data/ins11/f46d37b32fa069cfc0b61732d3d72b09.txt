First lady Jill Biden was showered with boos by the Philadelphia Eagles' home crowd ahead of their Sunday night matchup against the Dallas Cowboys, according to multiple media reports.

Mrs. Biden, an Eagles fan along with her husband, President Joe Biden, was an honorary captain for the pregame coin toss. She was on hand to promote the White House's Cancer Moonshot initiative and walked out with cancer survivors for a rendition of 'Fly Eagles, Fly,' The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

None of those things could shield her from the fan base's infamous boo birds, who have previously targeted Santa Claus and their own Super Bowl-winning team, according to CBS Sports.
