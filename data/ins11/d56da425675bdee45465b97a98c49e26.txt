Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, slammed Republican Georgia Senate opponent, Herschel Walker, for producing a prop police badge during their debate.

WARNOCK: 'I think what we saw clearly Friday night and last night, is that my opponent Herschel Walker is not ready. I pointed out the fact that he claimed to be in law enforcement, to be a police officer, and that he threatened a shootout with the police, and his response was to produce a fake badge? The people of Georgia deserve a serious person to represent them at serious times and I'm committed to doing that work.
