Spencer Platt/Getty Images News Stock index futures point to further gains at the start of trading Tuesday. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) +1.7%, S&P futures (SPX) +1.6% and Dow futures (INDU) +1.3% are higher. The economic calendar is light again, but earnings season heats up with plenty to trade on before and after the bell. J&J is higher after topping expectations. Rates are steady. The 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) is flat at 4.01% and the 2-year yields (US2Y) is flat at 4.45%. "There wasn't any specific catalyst of higher 10yr yields (Monday), other than perhaps US based investors are more focused on the Fed and inflation outlook than on UK financial instability," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.
