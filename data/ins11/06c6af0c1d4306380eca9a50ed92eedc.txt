The roster for the the first event in the controversial Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf League is out, and there are some notable names in the field — and a big one missing.
Dustin Johnson headlines the 42-player field, which also includes Sergio Garcia, Martin Kaymer, Kevin Na, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood, battling it out for the $25 million winnings.
In February, Johnson said he would be sticking with the PGA Tour, though he seems to have changed his mind in recent days. By playing in the LIV Golf Tournament June 9-11, Johnson will miss the RBC Canadian Open — the Canadian financial service company is one of his main sponsors — though he is still listed in the field.
