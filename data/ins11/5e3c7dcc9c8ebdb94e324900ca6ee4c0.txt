Former First Lady Michelle Obama has quietly been a titan of business earning a $70 million through deals with Spotify, Netflix and even influencing the fashion industry.

According to Vanity Fair, in her eight years as the first lady, Obama drove more than $2 billion to the 'retail sector' with her fashion choices alone and companies saw 'a 2.3 percent stock gain when she dons their products—five times that of a typical celebrity endorsement.'

It's not the first time a Michelle Obama endorsement has led to more money for a brand.
