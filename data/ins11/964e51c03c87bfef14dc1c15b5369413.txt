WASHINGTON, DC—Following recent mass shootings in Buffalo, NY, Uvalde, TX and Tulsa, OK, the House Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to advance the 'Protecting Our Kids Act' to the House floor. HR 7910 is a comprehensive package of gun violence prevention proposals to stop the spread of gun -related crimes and help prevent future mass casualty shootings. The legislation passed by a vote of 25-19, with all Republicans voting against.   'Today the House Judiciary Committee took the first, but hopefully not the last, step towards enacting commonsense gun violence prevention legislation,' said Chairman Nadler.
