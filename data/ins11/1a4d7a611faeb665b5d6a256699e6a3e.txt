Sydney's motorists will be hit by a 6 per cent surge in tolls on the WestConnex motorways just months before a state election that is expected to be dominated by cost-of-living concerns.

Surging inflation has already triggered higher quarterly increases in charges on other Sydney toll roads, increasing pressure on the government which is due to complete a wide-ranging review of tolls within the next two months.

Transurban operates all of Sydney's toll roads apart from the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel.
