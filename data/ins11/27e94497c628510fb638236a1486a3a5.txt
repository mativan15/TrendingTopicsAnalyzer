Cashbuild, a building materials supplier with operations in six southern African countries, has announced it will complete its exit from Zambia by end of September 2022 after posting persistent losses there.

The company, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and with 318 outlets in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi and Eswatini, also said in its financials for the year ended June 26 that revenue fell by 12% on the 2021 performance to $634mn because of an increase in DIY projects during COVID-19 lockdowns.
