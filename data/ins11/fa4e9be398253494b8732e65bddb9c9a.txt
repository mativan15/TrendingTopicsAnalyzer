Oct. 15—Anyone making the quick drive down to Kansas City to catch a flight will soon be doing so inside a brand-new terminal. The $1.5 billion infrastructure project happening at Kansas City International Airport is nearing completion and is expected to open in March of 2023.

Justin Meyer, deputy director of aviation at KCI, said the new terminal is more than 90% complete.

"A lot of the work that's being done now is interior fit and finish," Meyer said. "Some of the concession space is being built out, some of the gate seating is being installed, some of the signage is being installed, that's really the focus right now.
