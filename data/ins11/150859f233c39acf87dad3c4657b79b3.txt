The strong pandemic rebound of business aviation has had a significant impact on Honeywell Aerospace's industry outlook for the next decade.

On the eve of the National Business Aviation Association convention in Orlando, the company Sunday released an annual forecast that was up 15% on its key metrics from the previous year.

Honeywell now expects 8,500 new business jet deliveries through 2032 at a value of $274 billion — up from an outlook of 7,400 deliveries at $238 billion from last year's forecast.
