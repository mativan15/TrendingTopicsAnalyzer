Kyrie Irving was mired in uncertainty last season, about his ankle and his future.
That led the Nets guard to feeling 'isolated' and 'lonely,' he said in an interview with Stadium's Shams Charania that was published on Tuesday.
Irving missed the start of the 2021-22 NBA season for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, leaving him initially unable to suit up for games in Brooklyn because of New York City's vaccine mandate. He was also still recovering from an ankle injury he'd sustained during the playoffs the previous season that he called the worst of his career.
