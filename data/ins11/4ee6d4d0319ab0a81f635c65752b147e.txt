SMALL, clean-shaven, and with a melancholy bitterness about his tightly shut mouth, President Beneš is a simple man, but distinguished in his simplicity.

His self-possession has the unmistakable evidence of will power and intelligence. He is a self-made man in the best sense of the word.Yet Beneš wears an air of silence. It is not mystery exactly, but a great stillness.
