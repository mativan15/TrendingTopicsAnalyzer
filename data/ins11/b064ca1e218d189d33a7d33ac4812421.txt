Britney Spears may be a global icon known by millions, but it was the star's humility that first drew in her fiancé Sam Asghari.

Asghari, 28, opened up about his relationship with the pop star in a new GQ interview, and revealed his first impression upon meeting Spears in 2016 on the set of her "Slumber Party" music video.

"It was the humbleness that attracted me," he said.
