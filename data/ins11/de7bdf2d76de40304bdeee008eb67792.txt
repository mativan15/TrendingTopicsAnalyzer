Dominant, Pro Bowler, a potential Defensive Player of the Year candidate, all of these have been used to describe Quinnen Williams this season.

Jets teammates noticed a change with Williams beginning in training camp.

'A week into camp, you just knew it looked different,' Jets defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins said. 'Probably about three weeks into camp, I pulled him aside and I was like, ‘just do this all year, just do that. Don't do nothing else, just do this and he's been doing it so far.

'He's playing up to the level that not only everybody else expected him to play, but what he's expected himself to do every time he's on the field.
