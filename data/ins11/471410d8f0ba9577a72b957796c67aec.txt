Married at First Sight UK stars Jordan Emmett Connelly and Chanita Stephenson have revealed they're ‘rekindling' their romance, even though he dumped her over FaceTime.
Chanita and Jordan stunned viewers during the reunion episode last night, when they walked into the dinner party alone, sharing they were no longer together.
The couple had been one of the strongest this series, with all of us voting in their favour, including their fellow contestants and the experts.
However, things hadn't worked out the way they wanted to, and Chanita broke down in tears during the final reunion episode in which they revealed things hadn't worked out.
