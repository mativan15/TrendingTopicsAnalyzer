SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets will be used in two launches by the European Space Agency.

The ESA previously used Russian rockets, but has cut ties since the invasion of Ukraine.

The agency's boss has previously warned that the rest of the world's space tech is falling behind SpaceX.

Elon Musk's SpaceX will launch two rockets for the European Space Agency after the Ukraine conflict led to the organization severing ties with Russia.

The ESA's director general, Josef Aschbacher, confirmed on Thursday that it will use SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets to launch two spacecraft, Euclid and Hera, in 2023 and 2024 respectively, per Reuters.
