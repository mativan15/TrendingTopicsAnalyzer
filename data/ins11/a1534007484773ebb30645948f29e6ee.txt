One of the CEOs of South Korean super-app Kakao has resigned in the wake of the datacenter fire that disrupted it and other web giants.
Kakao operates messaging, rideshare, e-commerce and many other services in South Korea. Most were unavailable for much of the weekend after a fire at the third party data centre hosting its infrastructure necessitated a shutdown.
Disruption to everyday activities in South Korea was so severe that senior government figures scolded Kakao, the data centre's operator SK C&C, and Naver, another major online service impacted by the blaze.
