Backers of Boris Johnson in the ruling Conservative Party are calling for his return as UK prime minister following the dramatic resignation of his successor in 10 Downing Street, Liz Truss.

Johnson, who was only ousted as Britain's leader in July, hasn't yet declared his candidacy but is eligible because he remains a Conservative MP. The Times newspaper reported that Johnson is expected to stand, without saying where it obtained the information. Johnson himself has not commented publicly.
