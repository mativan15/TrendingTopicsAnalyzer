The long-time Shadyside bar now exists on Butler Street in Lawrenceville. It had to relocate after the building's landlord put in a new business. "We did what we needed to do to keep my 20 employees employed and came down to Lawrenceville, took over an existing establishment, and made our own place out of it," said Richard Rattner, the owner.
