Emphasising on the need to attain self-reliance, Union Minister of State for Defence and Tourism Ajay Bhatt Thursday said Sri Lanka was in such a bad economic crisis that its security forces were unable to pay the nominal fees for training exercises in India.
Bhatt, who was speaking at a session on ‘AatmaNirbharta in Defence R&D – Synergistic Approach' at the DefExpo at Gandhinagar, also hailed India's stand on the Russia-Ukraine war. All students, along with their pet animals, who were stuck in the crossfire were rescued safely due to India's position, he said.
