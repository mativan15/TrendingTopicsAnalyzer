FIRST ON FOX: Utah Senate candidate Evan McMullin has paid over $1.6 million to Democratic firms and uses the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue, despite running as an independent to unseat Republican Sen. Mike Lee.

McMullin, who unsuccessfully ran for president as an independent in 2016, has also neglected to pay back over $600,000 in debts incurred during his failed campaign.

Republicans have accused the Democratic Party of trying to deceive voters in Utah by supporting McMullin, who has repeatedly said he is the "Independent" voice and left the GOP in 2016, instead of supporting an explicit Democrat.
