Chinese wine importer Song Tian knows the cost of a trade war firsthand.The Tianjing-based businessman, who used to sell 20,000 bottles of Australian wine a year to Chinese customers, had to quit importing from Australia altogether as the trade relationship between Beijing and Canberra soured.In late 2020, China imposed so-called "anti-dumping" tariffs of up to 218 per cent on Australian wine, killing a market worth a billion dollars a year. Song Tian says Chinese wine importers want to see the tension between Australia and China ease so that they can import from Australia again.
