China's ruling Communist Party is holding its five-year national congress starting Sunday, where Xi Jinping is expected to receive a third term as the uncontested head of the country's party, government and military.

The proceedings surrounding the event are shrouded in secrecy, as is typical in China's authoritarian one-party state.

But the weeklong congress — the 20th in its more than 100-year history — is expected to produce a new set of leaders handpicked by Xi, who faces no term limits and has yet to indicate a successor after a decade in the top spot.
