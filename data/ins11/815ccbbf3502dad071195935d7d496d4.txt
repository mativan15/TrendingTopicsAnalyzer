You've lost your housemate, your family has fled the nest or you've broken up with your partner. Hopefully you're not dealing with all three of these issues right now, but the simple fact is life changes. Which is why Netflix now lets you transfer your carefully pieced together Netflix profile from one account to another. Designed to help those who have a profile on an account owned by someone else, the streaming giant says the feature allows users to move their 'personalised recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games, and other settings' to a new account.
