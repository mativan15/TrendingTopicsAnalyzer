SAN FRANCISCO —

After a summer of national and global climate devastation, Vice President Kamala Harris made a stop at the Cowell Theater on Tuesday to tout Democrats' progress on climate policy just weeks before the midterm elections.

During a wide-ranging conversation with podcasters Leah Stokes and Katharine Wilkinson for their show, 'A Matter of Degrees,' Harris spoke about her Bay Area roots, the Inflation Reduction Act and environmental justice — including how women, low-income communities and communities of color often bear the brunt of harmful policies.
