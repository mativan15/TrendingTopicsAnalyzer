SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares were mostly higher on Wednesday, with U.S. corporate earnings aiding sentiment, while traders awaited British inflation readings later in the day for clues on how hawkish central banks need to be to fight inflation.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.2%, but further gains were capped by slight falls in Chinese shares. China's mainland bluechips lost 0.2% while Hong Kong's Hang Sang index fell 0.1%.

Elsewhere, stocks tracked Wall Street higher.
