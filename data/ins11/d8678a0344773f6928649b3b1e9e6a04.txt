BLM gave $76.8 million in grants between July 2020 and June 2021, according to a recent tax filing.



The Black Lives Matter organization provided $1.4 million in grant money to a nonprofit founded by the mother of Michael Brown. The Michael O.D. Brown We Love Our Sons & Daughters Foundation, founded by Lezley McSpadden, was created shortly after Brown was killed in 2014 by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer.

According to a report from St. Louis Business Journal by way of local outlet KSDK, the date the grant was awarded is not indicated in the BLM tax filing.
