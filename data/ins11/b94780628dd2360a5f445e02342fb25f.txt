Aamir Khan's directorial debut Taare Zameen Par went on to receive both critical and box-office acclaim. The level of appreciation that it saw made it reach to Oscars that year. But strangely, the film that featured Aamir in the role of art teacher Ram Shankar Nikumbh wasn't meant for him. Film writer and filmmaker Amole Gupte wanted the 90s star Akshaye Khanna in the character's shoes. WikiBioAkshaye Khanna in an interview revealed how Gupte wanted him in this film and because Amole didn't know Akashaye, he approached Aamir to connect the dots.
