Oct 16 (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc on Sunday lifted its outlook for business jet deliveries, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought in a wave of first-time users and buyers in the private flying market.

Honeywell forecast up to 8,500 new business jet deliveries worth $274 billion from 2023 to 2032, up 15% from last year's outlook, while the usage in 2022 is expected to climb 9% higher.

Private flying demand boomed during the pandemic as wealthier passengers opted for charter planes due to concerns about exposure to the virus.
