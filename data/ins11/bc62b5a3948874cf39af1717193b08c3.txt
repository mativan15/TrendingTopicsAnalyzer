SAN FRANCISCO — The Warriors converted guards Ty Jerome and Anthony Lamb to two-way contracts, the team announced Tuesday night after its preseason finale against the Nuggets.
The news comes two days after Golden State waived Quinndary Weatherspoon and Lester Quinones, opening up their pair of two-day deals. 
Jerome and Lamb were late additions to the Warriors' camp, signing deals shortly after the team arrived back from its Japan trip earlier this month. 
Jerome averaged four points and 1.5 assists in two preseason games with the Warriors.
