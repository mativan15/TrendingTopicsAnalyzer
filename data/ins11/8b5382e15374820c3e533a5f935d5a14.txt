A smile plays upon the edges of Josh Hazlewood's mouth. This, to be clear, is not a fleeting reaction to some momentary amusement, but a more or less permanent feature. Over the course of a couple of conversations, one in Canberra and the other a few days later in Brisbane, it is almost always there – the smile of a man who seems to have cracked the T20 code.Hazlewood's rise in this format has been very recent and bewilderingly rapid.
