The ‘honesty shops' opened in nearly 15 schools in Ernakulam district of Kerala as part of the Student Police Cadet (SPC) project have gifted some valuable lessons on trust, truth and integrity for students.There is no salesman at these counters and students can drop the money for each item at the collection box kept on a table.
