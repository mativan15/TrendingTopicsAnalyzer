Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) is up 1.5% to trade at $69.80 at last check, but there's several reasons why investors should steer clear of the communications software name for now. The equity is just off an Oct. 13, two-year low of $62.10, and carries an 80.9% year-over-year deficit. Worst yet, it does not look like Twilio stock will be able to bounce back any time soon, given the security is currently within striking distance of a trendline that has historically pressured TWLO lower.

Specifically, Twilio stock is within striking distance of its 40-day moving average, which has acted as pressure for the better part of the last 12 months.
