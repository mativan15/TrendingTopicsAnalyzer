Has Bebe Rexha found the one? The songstress revealed to Ryan Seacrest she's ready to tie the knot with boyfriend Keyan Safyari. "Yes, we are going very strong, but I don't got no ring," Bebe teased when asked about her beau, whom she's been dating since 2020. "I kind of have like my spidey senses that it's on the way, but I could be absolutely wrong and be broken up with," Bebe added when asked if she thinks Keyan is "the one" and could potentially see herself engaged to. "He's very low-key which I love," she added.
