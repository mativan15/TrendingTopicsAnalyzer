The Food and Drug Administration just took its first legal action against companies it says are selling e-cigarettes illegally. After facing criticism for not doing enough to keep illegal vapes off the market, the agency asked the Department of Justice to file for injunctions against six manufacturers — which would bar them from selling the products. 'We will not stand by as manufacturers repeatedly break the law, especially after being afforded multiple opportunities to comply,' Brian King, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement.
