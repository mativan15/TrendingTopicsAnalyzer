Landlords are set to miss out on any additional tax breaks in the Finance Bill this year, dashing hopes that measures would be put in place.With landlords complaining over he impact of an evictions ban this winter, as well as budget day measures, it had been expected some benefit beyond what had already been announced would be included.The budget allowed for an increase in the amount a landlord could shelter from tax that had been paid out on pre-letting expenses, which was doubled to €10,000.However, following a backlash after the budget from landlords who said the measures were insufficient, the Government let it be known that further measures were being considered, including more tax breaks, for the Finance Bill.
