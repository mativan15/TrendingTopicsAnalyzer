A new stackable 'pod' apartment concept is coming to fruition in Los Angeles.

Rather than building the frame of a structure and filling it with apartments, housing construction group Cassette manufactures one-bedroom apartment units that are then stacked up to six stories tall to build a multifamily housing structure in half the time of a typical construction project.

Founded in 2019 but launching products this year as a new approach to modular construction, Cassette aims to prove that housing with sleek and purposeful design can exist without high costs.
