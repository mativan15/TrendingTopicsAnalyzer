Vikings punter Ryan Wright shook off the rough game, when his only chance to punt ended in a 15-yard shank against the Bears, and shined with all of the opportunity in Sunday's win against the Dolphins.

Wright, the undrafted rookie out of Tulane, was called upon to punt 10 times and he maintained a 44.1-yard average while pinning six inside the Dolphins' 20-yard line. The effort earned him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, the league announced Wednesday, marking the first such honor for Wright and second for Vikings specialists this season.
