When policymakers met in Washington D.C. last week, there was plenty of talk about the poor, the middle class, and the rich. In his 1969 poem 'The Poor,' Roberto Sosa writes 'The poor are many /and so/ –impossible to forget.' At that time, over half of the global population lived in extreme poverty ( less than $1.90 per day per person). The World Bank estimates that around 8.5 percent of the world's population (685 million people) could be extremely poor by the end of 2022, and that poverty is now declining at a very slow rate of only 2 percent a year.
