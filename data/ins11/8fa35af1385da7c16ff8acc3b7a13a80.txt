For a team that seems to suffer injuries each and every week, the Los Angeles Rams are hitting their bye at the perfect time. During the week off, the Rams are expected to get much healthier for the second half of the season.
Sean McVay told reporters on Monday that the Rams plan to have Brian Allen, Van Jefferson, Troy Hill, Cobie Durant and Bobby Brown all back after the Week 7 bye, just in time for their next game against the 49ers on Oct. 30.
