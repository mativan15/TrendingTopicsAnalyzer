By Australian Associated Press Published: 22:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 22:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 Former Morrison government minister Dan Tehan has made provocative comments about AFL coaches Alistair Clarkson and Chris Fagan as well as ex-Essendon chief executive Andrew Thorburn. In a freewheeling speech about immigration, public debate and "cancel culture", he suggested the former Hawthorn coaching duo had been treated unfairly after being accused of racism towards Indigenous players. Mr Clarkson is now at North Melbourne and Mr Fagan coaches Brisbane.
