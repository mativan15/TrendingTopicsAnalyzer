Hans Niemann won his third consecutive game at the US Chess Championship after defeating Samuel Sevian in Wednesday's 12th round.
While all games involving Niemann are now closely watched, debated, and analysed, an unusual situation arose during the game against Sevian which showed the players communicating and Niemann, seemingly annoyed.
Sevian picked up Nimeann's King from the board, and it seemed he was trying to fix the King's crown. Niemann protested and asked for his King back.

In the post-game interview, Niemann explained it was a misunderstanding between the players.
