Italian politician Giorgia Meloni, whose party has neo-fascist roots, could be on the verge of forming Italy's first far-right-led government since the end of the Second World War.On Friday, Meloni and her campaign allies met for about 10 minutes with President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale presidential palace. She emerged to tell reporters that the coalition had unanimously indicated to Mattarella that she deserved the mandate to govern.The palace later announced that Mattarella had summoned Meloni back, by herself, to meet with the president late Friday afternoon.
