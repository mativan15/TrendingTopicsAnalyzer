ATLANTA — Overtime Elite kicked off its second season with a slew of future NBA talent hitting the court for three games Thursday evening. The arena had an electric atmosphere with a sold-out crowd and standing room only in some areas around the building. Sitting courtside was the No. 1 pick in the 2022 NBA draft, Paolo Banchero, and four of his Orlando Magic teammates who face the Atlanta Hawks Friday night.

The No. 1 player in the 2025 class, Cameron Boozer, continues to show why he is the best high school prospect in the country, regardless of class and potential top-10 pick in the 2023 NBA draft Amen Thompson put on a flashy display in front the home crowd (twin brother, Ausar, did not play due to a minor ankle injury).
