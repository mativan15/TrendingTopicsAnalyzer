Seventeen people took themselves to local hospitals after a bonfire blazed out of control at a Maple Grove home early Saturday, but more than twice that number may have been injured, the Shawano County Sheriff's Office said Monday.

A statement from the sheriff's office said investigators believe as many as 30 to 40 people were injured in the fire, which involved current and former students of Pulaski Community School District. Police are still gathering information on the severity of the injuries, although they said some of the people were in critical condition and others have been released from hospitals where they sought treatment.
