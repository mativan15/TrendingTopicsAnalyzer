The government has torn up contracts with P&O Ferries over its controversial sacking of staff.
Nearly 800 seafarers had their employment ended en masse as the company looked to save money by hiring agency staff on lower wages.
Workers on new contracts have been hired from abroad and are paid less that the UK living wage.
Ministers have not hid their fury at the move, describing the behaviour as ‘unacceptable' and introducing a new law to stop it happening again.
Trade unions and politicians from all sides have accused the company of putting the safety of ships at risk, with one Labour MP branding P&O a ‘national disgrace'.
