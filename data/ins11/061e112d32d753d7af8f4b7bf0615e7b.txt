President Biden said Wednesday he is tapping another 15 million barrels from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize gasoline prices, sparking accusations of political gamesmanship with the stockpile before the midterms.

Mr. Biden said the barrels, which will be released sometime in December and completing a drawdown of 180 million barrels, will help to insulate the markets from shocks around the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Oil-producing OPEC nations cut production despite Mr. Biden's entreaties to leaders in Saudi Arabia, heaping pressure on the White House to dip into the reserve.
