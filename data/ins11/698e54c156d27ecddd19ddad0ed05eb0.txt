(Submitted by Bruce Mactavish)This summer's devastating forest fires in central Newfoundland — the worst in decades — have prompted the provincial government to hold off on its plans to sell off a damaged water bomber.Transportation Minister Elvis Loveless says officials are now re-evaluating their options and could instead decide to fix the aircraft and put it back into service. "With the challenges of climate change and the forest fires this past summer, I think it's kind of brought that to a level where we need to have, and I think it's necessary, I think the conversation is necessary," Loveless told CBC News in an interview.
