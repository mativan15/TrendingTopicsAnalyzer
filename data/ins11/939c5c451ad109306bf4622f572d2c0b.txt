Meanwhile, in the Democratic Monarchy of the Indian National Congress, a new president will emerge out of the tent today. This will be the first non-Windsor... sorry, Nehru-Gandhi president since kept the seat warm for Sonia Gandhi from 1996 to 1998, the 14th with a non-Nehru, non-Gandhi surname. Does this mean that the Bastille has been stormed? If the past is any indicator, it's not quite the end of aristocracy in the NSGOPTD (Not So Grand Old Party These Days). Monday saw 9,497 Congress members - that's 95% of 9,915 card-carrying members - cast their votes across 68 booths in India.
