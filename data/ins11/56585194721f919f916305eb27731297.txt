Hi Quartz Africa readers,Who has the right to name an African movement? Nigerians don't think it should be a white person living in Europe.Last week, Twitter users turned their attention to Trish Lorenz, a Berlin-based journalist whose book Soro Soke: The Young Disruptors of an African Megacity, co-opts a Yoruba phrase that rallied Nigerians protesting police brutality in Oct. 2020, and uses that movement to profile the changemaking scene in tech and other aspects of Nigerian society.It could have been another foreigner's view of Africa.
