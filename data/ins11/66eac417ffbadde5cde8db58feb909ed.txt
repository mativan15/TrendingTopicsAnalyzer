Actor-producer Dia Mirza, who is best known for her roles in films like Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein, Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd,  Kyun! Ho Gaya Na…, and Thappad, is not only a powerful actor, but also a staunch supporter of sustainability. Not only does she swear by homegrown brands, she has also adopted an environment-friendly lifestyle that has led to her latest venture: taking on as the brand ambassador of Greendigo, a brand manufacturing homegrown, organic cotton apparel for babies.
The 39-year-old, who welcomed her first child — a son — with husband Vaibhav Rekhi last year, talked about her experiences of being a mother, balancing motherhood and work, and the need for sustainability in all areas in an exclusive interaction with indianexpress.
