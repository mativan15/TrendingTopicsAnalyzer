Now hiring: the White House. The Biden administration on Thursday said that White House interns will, for the first time, be paid, starting in the fall. 'Too often, unpaid federal internships have been a barrier to hardworking and talented students and professionals, preventing them from contributing their talents and skills to the country and holding them back from federal career advancement opportunities,' the administration said in a news release. Participants will be paid at a rate of $750 a week, according to the Frequently Asked Questions section of the White House Internship Program site.
