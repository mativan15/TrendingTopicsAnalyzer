LONDON — Following the resignation of Liz Truss as Britain's fourth prime minister in a little over six years, her Conservative party — in power since 2010 — is racing to select a replacement. Candidates have until this coming Monday to put their name forward, but party officials have announced that in order to be considered they will have to show they have the backing of 100 Conservative members of Parliament — around a third of the party's legislators in the lower chamber of Britain's parliament, the House of Commons.
