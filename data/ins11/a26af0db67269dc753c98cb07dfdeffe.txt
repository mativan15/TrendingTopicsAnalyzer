Black advocates and lawmakers are criticizing the GOP over attacks on Democrats regarding the issue of crime that they say carry racial undertones.

A series of ads hitting Democrats as too soft on crime, directed at some white candidates but also Black candidates such as Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin, are using the issue of race to ignite fear, the critics say.

'The narrative is to stir up fear and it is being used against Black and Brown candidates,' said Georgia state Sen.
