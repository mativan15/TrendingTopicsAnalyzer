LONDON - Europe's shares, bonds and major currencies rallied on Monday, helped by relief that's Britain new finance minister had quickly shredded virtually all of the unfunded tax cuts that triggered UK market turmoil this month. Asia's main bourses had struggled overnight but Europe's STOXX 600 made 0.6% and Wall Street futures were up over 1% as the pound and UK government bonds soared in London.
 Britain's new finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced he was reversing "almost all" the tax measures laid out by Prime Minister Liz Truss and his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng just three weeks ago.
