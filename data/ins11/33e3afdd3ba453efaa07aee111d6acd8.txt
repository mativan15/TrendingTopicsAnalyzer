On Friday night, Page was named the recipient of a $50,000 lifetime achievement award, at the Australia Council's First Nations Arts awards – and it could not have come at a more opportune moment.The descendant of the Nunukul people and the Mununjali clan of the Yugambeh nation in south-east Queensland, Page has created more than two dozen works for Bangarra over the past three decades and won many accolades, including being named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).
