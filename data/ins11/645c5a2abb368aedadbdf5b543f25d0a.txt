Edson Souza/iStock via Getty Images Urban One, Inc. (NASDAQ:UONE) recently announced that political advertising later in the year could enhance quarterly revenue. In my view, with very few analysts covering the company, market participants seemed to forget UONE's stable free cash flow margins and the company's portfolio of stations. In my opinion, new products like CLEO TV and perhaps agreements with digital platforms could make the company even more profitable. There are risks from negotiations with agencies that sell UONE's advertising and the cyclicality of UONE's business.
