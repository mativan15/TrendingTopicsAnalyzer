Linus Roache has opened up on the beautiful portrayal of gay love in a time when homosexuality was illegal in 1950s Britain in My Policeman. 
The actor, 58, plays the older Tom Burgess, a gay policeman who enters into a relationship with museum curator Patrick Hazlewood while being married to schoolteacher Marion Taylor, with the younger Tom being played by Harry Styles. 
My Policeman switches between time periods, showing the younger Tom in the 1950s and the older Tom in the 1990s, and how the trio's life evolved over the resulting four decades.
