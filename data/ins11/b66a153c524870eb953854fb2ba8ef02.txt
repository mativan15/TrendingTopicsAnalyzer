Jury finds Fred Weichel was innocent of 1980 slaying that sent him to prison for nearly 36 years.

In a swift and decisive verdict, a Suffolk Superior Court civil jury found Tuesday that Frederick Weichel proved he was innocent of a 1980 slaying in Braintree and ordered the state to pay him $33 million in compensation for the nearly 36 years he spent in prison.
