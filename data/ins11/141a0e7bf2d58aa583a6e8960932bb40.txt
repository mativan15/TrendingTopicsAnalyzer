The trailer of Kannada actor ‘Daali' Dhananjaya's latest movie has impressed everyone. The promo video was also shown during Sunday's episode of Bigg Boss Kannada in presence of the show's host, superstar Sudeep.
Head Bush is a colloquial term for playing the game of coin flipping. It's mostly a game of chance and luck. The film is inspired by real-life incidents that happened in the 1970s. The film tells the rise of gangster MP Jayaraj, who became a nightmare for the ruling dispensation at the time.
