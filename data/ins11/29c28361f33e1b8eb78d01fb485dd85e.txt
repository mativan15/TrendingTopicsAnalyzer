The US Supreme Court has ruled against a Texas law which effectively barred social media companies from moderating user content online, temporarily blocking the legislation as a major legal battle plays out between the state government and Big Tech lobbies.In an opinion handed down on Tuesday, the court said it would grant a preliminary injunction against the Texas attorney general, prohibiting him from enforcing the law in question after a pair of major trade associations sued on allegations that it is 'facially unconstitutional' under the First Amendment.
