PARIS, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today biomaterials innovator MycoWorks announced the opening of its new office in Paris, France.
"Many of MycoWorks' luxury partners are based in Europe," said Matt Scullin, CEO of MycoWorks. "A presence in Paris allows us to work closely with brands as they move towards commercializing products made with Fine Mycelium."
Unlocking new design possibilities, MycoWorks' Fine Mycelium technology engineers mycelium – the infinitely renewable root structure of mushrooms – as it grows, resulting in a natural material that matches the look, feel, and performance of the highest quality animal leathers with low environmental impact.
