Debbie Antonelli is better known as a basketball player and broadcaster, whether at Cary High, N.C. State or at ESPN and CBS. But she's in so many halls of fame now — in the past two years alone, the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame — that it seemed like she might be able to transfer some of her talents to football prognostication, especially with her alma mater on an open date. (She does have other ACC loyalties, though.)

The bar keeps getting higher and higher, with 99.
