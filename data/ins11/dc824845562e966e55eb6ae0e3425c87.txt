Some have been calling for a recession as early as this year. Seemingly, there is little ‘good' news for long-only investors, especially in REITs. However, we see several bright spots. Already, two REITs have agreed to takeovers by Blackstone (BX) in April, and two more REITs are in play today. While the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield has certainly hurt the current prices of public equity REITs, private equity giants such as Blackstone have a mandate to invest in commercial real estate as holding cash is dilutive to their cost of capital.
