Coinbase announced today that it will extend its hiring freeze and revoke accepted offers from some candidates who haven't started their roles yet.

The third-largest crypto exchange by volume, Coinbase began to slow hiring two weeks ago, but this move is more drastic.

"Adapting quickly and acting now will help us to successfully navigate this macro environment and emerge even stronger, enabling further healthy growth and innovation," Chief People Officer L.J. Brock wrote in a company memo, shared publicly to Coinbase's blog.
