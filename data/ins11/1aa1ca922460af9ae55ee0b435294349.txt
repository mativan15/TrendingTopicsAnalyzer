It was the British libel trial sensation of the decade: football WAGS Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney went to court over a sting operation conducted by Rooney, and a viral social media post, that accused Vardy of leaking her private details to the press. Now the trial is set to come to the West End as a play titled Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial, for one night only. Further details about the location and date are yet to be confirmed.The verbatim play will be directed by Lisa Spirling (Wolfie, Describe The Night), adapted from seven days of High Court transcripts by Liv Hennessy (who was a Paines Plough's Women's Prize for Playwriting finalist) and produced by Eleanor Lloyd, who produced the five-year-running Agatha Christie's Witness For The Prosecution adaption and is president of the Society of London Theatre.
