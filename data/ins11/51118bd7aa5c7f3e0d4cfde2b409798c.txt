Brett_Hondow/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Just Eat Takeaway (OTC:JTKWY) may need to write down £5 billion ($6.3 billion) from the sale of Grubhub. Grubhub, which Just Eat acquired for $7.3 billion last year, may fetch as low £1 billion in a possible sale after failing to receive significant interest from strategic buyers, according a report in The Times on Saturday, which cited multiple unidentified sources. A number of private equity firms are said to have expressed interest in Grubhub, though it's not known if its serious, the report said.
