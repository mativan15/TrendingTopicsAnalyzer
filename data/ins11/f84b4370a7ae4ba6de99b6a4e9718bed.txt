Kurt Busch announced Saturday in his hometown of Las Vegas that he will not race full-time in 2023 after suffering from concussion-like symptoms since this summer.

Busch, the 2004 NASCAR Cup champion and 2017 Daytona 500 winner, was injured during a qualifying crash at Pocono Raceway in July and didn't get behind the wheel again this season.

The 44-year-old, who has been racing on the Cup circuit since 2001, was diagnosed with a concussion. The next month, he relinquished his spot in the 10-race playoff.
