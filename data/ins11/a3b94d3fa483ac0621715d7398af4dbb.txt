In the first few days of his new restaurant's operation, Nicholas Soike doesn't hesitate to point out a key loophole in the new Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse that opened last Friday in the Union Trust Building downtown.

Yes, diners should expect to typically wear business attire. But on evenings when the Pittsburgh Penguins play home games at PPG Paints Arena, Del Frisco's staff is not going to turn away jersey-wearing hockey fans.

After a full house in a middle-of-the-week evening, Soike sounded satisfied with how the new high-end steakhouse is being received so far.
