This time of the year has frequently caused trouble for the GAA because of the — ehhh — less inhibited behaviour of those involved in club matches. So it has been in recent weeks: one dismal episode after another.Then by way of grim culmination, a child was attacked by an adult in Thurles on Saturday. Presumably when his club arrived in Dr Morris Park for the Munster Council underage blitz, they had in mind a rapid sequence of enjoyable matches rather than London in 1940.The gardaí are involved, which is shameful and embarrassing in itself, and so too is the provincial council, which has appointed a subcommittee to investigate what happened and also to ascertain whether the event was properly organised.
