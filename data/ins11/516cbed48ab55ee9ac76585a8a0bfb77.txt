Genteel lines for the BMW X1 are out. Bold, chunky lines for the all-new third-generation 2023 BMW X1 are in. Dimensions are up just a touch, length and height extended by 1.7 inches to 177.2 inches and 64.6 inches, respectively, while width grows by less than an inch to 72.6 inches. Track and wheelbase also expand by less than an inch, with the track now 62.3 inches front and back, and the wheelbase out to 106 inches. The brawnier lines exaggerate those minor measurements, though.
