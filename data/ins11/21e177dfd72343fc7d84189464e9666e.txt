LISELOTTE SABROE / AP Feelings of disgust, anger and even fatigue have gripped a portion of young people – a cohort that's generally well-educated and committed to environmental protection – as the World Cup approaches, which will take place in Qatar from November 20 to December 18. Whether they are football team supporters, regular players, sports enthusiasts, or climate activists, many young French people feel disgusted by a competition tainted by scandals of dead workers on construction sites, the environmental disaster of constructing air-conditioned stadiums in the middle of the desert, the neglect of women and minority rights, or by daily plane trips to ferry supporters from other Gulf countries.
