Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down as Chief Operating Officer of Meta after 14 years as one of Mark Zuckerberg's top lieutenants at the company. She will remain on the company's board of directors.

In a post on Facebook, she said she plans to depart Meta in the fall and that "over the next few months, Mark and I will transition my direct reports." Javier Olivan, currently Meta's Chief Growth Officer, will take on the COO role, but his role "will be different from what Sheryl has done," according to a post from Zuckerberg.
