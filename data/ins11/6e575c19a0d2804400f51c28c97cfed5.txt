Sky Zone trampoline parks in the St. Louis region are reaching new heights, in every sense of the word.

Two locations of the Los Angeles-based indoor trampoline park chain, located at 631 Gravois Road in Fenton and at 10850 Lincoln Trail in Fairview Heights, recently expanded to include new attractions like air courts, multi-court sporting arenas with an air-filled floor that allow for tricks and stunts, and drop slides, slides that send guests free-falling.

'We're constantly innovating and putting new attractions in,' said Bron Launsby, a Sky Zone franchisee and the owner of the Fenton and Fairview Heights parks.
