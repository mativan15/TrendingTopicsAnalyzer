(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc said on Friday the chief executive officer of its worldwide consumer business, Dave Clark, was leaving the company after 23 years to pursue other opportunities.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to be ready with an update on Clark's succession over the next few weeks. Clark's last day at work will be July 1.

Clark, who joined Amazon in 1999 right after graduating from his MBA program, has led teams that designed fulfillment centers and transportation networks.
