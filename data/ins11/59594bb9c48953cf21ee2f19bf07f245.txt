D﻿undee United defender Kieran Freeman says there is plenty to improve on for the Tannadice side as they look to go four games unbeaten in the Premiership. L﻿iam Fox's side crashed out of the League Cup on Tuesday against Kilmarnock, but have won two of their last three league games. 'It was a really good week last week. We couldn't quite finish it off with getting a win up at Ross County, that would've been an excellent week," said the academy graduate. 'There is so much to improve on, we've lost a game and won a game so it's not perfect but we are gradually getting more towards where we want to be and hopefully we can take that into Saturday.
