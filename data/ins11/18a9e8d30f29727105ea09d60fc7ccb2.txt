As the Capital gears up for another round of municipal elections, union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday targeted the Aam Aadmi Party, asking people to choose if they want to make the city 'AAP-nirbhar' (dependent on the AAP) or 'Aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant). He blamed ruling AAP government for adopting 'second-class behaviour' towards the municipal corporations by withholding funds worth ₹40,000 crore to render them dysfunctional.The three MCDs, now merged into one, were all controlled by the BJP.
