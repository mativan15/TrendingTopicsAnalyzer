The two women hoping to become the next leader of the Saskatchewan NDP held their first debate on Thursday in Moose Jaw.

MLA Carla Beck (Regina Lakeview) and Saskatoon lawyer Kaitlyn Harvey discussed topics ranging from reconciliation to education, affordability and job creation.

In February, NDP Leader Ryan Meili announced that he would be stepping down.
