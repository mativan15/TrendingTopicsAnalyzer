Britain, among the leading donors to the poorest nations, has slashed its foreign aid contributions, imperiling global progress against infectious diseases, famine and climate change, as well as efforts to improve girls' education and sexual and reproductive health.

Since 2020, the country has cut its human rights work by 80 percent, funds for some global health programs by more than 80 percent and humanitarian aid to Yemen, Syria and other nations by 60 percent.

The consequences, especially for the struggling post-Covid economies of many low-income countries, have been catastrophic, experts said.
