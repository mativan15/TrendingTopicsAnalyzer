Oct. 16—Eagle is the highest rank a Boy Scout can achieve, and the culmination is a community service project in which the Scout takes the lead in organizing, gathering materials and a work crew, and executing his vision.

At Troop 239 in Penn Township's Claridge neighborhood, this summer produced a whole flock of Eagles.

Zach Posner, Aidan Kelly, Nathaniel Homan, Paul Mills and Dominick Morelli completed their Eagle projects over the summer.

"That doesn't usually happen in just one troop," said Mills, 15, a junior at Penn-­Trafford High School.
