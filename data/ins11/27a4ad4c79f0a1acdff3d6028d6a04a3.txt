SEATTLE – As the number of violent robberies at cannabis stores across the country soars, ironically it's some Democratic Party leaders standing in the way of legislation that would make pot shops a less appealing target.The S.A.F.E. Banking Act has bipartisan support and has passed in the U.S. House six times, but it's been blocked in the Senate by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who said last summer that he would continue to oppose it until lawmakers passed more sweeping reforms.
