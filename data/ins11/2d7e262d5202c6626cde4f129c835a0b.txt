Lenovo has created a laptop with a display that can expand upwards, giving the user more screen real estate.

The company showed off the device during its Lenovo Tech World event on Tuesday, where the PC maker also debuted a smartphone that features its own expandable screen.

Lenovo created the products using rollable screen technology. The flexible OLED panels can be rolled up inside a smartphone or laptop like a scroll, and then unfurled to expand the screen.

Lenovo uploaded a video showing the effect in action.
