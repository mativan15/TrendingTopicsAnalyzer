BBC Breakfast favourite Naga Munchetty was left red-faced on Friday after she was snubbed by the famous Larry the Cat outside Downing Street. The presenter was live on air this morning reporting on the latest in a series of car-crash moments for the Conservative government after PM Liz Truss  resigned yesterday after just 44 days in office. As the country was sent into another political and economic spin, Naga turned her attention to a more permanent resident of Number 10 - Larry. The 15-year-old Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office has been the only consistent figure on Downing Street in recent years, having seen a whopping four Prime Ministers come and go during his years at the famous address.
