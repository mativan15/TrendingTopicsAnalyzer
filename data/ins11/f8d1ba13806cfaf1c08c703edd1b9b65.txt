Besides love stories, one of the recurring themes in films shown at Cannes this year is overcoming economic hardship, by any means possible. Two films in the main competition show very different families, from Iran and South Korea, who come up with ingenious and precarious plans to make ends meet.

'Leila's Brothers' by Iranian director Saeed Roustaee is an intimate portrait of a family, where humiliation plays a key role, both within the family structure and within society itself.

Leila, played by Taraneh Alidoosti has four adult brothers, who are all in and out of work, scraping by for a living.
