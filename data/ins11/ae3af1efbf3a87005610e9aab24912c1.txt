At the beginning of April, a cheerful commercial was broadcast on various media in Japan. In it, a girl goes to a store to buy the same pair of red-and-white socks her friend is wearing but becomes disappointed when she finds they're sold out. A sensor in the store captures the expression on her face and notifies the staff, who respond to the situation quickly and put the girl at ease. In the meantime, the girl's back order travels through a 'corridor of light' to reach the sock factory, where robots and people work together to produce the socks in efficient, flowing movements.
