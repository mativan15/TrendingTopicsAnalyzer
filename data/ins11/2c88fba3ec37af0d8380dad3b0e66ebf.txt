US President Joe Biden said plans by the UK to cut taxes for the highest earners were a "mistake."

Liz Truss's government was forced into a U-turn on $50 billion of unfunded tax cuts this week.

Biden called the reversal "predictable" after markets reacted negatively to the plans.

Joe Biden hit out at the UK government's economic policy that would have given tax cuts to the rich after Liz Truss made an embarrassing U-turn this week.

The US president told reporters the prime minister's climbdown on a multi-billion dollar tax cut plan was "predictable," in a rare comment on British politics.
