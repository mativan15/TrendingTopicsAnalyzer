Dear Prudence,  I've always had a very chaotic relationship with my mom. It's taken me years to acknowledge that she was verbally and emotionally abusive to us as children. I recently got remarried. My mom always pitches a fit right before any special event in my life. We opted instead for a small destination wedding and a short engagement to limit the potential for chaos.
