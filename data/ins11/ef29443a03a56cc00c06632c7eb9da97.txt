The BC Wildfire Service is forecasting a slow start to the wildfire season with cooler and wetter conditions in June. The fire hazard is expected to remain low through the early summer in many parts of the province. However, some regions are expected to experience drier-than-normal patterns, including southern Cariboo, Thompson-Okanagan and Rocky Mountain Trench. The province saw one of its worst seasons on record last year due to drought-like conditions and a deadly heatwave. This year, the BCFWS says the longer-range forecast indicates temperatures will begin to climb to above-seasonal levels in late July and August.
