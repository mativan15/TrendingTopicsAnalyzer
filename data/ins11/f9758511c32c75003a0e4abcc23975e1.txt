With its very own warm and fuzzy acronym, HUGS is the latest addition to a complex set of busy balls being juggled over the future growth and shape of Hamilton. The draft Hamilton Urban Growth Strategy – looking at the way the city will grow over the next 50 years - went out for public consultation Tuesday. It aims to keep the city as a great place to live, ensure health and well-being for its residents, attract growth, and support the environment, particularly the Waikato River. HUGS comes hard on the heels of a draft Place Change 9 (PC9) covering protection of historic heritage and natural environment issued in July, and a draft Plan Change 12 (PC12) to give effect to new Government housing intensification rules sent out in August.
