Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis has issued a response after it was announced that next year's festival ticket will cost £340.
It was announced on Monday that festival enthusiasts will have to pay £335 plus a £5 booking fee for standard tickets, with £50 as a deposit and the balance due by the first week of April.
The last general sale in 2019 was priced at £265 plus a £5 booking fee for what should have been the 2020 festival. However, that year was cancelled twice due to Covid-19.
After the news was confirmed fans expressed their fury at the eye-watering prices on social media, with some threatening to boycott the annual festival due to the current cost of living crisis.
