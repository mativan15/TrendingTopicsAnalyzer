All that offers high returns, is not really gold. Around 20 people, including women, found this out the hard way. They have gone to the Police Commissioner to complain about a person they claim has cheated of more than Rs 12 crore in all. The complainants said the man, Kenchappa Hosamani, had promised them high returns on the investments made with him. According to the complaint to the Police Commissioner, Hosamani's victims are not only in Bengaluru, but also in other states. They said that Hosamani and his wife Shruthi Kenchappa claimed to be directors of various companies and claimed that they were into crypto business and foreign share trading.
