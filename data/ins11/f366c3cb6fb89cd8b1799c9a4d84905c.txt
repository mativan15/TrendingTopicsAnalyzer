The largest cryptocurrency climbed for a third day, breaking above $30,000. It jumped as much as 4.4% to $30,441.43. While Bitcoin's dominance has been increasing recently, some altcoins were outperforming, with Avalanche up 6.6% and Cardano gaining 8.6%.

Bitcoin has been stymied in recent months as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have pivoted toward rate-hiking cycles amid stubbornly high inflation.
