Information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the cold case killing of a 19-year-old Fresno resident could be worth more than $50,000 in reward money following an effort from Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Kyrin Wright was shot to death about 8 p.m. May 27, 2021, outside the Parc Grove Commons apartment complex near Fresno Street and Clinton Avenue, police said.

Officers found Wright near a playground in the middle of the complex, having suffered a gunshot wound to his upper body.

Homicide detectives learned Wright was inside the parking lot of the apartment complex when an unknown suspect fired multiple shots at him, police said.
