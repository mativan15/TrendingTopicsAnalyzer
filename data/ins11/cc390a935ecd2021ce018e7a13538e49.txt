naphtalina/iStock via Getty Images Stock index futures point to a lower open Tuesday following a strong performance last week that broke historically long losing streaks for the major averages. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) -1.5%, S&P futures (SPX) -0.8% and Dow futures (INDU) -1% are lower. Rates are higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield up 7 basis points to 2.82% and the 2-year up 5 basis points to 2.55%. "We think we're through the worst of markets being surprised by inflation and policy," Morgan Stanley strategist Andrew Sheets wrote.
