Climate campaigners are taking the UK government to court over the country's plans for reaching net-zero carbon emissions. They argue that the government has broken UK climate laws, in a trio of cases due to be heard at the High Court of Justice in London.
Launched last October, the Net Zero Strategy laid out a sweeping series of measures to meet the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero goal, including backing for a large nuclear power plant and a mandate on electric car sales.
