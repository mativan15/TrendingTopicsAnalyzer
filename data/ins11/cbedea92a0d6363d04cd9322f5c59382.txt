Extracting cannabis oil at X-Tract in VermonthX-Tract
In Vermont, newly-legal recreational cannabis is a 'craft industry' said Trevor Schell, chief executive of X-Tract, which specializes in cannabis oil extraction. The business ecosystem there is mostly small farms and start-ups that 'don't have the resources' to drive up and down the state selling their wares to dispensaries he said. That's why his company, which takes in dried cannabis and works with brands to produce pre-rolls and edibles, has built relationships with retailers.
