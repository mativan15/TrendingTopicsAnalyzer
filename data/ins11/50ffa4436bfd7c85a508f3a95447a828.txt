A Turkish defence contractor has agreed to donate the $6 million (£4.7m) armed unmanned drone that Lithuania was crowdfunding in support of Ukraine's war against Russian invaders.The donation of the Bayraktar TB2 drone is part of what appears to be a tightening of security and defence ties between Ankara and Vilnius ahead of a critical Nato summit in Madrid later this month.'It is unbelievable but Turkey just agreed to give the Bayraktar that Lithuania gathered money for free!' Lithuania defence minister Arvydas Anusauskas wrote Thursday in a tweet sprinkled with capital letters, exclamation points and emojis.
