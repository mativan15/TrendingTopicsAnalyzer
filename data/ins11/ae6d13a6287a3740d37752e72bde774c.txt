The Indiana Pacers closed out preseason play with a whimper. They fell at home to the Houston Rockets 122-114. Indiana's defense looked atrocious all night.

By halftime, the Rockets already had 81 points. They were 14/24 from long range, had attempted 15 free throws, and had just five turnovers. The Pacers provided little defensive resistance, and they were punished for it.

"I think tonight was on the starters. We let them get into the game way too easy, way too comfortable," Pacers center Myles Turner said after the game.
