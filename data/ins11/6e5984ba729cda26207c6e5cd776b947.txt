While much of the focus on the Penn State quarterback situation is justifiably placed on what to look for in 2022 with the return of Sean Clifford and the addition of Class of 2022 quarterback Drew Allar, a look a little deeper into the future shows Penn State's quarterback situation could be in steady shape for years to come. Penn State held its White Out Camp this weekend, and a future Penn State quarterback is receiving some good reviews for his performance.

Marcus Stokes, a four-star quarterback in the Class of 2023, attended the Penn State camp and put on an impressive show.
