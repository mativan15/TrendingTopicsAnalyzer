By Xavier Fontdegloria Manufacturing activity in the New York State shrunk in October for the third straight month, a sign of persisting headwinds for the factory sector amid slowing demand, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed Monday. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey's general business conditions index decreased to minus 9.1 in October from minus 1.5 in September. This is below the minus 5 consensus forecast from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The indicator, which is based on a survey of manufacturing firms in the New York area, signals factory activity fell at a sharper pace compared with the previous month as the reading came in further below zero.
