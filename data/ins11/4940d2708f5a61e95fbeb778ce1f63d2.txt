Nick Robertson and Victor Mete plan to have family around at the Scotiabank Arena when they play their first regular season games with the Maple Leafs this season.

Mete's from Woodbridge, so buying tickets for the clan might get a bit pricey. Robertson doesn't have such a worry. His family is his brother, Jason, and he'll be playing for the Dallas Stars.

'I played against him last year, so now I'll try not to think about playing him,' said Robertson. 'I'll just focus on what I can do.'

It's fair to say Robertson has somewhat of a chip on his shoulder.
