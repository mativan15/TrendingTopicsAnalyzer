The Florida Gators host their Southeastern Conference peers, the LSU Tigers, on Saturday, Oct. 15, for Week 7 of college football, and if you're wondering how you can watch the action live, you've come to the right place.
Florida holds the all-time edge in the series with a 33-32-3 mark, though LSU has won the last three meetings as well as nine of the last 12 matchups since 2010. This streak included the infamous shoe-throw game in 2020, when the Gators collapsed at home in the fourth quarter to fall, 37-34.
