PIOMBINO, Italy, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Italy is invoking the need for energy security in the face of Russian supply cuts to rush through in a matter of months a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal – a process that would normally take years due to local objections and permitting.A preliminary go-ahead for the 5 billion cubic metre capacity (bcm) project in the port of Piombino in the central region of Tuscany, could come as soon as Friday, people close to the matter told Reuters.Such a big-scale project will help Italy avert a supply crunch it could otherwise face next winter, but keep it hooked on gas for longer, slowing down its transition to renewable energy.
