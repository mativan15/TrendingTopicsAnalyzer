Space travel of late has been the stuff of big, splashy headlines. Of Jeff Bezos sending 90-year-old William Shatner (who famously played Captain James T. Kirk on the original Star Trek) to the very edge of space atop one of Bezos' Blue Origin rockets. Of Elon Musk, head of SpaceX, speaking openly about missions to Mars while also doing his part to further space tourism. Of Richard Branson announcing it would cost someone a cool $450,000 to book a flight on one of his Virgin Galactic voyages.
Commercial space flight is indeed taking off.
