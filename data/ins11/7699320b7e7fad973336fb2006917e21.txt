Shares of Facebook parent Meta fell nearly 3% Wednesday following news that Sheryl Sandberg is leaving the social media giant after a remarkable 14-year career. But we believe the pullback presents a great buying opportunity for investors. While we will miss the leadership of Sandberg — the company's chief operating officer and No. 2 to CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg — it doesn't change our investment thesis. We are happy with the direction of the company under Zuckerberg, and remain highly encouraged about the recent improvements made to Reels, its rival to TikTok.
