As Wall Street starts another month with further volatility in the markets, Credit Suisse identified some "dividend aristocrats" that could offer investors steady returns. Analysts at the investment bank maintained an overweight rating on dividend stocks, even as they moved down to neutral on value stocks, according to a Friday report from the investment bank. They believe that value is currently overbought, as they expect most of the increases in yields for U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, are in.
