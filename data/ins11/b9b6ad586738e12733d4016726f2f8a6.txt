Dick Wolf's Chicago franchise is NBC's most reliable audience magnet, and that fact proved out again in the seven-day ratings for Oct. 3-9. Chicago Fire was the second most-watched primetime show of the week on the broadcast networks and tied for the lead among adults 18-49 after a week of delayed viewing (excluding football in both cases). Franchise mates Chicago PD and Chicago Med also made the top 10 in both measures. Fire and PD each recorded 1.2 ratings in the key ad demographic of adults 18-49, tying with The Simpsons (which had an NFL lead-in) for the top spot among entertainment shows.
