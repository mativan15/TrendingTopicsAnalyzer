The second season of 'Russian Doll' sees Nadia (Natasha Lyonne, who also serves as the show's co-creator and showrunner) stepping back in time to the 1980s via a subway car. As posters of 'Cats' and film 'Sophie's Choice' appear, Nadia glimpses a newspaper. The year is 1982.
Not only does Nadia time travel, but she also finds herself in the body of her pregnant mother, Lenora, aka Nora, played by Chloë Sevigny.
Diane Lederman stepped in as production designer, taking over from Michael Bricker, to build the '80s world, including Lenora's pink apartment.
