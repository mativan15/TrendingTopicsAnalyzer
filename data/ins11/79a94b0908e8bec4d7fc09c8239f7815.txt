London's Transport Commissioner Andy Byford said: 'We are extremely disappointed that the RMT has announced strike action on the London Underground and Overground on 3 November. We have not yet received official notification of this action from the RMT. 
'We call on them to withdraw this action and continue to engage with us and Arrival Rail London, operator of the London Overground, to avoid disruption to our customers.
'On the London Underground dispute, there are no changes to TfL pensions as a result of this recent submission and no proposals for change.
