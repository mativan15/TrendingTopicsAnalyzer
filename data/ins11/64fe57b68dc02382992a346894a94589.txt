A resurfaced clip from 2018 of Stacey Solomon questioning the role of the Royal Family has been circulating on social media amid the fervent Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations

The Loose Women paid tribute to the Queen on Thursday to kick off the long weekend of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations to mark her 70 years on the throne.

Loose Women Gloria Hunniford, Linda Robson, Jane Moore and Kaye Adams were decked out in regal aplomb in the studio as they dressed up as the Queen through the ages.
