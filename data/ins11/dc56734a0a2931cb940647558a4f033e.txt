Oct. 20—Decatur City Schools Superintendent Michael Douglas told the school board he wants to relocate students from 18 pre-kindergarten classrooms scattered around the city, all of which are full, to a centralized pre-K center that provides more rigorous instruction.

Douglas said at Tuesday evening's board meeting that federal pandemic-related funding makes the establishment of a new pre-K center feasible.

"We have $10 million in federal funds now," Douglas said. "The money has to be spent on something that is COVID-19 related.
