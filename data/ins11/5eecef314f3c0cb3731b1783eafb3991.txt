Is your communication safe? Are you certain? Does the tool you use encrypt and anonymize your discussion and offer self-destructive chats, not require signup, not use metadata, run without a centralized server and add private file sharing?
Chances are pretty slim that the service you use can't match those privacy  features. Speek!, on the other hand, does.
This new service is a cross-platform chat tool that is open-source, free to use and secured by the Tor network.
