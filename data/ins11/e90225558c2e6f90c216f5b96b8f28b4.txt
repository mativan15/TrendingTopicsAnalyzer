When influential grocer Whole Foods Market Inc. summons your company to make a product, saying no is out of the question.

That was the enviable position Tacodeli Holdings found itself in 2017, and the company's consumer packaged goods presence has only grown since.

'I recognize there's a lot of really good products out there that would love to just have an audience with Whole Foods, would love to even just be a consideration and love to have five minutes of their time to try to introduce them to a product,' said Eric Wilkerson, Tacodeli co-founder and co-CEO.
