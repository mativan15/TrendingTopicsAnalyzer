Marshall brings 30 years of experience from BCG, JP Morgan Chase and Mckinsey.

Marshall's expertise will be instrumental in helping Flutterwave continue to meet global risk management and compliance standards for merchants and partners as the business scales.

Following its Series D funding in February 2022, which valued the company at over $3 billion, Flutterwave continues to expand globally as Africa shifts to digital solutions for cross-border payments.

Marshall's appointment as Senior Advisor follows other significant additions as the company continues to pursue aspirations to scale across the globe.
