The Denver Broncos say they're not making a change at running back, but fantasy football managers should be proactive just in case.

Broncos starter Melvin Gordon has fumbled four times this year, and 11 times in 37 games overall with the Broncos since 2020. In 104 career games, Gordon has 25 fumbles on his resume.

Gordon did not fumble against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 6, but Denver's coaching staff benched at halftime on Monday in favor of Latavius Murray, who has fumbled nine times in 124 career games.
