One of the largest CPA firms in Buffalo will have its first female managing partner as of next year.

Lumsden & McCormick LLP appointed Sara Dayton, who will assume the position Jan. 1. She succeeds John Schiavone, who's been with the firm more than 30 years and in that role since 2010.

Dayton, who leads the firm's auditing and accounting department and the governmental services group, will soon oversee day-to-day management of the firm, along with business development and strategy. She's been with Lumsden & McCormick for more than 10 years and is the first woman to hold the position in the firm's 70-year history.
