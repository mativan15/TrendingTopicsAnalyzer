Susan Freeman-Smith, a Ratcliff resident, has found her mother's birth family thanks to a 23andMe DNA kit. She met one of her aunts last fall and she recently met her uncle and his family in Wisconsin for the first time.

Freeman-Smith's mother was adopted as a child when her parents were stationed in the military in Parmesans, Germany. The family had assumed her mother was 100% German.

Freeman-Smith was always curious about her mother's family, so she decided to purchase a 23andMe DNA kit in 2014.
