It sure looks like it'll be another two-team race in the English Premier League in 2022-23.

Manchester City and Liverpool have odds significantly better than anyone else to win next year's league title. And the reigning champions are at better than even money to win the league for the fifth time in six seasons.

City is at an incredibly short -160 at BetMGM to win the league again. The Citizens won the 2021-22 campaign on the final day of the season with three goals in six minutes to turn a two-goal deficit to Aston Villa into a one-goal lead and a win while Liverpool beat Wolves.
