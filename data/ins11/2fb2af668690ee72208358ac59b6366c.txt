TUESDAY, Oct. 18, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- Substantial numbers of kids and teens are being tracked, lured and sexually abused online, and adult strangers aren't always the perps.

In many cases, it's friends and dating partners who are doing the grooming, a new study shows.

The prevailing image of online sexual abuse is an older predator who seeks out kids online, but the researchers said that's not really the case.

'The majority of perpetrators are offline acquaintances,' said study author David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, in Durham.
