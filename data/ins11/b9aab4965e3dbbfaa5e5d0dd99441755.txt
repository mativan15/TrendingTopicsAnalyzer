A fledgling salsa enterprise is marking a milestone as it prepares for a regional 'future food' showcase. Tex-As Salsas is taking jars from its 500th batch to the inaugural Food Innovation Big Day Out on Friday. The event is intended to showcase food innovation in Manawatū, hosted by Food HQ, with almost 30 exhibitors taking part. One of them is Tex-As Salsas, a venture founded by Houston, USA, native Kari Highstead in Palmerston North in 2019.
