The EU move to partially ban imports of Russian oil hurt Moscow's ability to finance its war in Russia, Ukraine officials have said. 
The Ukraine Foreign Ministry welcomed the news of the deal, which came late last night and which will see the bloc aim to cut 90pc of Russia's crude imports by the end of the year. 
"We expect that by the end of 2022 Russia will lose up to 90pc of its oil exports to Europe. This means that the Russian military machine will not receive tens of billions of dollars for the war against Ukraine.
