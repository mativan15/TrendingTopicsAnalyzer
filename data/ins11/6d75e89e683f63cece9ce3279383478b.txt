As the T20 World Cup started in Geelong on Sunday, the eight teams that have automatically qualified for the Super 12s gathered in Brisbane for their final warm-up matches, games that some consider a vital part of their preparations and others little more than an inconvenience.Most teams play two games, an idea that England, despite some pressure from the ICC, simply refused to entertain.
