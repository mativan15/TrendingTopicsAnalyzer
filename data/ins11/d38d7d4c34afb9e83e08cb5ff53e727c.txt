Investing.com-- Asian stocks fell on Monday as concerns over U.S. curbs on Chinese semiconductor imports were worsened by a report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was planning to drop Chinese chips, while fears of sharp interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve also weighed.

China's bluechip Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 index fell 0.4%, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 0.1%. Japanese financial daily Nikkei reported on Monday that iPhone maker Apple Inc has paused plans to use memory chips from China's Yangtze Memory Technologies in its products.
