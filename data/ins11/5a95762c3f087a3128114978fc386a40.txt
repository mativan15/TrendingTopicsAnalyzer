A game day raffle winner at FedEx Field said Wednesday that the check he received from the Washington Commanders had bounced.

The team said by the afternoon that they had resolved the issue and paid the fan.

A man named Drew called into The Team 980 sports radio station's Russell & Medhurst show to tell the hosts that the $14,822 check from the Washington Football Team Charitable Foundation was no good, according to a report on the station's website.

Drew in Rockville (the fan that actually won the 50/50 raffle) just called in & confirmed in his words that a check for $14 K bounced.
