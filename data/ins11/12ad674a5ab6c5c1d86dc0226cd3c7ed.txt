OTTAWA—Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's call for her ministers to tighten their belts won support from an important voice Thursday — the former governor of the Bank of Canada.

Mark Carney, however, also said what Freeland still refuses to say — Canada is heading into a recession.

And in these circumstances, he told a Senate committee studying inflation, it's important the Bank of Canada and federal budget-makers don't work at cross-purposes.

In other words, the government can't be spending more money even as the central bank is raising its rates — which it's widely expected to do next week.
