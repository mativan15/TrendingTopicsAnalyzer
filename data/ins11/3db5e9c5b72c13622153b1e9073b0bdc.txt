Stocks jumped on Monday, recouping some recent losses, after Bank of America reported strong earnings and Britain announced a reversal of Prime Minister Liz Truss's tax plan.

Monday's recovery was the latest in a series of volatile movements in stocks and bonds. The S&P 500 rose 2.8 percent in early trading on Monday, after falling more than 2 percent on Friday, which followed a rise of more than 2 percent on Thursday. The benchmark index remains down more than 23 percent since the beginning of the year.
