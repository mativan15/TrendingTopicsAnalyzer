As his term in office winds down, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has kept a low profile. But he spoke at a recent downtown luncheon and offered some advice to the next mayor — whether it's Karen Bass or Rick Caruso. 'The top three issues for my successor — it's housing, it's housing and it's housing,' Garcetti said. 'There is no issue more important than housing.' Bass is leading Caruso by a significant margin in the polls, and so she in particular has been getting a lot of advice lately. Among her most influential supporters is Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul who has spent $1.
