In November 1914, when Benito Mussolini, then prominent as a revolutionary socialist, tried to mobilize popular opinion for Italy to intervene in World War I, he gave the name 'Autonomous Fasci of Revolutionary Action' to his disparate supporters. The term 'fascio' (plural 'fasci') was then common in Italy's political lexicon, in its core meaning of 'bundle', to denote a loosely-organized group grounded in a common ideology. It was the workers' movement in Sicily of the mid-1890s that firmly cemented the word 'fascio' into everyday use.
