Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård is one of the many big names in Hollywood who has made the decision to separate his work from his personal life. However, it's publicly known that the "It" star has been in a long-term relationship with fellow Swedish actor Alida Morberg (via Distractify). It's also public knowledge that the two are parents to a daughter, as Skarsgård once mentioned in an interview with Stephen Colbert, to the surprise of many viewers (via YouTube).
