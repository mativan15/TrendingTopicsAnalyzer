PATNA: With no support from the state government and lack of sponsorship, the differently-abled basketball players from Bihar, who began their campaign at the East Zone Wheelchair Basketball tournament in Patna on Monday, were forced to use ordinary wheelchairs instead of customised basketball wheelchairs, said the president of the Wheelchair Basketball Association of Bihar.'We could not get the all-important basketball wheelchairs because our request for part-sponsorship is pending with the social welfare department since January 2019,' said Deepak Kumar Singh, a state player and a recipient of the Bihar Khel Samman 2020-21, also the president of the Wheelchair Basketball Association of Bihar.
