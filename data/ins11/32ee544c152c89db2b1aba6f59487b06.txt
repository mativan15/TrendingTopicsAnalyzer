Please advise.--Dwip Jit We always ask our readers to choose mutual funds based on their goals, investment horizon and risk profile. Are you investing for a long-term goal? If yes, you can invest in an equity mutual fund or a scheme that will invest in stocks. Next, are you a conservative equity investor who wants to grow money without too much volatility? If yes, you can invest in large cap mutual funds.
