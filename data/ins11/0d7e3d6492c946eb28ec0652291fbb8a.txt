OPINION: Student debt is the latest hot button issue over which Americans are arguing, but there's an obvious solution to the problem — a solution that no one is talking about. Extreme partisans on the left, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, want the government to forgive up to $50,000 of student debt to all student borrowers. President Biden wants the government to forgive up to $10,000 of student debt to all student borrowers. And most Republicans and conservatives don't want the government to forgive any student debt, rightly pointing out that doing so is making taxpayers pick up the tab for a bill that was never theirs in the first place.
