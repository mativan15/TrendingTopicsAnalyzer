The early news from the media portion of the business aviation's largest annual event points to big expectations for aftermarket work.

Highlighted locally by the Textron Aviation unit of Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) revealing a 180,000 square-foot expansion of its parts center in Wichita, multiple other manufacturers also boosted service plans this week at the National Business Aviation Association convention in Orlando.

NBAA arrived in 2022 as the industry is on an unexpected upswing as it rides a recovery wave of new customers spawned by the Covid-19 pandemic.
