A special court Friday rejected bail to NCP leader and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with a case of alleged corruption filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
Deshmukh was granted bail by the Bombay High Court earlier this month in a money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).
The corruption case was filed by the CBI, alleging that it was at Deshmukh's behest that bribes were collected from bar owners by dismissed policeman Sachin Waze.
