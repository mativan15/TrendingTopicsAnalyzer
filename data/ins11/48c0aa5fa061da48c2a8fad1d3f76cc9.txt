Chile's government sent 25,000 police officers to control public order on the third anniversary of a social outburst and massive protests. In 2019, Chilean citizens demanded better health care, education, pensions and more housing in a revolt that left 33 dead. Three years later, their demands remain unanswered. Small groups of protesters in Santiago interrupted traffic and clashed with police, who dispersed them with water cannons and tear gas. The demonstrators, however, continued to gather and cause disorder.
