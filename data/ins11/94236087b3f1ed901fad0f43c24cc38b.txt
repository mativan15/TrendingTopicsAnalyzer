The 2022-23 summer of Cricket is now underway with registrations open for all grades and programmes. For our youngest players there is our new Smash Play programme this summer and you can register for the centre that suits you best – Horton Park, Renwick, Seddon or Picton. Harcourts Kiwi Cricket is the next stage played with a soft ball at Lansdowne Park on Saturday mornings with separate boys and girls sections. Register for these programmes through the 'register now' link on our website home page.
