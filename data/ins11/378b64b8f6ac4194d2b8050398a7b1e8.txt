The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved micro-cap generic drugmaker Lannett Company (NYSE:LCI) to rapidly expand liquid drug manufacturing of Numbrino®, the company's branded topical anesthetic product, at its main plant in Seymour, Indiana.
The company previously manufactured Numbrino and other liquid drug products at its Carmel, New York plant, which it sold in March of this year as part of a restructuring and cost reduction plan.
NUMBRINO is indicated for the introduction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes for diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities of adults.
