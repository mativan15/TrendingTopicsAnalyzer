Slain Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala bore 19 bullet injury marks and would have died within 15 minutes, said his autopsy report. Moosewala was shot dead by unidentified assailants in Punjab's Mansa district on Sunday, a day after the state government pruned his security cover. The assailants had sprayed bullets on 28-year-old Moosewala in Jawahar Ke village after waylaying his vehicle. At least three weapons were used and thirty empty cases were found from the site. A panel of five doctors had conducted the post-mortem examination of Moosewala.
