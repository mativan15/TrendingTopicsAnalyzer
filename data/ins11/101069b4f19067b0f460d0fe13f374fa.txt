Eaton will be selling electrical-vehicle chargers to the federal government under the terms of an expanded contract with the General Services Administration.

Eaton (NYSE: ETN), whose electrical systems division is based in Pittsburgh, was awarded a GSA blanket agreement for its electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. It's a part of the many portfolio of contracts that Eaton has received to supply electrical infrastructure to the federal government.

Its Green Motion EV chargers will be supplied to the VA Medical Center in Coatesville, Pa.
