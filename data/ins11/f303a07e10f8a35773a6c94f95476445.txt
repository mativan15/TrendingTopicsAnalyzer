Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last quarter. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. In that time, it is up 22%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 55%.

After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals.
