The latest iPad Air represents the fifth generation of Apple's lightweight and ultra-portable tablet lineup. From the outside, the 2022 entry looks and feels a lot like its 2020 predecessor: the iPad Air 4. From the thin, symmetrical bezels to the 10.9-inch display to the cool-to-the-touch aluminum body, I wouldn't blame you if you mistook one generation for the other.

But in the newest iPad Air lives the company's tried-and-true M1 processor, a wider front-facing camera, and the hottest buzzword in tech: 5G.
