MILLIONS of people on benefits will get a one-off payment to help them cover rising bills in the cost of living crisis.
A package of support worth up to £1,500 for some people was announced by the government yesterday.
Not everyone on benefits will get the £650 - but can qualify under other schemes
Among those eligible for the help are those on Universal Credit and other means-tested benefits.
They will get a £650 one-off payment starting from July to help pay for things like energy, fuel and food, which have all risen in price in recent months.
