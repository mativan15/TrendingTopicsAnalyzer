Jeremy Hunt, who was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer six days ago, has confirmed he will not be entering the leadership race.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has insisted that there should instead be a general election, claiming: "They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish.""The British public deserve a proper say on the country's future. They must have the chance to compare the Tories' chaos with Labour's plans to sort out their mess, grow the economy for working people and rebuild the country for a fairer, greener future.
