Elon Musk announced another refinancing of his Twitter deal in a filing made public yesterday (Wednesday). He is dropping the idea of using his stake in Tesla as collateral for loans. Mr Musk had originally secured a $12.5 (£9.9) billion margin loan against his shares in Tesla as part of his $44 (£35) billion financing deal for the Twitter purchase. This was subsequently reduced to $6.25 (£5.0) billion earlier this month (see story below) and has now been removed entirely. This may come as a relief to Tesla shareholders, who have suffered a 35% drop in their share price since the acquisition was announced.
