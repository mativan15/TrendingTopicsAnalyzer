What caused the issue at the Department of Juvenile Justice facility outside Columbia Tuesday morning?

That's a question public officials need to be asking. The answer shouldn't be as simple as it was a fight.

The incident, as reported on by The State's Noah Feit and Alexa Jurado, at the children's prison was described as a 'situation,' a 'disturbance' and a 'riot' by different news outlets.

The specifics of what occurred aren't yet clear, nor is the cause. While the public's right to know what happens at state funded agencies like DJJ is of utmost importance, of equal importance is officials analyzing the cause of what happened and finding solutions without delay.
