The winner of the 2022 Booker Prize has said the attack on Sir Salman Rushdie caused him to 'self-censor' and discard work amid concerns for his own family.Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka said that when writing 'semi-political' work there was always consideration for whether it would 'cost you more than you anticipated'.The writer won the coveted prize with his second novel, The Seven Moons Of Maali Almeida, on Monday, just over two months after the attack in New York state.
