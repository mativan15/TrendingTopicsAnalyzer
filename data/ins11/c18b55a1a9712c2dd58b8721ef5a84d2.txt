This weekend anti-government rallies toured the capitals of several countries of the European Union simultaneously. The most massive demonstrations gathered in Berlin, opposite the Bundestag building, as well as in the center of Prague.
German protesters came out with banners ' Russian oil and gas ' and ' Scholz Government = Biden Administration '.
In the Czech capital, where protests have been going on for several weekends, protesters are asking the government to resign. Petr Fiala Prime Minister said that only those ' used by Moscow ' attend the calls.
