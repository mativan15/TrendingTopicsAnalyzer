In 2015, a large-scale report into pregnancy and maternity discrimination – the most recent of its kind – found that 77% of working mums experienced discrimination in the workplace and a shocking 54,000 women a year lose jobs for getting pregnant.
A well as this, one in five experienced harassment or negative comments from someone at work when they were pregnant or back from maternity leave. 
One in 10 said they were treated worse when they returned to work after having a baby, while 7% were even put under pressure to hand in their notice.
