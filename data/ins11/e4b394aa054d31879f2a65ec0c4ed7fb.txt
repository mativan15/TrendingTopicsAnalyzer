No. 5 Clemson has yet another Top 15 matchup on its hands on Saturday, and this time it's against No. 14 Syracuse.

Coming off a six-point victory over Florida State last week, the Tigers enter Week 7 atop the ACC Atlantic Divison with a perfect 7-0 record on the 2022 season.

The Orange are right behind the Tigers, however, as they are also undefeated on the year with a 6-0 record.

Although Death Valley has hosted some incredible games through the years, Saturday's noon kickoff between these two teams will be the first time that two 6-0 or better ACC teams have faced off in Memorial Stadium.
