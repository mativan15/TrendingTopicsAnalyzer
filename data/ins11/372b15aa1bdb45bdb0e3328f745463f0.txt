Will Campbell and Harold Perkins had high expectations entering their freshmen years. As highly touted blue-chip recruits, the two were the biggest prizes of Brian Kelly's first recruiting class.

According to 247 Sports, they've lived up to the hype, making the Midseason True Freshman All-American team. On Campbell, 247Sports writes that he 'allowed a sack in his start but hasn't given up one since. He's only allowed multiple pressures in two games this season.'

247 also points out that Campbell's earned the best PFF grade among true freshmen tackles who have played at least 20% of their team's snaps.
