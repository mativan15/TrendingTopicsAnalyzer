Robert Way/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) shares marked a modest decline on Friday after Telsey Advisory took their rating on the stock to a Hold-equivalent. The firm noted that warnings on international sales and inventory issues have aroused more caution on footwear and apparel retail trends. In particular, both Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) and Nike (NKE) noted as of late that high inventory has prompted a need for promotions that is likely to cut into margins. While Under Armour's (UAA) inventory has been cited as 'leaner than most competitors', it too is expected to utilize promotions to compete, especially in a tougher macroeconomic environment.
