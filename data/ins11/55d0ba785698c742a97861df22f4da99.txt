ISLAMABAD — 
A global money laundering and terrorism financing monitor Friday removed Pakistan from a list of countries under the "increased monitoring" process after four years for addressing its "strategic deficiencies" to combat the crimes. The president of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) made the announcement after a meeting at its headquarters in Paris, boosting the reputation of the South Asian nation which is struggling to deal with a troubled economy, ravaged by this year's catastrophic floods, and a balance-of-payment crisis.
