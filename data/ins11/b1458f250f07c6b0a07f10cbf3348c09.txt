Oct. 15—It was a tight race until the final minutes of voting, but it was ConVal junior Eric McGrath who earned Sentinel Player of the Week for the week of Oct. 1-7.

McGrath earned 47.2 percent of the record-setting 3,683 votes cast during the week. He totaled 1,740 votes.

Monadnock sophomore Amanda Roy was right behind him with 1,582 votes (43 percent).

As of Thursday morning, the two were separated by just one vote. By Thursday at noon, McGrath had pulled ahead.

"It was a big-time community effort to get him voted in," said ConVal head coach Matt Harris.
