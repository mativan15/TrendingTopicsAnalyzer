O'Connor, Ont. — O'Connor Township wants to be a little more connected. Frustrated with their slow internet service in the community, the six councillor candidates — and the crowd — made it one of the main topics Oct. 13 at the O'Connor Candidates Night at the O'Connor Community Centre on Highway 595.

'Your council and myself have been working really hard trying to get better internet out here,' said incumbent councillor Alex Crane, a former longtime union representative who worked at the Canadian Grain Commission.
