The transaction is expected to close on June 1 and the companies will immediately begin the process of fully transitioning the business to Blaster's operations.  This transition is expected to last much of 2022 as the two companies work to ensure minimal disruption for all stakeholders.
Blumenthal Holdings plans to refocus strategically around the RSC Bio Solutions business, a green tech company serving large marine and industrial fleets operating in sensitive environments.
