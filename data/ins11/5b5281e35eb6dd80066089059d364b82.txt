HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Dr. Mehmet Oz rolled onstage inside of an inflatable orb, put on a hydrating face mask and proceeded to pitch a new line of skin care products to a convention of supplement distributors at Salt Lake City's Vivint Arena in 2018. The crowd roared in applause.

The celebrity surgeon's appearance seemed like an extension of 'The Dr. Oz Show' on daytime TV. But his attendance was in service of the convention's host, Usana Health Sciences, a Utah -based supplement manufacturer that has been investigated by federal authorities, sued by its own shareholders and accused of operating like a pyramid scheme.
