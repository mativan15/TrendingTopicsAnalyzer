Valencia have confirmed Anil Murthy has left the club as president with immediate effect after he threatened the "kill" the reputation of a player. Murthy threatened to destroy Carlos Soler in the media if the midfielder did not pen a new contract at the club. Murthy had claimed that the leaked audio footage, which was claimed to be his voice, had been edited. Spanish newspaper Superdeporte published the audio recording in April in which a voice, which they reported as Murthy's, threatened to ruin the reputation of the Spain international should he refuse to commit his future to the club and instead leave the Mestalla as a free agent.
