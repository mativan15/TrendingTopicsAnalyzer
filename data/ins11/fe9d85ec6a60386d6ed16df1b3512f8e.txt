Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, who is being interrogated in the ‘visa for scam' case, on Saturday gave a sarcasm-laced reply when he was questioned about the CBI probe. 'A test match is for five days. This is just day three,' the 50-year-old Sivaganga MP was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. His remarks came ahead of the third day of questioning.'I'm awaiting to hear from the speaker, I have written to him,' the Congress leader said. On Friday, Karti Chidambaram said he had written to Lok Sabha speaker Om Prakash Birla over the alleged breach of privilege as a parliamentarian.
