Stolen identities and credit cards are frequently found on the dark web, but it's becoming increasingly common to find hacked social media accounts for sale on darknet marketplaces. How much do they cost? Far less than you would think.

According to data extracted by Whizcase (and visualized by Atlas VPN) between January and September 2022, the cheapest accounts belong to Reddit, which go for as low as $6. TikTok, Pinterest, and Twitter accounts all cost $10 or less, while Discord, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat are about $15 a pop.
