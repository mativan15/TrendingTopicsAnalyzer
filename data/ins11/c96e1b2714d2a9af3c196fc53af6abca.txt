Insolvency appellate tribunal NCLAT on Friday directed Jet Airways' new owner - Jalan-Kalrock consortium - to pay the unpaid provident fund and gratuity dues of employees of the carrier, which is going to restart its operation. It has directed the former resolution professional to "compute the payments to be made to workmen and employees within one month from today" and communicate the same to the Jalan-Kalrock consortium to take steps for the payment. Allowing a batch of petitions filed by the associations of workmen, Aircraft Maintenance Engineers, Officers and Staff Association and others, a two-member NCLAT bench had asked the new owner to make payment of provident fund dues as admitted by the resolution professional.
