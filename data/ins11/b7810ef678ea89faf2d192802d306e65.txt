The UK government has kicked off a consultation to collate feedback on strengthening the security and resilience of local datacenters and cloud services to protect against outages and national security threats.
Companies that run, purchase or rent any element of a datacenter are being asked to detail the types of customers they serve.
Announced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) late last week, the move is perhaps a recognition that the UK may need to beef up measures to safeguard key infrastructure against cyber threats and other disruptions.
