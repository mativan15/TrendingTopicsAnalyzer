President Biden is scheduled to meet with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday and will underscore the White House message that the economy is on the right track despite the pain of soaring inflation. The Oval Office meeting will be the first time Mr. Biden has met with Mr. Powell since nominating him in November to serve a second term as the central bank chairman. The two plan to discuss the state of the economy and the administration's plan for tackling inflation, which ranks as 'the president's top economic priority,' according to a White House announcement.
