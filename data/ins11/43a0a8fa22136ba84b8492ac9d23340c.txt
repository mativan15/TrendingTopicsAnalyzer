Would you quit your job over climate inaction? A third of UK employees say they would

A third of UK employees say they are willing to quit their jobs if their employer takes no action to reduce or eliminate its carbon footprint.

The figures come from a survey of 2,000 UK office workers carried out by Supercritical - a platform that helps companies to measure, reduce, and offset their climate impact.

The sentiment was even stronger among Gen Z with over half of 18 to 24 year olds saying they would be willing to leave a company based on its net-zero credentials.
