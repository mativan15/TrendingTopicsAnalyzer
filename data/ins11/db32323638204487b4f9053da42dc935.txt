A Ukrainian fashion designer whose corsets have been worn by Little Mix has told how she packed her car full of the garments as she fled the country with her ‘terrified' 10-year-old son.
Tetiana Stetsyna said goodbye to her husband and left her home city of Odessa, which has been pounded with missile strikes by Russian forces, in order to take their child Denys to safety.
Two days after the invasion began, she filled the car with corsets and materials to make the designs, at the expense of her personal belongings, and drove to neighbouring Moldova.
