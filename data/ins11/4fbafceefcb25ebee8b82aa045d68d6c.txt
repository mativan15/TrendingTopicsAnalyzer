A former boss of the prime suspect in the Leah Croucher murder investigation claims he warned police that he would carry out murder over a decade ago. The business owner took Neil Maxwell on as a mechanic for 'a few years' before he was jailed for rape in 2009. He grew concerned about his behaviour, so much so that he told police at the time: 'He is one evil f*****, he can't control his urges for sex and he's going to kill someone.'In an interview with The Daily Mirror, the former boss – who did not want to be named – said how he saw Maxwell's probation report from a previous conviction and said experts called him a 'dangerous man'.
