The Baltimore Ravens have had a very eventful 2022 offseason, adding talent on both sides of the ball through free agency and the draft. They've also brought back players from their 2021 team that were free agents as well as see others depart for new opportunities with other teams.
When listing out one move that each NFL team still needs to make in the 2022 offseason, Maurice Moten of Bleacher Report said that Baltimore's is to sign quarterback Lamar Jackson to a contract extension. Moten acknowledged that Jackson could be betting on himself in 2022, but he talked about how the Ravens should look to extend him before the Arizona Cardinals extend their quarterback in Kyler Murray.
