My son, 17 years old, constantly counts things. He takes two steps in front and three steps behind while walking. He has to spend time in counting the number of movements while soaping his hands.
He counts money given to him sixteen times and he also has to bow down and pray before every deity a certain number of times in a particular way, otherwise, he gets very upset and anxious. Not surprisingly he finds it difficult to study, attend college, socialize, and just have a great time! I know that this is something called OCD but have been just so scared to go to a doctor in the past, but I think his problems are just increasing'.
