Emmanuel Macron was re-elected president of France last May on a platform of reform and renewal of French domestic politics and institutions. Achieving those objectives depended on him securing a compliant parliamentary majority to push his policies through in the established manner. Failure to do so in June, when his centrist alliance fell short of a majority by 38 seats, has hobbled his platform.The older pattern of centre-left and centre -right party competition has been supplanted by more radical and polarised parties determined to make their mark.
