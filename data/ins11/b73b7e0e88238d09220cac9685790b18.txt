I watched the first few series more out of professional duty than anything else, and found it irritatingly one dimensional, reductive and exhaustingly cliched, little more than a high-budget soap. Unlike other shows about the Royal Family, which either seek to satirise or stylise their existence, The Crown is mawkish and exploitative.Its makers have never viewed the real-life counterparts of their on-screen characters with any sort of humanity, seeing their lives, loves and personal tragedies as nothing more than a gold mine to be exploited for maximum profit.
