Fashion brand Missguided has appointed administrators after suppliers filed to shut it down over unpaid debts.

The retailer with about 330 staff has asked Teneo Financial Advisory to sell its business and assets.

Missguided has been hit by supply chain costs, inflation increases and "softening" consumer confidence in an increasingly tough market, Tenoe said.

One marketing expert said rival brands were better, cheaper and faster and shoppers now care about sustainability.
