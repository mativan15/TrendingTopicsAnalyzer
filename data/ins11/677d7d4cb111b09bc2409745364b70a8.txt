LOS ANGELES (CNS) - One day after electing a new council president and voting to start the process of placing measures before voters that would create an independent redistricting commission and expand the size of the council, the Los Angeles City Council is set to meet virtually Wednesday for the second straight day. This week's meetings are being held virtually due to multiple council members testing positive for COVID-19, with the chamber open only to the media and city staff. Councilman Mike Bonin tested positive for COVID-19 last week and has since tested negative, but Council President Paul Krekorian tested positive on Monday.
