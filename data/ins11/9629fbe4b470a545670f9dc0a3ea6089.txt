Selma Blair has left Dancing With The Stars over health concerns, after receiving a perfect 40 for her last dance.
The actress, who was partnered with Sasha Farber, revealed in 2018 that she'd been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
She made the difficult decision to leave the US dancing competition, breaking the news to Sasha by saying: ‘You know I've been monitored and in touch with my doctors this whole process.
