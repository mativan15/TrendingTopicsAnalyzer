[Photo/Agencies] Apple Inc's reported plan to extend the supply chain in Vietnam could be an attempt to spread out the tech giant's contract manufacturers amid the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is no need to worry that some orders might slip out of China, experts said on Friday. Vietnamese news website SGGP reported Apple CEO Tim Cook, who met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, earlier this month, as saying that the company wants to extend its supply chain in Vietnam.
