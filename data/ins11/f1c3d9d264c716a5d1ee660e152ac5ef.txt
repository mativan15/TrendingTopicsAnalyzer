Since the signing of the Abraham Accords in September 2020, Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, has emerged as one of the top travel destinations for Israelis.

Post-corona numbers for visiting Israelis are expected to top a staggering 50,000 a month, although there will be a temporary lull over the summer months, when temperatures can soar to 40 degrees Celsius.

Since Saudi Arabia dropped its ban on flights to and from Israel using its air space, direct flights from Israel to Dubai now take just a little more than three hours, with four airlines to choose from.
