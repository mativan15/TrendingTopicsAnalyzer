White collar crimes involving embezzlement of thousands of crores of rupees offered as loans by banks are highly harmful to society for they are committed by well-educated and influential people who are otherwise expected to set a moral example and behave responsibly, the Madras High Court said.
Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira said unlike other crimes, which could happen due to sudden provocation, siphoning off public money by defrauding banks was an offence committed with a calculated motive, a deep understanding of the consequences and a clear intention to escape from said consequences.
