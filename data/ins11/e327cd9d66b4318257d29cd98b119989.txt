Alex Rodriguez believes batting Aaron Judge in the leadoff spot is 'ridiculous,' and he says the Yankees need to make a change 'immediately.'
The former Yankees slugger, now a studio analyst for Fox, said Friday night that Judge needs to be better protected in the lineup.  Judge, who set the American League record with 62 home runs in the regular season, is 0-for-8 with seven strikeouts in the Yanks' split of the first two games of the AL Division Series against the Guardians.
 'As far as Aaron Judge, this is gimmicky baseball,' A-Rod said during the Fox postgame show alongside Kevin Burkhardt and Hall of Famers Frank Thomas and David Ortiz.
