A woman is furious with her husband for always 'forgetting' things.

She asked Reddit's 'Am I the A******? (AITA)' forum for advice in the post 'AITA for ‘losing it' on my husband because he can't seem to remember anything?' Her husband forgets his work ID and even to pay bills on a regular basis. But she became fed up when he forgot to take care of their 1-year-old's medical needs.

The husband drops off the baby at daycare every day on his way to work. In addition to dropping off their son, the husband must also remember to bring the child's prescription meds, daycare forms and extra wipes.
