BOSTON, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Aqua Security, the leading pure-play cloud native security provider, today announced it more than doubled revenue in the last 18 months. Aqua attributes its recent growth to rapidly increasing demand for an integrated solution that secures cloud native applications from code through runtime. The company also reports its $1 Million Cloud Native Protection Warranty is driving customer acquisition.
The skyrocketing demand for the company's security solution is driven by a global push to the cloud along with calls from governing bodies to take immediate action to bolster cloud native security.
