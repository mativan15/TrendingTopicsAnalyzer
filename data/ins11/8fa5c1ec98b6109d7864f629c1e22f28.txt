Russell Wilson had a chance to put together a drive that could have started to perhaps endear him to Denver Broncos fans. And then another chance. And another.

The Broncos had three possessions when they were tied 16-16. One came at the end of regulation and then there were two to start overtime. All three ended in punts, with no points. There was only one first down in those drives and it came on a run.

Then Denver's special teams made a huge mistake. Montrell Washington muffed a punt when a blocker was pushed back into him.
