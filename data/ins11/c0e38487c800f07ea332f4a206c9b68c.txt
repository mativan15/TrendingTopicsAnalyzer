By Reuters Published: 14:05 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 14:05 EDT, 15 October 2022 The Philadelphia Flyers placed forward Owen Tippett on injured reserve Saturday with an upper-body injury. The team recalled forward Olle Lycksell from the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League in a corresponding transaction. Tippett, 23, played 4 minutes and 20 seconds in Thursday's season-opening 5-2 win against New Jersey. He drew a two-minute boarding penalty in the first period for a hit on Devils defenseman Brendan Smith.
