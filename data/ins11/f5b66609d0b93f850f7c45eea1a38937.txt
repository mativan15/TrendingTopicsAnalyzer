Harry Styles is teaming up with an anti-gun violence charity for his upcoming North American tour.
The former One Direction star, 28, is preparing to kick off a massive new tour in celebration of the release of new album Harry's House.
But after the violence seen in the United States, Harry is using the tour to try and raise money and awareness for an anti-gun violence charity.
This week, an 18-year-old man shot and killed 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.
The shooter, who also died in the incident, has been named as Salvador Ramos.
