CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Things are such a mess with the Carolina Panthers' quarterback situation that interim coach Steve Wilks isn't even sure who'll be healthy enough to start Sunday against Tampa Bay.

Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold are dealing with sprained ankles, while P.J. Walker has a neck injury. Jacob Eason is the only healthy QB on the roster for Carolina (1-5), but he was just elevated from the practice squad last week and has limited NFL experience.

'I think they are all considered to be in the mix, especially with the injuries that we have,' Wilks said.
