The Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare has undertaken a massive campaign to simplify rules to ensure "ease of living" for central government pensioners, an official statement issued on Thursday said. The DoPPW, which administers pension-related policy matters in respect to central government civil employees, has launched a major campaign on easing of rules during the ongoing special campaign. The Centre has launched a special cleanliness campaign from October 2 to October 31, aimed at simplifying of rules/procedures, disposing of scrap/waste, minimizing pendency of work and resolving public grievances in all its departments.
