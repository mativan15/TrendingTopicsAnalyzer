Published: 03:18 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 03:27 EDT, 20 October 2022 Liz Truss' premiership appears to be in its death throes today after an anarchic 12 hours that saw her Home Secretary resign, reports of tears and tear-ups in the Commons over fracking and the Tory leader apparently chasing her own chief whip while begging her not to resign as her own MP called her a 'shambles' to her face.Ms Truss may soon be the shortest serving Prime Minister in history with some of her MPs calling on her to go this morning 'in order to stop the shambles' and Tory backbencher Simon Hoare declared she has just 12 hours to save her job.
