Mick Schumacher has picked up an unwanted paddock nickname as F1's ‘crash kid' after the German suffered another poor weekend in Monaco. His fortunes in the sport so far have been in complete contrast to his father Michael, who earned seven world titles during his glittering career.The 23-year-old Haas star crashed out after losing control of his car at the fast turn 14 in his second big accident this season. He smashed against the barriers, splitting the car in two and bringing out the red flag.
