Marv Levy knows exactly what enabled his Bills, behind quarterback Jim Kelly, to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls:
'Resilience,' Levy, the longtime Buffalo head coach, told Serby Says from his Chicago home. 'The ability to bounce back. I quoted some words from Winston Churchill: Never, never, never, never surrender. And that's the way they were.'
Levy, the 97-year-old Hall of Famer, will be just like any other member of his beloved Bills Mafia when the marquee showdown between two quarterbacks who never surrender and two teams that never surrender unfolds at Arrowhead Stadium with the possibility that the winner will be hosting the AFC Championship game.
