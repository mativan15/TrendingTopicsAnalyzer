Bray Wyatt stunned WWE fans as he brought SmackDown to a close with an emotional speech and one huge horror movie style twist.
The former world champion – who made his epic return at Extreme Rules last weekend – spoke out of character as Windham Rotunda for the first time and offered a heartbreaking insight into the ‘past year of his life', hinting at Brodie Lee's tragic death and getting released by the company in the summer of 2021.
After making a haunting entrance with an incredible new theme song, Bray took the mic and said: ‘I am incredibly grateful and I'm really, really nervous to be here.
