Brad Pitt, you owe Geena Davis big-time — and not just because you stole all her getaway money in 'Thelma & Louise.'
On Thursday's episode of BBC America's 'The Graham Norton Show,' the Oscar-winning actress revealed that she auditioned with three other actors to play conman cowboy J.D. opposite her Thelma in the 1991 Ridley Scott classic. And it was Davis who gave the thumbs-up to Pitt for the breakout role that sent him on his way to becoming one of Hollywood's biggest stars.
After Norton said that 'Brad Pitt owes his entire career' to Davis, she told the story about how she was transfixed by Pitt's talent — and no doubt, his fair-haired hunkiness — when she auditioned with him after first reading with the three other finalists, who all had brown hair.
