A new energy tariff promises to cut costs for households this autumn, but only if customers give up their mobile and broadband deals.
The energy price cap, which limits what suppliers can charge customers on variable tariffs, is now predicted to rise to £2,879 in October, more than £900 above the current level, according to analyst Cornwall Insight.
Supplier Utility Warehouse has introduced a 12-month fixed tariff for £2,250, some £230 less than the next cheapest fixed deal on the market and £625 less than the average fixed cost, according to comparison site Uswitch.
