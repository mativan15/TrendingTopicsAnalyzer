Production is set to resume on the film Rust, however it won't take place in New Mexico where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot. 
According to insiders, filming is likely to take place in California instead, because it would be ‘too emotionally difficult' for the cast and crew to return to the location where Hutchins died in October 2021. 
Hutchins, 42, was fatally wounded when a prop gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding misfired, also injuring director Joel Souza.
Her family had filed a lawsuit against Baldwin and others involved in Rust in February, accusing them of reckless behaviour and cost-cutting measures which led to her death.
