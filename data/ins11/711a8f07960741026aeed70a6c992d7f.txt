Jeremy Hunt has scrapped nearly all tax cuts announced in last month's mini-Budget, including deferring a 1p cut to income tax "indefinitely" and axing a proposed cut to corporation tax in a major U-turn for Liz Truss' Government.

He said: "No government can control markets but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances... We will reverse almost all the tax measures in growth plan. At a time when markets are rightly demanding a commitment to sustainable finances it is not right to borrow to fund this.
