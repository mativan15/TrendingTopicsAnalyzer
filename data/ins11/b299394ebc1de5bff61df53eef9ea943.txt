Tesla is now the best-selling luxury car brand in the US. If you needed more proof that the future of the auto industry is electric, well there you go. But what's surely a feather in the cap of Elon Musk is a gut-punch to storied, high-end brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz that were always the go-to choice for buyers with some extra money to spend.The Germans have had enough. Late last year, Mercedes launched its first battery-powered car for US buyers: the EQS sedan. I took a spin in the luxurious four-door to see exactly what Tesla is up against and came away impressed by the Benz's extra-long range, buttery-smooth ride, and breathtaking interior.
