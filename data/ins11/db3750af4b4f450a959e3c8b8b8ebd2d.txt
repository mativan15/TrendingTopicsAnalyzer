As the parent of a high school junior, I feel like the unluckiest college saver. I'm close to tuition bills coming, which is not a good time for our portfolio balance to be down 17.5% since last year — even in an age-based investment fund that's pretty conservative by now. To boot, this is something of a double-whammy, because I started saving in 2007 and the account took a beating right off the bat with the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  Early losses and late losses are hard on investment accounts, but with college on a fixed timeline, it's hard to get around when the bills are due.
