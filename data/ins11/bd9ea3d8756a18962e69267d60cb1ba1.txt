May 27—Harrison Twp. has put a pause on new developments in the Wagner Ford Road and North Dixie corridors so that it can conduct research and figure out the best way to develop the area after a tornado ripped through it three years ago.

Harrison Twp. Administrator Kris McClintick said there had been disinvestment in some of the township's commercial corridors before 2019, and there were also ongoing shifts in the brick-and-mortar retail market.

Then the tornado hit, leaving some clean slates for redevelopment, but also making clear the need for better strategies.
