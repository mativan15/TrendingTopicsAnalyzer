A community engagement project in northeast Calgary is aiming to answer one question: what makes a great public space?  Charity Vivo for Healthier Generations and Calgary's Parks Foundation are speaking with residents as they transform neighbourhoods and look towards future builds. The organizations started their engagement with a Saturday event focused in on north-central parks and public spaces. Neighbours, stakeholders and city leaders were on hand to spark a dialogue.  "We are super excited to bring the community together to talk about what matters to them and what creates amazing outdoor spaces," Vivo CEO Cynthia Watson told CTV News.
