Spencer Jones and Vanderbilt busted out of late-season funks and the Commodores got program-record run production Saturday to stay alive in the NCAA Tournament. The Commodores homered four times in a 21-1 victory over New Mexico State in the regional at Corvallis, Oregon. It was their highest run total in 122 NCAA Tournament games and their highest in any game in three years. Vanderbilt, the No. 2 regional seed, played in the last two College World Series finals but entered Saturday 1-6 in its last seven and 16-18 since a 20-4 start.
