Dwayne Johnson has shared his delight over being taken to prom as a carboard cut-out by one of his fans, sharing her photos on his Instagram and calling it ‘an honour'.
Fan Mel had devised the ingenious plan to be escorted to prom by one of her favourite celebrities, sourcing a life-size cardboard version of the former WWE wrestler turned Hollywood superstar in a bowtie and bright pink tuxedo jacket.
Mel coordinated nicely with her prom date in a purple glittery dress and shared a few traditional ‘date pics' of the two of them, seemingly arm-in-arm, as well as a group shot with their friends from later in the night.
