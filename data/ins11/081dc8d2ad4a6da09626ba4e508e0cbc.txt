Howdy, I'm your host, Houston Mitchell. Let's get right to the news.

From Kevin Baxter: No MLS team has won more games, scored more goals or earned more points in the regular season than LAFC since it entered the league five years ago.

But the playoffs have been the team's kryptonite.

Denis Bouanga, who joined LAFC in August, wasn't here for any of that history.
