Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation, two super PACs financed by crypto executives, are each expected to spend at least six figures on an ad blitz starting in two weeks, according to one of the groups' chief strategists. The PACs plan to invest in TV ads supporting candidates from both sides of the aisle just days before the midterm Election Day on Nov. 8. Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation are funded primarily by the GMI PAC, another super PAC that has seen massive donations from cryptocurrency leaders.
