Jun. 5—Editor's note: The Transcript sought commissioners and experts outside the county during an election season to give readers an inside look at the many roles commissioners assume. None of the commissioners interviewed are up for reelection.

County commissioners across the state are best known as three-member boards that repair roads and bridges in unincorporated areas, but the job is much more than that, say three longtime commissioners.

Commissioners can be in a meeting on a board or committee one minute and in court the next, on a road grader one day or on another oversee the burial of an indigent resident.
