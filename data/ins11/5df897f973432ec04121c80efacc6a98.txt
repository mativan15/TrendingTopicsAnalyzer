The National Rifle Association declared bankruptcy last year as it faced allegations that its executives used tens of millions of dollars for personal expenditures and otherwise mismanaged money. But that hasn't stopped the gun rights organization from funding the campaigns of political candidates.Since 2010, the NRA has spent more than $148 million on federal elections, nearly all of which has gone toward supporting Republican candidates in one way or another. About $91 million was spent trying to defeat candidates, according to OpenSecrets, a campaign finance watchdog.
