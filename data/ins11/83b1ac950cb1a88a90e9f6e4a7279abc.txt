Alice Wheeldon, a women's rights campaigner who opposed the First World War, was one of the detainees gazing from the pages of the 500-page book, alongside black and white photographs of others convicted of a host of offences between 1890-1920.

Mrs Wheeldon, of Derby, was convicted – on the evidence of a discredited British spy – of plotting to kill David Lloyd George in 1917 during the war, and was jailed for 10 years, as the ledger records.
