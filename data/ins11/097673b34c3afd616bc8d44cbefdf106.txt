Amazon is ramping up criticism of a key antitrust bill that aims to rein in the e-commerce giant's power, in part by trying to distance itself from the other tech giants targeted by the proposed legislation.

Amazon's vice president of public policy Brian Huseman published a blog post Wednesday slamming the bipartisan American Innovation and Choice Online Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), in the company's most extensive and direct criticism of the legislation.
