This is a transcript of the interview we published on May 17. We hope you enjoy it!

Dave Flitman: The demand is so under satisfied over the last 12 years in this industry. I think that the demand will continue to drive growth for a long time. I see any downturn now -- obviously, if rates just continue to skyrocket and double or triple from here, all bets are off, of course.
