Managed services growth not enough to offset pullback in XaaS spending

SYDNEY, October 18, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spending on cloud services in Asia Pacific was down sharply in the third quarter, as the market was weighed down by economic concerns and continuing business disruptions in China, the latest state-of-the-industry report from Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, finds.

The Asia Pacific ISG Index™, which measures commercial outsourcing contracts with annual contract value (ACV) of US $5 million or more, shows third-quarter ACV for the combined market (managed services and cloud-based XaaS) dropped 29 percent, to US $3.
