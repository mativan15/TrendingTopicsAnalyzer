EDMONTON - A former member of Alberta's legislative assembly and key fundraiser for war-torn Ukraine says he's skeptical about Premier Danielle Smith's apology for remarks she made about the country's conflict with Russia. Thomas Lukaszuk, who has been raising millions of dollars in humanitarian aid with former Alberta premier Ed Stelmach for Ukraine, said he wants details on how Smith's stated views have evolved, adding it is damaging the fundraising effort. 'I personally don't buy it (Smith's apology), but the fact is we are where we are, and the situation in Ukraine is real and Ukraine requires more help now than ever,' Lukaszuk said in an interview Wednesday.
