The Maharashtra Chief Minister Fellowship programme, which was suspended during the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) tenure, is set to make a comeback with a proposal to renew the scheme will be ready within the next two weeks. On the completion of the one-year programme, a fellow will receive a certificate from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Mumbai or Indian Institute of Management (IIM)-Nagpur.
According to officials, the state government is in talks with both the institutes for the affiliation of the certificate course, under which a fellow will be enrolled, once selected for the programme.
