Jun. 2—CONCORD — Gov. Chris Sununu said Wednesday that recent mass shootings, including one at a Uvalde, Texas, school, haven't convinced him of the need to change the state's gun laws.

"We aren't looking to make any changes in firearms policy," Sununu said.

Meanwhile, in the wake of the Texas incident, Safety Commissioner Robert Quinn and Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said they will do a reassessment of any possible "gaps or vulnerabilities" in public schools here.

Sununu said nearly $30 million in infrastructure grants has made schools safer here, but he said officials at all levels of government must remain vigilant about the risk.
