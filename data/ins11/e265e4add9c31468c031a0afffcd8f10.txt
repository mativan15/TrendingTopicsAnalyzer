The Union government has extended cuts in levies on certain varieties of lentils (pulses) and started stockpiling imported ones to replenish markets, taking further measures to cool spiraling prices, an official said on Friday. While the government's interventions have helped stabilize prices of pulses, costlier cereals, milk, vegetables and protein surged the most in two years in September. India's retail inflation accelerated in September to a five-month high of 7.41% year-on-year, driven by food prices, which stood at a record 8.
