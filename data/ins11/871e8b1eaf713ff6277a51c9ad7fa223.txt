Ethereum may soon split into two, according to some developers. As the second largest blockchain network vies for mainstream acceptance, it has increasingly fallen under the microscope of governments and regulators eager to tame the platform.

The US government's vision for Ethereum – which involves regulating certain kinds of blockchain apps out of existence – is at odds with some of the core principles that the platform was founded on.

Ideas like 'censorship resistance' and 'credible neutrality' may be thrown out the window as big businesses and average users – folks comfortable with a more heavily regulated crypto experience – enter the Ethereum arena.
