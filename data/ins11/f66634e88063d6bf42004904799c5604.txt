Good morning,The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled against accused people in 34 sexual-assault cases in a row, stretching back more than four years, making it more difficult to overturn such convictions on appeal as the cases pour in during the Me Too era.The Globe and Mail reviewed all sexual-assault cases heard by the Supreme Court since 2014.
