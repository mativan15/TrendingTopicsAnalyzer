PERTH, AUSTRALIA — 
Australia and Japan agreed to share sensitive intelligence and deepen defense cooperation Saturday, signing a security pact to counter China's military rise.
Prime ministers Fumio Kishida and Anthony Albanese signed the accord in the Western Australian city of Perth, revamping a dusty 15-year-old accord drafted when terrorism and weapons proliferation were the overriding concerns.
Under the deal, the countries' defense forces will train together in Northern Australia, and "expand and strengthen cooperation across defense, intelligence sharing" and a raft of other areas, Australian officials said.
