H﻿ugo Bueno's full first-team Wolves debut was one positive to take from a disappointing night at Selhurst Park according to caretaker boss Steve Davis.T﻿he 20-year-old made his first start in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat and impressed with his assist for Adama Traore's opener.Davis said: "I thought he was excellent. Didn't let anyone down, I think he felt that we trusted him and we know him."We know he's a character, we know what he's capable of and he's ready. He was ready for that moment. I thought he took it really well.
