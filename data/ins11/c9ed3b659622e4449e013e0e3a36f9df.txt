The Brockton Public Library is adding a mobile planetarium that can seat 40 children to its more traditional collection of books, music, and movies.The public is invited to a launch party for the new acquisition from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on June 11 at the Brockton Main Library, 304 Main St. Because of COVID, masks will be required.Starting at the end of June, the inflatable dome will be available to local schools and community centers with space to accommodate the structure — which is 10½ feet tall and 16 feet in diameter and inflates and deflates in 10 minutes, according to Pat Monteith, who is coordinating the mobile planetarium program.
