Britain's interior minister Suella Braverman quit on Wednesday, becoming the second senior cabinet minister to depart within a week.
While Braverman has resigned over a 'technical' breach of government rules — she sent an official document from her personal email account —  in her resignation letter, she also criticised Prime Minister Liz Truss, saying she had 'concerns about the direction of this government'. UK's new interior minister will be Grant Shapps, who had not backed Truss for the PM post and was removed as transport minister when she came to power.
