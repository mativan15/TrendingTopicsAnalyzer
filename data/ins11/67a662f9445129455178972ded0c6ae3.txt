A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking direction for a confidential survey by the Archaeological Survey of India on all the ancient and prominent mosques which are over a hundred years old in India and having wells and ponds. The PIL sought directions for the shifting of wuzu or wudu (Islamic procedure followed by Muslims for cleansing parts of the body before offering prayers) from the ponds and wells in the mosques over hundred years old which are disputed to taps or modern faucets till the time, a confidential survey could be completed so that if any relic is discovered, unnecessary communal hatred and hurting religious sentiments could be avoided.
