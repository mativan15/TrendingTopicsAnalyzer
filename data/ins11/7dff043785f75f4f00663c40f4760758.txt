Time to make sure you've got your sunblock, sunglasses — and your Amazon app! The website just dropped tons of Memorial Day deals on their most popular devices. There's a FireTV Omni 65" TV that's $330 off, a Fire TV stick that's a ridiculously low $25 and an Echo Dot Speaker that's only $35. You'll also find goodies like an Echo Show 8 for $100 and a Ring Video Doorbell for $52!

If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course.
