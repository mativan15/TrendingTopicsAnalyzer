The long-running, award-winning Fox animated series "Bob's Burgers," created by Loren Bouchard, is an unassuming Hollywood success story. Built in the same mold as "The Simpsons" and "King of the Hill," it's no surprise that this irreverent, whip-smart and family-oriented animated comedy is such a success, both commercially and creatively. The arrival of a movie version, "The Bob's Burgers Movie," seems like just icing on the cake, but it also is a refreshing contrast to the kind of big-screen spectacle that usually crowds theaters in the summer.
