Making two expected moves, the Cavaliers exercised the third-year option on center/forward Evan Mobley and the fourth-year option on guard Isaac Okoro Saturday.

Both options are for 2023-24.

The Cavs also waived guards Sharife Cooper and R.J. Nembhard and forwards Mamadi Diakite, Nate Hinton and Jamorko Pickett ahead of Wednesday night's season opener at Toronto. Nembhard was signed to a two-way contract.

Selected third overall out of USC, Mobley was runner-up for NBA Rookie of the Year last season and a unanimous All-Rookie first-team pick.
