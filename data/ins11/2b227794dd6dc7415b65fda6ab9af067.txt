The first metaverse for law enforcement has been unveiled by Interpol. As some crimes committed in the physical world are not yet regulated in the virtual space, perpetrators are already taking advantage of the relative lawlessness, the organization concludes. The launch of the platform by Interpol was announced during its 90th General Assembly in New Delhi on Thursday. In a statement published on its website, the international police body explained that users of the new metaverse can take a tour of a virtual re-creation of the Interpol General Secretariat headquarters in Lyon, France, interact with other officers, and take training courses in forensic investigation along with other policing capabilities.
