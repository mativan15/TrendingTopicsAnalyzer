Going into the 2022 football season, Aggies Wire will be looking at each scholarship player listed on the Texas A&M roster.
Over the preseason, each profile will cover where the player is from, how recruiting websites rated them coming out of high school, and what role they will play for Jimbo Fisher this season.
Lebbeus Overton reclassified out of the 2023 national recruiting class to join the 2022 class in order to come to Aggie land a year early and contribute on the defensive line as soon as this coming season.
