I feel like I'm getting back into a groove.

Through Week 4, I was 20-10 with my picks before enduring a few losing weeks. Last week was a better effort as I nailed Iowa State, Old Dominion and Nebraska and eked out a win with USC.

One loss — Utah State being down to its fourth-string QB — I'll chalk up as bad luck. The other two were just bad picks, though I wasn't the only one fooled by Bret Bielema's injury shenanigans.

Now it's on to Week 8.

Last week: 4-3

Overall: 29-24

Indiana at Rutgers

Time: Noon | TV: BTN | Line: RU -3 | Total: 48

If there's one unit I trust in this game, it's the Rutgers defense.
