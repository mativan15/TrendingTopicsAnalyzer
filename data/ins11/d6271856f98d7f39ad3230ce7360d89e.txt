Middlesex County's Latino Telehealth Program, a community-based initiative geared toward education and increasing access to bilingual telemedicine options, has expanded to serve New Brunswick after successfully launching in Perth Amboy a year ago, county officials announced.

In partnership with New Brunswick Tomorrow, a nonprofit that has driven social revitalization for the city for more than 40 years, the Telehealth Program increases access to health care to the uninsured and underinsured residents of Middlesex County via telehealth health care programs.
