It's time to ask if the Bank of England's independence is worth maintaining

I have to feel some sympathy for Rishi Sunak. He has faced some of the most testing economic challenges in modern times, yet the two most powerful institutions that he depends on have essentially failed him. The Bank of England last year was forecasting a 3 per cent or so blip in inflation, now it is forecasting a 10 per cent level that may not go away. In essence they thought the problem was going to be easily manageable, and now it is turning into a nightmare.
In March 2021 the Treasury and Office of Budget Responsibility estimated the need for public borrowing for 2021-22 at £234 billion, but the outturn was £145 billion, an error of almost £90 billion.
