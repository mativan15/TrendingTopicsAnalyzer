A woman meant to help manage a military veteran's money stole more than $100,000 from him and bought a house in Louisiana, federal prosecutors say.

After draining the veteran's accounts of $109,217, Sloane Signal-Debose, 51, of Slidell, used the money to put a down payment on her home before stealing thousands more to make home repairs, according to court documents filed in New Orleans federal court.

This came after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decided the veteran needed help managing his finances and bank accounts, so Signal-Debose was chosen as his fiduciary, court documents state.
