Kanye West is set to buy the social-media platform, Parler, which describes itself as the 'Premier Global Free Speech App,' after he was removed from Twitter and Instagram over anti-Semitic statements.

West, who now goes by the name Ye, released a statement explaining his purchase. 'In a world where conservative opinions are considered to be controversial we have to make sure we have the right to freely express ourselves,' he said.

Parlement Technologies, Parler's parent company, said it expects the deal to close later this year though the company didn't say how much West would be paying.
