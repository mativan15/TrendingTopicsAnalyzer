Amid the depleting foreign currency reserves and crashing economy, Pakistan is in dire need of USD 36-37 billion in foreign financing in the next fiscal year. The country's international bonds have lost almost one-third of their value and Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has announced that Pakistan is yet to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June, The Express Tribune reported.

The minister revealed that at present the government is not in a position to raise fresh foreign debt from the global capital market and stressed controlling inflation as the top priority.
