The US Attorney's Office for Manhattan has charged a former product manager at OpenSea, the largest marketplace for nonfungible tokens, with insider trading of a digital asset. This is a first for the Department of Justice.On multiple occasions in 2021, Nathaniel Chastain allegedly secretly purchased NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage, only to resell them after the assets were placed on the front page, increasing their value dramatically, according to the indictment from the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York that was unsealed Wednesday.
