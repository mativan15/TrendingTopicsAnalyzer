The union representing Quebec's laboratory technicians says the quality of services in hospital labs will continue to affect patient care if the government doesn't act quickly to stop it. "There is a crisis situation in labs that already affects the health of the population. It affects results, and diagnoses are delayed. And now the situation is even more critical," said Sandra Etienne, vice president of Syndicat APTS, a union representing professional and technical health and social services personnel.
