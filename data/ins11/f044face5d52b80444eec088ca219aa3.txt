Goaltender Matt Murray tweaked his groin in the morning skate on Saturday, leaving in doubt the Maple Leafs' plans their game against the Ottawa Senators.

Ilya Samsonov will likely get the start if Murray can't play Saturday night, but his backup is a big question.

If the Leafs training team thinks Murray is healthy enough, he could dress. If they think the problem is more serious and he is likely to miss at least 10 games in 24 days, they could put Murray on long-term injured reserve and call up Erik Källgren from the Marlies.
