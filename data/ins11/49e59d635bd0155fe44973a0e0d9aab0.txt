May 28—A successful Oak Hill business geared toward empowering women celebrated the ribbon cutting of a second location in the Crossroads Mall on May 26.

The Hive Health & Boutique offers everything from boutique clothing, shoes, purses and accessories to home décor.

"We tried to take a little bit of everything we have in our Oak Hill location and offer it there (at the mall)," said Jennifer McKinney, who co-owns the business with Hollie Elswick.

The women, both 2009 graduates of Fayetteville High School, joined forces in 2019.
