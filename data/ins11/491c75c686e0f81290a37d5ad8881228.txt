Two St. Louis-based health care businesses have agreed to merge under a new parent organization.

Town & Country-based Navvis, a health care consulting business, and Esse Health, one of the St. Louis region's largest physician groups, will combine and form a new company called Surround Care, officials announced Thursday.

The boards of both companies have approved the merger, which is scheduled to close Oct. 31, officials said. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Navvis is majority owned by management with minority investors including Orlando Health, SSM Health, Hawaii Medical Services Association (HMSA) and Medica, according to a spokeswoman.
