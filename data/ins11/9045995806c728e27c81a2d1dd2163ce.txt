Oct. 18—The Freeborn County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday approved a resolution supporting a county grant request to build a new interchange on Interstate 90 at Bath Road.

Previous county boards have considered the I-90 interchange on the road, also known as County State Aid Highway 20, a few other times over the past 30 years.

County Engineer Phil Wacholz said the county will ask for full funding for the project through the Corridors of Commerce program after continued discussions with the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
