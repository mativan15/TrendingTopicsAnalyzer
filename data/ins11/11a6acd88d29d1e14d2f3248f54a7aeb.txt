The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal that had urged the justices to interpret the Constitution as conferring birthright citizenship on people born in American Samoa.

The court's denial came in a one-line order without explanation or noted dissent. The justices' vote breakdown was not disclosed, as is typical, but the court's rejection means fewer than four voted to hear the appeal.

The lawsuit, brought by a group of American Samoans, challenged a set of infamous Supreme Court precedents known as the 'Insular Cases,' which were decided more than a century ago.
