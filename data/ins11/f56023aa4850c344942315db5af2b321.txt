On the Eastside streets of Los Angeles, Ana Castro is a political foot soldier of local acclaim, known as 'La del Mopeador.'

For decades, the 67-year-old janitor marched in street protests and knocked on doors carrying a floppy string mop as a working-class totem, earning her the Spanish moniker 'the Mop Woman.'

Los Angeles City Councilmember Kevin de León showed up at Castro's apartment in Montecito Heights when he was looking for help campaigning for assemblyman, and she started going straight from her night shift cleaning high-rise offices to canvassing for him on the Eastside.
