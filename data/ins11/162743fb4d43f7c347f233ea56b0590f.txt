Chelsea manager Graham Potter praised goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for his recent performances and said he was happy to have him competing with Edouard Mendy for the first-choice spot, welcoming the selection headache ahead of a busy schedule.Arrizabalaga starred in Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League win over Aston Villa on Sunday where he produced a series of superb saves and denied Danny Ings what would have been an equaliser to ensure Potter's impressive start at Chelsea continued.The Spaniard was second-choice behind Mendy in the last two seasons but has reasserted his authority at Stamford Bridge after the Frenchman's injury last month, having kept four straight clean sheets.
