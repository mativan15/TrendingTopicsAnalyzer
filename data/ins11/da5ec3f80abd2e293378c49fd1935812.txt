Despite rising interest rates and other inflation-related aches, a new University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll finds American support for Ukraine is holding steady. Fifty-seven percent of the 1,029 respondents contacted Oct. 7-10 reported that they were prepared to accept rising prices as the United States helps Ukraine fend off the Russian invasion, compared to 58% of June respondents who said the same. Similarly, 60% of October respondents said they were prepared to pay more for energy as a result of the United States' support, down 2% from those who said the same in June.
