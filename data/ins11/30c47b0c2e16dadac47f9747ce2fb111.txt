The Justice Department has said it will review law enforcement's response to the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas which left 21 people dead.

Last Tuesday, a teenage gunman stormed Robb Elementary School in Uvalde killing 19 children and two teachers in the shooting.

There has been mounting criticism over the police response to the shooting, the worst in the US in a decade.

Anger has been building in the city of Uvalde since the tragedy, and questions remain over why local police waited for nearly an hour to storm the classroom, while the attacker and children were trapped inside.
