'The problem in NSW is most of this stuff is not dealt with by law, it's dealt with by principles,' Twomey said. 'That's all very well and good, but it doesn't in the end give you an answer, in most cases, about what you actually have to do or what you can't do.'LoadingA. J. Brown, a professor of public policy and law at Griffith University who will also present to the ICAC on Friday, said some pork-barrelling was legitimate and in fact inherent to democracy, and could never be fully erased. But there appeared to be a growing assumption by MPs and ministers that they had no obligations to public trust when spending taxpayer money, he said.
