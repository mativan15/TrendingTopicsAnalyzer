Nightshade Cannabis has been on the cutting edge of New York's cannabis industry.

The small family farm started as a certified organic vegetable grower in 2015. In 2017, they applied to be part of a state industrial hemp farming research grant, anticipating that in the not-too-distant future, adult-use cannabis would be legalized. The next year, they added a research license for processing cannabis.

Now, the farm, located in the southern Albany County hamlet of Medusa near the line with Greene County, has both a cultivation and a processing license.
