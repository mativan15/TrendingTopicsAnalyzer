Wilson County's Nov. 8 municipal election will have only two contested city council races in Lebanon.

Lebanon has three of the city's six council seats up for election with one uncontested race as well.

Mt. Juliet has two of its five city commission seats that are voted on and both are uncontested.

Watertown has three candidates for three at-large council seats up for election, which makes that election effectively uncontested.
