Will Arnett will play killer clown Sweet Tooth in TV's 'Twisted Metal'

According to Variety, Will Arnett is set to voice the character of Sweet Tooth in the upcoming action-comedy "Twisted Metal" show coming to Peacock. As of now, it's unclear if the character will be physically portrayed in live action by another actor, or if the killer clown will be totally CG, but Arnett's gravelly, baritone voice is a home run casting choice if you ask us. The actor will be joining Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church and Neve Campbell on the show, based on the classic car combat game.
