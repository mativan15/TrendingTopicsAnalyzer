Saffron Cordery, the organisation's interim chief executive, said local government public health spending is often 'one of the first areas to go" when it comes to cuts.This could result in the reduction of outreach clinics, sexual health clinics, school nurses, and health visitors, she said."For an NHS that is creaking under demand, public health and community health services are the things that can keep people healthy at home, or at least certainly keep them from being emergency admissions into hospital,' she said.
