About 150 soldiers arrived back at Fort Bragg on Tuesday night after an eight-month deployment in Europe.

The soldiers, who are part of the 3rd Battalion, 321st Field Artillery Regiment, rapidly deployed to Germany on Feb. 28 in support of the 18th Airborne Corps and the immediate response force's mission to bolster NATOS's eastern flank and support NATO in deterring Russian aggression after Russian invaded Ukraine.

The regiment transferred responsibilities to the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, on Saturday.
