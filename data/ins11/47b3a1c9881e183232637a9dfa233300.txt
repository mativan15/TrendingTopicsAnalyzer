Giorgia Meloni headed to Rome's Quirinal Palace on Friday where she is expected to be appointed as Italy's new prime minister.

Matteo Salvini and ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi will join her at the meeting with Italy's president, Sergio Mattarella, to deliberate cabinet positions in the government.

Meloni's Brothers of Italy -- a national conservative party with neo-fascist roots -- emerged as Italy's biggest party in a snap general election held on 25 September.

It is the biggest force in a right-wing coalition that includes Salvini's Northern League movement and Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
