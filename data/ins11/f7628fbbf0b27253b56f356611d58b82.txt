The Eagles own the 2nd-ranked total offense (419.8 ypg) in the NFL, trailing only Buffalo (440.4 ypg). Philadelphia's 419.8 yards per game mark the club's 2nd-most through the first five games of a season since the 1970 merger, behind the 2013 campaign (454.8 ypg).
The Eagles also lead the league with 58 explosive plays (16+ yard completions and 10+ yard rushes) this season.
Sunday night could be more about dominance up front and less about explosive plays. The perfect scenario would see the Eagles handling every drive against Dallas similarly to the eight-minute drive that closed Arizona out last Sunday.
