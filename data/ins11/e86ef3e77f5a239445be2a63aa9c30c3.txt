Dwayne ‘The Rock' Johnson may have left WWE for Hollywood a long time ago, but wrestling is still very much in his blood – and his heart.
The former world champion and Black Adam actor is rumoured to be making an epic return to the ring to face his real life cousin Roman Reigns at when WrestleMania 39 rolls in Hollywood in April 2023, but there's also a chance he could be joining the team behind the scenes.
It's been all change for WWE this year, after Vince McMahon retired in July with his daughter Stephanie McMahon taking over as chair, as well as co-CEO alongside Nick Khan, and Paul ‘Triple H' Levesque becoming head of creative and talent relations along with his latest job title chief content officer.
