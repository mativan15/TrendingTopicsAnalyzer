The Circa casino, in downtown Las Vegas, home to the biggest sportsbook in the world, features a hundred-and-twenty-by-forty-foot television screen, three floors of stadium-styled seating, and a pool area with an even bigger screen where you can rent a cabana for five hundred dollars per day. High-priced venues in Las Vegas are usually the provenance of sweaty men in designer shirts who want to attract women into the V.I.P. sections of clubs, but, when I visited the Circa this past Sunday for eight hours of manic football betting, the clientele was mostly made up of young, also sweaty men in poorly fitted football jerseys, soft shorts they could have bought off Instagram, and baseball caps that they wore backward.
