OTTAWA—Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez defended Ottawa's online news bill before a parliamentary committee on Friday, the same day Google — C-18's top critic — shared how it would want to see the proposed legislation amended.

'The world is watching us, and I hope that we will rise to the occasion,' the minister told members of the House of Commons heritage committee.

'We can give Canadian news media a chance to rebuild and thrive in a more sustainable, fairer use of the system. And we'll do everything we can to give Canadians access to fair, impartial, fact-based, high-quality news.
