It's probably a good thing Illinois is a ways away from Arkansas. Because it's hard to predict the reaction of the Razorbacks' fan base when they hear: Bret Bielema is a dynamite coach.

The former Razorbacks head man had three modest seasons at Arkansas, but bookend years of 3-9 (0-8) and 4-8 (1-7) in the SEC left him five games below .500 and 11-29 in the SEC during his five seasons.
