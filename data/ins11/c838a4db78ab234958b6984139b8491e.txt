Flowers lay at a crime scene at the side of the Plains Road April 20, 2020 in Debert, Nova Scotia, Canada.

An inquiry into Canada's worst mass shooting has released audio of a call that lead to political interference claims in the massacre investigation.

The head of the RCMP, the federal police force, was accused of pressuring local officers to help advance the Trudeau government's gun control plans.

The accusation stemmed from notes from the call first released in June as part of the inquiry.
