The Volusia Sheriff's Office on Friday filed a risk protection order, sometimes called a "red flag" law, requesting that law enforcement be allowed to temporarily seize firearms belonging to the suspect in Thursday's armed standoff, records show.

The sheriff's office also contacted the Secret Service after discovering "a significant amount of counterfeit money and printing equipment" inside the home near Port Orange, sheriff's officials said in a news release.

Curtis Lapiere Jr., 56, was arrested Thursday afternoon and charged with aggravated assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer following an hours-long standoff that began that morning.
