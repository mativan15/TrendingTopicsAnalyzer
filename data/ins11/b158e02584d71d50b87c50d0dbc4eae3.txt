RichLeggOur first look at Biodesix, Inc. (NASDAQ:BDSX) ,a small diagnostics firm, was posted just over a year ago last September. We weren't buyers, and came to the following conclusion: Biodesix is an interesting company in a growing niche of the market. While quarterly results missed estimates, revenues are on an upward track. That said, the company is likely to raise additional capital given its quarterly burn rate in the foreseeable future. Recent insider buying is a nice positive, and while analyst commentary is sparse, it is positive.
