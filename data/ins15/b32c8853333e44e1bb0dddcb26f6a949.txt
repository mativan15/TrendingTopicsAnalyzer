Welp! Taylor's back with the album we've all been waiting for – ever since Evermore became a global hit in 2021. 
And it's instantly apparent that the Laurel Canyon thing is over. 
Gone, too, is the tasteful sepia, drifting-through-the-New-England-woods aesthetic. There's nothing hippie, nor preppy, about Midnights. 
This is filled with purring, growling synths and tick-tock electronic drum patterns.
It's still unmistakably Swift. This baker's dozen of songs – a concept album of sorts, based on ‘the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life' – are razor-sharp.
