By Australian Associated Press Published: 20:36 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 20:36 EDT, 20 October 2022 Police now have the power to take cash from organised crime gangs in NSW after the "toughest ever" laws targeting rich criminals passed parliament. Suspects with more than $250,000 cash or $2 million in assets will now be subject to a court restraining order if they cannot explain how they made their money. Deputy Premier and Police Minister Paul Toole said the bill that passed on Thursday was part of a broader suite of reforms designed to provide police with what they needed to tackle organised crime in 2022.
