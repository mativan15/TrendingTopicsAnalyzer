Liz Truss will be setting out a new 'plan' for Government at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, a Cabinet minister said after the Prime Miniser tore up her previous blueprint for Britain.

Ms Truss faces a humiliating clash with Sir Keir Starmer, having been forced to dump her entire economic strategy and with her leadership in peril.

It comes amid more gloomy economic news with inflation reaching a fresh 40-year high of 10.
