As wind energy occupies an increasingly large share of the energy landscape, a new study by Colorado State University economists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that more accurate wind forecasts over the last decade have netted consumers over $150 million per year in energy savings.
The study, published in the Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy, is based on NOAA's High Resolution Rapid Refresh model, which provides hourly updated weather forecasts, including wind speed and direction data, for every part of the United States.
