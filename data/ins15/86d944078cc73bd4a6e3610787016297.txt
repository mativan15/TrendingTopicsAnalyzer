The world of NFTs, which exploded last year amid a pandemic-induced cryptomania, notched a fun new milestone today: its first insider-trading indictment.
On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged Nathaniel Chastain, a former Harvard poetry student and Mad Magazine jokester, with a single charge each of wire fraud and money laundering for allegedly front-running the crypto markets by buying up 45 NFTs and then selling them shortly after for at least double the money — and sometimes five times as much, according to the indictment.
