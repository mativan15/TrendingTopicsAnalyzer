If you buy and hold a stock for many years, you'd hope to be making a profit. Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 43% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 32% in that time.

Since the stock has added US$2.9b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns.
