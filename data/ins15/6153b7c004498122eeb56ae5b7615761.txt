The whirlwind of controversy encircling the Chicago rapper born Kanye West may have created widespread ripples of news across business, fashion, politics and social media, but it has raised nary a peep in his hometown, though a few voices are speaking out against his recent outbursts.

The rapper who legally changed his name to Ye has been at the center of a media firestorm that has alienated him from former business partners amid accusations of antisemitism.

Last weekend, he reignited claims of antisemitism following the release of his interview for the podcast 'Drink Champs,' where he questioned the cause of George Floyd's death and recycled old tropes about Jewish money and influence.
