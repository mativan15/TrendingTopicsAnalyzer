By Reuters Published: 10:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 10:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 Oct 17 (Reuters) - The calf injury to Tottenham Hotspur's Richarlison is not as serious as first thought and the Brazil forward should be fit in time for the World Cup, manager Antonio Conte said on Monday. The 25-year-old suffered the injury in the 2-0 Premier League win against his former side Everton at the weekend and later said that he feared he could be ruled out for Qatar. Conte allayed those fears and confirmed that Richarlison, who has 17 goals in 38 appearances for Brazil, would recover before the tournament kicks off on Nov.
