Monica and Evalyn Lee light candles Wednesday at Stephens Lake Park as part of a candlelight vigil for victims of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

A lone 18-year-old gunman on May 24 killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

It was the third-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history behind Virginia Tech University in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.

Columbia middle and high school students with Missouri Youth Voices had two options: They could hold a protest or a candlelight vigil.
