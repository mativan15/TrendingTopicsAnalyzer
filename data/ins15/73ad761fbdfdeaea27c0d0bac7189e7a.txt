The global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering, FATF, is likely to free Pakistan from its inglorious "grey list" on Friday, allowing the country to try to get foreign funds for tiding over its precarious financial situation. The move may come more than four years after the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put Pakistan on its "grey list" for its failure to check the risk of money laundering, leading to corruption and terror financing.The FATF had found Pakistan's deficiencies in its legal, financial, regulatory, investigation, prosecution, judicial and non-government sectors to fight money laundering and combat terror financing, which are considered serious threats to the global financial system.
