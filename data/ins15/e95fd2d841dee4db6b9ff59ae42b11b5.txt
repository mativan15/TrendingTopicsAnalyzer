Republican senators plan to unveil a bill that would bar U.S. app stores including Apple and Google from hosting apps that allow payments to be made with China's digital currency, according to a copy of proposed legislation seen by Reuters. The concern is the payment system could allow Beijing to spy on Americans.The bill is backed by Senators Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and Mike Braun and states that companies that own or control app stores "shall not carry or support any app in [their] app store(s) within the United States that supports or enables transactions in e-CNY.
