Reacting to President Biden's claim there's no "immediate" fix to record-high gas and food prices, Fox News contributor and The King's College Executive Vice President of Business professor Brian Brenberg called Biden on his bluff during "Varney & Co." Thursday. "The president is wrong that he can't do anything. He is dodging this issue," Brenberg told FOX Business' Stuart Varney. "He could have been doing things for months. He could still do things.""The fact that he can't stand up to his own party is absolutely no excuse for not doing anything in this critical issue," the professor continued.
