One thing you might not know about Detroit is how big it is. At 142.9 square miles, it's not as vast as Houston, (599.6 miles), but you can spend hours motoring around the Motor City.

The auto industry still dominates here, including GM (GM), which has its headquarters downtown and assembly plants in the area. In addition, there's GM's Technical Center, the cradle of GM's engineering efforts for almost 70 years. It is a campus befitting of an auto giant. Designed by Eero Saarinen, the grounds cover 710 acres, with 11 miles of roads, over a mile of tunnels, and a pair of lakes (one is some 22 acres) that are used as emergency fire reservoirs.
