JACKSON, Miss. — Mississippi's scandal-plagued welfare program turns away most applicants for cash assistance, and it has not been tracking whether its programs fulfill the goal of lifting people out of poverty in one of the poorest states in the nation, lawmakers were told Tuesday.

Robert G. "Bob" Anderson said that when he became director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services in March 2020, he found the agency had "output numbers" to track spending.

"But we didn't have a lot of outcome information," Anderson said.
