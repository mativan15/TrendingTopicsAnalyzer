If you thought the Olivia Wilde, Jason Sudeikis, and Harry Styles drama was over, well, you thought wrong, because Jason's ex is now part of the ongoing saga.
To recap, Don't Worry Darling director Olivia, 38, and Ted Lasso star Jason, 47, made headlines recently after their former nanny spoke out, claiming the actress made a special salad for new boyfriend Harry, 28, while still engaged to Jason.
MailOnline also claimed that Olivia had prepared a salad for Harry with her ‘special dressing' which enraged Jason, who allegedly ‘tried to prevent her leaving by lying under the car.
