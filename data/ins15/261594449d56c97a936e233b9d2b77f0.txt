"Others must be deterred from committing similar crimes," Judge Carl Nichols said. A federal jury found Bannon guilty of two counts of contempt of Congress, rejecting his claim of executive privilege. The first charge was for failing to appear for a deposition in October 2021, while the second charge was for refusing to turn over records requested by the committee.
