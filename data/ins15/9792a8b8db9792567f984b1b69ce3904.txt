Isiah Pacheco didn't get a ton of the ball, but the times he did see action, the Kansas City Chiefs running back made it count.

A seventh-round pick out of Rutgers, Pacheco had two carries for nine yards and two catches for nine yards in Sunday's Chiefs 24-20 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Pacheco has certainly been a solid Day 3 addition for Kansas City this season.
