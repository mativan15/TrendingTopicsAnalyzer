The defending champion Avalanche are a lot to defend, a vital trait that has so far eluded the division rival Minnesota Wild. Mikko Rantanen scored the go-ahead goal midway through the second period and Nathan Mackinnon and Valeri Nichushkin each had a goal and two assists for the Avalanche, who beat Minnesota 6-3 on Monday night to keep the Wild winless.
