Michael Vi/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) delivered solid results last year, continuing on a momentum seen over the past decade. Although the coming year is expected to generate double digit revenue growth, it would however be the slowest growth rate since its IPO in 2013, driven by a tight labor market. Nevertheless, continued market expansion, a combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, along with a very solid balance sheet suggests bright prospects for the company in the longer run.
