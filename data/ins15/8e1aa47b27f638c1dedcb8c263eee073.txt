NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday rejected suggestions from the West that India's purchases of Russian oil is helping fund the war in Ukraine, saying New Delhi is only working to get the best deal for its citizens amid intense volatility in global energy markets. He noted while participating in an interaction session at the annual Bratislava Forum, organised by the think tank GLOBSEC in the Slovakian capital, that European countries have included carve-outs in sanctions imposed on Russia that allow them to access Russian gas.
