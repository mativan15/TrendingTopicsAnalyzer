George Kambosos Jr will demand a rematch for the undisputed lightweight world title despite being comfortably beaten by Devin Haney last night. 41,129 fans packed into the Marvel Stadium last night to cheer on home fighter Kambosos, who defeated Teofimo Lopez for the unified WBA, WBO and IBF titles last November. But it was Haney who upset the apple cart with a dominating performance over 12 rounds to become the first undisputed champion of the four-belt era. The American was forced to leave promoter Eddie Hearn to sign a relatively unfavourable contract with Top Rank Boxing and Lou DiBella to make the fight happen.
