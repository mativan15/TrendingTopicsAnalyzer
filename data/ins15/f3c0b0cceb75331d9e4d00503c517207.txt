Vishnu during the weekly grievances redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Monday.The petitioners, led by M. Latha, district president, AIDWA, said the government, which was allotting vast tracts of lands to the investors at subsidised cost, should create ‘land bank' by pooling unused poramboke lands to be given to the homeless below poverty line families for constructing permanent houses.
