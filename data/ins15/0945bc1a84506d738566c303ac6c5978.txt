Hingoli MLA Santosh Bangar is again in the eye of the storm, this time for allegedly threatening the district director of agriculture over the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. A delegation of senior agriculture officials, under the banner of Maharashtra Rajya Krishiseva Mahasangh, met Hingoli agriculture commissioner Dheeraj Kumar on Monday to protest against the incident.
In their letter, the Mahasangh alleged that the MLA cornered the director of agriculture in the district over the crop insurance scheme and the various lacunae in it.
