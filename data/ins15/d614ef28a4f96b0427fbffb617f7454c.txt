According to Love Island winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, no one actually did the deed this series.
Life has been pretty hectic for the Turkish actress since she left the Majorcan villa with boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti, bagging herself brand deals and TV appearances left, right, and centre.
However, she hasn't forgotten her roots and is still down to dish the dirt on all things Love Island.
Spilling the beans on the couples' bedroom antics, Ekin-Su revealed that, well, there actually isn't much to spill, as no one had sex during the show.
