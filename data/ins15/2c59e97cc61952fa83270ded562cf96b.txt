JohnnyPowell/E+ via Getty Images Block (NYSE:SQ) is a true fintech disruptor that we have traded several times. The stock has been absolutely decimated in the last few months along with so many other innovative tech names. The stock has fallen a good 70% plus from peak to trough. That said, even with the horrific action in the stock market, the company is still growing sharply and is moving more toward being profitable in a sustainable manner. It is our opinion that shares actually became reasonably valued when they dipped under $100, but at and under $80, we think there is big opportunity to own this disruptive name.
