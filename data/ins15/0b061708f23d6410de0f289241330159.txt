Just weeks after Hurricane Ian ravaged the southwest Florida city of Fort Myers, someone hit a lottery jackpot at a 7-Eleven convenience store on the city's Colonial Boulevard. The individual in Fort Myers was not the only person who purchased a Mega Millions ticket with the winning numbers of 9, 22, 26, 41, 44 and the Mega Ball 19 on Friday. Another winning ticket was purchased in San Jose, California. As of Tuesday morning, neither person had come forward to claim their considerable winnings.How considerable? The jackpot was $494m, which the winners will now likely split — meaning that each person stands to walk away with $247m.
