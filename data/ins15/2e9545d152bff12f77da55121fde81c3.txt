"Insecure" star Issa Rae is criticizing Hollywood for defending Ezra Miller after their "atrocious" behavior. "I'm gonna be real, the stuff that's happening with Ezra Miller is, to me, a microcosm of Hollywood," Rae said, according to Elle Magazine."There's this person who's a repeat offender, who's been behaving atrociously, and as opposed to shutting them down and shutting the production down, there's an effort to save the movie and them."The actress' comments come on the heels of Miller's series of arrests and abuse allegations over the past year.
