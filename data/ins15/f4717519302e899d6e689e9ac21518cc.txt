When you think of 70-inch TVs, you might assume that means an extortionate price. Not with this 70-inch TCL 4K TV, though, which is currently reduced to a fantastic low price of $499.99 at Best Buy (opens in new tab). When it comes to this year's Memorial Day sales, we haven't seen another TV deal that's quite such incredible value for money - and we doubt it'll be beaten across the entire holiday weekend.This TCL 4K TV was originally priced at $829.99 and brought down to $599.
