Another one bites the dust.

Liz Truss handed in her resignation on Thursday afternoon after only 45 days as UK prime minister

She will go down in the history books as the shortest-serving leader in British history (so far), taking the record from George Canning who died of ill health in 1827 after 119 days in office.

The dust has barely settled, but the race to replace Truss as leader of the battered and beleaguered Conservative Party has already started, with a new PM promised by October 28.

Whoever wins will be the UK's fourth leader in just over three years, amid a wave of political turmoil in a country that was once looked at as a beacon of stability.
