Washington Commanders defensive end Chase Young reported to the team's facility Tuesday for this week's session of voluntary offseason workouts, a team official said. The 23-year-old missed the previous week because he was in Colorado, working with a trainer to rehab his knee injury.  Young's attendance — or lack thereof — at the sessions has become a main point of focus ever since he skipped last year's voluntary organized team activities to film commercials. The defensive end defended the decision — 'I was making money, baby!' he said, also noting that he continued to work out on his own — but coach Ron Rivera had said he expected Young to be in Ashburn for OTAs.
