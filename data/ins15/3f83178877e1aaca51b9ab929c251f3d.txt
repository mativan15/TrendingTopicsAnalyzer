Asserting that India's global standing has improved over the past eight years since the NDA Government came to power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that international organisations have begun to accept that 'poverty is reducing in India'.
Modi also underlined security and integrity as the key markers that differentiate his Government from the previous regime, and said that the country's borders are more secure than before and the 'talk' now is about ease of doing business instead of corruption.
