YELLOWKNIFE - Meeka Atagootak says the house in Pond Inlet on Nunavut's Baffin Island that she shares with her children and grandchildren is 'unlivable' 12 years after a water truck hit and damaged it.

The elder says she has had to deal with flooding, rusty pipes, mould and a deteriorating foundation, which have led to frequent health problems.

Getting help has been slow, she says.

'It's been a struggle when no one is really taking care of us,' she recently said in Inuktitut before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Indigenous and Northern Affairs.
