Players often dress up for ring night, but no one on the Warriors did it quite like Draymond Green on Tuesday. Green rolled into Chase Center in a shimmery Kelly green suit with some words for the NBA cameras following him into the arena.
'Looking like money, you know what I'm talking about,' Green said. 'By the way, welcome back to the Warriors Invitational. We back, baby.'
Green isn't one to ignore the elephant in the room, so the green suit and money talk seemed to be pointed comments about his contract situation.
