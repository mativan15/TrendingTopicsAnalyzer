By Australian Associated Press Published: 00:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 00:25 EDT, 17 October 2022 Australia risks plunging into "dangerous populism" unless political donation laws are urgently addressed. It's one view shared at an inquiry into this year's federal election, which is exploring if campaign funding laws need to be tweaked. Existing laws mean only donations more than $14,500 must be publicly disclosed, and there are no spending caps. The government is considering lowering that figure to $1000 and ensuring those donations are declared in real-time.
