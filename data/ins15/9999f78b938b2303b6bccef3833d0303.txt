It's understandable if you feel frustrated when a stock you own sees a lower share price. But sometimes a share price fall can have more to do with market conditions than the performance of the specific business. The Laureate Education, Inc. (NASDAQ:LAUR) is down 37% over a year, but the total shareholder return is 22% once you include the dividend. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 23%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 29% in the last three years.
