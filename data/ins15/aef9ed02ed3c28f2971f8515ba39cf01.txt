A draft of the German government's cannabis legalization measure, which was leaked on Wednesday, indicates the EU country is getting close to legalizing retail distribution, possession and home grow of recreational marijuana. "We are encouraged by most aspects outlined in the draft," Cantor Fitzgerald's Pablo Zuaic said in his latest analyst note, adding that Canadian cannabis giants Tilray Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis Inc. (NASDAQ:ACB) (TSX:ACB) are well positioned to benefit from the cannabis legalization in Germany.
