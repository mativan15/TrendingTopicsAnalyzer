When the parliamentary panel on Information Technology met for the first time after the reconstitution earlier this week, the newly inducted member, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha – who won the April by-poll on a TMC ticket from Asansol in West Bengal – said he was quite impressed by the 'intellects' of the fellow members whereas his knowledge about IT is confined to send text messages and delete them. The otherwise-intense atmosphere became light when CPI-M's Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas suggested, at the end of the meeting, that the panel should make itself productive by ensuring that Sinha is taught how to send WhatsApp messages by the end of its tenure.
