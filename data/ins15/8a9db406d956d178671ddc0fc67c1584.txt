Audiences learned how scary summer secrets could be when I Know What You Did Last Summer hit theaters on Oct. 17, 1997. The Jim Gillespie-directed film follows friends Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry Cox (Ryan Phillippe) and Ray Bronson (Freddy Prinze Jr.) as they're stalked by hook-wielding killer Benjamin Willis (Muse Watson). The scary stalker enters the picture one year after the group covered up a car accident in which they supposedly killed a pedestrian, who ended up being Ben.
