Bath & Body Works Inc. is now in the hair and facial skin care business.

The Columbus-based retailer has been teasing its expansion into those new businesses for at least a year now, but now it's a reality.

Called Moxy, the new line is available online as well as in 11 Bath & Body Works stores in Atlanta, Cleveland and Columbus.

The lineup includes face masks, moisturizers, cleansers, hair masks, shampoos and conditioners. The products are made without phthalates and mineral oils and are not tested on animals.
