(Bloomberg) -- After almost three years of strict Covid-19-related restrictions on travel, Japan reopened its borders to vaccinated travelers on Oct. 11. The border restrictions had resulted in a slump in visitors, from a record of almost 32 million in 2019 to only 246,000 in 2021. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is hoping visitors will give the economy a much-needed boost, and is aiming to attract 5 trillion yen (more than £30.7 billion, or $33.5 billion) in annual tourist spending.  Travelers will be able to take advantage of a strong US dollar, which is at a multi-decade high against the yen, making high-end dining a very attractive prospect.
