No one knows what happened to the lost climate letter. All that is known is this: Alaa Abd El-Fattah, one of Egypt's most high-profile political prisoners, wrote it while on a hunger strike in his Cairo prison cell last month. It was, he explained later, 'about global warming because of the news from Pakistan'. He was concerned about the floods that displaced 33 million people, and what that cataclysm foretold about climate hardships and paltry state responses to come.A visionary technologist and intellectual, Abd El-Fattah's first name – along with the hashtag #FreeAlaa – have become synonymous with the 2011 pro-democracy revolution that turned Cairo's Tahrir Square into a surging sea of young people that ended the three-decade rule of Egypt's dictator Hosni Mubarak.
