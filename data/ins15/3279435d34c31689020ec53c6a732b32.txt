On Saturday, June 4th 2022 American rapper and singer Bryce Vine will play Petco Park's behind the scoreboard venue in support of headliners Dirty Heads. Any stadium gig is a big deal for performers, as the door cracks open to playing the big field on another trip in the not too distant future. It is not easy to describe Bryce's style. It's a mash up of bass heavy rap, combined with a pop flavor, hip-hip choruses and a tinge of punk rock.
