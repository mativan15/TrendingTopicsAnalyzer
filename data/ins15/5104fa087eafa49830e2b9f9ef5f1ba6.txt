 When it comes to cybersecurity in the workplace, younger employees don't really seem to care that much, which is putting their organizations in serious harm's way, new research has claimed.Surveying approximately 1,000 workers using devices issued by their employers, professional services firm EY found Gen Z enterprise employees were more apathetic about cybersecurity than their Boomer counterparts in adhering to their employer's safety policies.This is despite the fact that four in five (83%) of all those surveyed claimed to understand their employer's security protocol.
