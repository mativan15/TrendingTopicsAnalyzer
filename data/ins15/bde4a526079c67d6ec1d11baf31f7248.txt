American College of Cardiology (ACC) donations to lawmakers, candidates, and political action committees (PACs) are back in full swing after a brief suspension following the January 6, 2021 insurrection on the US Capitol building. "I think what January 6 taught us is that we did need to really take a deep dive and reevaluate things," Andrew P. Miller, MD, chair of the ACC's HeartPAC, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology. As previously reported, the HeartPAC executive committee announced just days after the attack on the US Capitol that it would stop all individual and leadership contributions and review its donation policies.
