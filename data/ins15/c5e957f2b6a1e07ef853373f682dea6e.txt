David Hecker/Getty Images News Excelerate Energy (NYSE:EE) has one of the world's largest fleets of floating storage and regasifaction units (FSRUs). They take LNG off trans-ocean vessels and convert the LNG back into normal natural gas to go into a country's pipeline infrastructure. Until recently much of Europe's natural gas was pumped in its natural state via pipelines directly from producing sources in Russia to customers in Germany and elsewhere, with Germany being the biggest customer by far.
