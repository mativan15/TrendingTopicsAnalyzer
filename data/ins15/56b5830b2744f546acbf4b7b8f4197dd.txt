Mumbai: Even as the state is yet to inoculate more than 10% or 10.9 million eligible beneficiaries for their first and 28.1 million for their second dose, more than 375,000 doses are due to expire between June 9 and July 31, a Right to Information (Act) query filed by HT has revealed. The state government, however, has said that all doses will be utilised before their expiry as it has ramped up inoculation efforts through Har Ghar Dastak, an outreach programme, launched on November 3, 2021, and which enters its second phase on June 1.
