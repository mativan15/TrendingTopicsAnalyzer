CBS is wasting little time in locking down its trio of first-year scripted shows. The network has extended the orders for East New York, Fire Country and So Help Me Todd after promising starts for all three. CBS is calling the extensions 'full season orders,' though it hasn't set episode counts for the trio. In the era of shorter season orders, a full run can mean anything from 15 or 16 episodes to the once-standard 22. The pickups for the three shows come as little surprise, as Fire Country, East New York and So Help Me Todd are the three most watched rookie network shows of the 2022-23 season so far.
