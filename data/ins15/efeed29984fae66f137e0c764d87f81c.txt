The prime minister is poised to abandon Boris Johnson's schools legislation and pare back plans to curb industrial action amid mounting concerns among Tory MPs about her authority.The Times has been told that the government will abandon the schools bill tomorrow. It formed part of Johnson's drive to have all schools join an academy trust by 2030 and also included the provision of a new register for children who are absent from schools and more powers for Ofsted, the school inspector.Ministers had already been forced to scrap parts of the legislation after accusations of a Whitehall power grab that would have limited the freedom of academy schools.
