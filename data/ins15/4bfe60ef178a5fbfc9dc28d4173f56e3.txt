SOUTHERN PINES, N.C., June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Golf Association (USGA) CEO Mike Whan takes pride that his organisation is offering a record $10 million purse at this week's U.S. Women's Open but says the prospect of prize money parity with the men's Open is not likely any time soon.The USGA has nearly doubled the purse for the Women's Open in one fell swoop from last year without taking anything from the budget of money-losing areas the administrative body is responsible for, Whan told Reuters on Thursday.
