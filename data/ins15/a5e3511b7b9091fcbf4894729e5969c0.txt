Current plans to monetize WhatsApp do not include placing ads directly on the popular platform, sources told TheStreet.

Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) - Get Meta Platforms Inc. Report is going through a very tough time.

The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is being mocked and is watching the bond of trust with investors crumble day by day. Meta shares are down 62.3% since January, reflected in a fall in market value of nearly $570 billion.

Blame it on formidable rival TikTok for taking market share in ad revenue and on Apple (AAPL) - Get Apple Inc.
