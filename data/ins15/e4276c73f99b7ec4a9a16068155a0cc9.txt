It's fall which means it's getting chillier outside, and we don't mind it at all. The cooler days mean there's no better time to get cozy and wrap up in our favorite blankets. And if you need to refresh your stash, then you have to snag one from Barefoot Dreams. The brand is known for blankets so cozy, you won't want any others. Luckily, you can bring one (or two) home now for under $75 — the blankets typically retail for over $100. QVC has these decorative throws on sale now, but hurry, it's a flash deal which means the sale won't last long.
