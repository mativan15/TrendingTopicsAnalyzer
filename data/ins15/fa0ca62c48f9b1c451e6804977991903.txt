The axing of the energy price guarantee from April next year could lead to almost 11 million UK households falling into fuel poverty, campaigners have warned.The End Fuel Poverty Coalition described the outlook as 'frankly terrifying' and urged the Government to focus on a new package of support and energy market reforms, alongside investment in home insulation and renewables.The predicted increase from the current seven million households in fuel poverty to 10.7 million after the Government lifts its guarantee limiting the average household energy bill to £2,500 from April will then fall slightly – but will still leave 10.
