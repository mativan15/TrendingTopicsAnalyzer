SILVER BAY Superior Hiking Trail needs volunteers The Superior Hiking Trail Association is looking for volunteers for upcoming projects on two sections of the more than 300-mile trail in northeastern Minnesota. A Bean and Bear reroute, scheduled for June 15-June 25, will shift from a muddy section to a more sustainable route, according to organizers. Volunteers will cut brush, dig vegetation and create walking surfaces. It is a 3-mile hike from the Penn Blvd. Trailhead in Silver Bay to the site. Volunteers are also needed to dig, haul material and build a new Spruce Creek bridge July 8-12.
