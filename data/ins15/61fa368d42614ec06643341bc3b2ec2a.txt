A deal that would see NZ Rugby sell a share of its commercial rights to a US investor in return for at least $200 million in cash is fair, but it probably wouldn't be possible to 'put the genie back in the bottle' and there are risks, according to a leaked report. The confidential report, commissioned from consultant PWC by NZ Rugby and circulated in March to provincial rugby unions and the NZ Māori Rugby Board, also said that NZ Rugby did not have an immediate need for all the money. The NZ Rugby Union will hold a special general meeting on Thursday to vote on the transaction, which would see the rugby body spin-off its commercial arm into a new business dubbed CommLP, in which US private equity firm Silver Lake would be allowed to buy a minority stake.
