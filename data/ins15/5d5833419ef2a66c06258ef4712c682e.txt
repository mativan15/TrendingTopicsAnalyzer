The Mississippi River is the latest body of water in North America to be hit by ongoing drought.The second-longest river in the United States, the Mississippi flows 2,350 miles from Lake Itasca, Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. As the water levels continue to recede, Tower Rock, an island in the middle of the Mississippi River, has become accessible by foot for the first time in living memory, CNN reported.People are able to walk to the island when water levels are below 1.5 feet at the Chester, Illinois, river gauge, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation.
