Russian Urals oil currently trades at just under $91 a barrel. That's a $25 discount to Brent crude, which is priced at $116 a barrel. That's opened the window for smaller traders to step in, with Russia still exporting 3.6 million barrels of oil a day by sea, according to the commodities data and analytics firm Kpler. Paramount's founder Niels Troost is now working from Dubai to avoid European sanctions, The Journal said. He's also previously done business with sanctioned Russian oligarch Gennady Timchenko, who is Vladimir Putin's former tennis partner.
