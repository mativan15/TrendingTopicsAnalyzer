Fans of Warhammer 40,000 world are basking in The Emperor's Light this fall in the lead-up to the series' next major video game launch, Darktide. Developed by Swedish studio, Fatshark, the upcoming first-person shooter continues the trend of blood-soaked four-player cooperative bedlam that the team initially delivered with the dark fantasy titles Warhammer: End Times – Vermintide and Warhammer: Vermintide 2. Set in the endless inter-species war 41st Millennium, Darktide centers around the hive city of Tertium, with players teaming up to battle vicious hoards on behalf of The Imperium — an authoritarian in-game government that's trying to hold together a decaying galactic empire.
