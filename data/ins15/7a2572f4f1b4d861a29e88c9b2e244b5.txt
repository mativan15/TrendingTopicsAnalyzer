Arvida Group Limited (NZSE:ARV) came out with its yearly results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. Revenues disappointed slightly, as sales of NZ$208m were 4.4% below what the analysts had predicted. Profits were a relative bright spot, with statutory per-share earnings of NZ$0.32 coming in 13% above what was anticipated. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual.
