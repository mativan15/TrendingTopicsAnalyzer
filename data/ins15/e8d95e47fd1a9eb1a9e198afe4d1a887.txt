House Democrats unveiled plans on Tuesday to introduce eight separate bills aimed at reducing gun violence after last week's Texas school massacre and the racist rampage in Buffalo.The Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), plans to take up a package of bills dubbed the Protecting Our Kids Act, including measures to raise the age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 from 18 and ban most high-capacity magazines.Other bills would tighten background checks, enact stricter rules for storing guns, and beef up penalties for gun trafficking and so-called 'straw man' purchases to evade rules.
