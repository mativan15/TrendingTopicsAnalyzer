A huge fire has broken out amid clashes at Tehran's Evin prison, where many of Iran's political and dual-national detainees are held, according to officials and witnesses.
State news agency IRNA said eight people were injured in Saturday's unrest, which erupted after nearly a month of protests across Iran over the death in detention of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman.
The protests have posed one of the most serious challenges to the Iranian government since the 1979 revolution, with demonstrations spreading across the country and some people chanting for the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
