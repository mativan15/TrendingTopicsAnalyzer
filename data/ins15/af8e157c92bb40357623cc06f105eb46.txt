A quick chat with Mary Biggs, operations manager of Featherston Booktown Karukatea Festival, running June 8-12, 2022. What's one place you'd take every visitor to in NZ and why? Besides the Featherston Booktown Karukatea Festival, you mean? The Wairarapa south coast, every time. I take friends and family to the Lake Ferry Hotel for the freshest fish and chip lunch, then onto the iconic Ngawi fishing village and Cape Palliser lighthouse before a lovely, meandering drive back to Featherston. What's your secret backyard favourite spot? I just love Riversdale Beach and the road trip out there.
