Mumbai: MX Player, India's leading video streaming platform from Times Internet, has decided to allow its users to opt for the premium ad-free service and pay later, unlike other industry players, where a user has to pay upfront for the monthly or annual subscriptions. The ‘watch-now-pay-later' offering from MX Gold is a first for the streaming sector globally.

"We are breaking the moulds of how entertainment has been consumed till date," said Abhishek Joshi, Business Head-SVOD (Subscription Business) and Business Partnerships, MX Player.
