CannTrust Holdings Inc. was a high-flying stock in the early days after recreational cannabis was legalized but it all came crashing down less than a year later, in the summer of 2019, when Health Canada sanctioned the Vaughan, Ont.-based company for unlicensed cultivation and for providing inaccurate information to the regulator.

Now, former chief executive Peter Aceto and two former directors are on trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, facing quasi-criminal charges including fraud and insider trading, which were laid in June 2021 following a months-long investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission and the RCMP.
