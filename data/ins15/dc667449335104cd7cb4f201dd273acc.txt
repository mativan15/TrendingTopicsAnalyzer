Osborne Country music has traditionally been slow to acknowledge societal changes, and white performers have dominated the genre. Over the years, there have been a few stars of color, but in 2019, the real bomb dropped. 'I think it's pretty amazing,' offers documentarian Ken Burns, 'that the number 1 country single of all time is by a gay Black cowboy.' Burns is referencing 'Old Town Road,' by Lil Nas X, a song that was then so controversial that the initial recording of the song was deemed outside the bounds of the genre and pulled from the country charts.
