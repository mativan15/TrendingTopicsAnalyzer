It's not clear who provided a cache of text messages from the phone of former senator Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. That the messages overlap with the period after the 2020 election and Loeffler's own failed bid to hold her seat is probably not a coincidence, though, as they may have been turned over in response to a subpoena - and that period is subject to no shortage of legal wrangling.

What's revealed in them is telling, if not surprising. While we know that Loeffler and other Republicans were facing explicit pressure from Donald Trump to support his false assertions about the election results, the messages suggest that Loeffler and her team were also influenced heavily by the implicit power wielded by Trump's angry base of support.
