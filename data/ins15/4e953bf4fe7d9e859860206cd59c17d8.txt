Jacinda Ardern has said the decision to scrap funding for a long-running Shakespere education festival is not 'indicative of a culture war in New Zealand'. Creative New Zealand (CNZ) has been accused of 'cancelling' the Bard by cutting its funding of the Shakespeare Globe Centre of New Zealand. The issue has promted international headlines after a CNZ assessor claimed Shakespeare was 'locked within a canon of imperialism' and the text was not relevant to 'the contemporary art context of Aotearoa'.
