On January 1, 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, one of Haiti's founding fathers, and the first Black head of state in the Americas, declared the country's independence after a fourteen-year war with European colonial powers. The revolution severed Saint-Domingue, as the country was then known, from French colonial rule. It also liberated the enslaved and established Haiti as the world's first Black republic. 'We have dared to be free, let us be thus by ourselves and for ourselves,' Dessalines declared, but his leadership of the newly autonomous nation would be short-lived: on October 17, 1806, he was assassinated by political rivals and left behind a splintered country.
