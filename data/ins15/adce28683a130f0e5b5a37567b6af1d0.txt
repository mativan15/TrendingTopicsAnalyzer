Maks_Lab/iStock via Getty Images N-Able (NYSE:NABL) rose 2% at least partly amid a report that the cloud-based software solutions company could become an acquisition target. N-Able may be a potential takeover candidate after it was spun out of Silver Lake and Thoma-Bravo backed Solarwinds (SWI) last July, according to an earlier Dealreporter item. N-Able is viewed as a target after peer Datto Holding (MSP) agreed to be acquired by Kaseya for $35.50/share last month. The Kaseya CEO told Dealreporter that he thought there may have as been as many as 10 or 15 bidders for Datto (MSP).
