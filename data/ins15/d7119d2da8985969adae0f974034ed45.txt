Listen to this story: Berlin, Germany – Having visited the German capital twice before, Polina Punegova, from the Russian port city of St Petersburg, had often told her Ukrainian partner Yulia Maznyk that she would love Berlin's architecture, graffitied streets and spirit of open-mindedness, and that they should visit together.
But following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Moscow-based couple found themselves in Berlin in less than holiday-like circumstances.
They were visiting Budapest when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.
