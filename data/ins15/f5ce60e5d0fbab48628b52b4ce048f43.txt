Everything's gone right for Oklahoma Sooners since the start of the NCAA tournament. With their 7-1 win over the UCF Golden Knights, the Sooners clinched their sixth-straight appearance to the Women's College World Series and their 12th overall.

They've outscored opponents 52-3 in five games.

On Saturday afternoon in a packed Marita Hynes Field, the Sooners were once again phenomenal. Nicole May threw a complete game, allowing just one earned run on three hits while striking out four. She only allowed five baserunners all game and continued to reward Patty Gasso's faith in the Sooners' pitching staff minus Jordy Bahl.
