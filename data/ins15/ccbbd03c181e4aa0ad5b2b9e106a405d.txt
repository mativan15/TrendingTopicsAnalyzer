We built an Instant Review System (IRS) for badminton, also named a Challenge System. It allows players to verify linesmen in/out decisions and makes the game fairer. Elements such as lighting, the influence of air-conditioning on the flight trajectory, or the moving mats can significantly impact the final in/out decision. Due to the construction of the shuttlecock, it behaves differently during the flight than, for example, a tennis ball. This publication discusses the problems we encountered during our work with the proposed solution.
