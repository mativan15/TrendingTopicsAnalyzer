BOSTON–The Philadelphia 76ers are set to begin another title quest on Tuesday when they open the season on the road against the Boston Celtics. In order for the Sixers to get to where they want to go, they will have to go through Boston so this is a nice early test.
The Sixers have added a lot of additions in order to improve the depth and the supporting cast around stars Joel Embiid and James Harden, but they will be counting on some mainstays to help as well.
One of those players is Furkan Korkmaz who has kind of become a bit of an afterthought in Philadelphia.
