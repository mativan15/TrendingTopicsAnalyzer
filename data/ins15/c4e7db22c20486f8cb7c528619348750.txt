I went out for pizza the other night, but had to eat it in my car.That's because the Frank Pepe's in Manchester, Connecticut had this sign on its door.'Attention: Dining Room closed after 4 p.m. today due to staffing shortages.'So I ate in my SUV, no problem, (the pizza was fantastic), but it made me think 1) this can't be good for Frank Pepe's, and 2) the note on the door is literally a sign of the times.A sign we're living in a world where supply shortages — employees, oil, semiconductors — are commonplace and impacting the economy to a degree we haven't seen for decades.
