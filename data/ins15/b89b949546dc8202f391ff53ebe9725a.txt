MSNBC's Chris Hayes claimed that Democrats must fight to lower gas prices in order to save our democracy from "existential peril."The host of "All In with Chris Hayes" argued Wednesday that high gas prices are bad, not because they affect the lives of everyday Americans, but because they'll encourage people to vote for Republicans in the midterms, who are "under the thrall of the guy who tried a violent coup."Hayes worried that high gas prices will force voters to choose 2020 "election deniers" in the upcoming elections.
