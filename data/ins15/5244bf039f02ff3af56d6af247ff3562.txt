Is it a throwback or the future of social media? Instagram is testing out a new internal feature that would enable users to add a song to their profiles. Tech leaker and developer Alessandro Paluzzi first shared the news on Twitter on Monday, which ignited nostalgic comparisons to MySpace. However, the feature "is an internal prototype, and not testing externally," said Meta spokesperson Christine Pai in an email statement.Paluzzi, who's known for uncovering app updates through reverse engineering, tweeted screenshots about the potential feature and how it would work.
