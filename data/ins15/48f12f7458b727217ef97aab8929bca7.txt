After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Western nations, including the United States and those in Europe, were quick to slap punitive sanctions on the country. The idea was to punish Russia for the invasion by collapsing its economy. President Biden told the public the goal was to 'reduce the ruble to rubble.'
Eight months later, it is clear that this has not worked. The ruble is not 'rubble' — in fact, it is stronger than it was before the war in February, having risen around 23% against the dollar.
