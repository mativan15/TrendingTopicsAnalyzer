France's national linguistic watchdog, the Académie Française, has banned the official usage of a number of phrases borrowed from English to describe the world of gaming. 
Instead of 'esports,' government workers should refer to 'jeu video de competition.' Instead of talk of 'pro-gamers,' they must discuss the activity of the 'joueur professionnel.' And instead of 'streamers,' they must refer to the 'joueur-animateur en direct' — and so on.
