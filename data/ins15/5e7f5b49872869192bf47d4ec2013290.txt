That's why they built the Samaritan app- where you can help your unsheltered neighbors achieve increased stability and health. It's easy and takes under a minute - be part of the solution by downloading the Samaritan app from here. Dignity Health and California Hospital Medical Center (CHMC) recently partnered with Health Care LA (HCLA) to provide homeless patients with memberships to Samaritan, a platform that gives members direct financial and social support towards housing and life goals.
