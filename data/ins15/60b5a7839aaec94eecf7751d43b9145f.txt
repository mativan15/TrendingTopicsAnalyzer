This article originally appeared on VICE Netherlands.Polina Frank, 22, is a tattoo artist and journalism graduate from Kyiv. I meet her on a sunny Tuesday evening at Amsterdam's Mosel Mosel tattoo parlour, where she's currently working. Despite the late hour, Frank is busy filling in the last remaining spot on an Italian woman's leg with a psychedelic motif. Above her hangs a piece of paper with bank account details of Ukrainian organisations accepting donations. Frank is among the 6.6 million refugees who have fled Ukraine in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.
