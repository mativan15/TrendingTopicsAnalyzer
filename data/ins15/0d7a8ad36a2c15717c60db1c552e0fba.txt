Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, took a few new positions in the 2022 first quarter, including insurance company Markel (MKL 1.95%). That's an interesting partnership since Markel is often referred to as a "baby Berkshire," meaning it's reminiscent of Berkshire Hathaway itself. But it should evoke more interest than just being a Buffett pick since it's beating the market so far in 2022. In fact, it's actually up 12% in 2022, while the S&P 500 is down 16%. So should you be like Buffett and invest in Markel?
Another Berkshire Hathaway in the making?
Markel has been around for a long time, since its humble beginnings as an alternative insurer in 1930.
