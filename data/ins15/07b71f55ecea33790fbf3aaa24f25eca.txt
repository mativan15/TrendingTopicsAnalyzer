1. The Perils of Trying to
Fix Your Garage Door
Yourself 2. Many homeowners claim to be DIY experts, while others simply begrudge paying

doors, the temptation to fix it themselves will always be there for DIYers or
anyone who refuses to accept the fact that the work may be beyond their
capabilities. While a scattering of homeowners may have the knowledge, tools
and training to repair their own garage doors, most do not, and since garage
doors are heavy objects that can cause damage to property or injury to
individuals, it's never a wise idea to attempt any repairs without the help of a
garage door technician.
