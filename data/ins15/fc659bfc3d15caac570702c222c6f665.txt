Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has entered into an agreement to purchase Parler, a social media site popular with Trump loyalists, the company announced on Monday. The surprise move comes days after Twitter and Instagram locked Ye's accounts over a series of antisemitic posts that were widely condemned. Parler, which calls itself the "pioneering uncancelable free speech platform," characterized the restrictions Twitter and Instagram placed on his accounts as censorship, arguing that Parler's more hands-off approach to content moderation ensures that all voices can be heard.
