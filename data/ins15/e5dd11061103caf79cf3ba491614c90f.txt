The Financial Times magazine How To Spend It has long provided inspiration to bankers wanting to blow their bonuses on designer goods – but the publication has been rebranded because spending big is no longer seen as a positive quality.The luxury magazine, packaged with the FT's Weekend edition, is stuffed with expensive adverts for high-end watches, safaris, and luxury yachts aimed at its jet-set wealthy readership – making it a money-spinner for the newspaper.Yet the FT says the How To Spend It name no longer reflects the 'changing times and priorities' in a world of financial inequality and the invasion of Ukraine.
