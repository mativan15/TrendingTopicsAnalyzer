Mayors of Alberta's mid-sized cities gathered in Airdrie to talk shop Thursday, and first on the to-discuss list was the new Danielle Smith government. Leaders from 24 communities met for the Mid-Sized Cities Mayor's Caucus, a biannual in-person event that will run for two days. Amongst a rocky few years in the municipal-provincial relationship, many preached collaboration and communication as a new premier takes over. "I hope they focus on the fundamentals and deal with the real important issues," Airdrie Mayor Peter Brown said.
