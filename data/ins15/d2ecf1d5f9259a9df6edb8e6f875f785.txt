Ankiti Bose, who was fired last week as chief executive officer of the Singapore startup Zilingo Pte, says she'll keep fighting to clear her name.
The fashion e-commerce platform terminated her employment after an investigation into claims of what it called 'serious financial irregularities' and said it 'reserves the right to pursue appropriate legal action.' The probe included questions about Zilingo's accounting practices and payments to several service providers of more than $7 million that were signed by her without the knowledge of senior executives, according to people familiar with the matter.
