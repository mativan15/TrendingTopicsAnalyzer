The Apple AirPods have returned to their lowest-seen price ever, thanks to this excellent Jubilee weekend deal from Amazon. So without further ado, allow us to announce that the second-gen Apple wireless earbuds have now been reduced from £119 to just £99 (opens in new tab). If that £20 saving doesn't seem worthy of 70 years of service, consider that the ever-popular AirPods 2 originally launched at £159, so it really is a right royal bargain – and a price we haven't seen in months.
