May 27—ANDERSON — Rep. Terri Austin is advocating measures at the state level to ease the burden of inflation on residents.

Austin, D-Anderson, on Friday proposed that Indiana residents be given a large share of the state's $6 billion surplus.

Democrats in the Indiana General Assembly attempted to have lawmakers consider a measure to suspend the state's gasoline tax for a period of time to provide motorists with relief at the gas pump.

The Republican majority at the Legislature declined to consider the request.
