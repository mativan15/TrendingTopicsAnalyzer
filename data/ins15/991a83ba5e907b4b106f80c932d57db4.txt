The NBA season starts on Tuesday night with an awesome doubleheader. First up, two of the presumed top teams in the East square off in Boston as the 76ers meet the Celtics. After trading for James Harden at the deadline last year, this will be the first full season with Harden playing in Philadelphia alongside MVP candidate Joel Embiid. The Celtics reached the NBA Finals last season and return with largely the same team, adding point guard Malcom Brogdon to a lineup centered around Jaylen Brown, Jason Tatum and NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart.
