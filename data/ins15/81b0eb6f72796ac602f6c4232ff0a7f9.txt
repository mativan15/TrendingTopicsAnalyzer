The Brooklyn Nets ended their preseason with two big victories but even star guard Kyrie Irving understands that the team will have to work hard all season long if they have any championship aspirations.
Basketball journalist Nick Friedell of ESPN spoke to Irving on the season's start. Irving said, 'We got to dance every night — 82 games and perform well. So I like to think of it as going on like a tour and we get to be able to bond.'
Kyrie Irving missed a lot of playing time last season due to local vaccination requirements, but he hopes to be able to compete at a high level for the entirety of the 2022-23 season.
