Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images News Stock index futures point to a lower open Friday, with social media stocks struggling and longer rates still on the rise. But the major averages are still on track for a winning week, all up more than 2%. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) -1%, S&P futures (SPX) -0.7% and Dow futures (INDU) -0.5% are lower. "I remain bearish on riskier assets for now, though will reassess this view if/when the S&P manages to break north of the 3,800 mark," Caxton's Michael Brown said.
