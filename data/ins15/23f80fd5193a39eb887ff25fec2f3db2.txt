jittawit.21Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is one of the best real estate investment trusts on the market right now for income investors. According to the Relative Strength Index, the trust has formed a double-top formation, is now in a short-term down channel, and is oversold. At the same time, Realty Income provides one of the most secure and consistent dividend growth rates in the real estate investment trust sector. Since the trust's stock price has dropped to $55 in the last two months, I believe there is an opportunity for income investors here even if Realty Income's stock price falls further.
