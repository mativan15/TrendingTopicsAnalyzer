Fleur East absolutely brought the house down with the first Argentine tango of Strictly Come Dancing this series – and one person in particular got a little too excited.
The former X Factor star was devastated after finding herself in the dance-off last week, but survived to dance another week as Richie Anderson and Giovanni Pernice were eliminated.
However, she well and truly came back fighting with a fiery tango with Italian pro Vito Coppola to Paint It Black by Ciara, leaving everyone hot under the collar.
