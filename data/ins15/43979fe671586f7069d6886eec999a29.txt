One of the highly anticipated announcements the Shiba Inu community looks forward to is the Beta testing and release of the documentation of Shibarium. And, based on several tweets from key figures in the development team, it looks like an announcement related to the Layer-2 solution could happen sometime this week.
Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, previously teased that they will no longer take calls until after the Mercury Retrograde is over. Interestingly, the Mercury Retrograde ends on Friday and while Kusama did not say anything about it, some investors speculate a major announcement could happen.
