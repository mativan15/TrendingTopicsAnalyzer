Florida Keys

A Florida Keys man with a history of pulling off elaborate cyber crimes, forgeries and counterfeit schemes 10 years ago was sentenced this week to three years in federal prison, after pleading guilty to faking documents used to create a bogus pilot's license to steal a private jet.

Cole Peacock, 30, has a storied criminal career of clever crimes straight out of a Hollywood script.

These include defrauding a Tennessee tech company out of $3 million in computer equipment in 2016, impersonating a Monroe County Fire Rescue lieutenant in 2019, and sending a bomb threat to the sheriff's office after hacking into the agency's computer system, making it appear as if the treat came from within the department back in 2013.
