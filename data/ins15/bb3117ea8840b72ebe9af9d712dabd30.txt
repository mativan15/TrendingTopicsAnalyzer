German Chancellor Olaf Scholz ordered an extension in the life of the country's three remaining nuclear plants until mid-April 2023 -- a dramatic reversal of an earlier decision by Economy Minister Robert Habeck -- as the country contends with an unprecedented energy crisis.

Scholz's decision, which came late Monday after a day of speculation, is designed to end a standoff between his two coalition partners, the Greens and the Liberals. While Habeck's Greens are ideologically opposed to nuclear power, the business-friendly Free Democrats under the leadership of Finance Minister Christian Lindner argue that Germany should use all the generation capacity available to tackle the crisis.
