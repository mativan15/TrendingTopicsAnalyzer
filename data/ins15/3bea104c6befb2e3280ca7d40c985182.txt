Days after Chief Minister M.K. Stalin visited a taluk office and spotted a few 'deficiencies' in services, the Commissionerate of Revenue Administration has constituted a quality assurance cell to curb the tendencies of some tahsildars and other field officers to reject online applications for certificates on flimsy and untenable grounds. During surprise visits in taluk offices and interactions with citizens at e-Sevai centres, 'it has come to [our] notice that some tahsildars and other field officers handling the processing of online certificate applications have been rejecting applications on flimsy and untenable grounds, causing harassment to citizens,' according to a communication sent by the Commissionerate of Revenue Administration to all the Collectors.
