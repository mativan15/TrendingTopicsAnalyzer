Tech titan Elon Musk took to Twitter recently to share yet another controversial take, this time espousing his belief that a recession would be 'good' for the American economy.Writing late Thursday night in response to a Twitter user's question about whether the US was headed towards another recession, the Tesla CEO replied with an emphatic, 'Yes'. He then went on to explain why this economic downturn, which for most Americans would be viewed as a bad thing (during the 2008 housing crisis, 3.6 million jobs were lost, and more than one million homes were lost to foreclosure), was, in his view, a net positive.
