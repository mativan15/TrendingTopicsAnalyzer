7:33 PM ETCLEVELAND -- José Ramírez didn't let a torn thumb ligament stop him from leading the Guardians during a surprising season.Cleveland's All-Star third baseman played the second half -- as well as the team's playoff run that ended Tuesday in the AL Division Series -- with a torn right thumb ligament that will require surgery.The team said Ramírez injured the ulnar collateral ligament in his thumb during a June game in Los Angeles. The 30-year-old could have opted for surgery, which would have sidelined him for two months, but decided to keep playing.
