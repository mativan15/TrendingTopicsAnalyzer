Stocks climbed after the S&P 500 breached a technical level that has triggered gains in the past, with risk appetite improving as more of U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss's unfunded tax cuts were reversed. The breadth of the rally was so strong that at one point over 99 per cent of the companies in the U.S. benchmark were rising, with the gauge pushing away from its 200-week moving average. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed. Bank of America Corp. surged on solid earnings. This year's equity rout has left the S&P 500 testing a 'serious floor of support,' Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson wrote, adding he 'would not rule out' a rally to about 4,150 points -- suggesting a 16 per cent upside from Friday.
