Europe's STOXX 600 rose for the fourth straight session on Tuesday, building on the previous session's rally that was driven by Britain's reversal of its fiscal plan, with investors keeping a watch on earnings to gauge the economic outlook.The region-wide index ended 0.34% higher. It logged its best day in near two weeks on Monday after Britain's new finance minister Jeremy Hunt scrapped most of Prime Minister Liz Truss's 45 billion pounds of unfunded tax cuts that led to market turmoil and forced the Bank of England to intervene.
