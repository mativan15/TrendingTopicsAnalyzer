Marvin Vettori thinks Luke Rockhold will suffer another knockout loss in his return.
Rockhold (16-5 MMA, 6-4 UFC) is expected to face Paulo Costa (13-2 MMA, 5-2 UFC) on Aug. 20 in what will be his first fight since July 2019.
The former middleweight champion has been knocked out in his past three octagon losses and Vettori (18-4-1 MMA, 8-3-1 UFC) sees the same fate for him when he takes on Brazilian powerhouse Costa.
'I see Luke Rockhold losing the few brain cells that he has left in his brain and just going to sleep badly for a few minutes,' Vettori said in an interview with Helen Yee.
