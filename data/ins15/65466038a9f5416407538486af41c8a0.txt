Xi Jinping has already rewritten China's rules of political succession. The end of the Communist Party's congress will show how far he intends to go.

The twice-a-decade gathering is expected to culminate around noon Saturday with the announcement of a new Central Committee, about 200 of the nation's most powerful ministers, executives and generals. Xi's presence on the list will provide the first official confirmation that the 69-year-old leader intends to ignore the party's unofficial retirement age of 68.
