Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers during the third quarter, marking a major turnaround for the streaming giant that has been plagued by declining growth during the past year. The streamer now has just over 223 million subscribers and is projecting to add another 4.5 million subscribers during the fourth quarter. Total revenue during Q3 reached $7.92 billion. Tuesday's earnings represent the first time this year that Netflix has added subscribers. Netflix lost 970,000 subscribers during the second quarter and 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter — losses that sent the company's stock price downward and resulted in staff morale taking a major hit in light of layoffs and a pull back on company spending growth.
