Legacy Redevelopment Corp. President and CEO Terese Caro is shown May 13 at the organization's offices at 1536 W. North Ave. in Milwaukee. Legacy Redevelopment is one of two organizations to receive money from Northwestern Mutual to provide assistance for minority-owned businesses to get capital to grow.

Starting a business is easier than most people think, but getting access to capital to grow and maintain that business is where the difficulties lie.

For Black Americans, getting access to funding has been historically challenging, but Northwestern Mutual is trying to lessen the burdens of entrepreneurs in Milwaukee.
