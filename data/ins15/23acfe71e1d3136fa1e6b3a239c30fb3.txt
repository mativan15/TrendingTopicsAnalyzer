It's a tough time to be a crypto investor. The cryptocurrency sector, as a whole, lost more than $1 trillion in a matter of months, as major tokens have seen their prices plummet.
Bitcoin (BTC 0.96%), for example, has fallen nearly 53% from its peak in November. Ethereum (ETH -1.41%) is down nearly 60% in that time frame. And Solana, one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies of 2021, has plummeted by more than 80%.
If you've invested in crypto (or are considering buying now), this slump can be alarming.
