At a time when large IT companies are scouting for talent in cities like bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi and Mumbai, India's first software unicorn Zoho is trying to go to the heartlands of the country. Zoho's billionaire founder Sridhar Vembu himself moved to a small village named Tenkasi about three years ago and has been working from there ever since. At an interview with ETCIO in Bengaluru, Vembu, clad in leather chappals and a Veshti, talked about the importance of developing talent in rural areas and how he's working towards giving back to the community.
