Paul Hollywood, 56, has spoken out about the emotional toll The Great British Bake Off moving from BBC to Channel 4 had on him. The beloved baking show switched channels in 2016 and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc announced they would not be returning, as did judge Mary Berry who said she made her decision out of 'loyalty' to the BBC.It was soon confirmed that Paul would continue as a judge on Channel 4 which prompted some backlash on social media.Famously, Bake Off 2013 runner-up, Ruby Tandoh, unleashed her fury in a series of tweets.
