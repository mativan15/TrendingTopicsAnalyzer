A Montreal-based child and family services agency isn't serious about improving care for Indigenous youth, and no one is holding it accountable, an advocate for Indigenous people said Friday.
Nakuset, director of the Native Women's Shelter of Montreal, says that while Batshaw Youth and Family Centres has received recommendations from Indigenous communities and the province's human rights commission, the agency isn't implementing them.Her comments are in reaction to an incident in April that only became public recently, in which an Inuk teenager at a Batshaw rehabilitation centre north of Montreal was allegedly put in isolation despite being in pain and needing emergency surgery.
