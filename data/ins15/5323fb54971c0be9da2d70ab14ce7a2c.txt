Mumbai: Maharashtra will embark on setting up new solar plants across districts to generate 12,000MW renewable energy in the next six years, MSEDCL managing director Vijay Singhal announced on Friday. This will ensure there is no shortfall in electricity supply due to growing demand for power across the state, especially during summer months when consumption has peaked to over 28,000 MW recently.Singhal said that the key focus will now be on solar, wind and renewables, especially after the state received a huge investment of Rs 50,000 crore for renewable energy signed with ReNew Power, one of India's leading renewable energy companies, at Davos earlier this week.
