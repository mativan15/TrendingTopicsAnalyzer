(Bloomberg) -- A local election in Northern Ireland will be held this year if the region's power-sharing government is not restored before the end of October, UK Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said Tuesday. The Democratic Unionist party is currently refusing to participate in the government unless the UK moves to override the post-Brexit agreement which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market. Unionists object to the deal because they believe it treats the region differently to the rest of the UK.
