THE WINE YOGI IS BACK! And we are shifting gears just a bit to broaden our segment and now it's Foodie Friday! Kristal and I went on a field trip yesterday to Trompeau Bakery on South Broadway in Englewood and we will have a full report. The Wine Yogi's blog on our field trip can be found here, and we both highly recommend this gem of a bakery! I brought Chuck a cherry cheese danish and he asked where the bakery was from us. When I told him Englewood, he said, "Thank God it's not super close or I'd weigh a billion pounds in a month".
