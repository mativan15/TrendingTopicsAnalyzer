ATLANTA — Democratic candidates in the two marquee Georgia races are blitzing the airwaves with television ads — and making two markedly different pitches to voters.

A new spot cut by Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, presents her as a 'math whiz' with bold progressive ideas to raise teacher pay, extend child care and fund preschool. Another ad vows to put Georgia's surplus toward fresh stimulus checks for the middle class and to expand affordable housing.

Meanwhile, Sen. Raphael Warnock is running as an independent-minded legislator and highlighting bipartisan pursuits like capping insulin costs as he seeks a full six-year term.
