The U.S. Justice Department on Monday asked a federal judge to sentence former President Donald Trump's adviser Steve Bannon to six months behind bars, saying he pursued a 'bad faith strategy defiance and contempt' against the congressional committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Bannon, an influential far-right political figure, was convicted in July on two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena.
Each count is punishable by between 30 days to one year in prison and a fine ranging between US$100 to US$100,000.
