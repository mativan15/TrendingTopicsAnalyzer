Police are on the hunt for a serial bank robber they say has netted $15,000 in a two-borough crime spree that began in April.

The suspect has hit banks in Queens and Manhattan, first targeting the Queens County Savings Bank in Woodhaven, Queens around 10 a.m. on April 5th.

In that robbery, police said, the suspect demanded money from a teller by handing over a black bag and a note that said: 'I'm not joking, I will shoot everyone.'

The rest of his heists have followed the same pattern, cops said.
