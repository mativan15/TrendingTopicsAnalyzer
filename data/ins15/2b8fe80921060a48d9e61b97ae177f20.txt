Published: 15:34 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 15:34 EDT, 18 October 2022 Ohio State's powerful offense might get a stern test from one of the nation's best defenses on Saturday when the No. 2 Buckeyes host Iowa in a rare matchup of the conference opponents. The Buckeyes (6-0, 3-0) and Hawkeyes (3-3, 1-2) had last weekend off, so they've had plenty of time to prepare for their first encounter since Iowa's 55-24 upset in 2017 and only the teams' second meeting in 11 years. Iowa has not played at Columbus since a 34-24 loss in 2013, and the most recent Hawkeyes' victory in Ohio Stadium was 16-9 in 1991.
