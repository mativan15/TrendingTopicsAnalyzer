Love Island 2022 star Davide Sanclimenti runs a shisha business providing ‘only the finest' hookah products to restaurants and nightclubs.
Yep, forget Chuggs and his bucket hat biz of yesteryear, there's a new entrepreneur in town.
David, who is one of the singletons on the line-up for the new series and set to enter the Majorcan villa next week, is the director of S Deluxe Shisha, which is primarily based in the North West.
The company provides electronic shisha devices from ‘the best manufacturers' in the world' and offers catering services to venues across Manchester.
