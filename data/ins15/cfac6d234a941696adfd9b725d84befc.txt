Politics Oct 21, 2022 2:56 PM EDT The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued a subpoena to Donald Trump. The nine-member panel sent a letter to the former president's lawyers on Friday, demanding his testimony under oath by mid-November and outlining a request for a series of corresponding documents.
The decision by lawmakers to exercise their subpoena power comes a week after the committee made its final case against the former president, who they say 'personally orchestrated' a multi-part effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
