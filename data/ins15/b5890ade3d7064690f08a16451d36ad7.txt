Vestria Capital is looking to give more investors access to the booming market of breakaway investment advisors.Registered investment advisors, more commonly known in the industry as RIAs, are a segment of the wealth industry managing $110 trillions of assets made up of wealth managers that have typically launched after leaving a big brand like Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. Over the last few years, the industry's largest RIAs have attracted investment from private-equity firms including KKR, Bain Capital, and Warburg Pincus.
