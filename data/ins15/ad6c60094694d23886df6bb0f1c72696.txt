Singles can play Cue'd Up by navigating to the "Explore" section in the Plenty of Fish app. Each Cue'd Up game consists of a small group of singles (six players max), and four rounds of gameplay. During each round, the players are presented with a humorous "cue" and are given 40 seconds to respond. From there, the responses are anonymously shared with the group and each player votes for their favorite answer. At the end of each game, the players see who they are most compatible with based on how they voted, and can continue the conversation with their matches in a one-on-one chat or join another game with new singles.
