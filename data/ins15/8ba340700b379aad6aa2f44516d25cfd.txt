Lufthansa is updating its long-haul customer experience with a suite of new seats it's calling Allegris.

Lufthansa will replace more than 30,000 seats throughout its fleet as part of a $2.5 billion refresh.

Take a look at the new suites.

Lufthansa's new first class suites will have closeable doors that offer passengers a private dining experience on caviar and other gourmet foods at a restaurant-style table when the new premium seats debut next year on the German flag carrier's long-haul flights.
