South Korean carmaker Hyundai is taking too long to weed out child labor.The company intends to 'sever relations' with two Alabama plants under scrutiny for child labor violations 'as soon as possible,' chief operating officer Jose Munoz told Reuters yesterday (Oct. 19). Reading between the lines, it hasn't cut ties yet—even though the first headlines around the unlawful activity came up three months ago.With less than a week to go before reporting earnings, Hyundai must take swift action. Not only will working with such suppliers do reputational damage, they can also hurt business by resulting in hefty fines and productivity losses.
