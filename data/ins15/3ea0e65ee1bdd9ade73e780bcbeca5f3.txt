Tory MPs have been told a Labour vote in the Commons seeking to ban fracking is being treated as a 'confidence motion' in Liz Truss's embattled Government.Conservative deputy chief whip Craig Whittaker warned his MPs that Wednesday afternoon's vote is a '100% hard' three-line whip.The dozens of Conservatives who oppose fracking face being kicked out of the parliamentary party if they do not back the Government's controversial end to the moratorium in England.Labour sources said the Tories had walked into their trap and are preparing online adverts to target every MP who backs giving the controversial shale gas extraction the go ahead.
