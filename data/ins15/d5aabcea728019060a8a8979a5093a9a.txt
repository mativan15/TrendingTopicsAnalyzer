Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday responded sharply as the CBI summoned his deputy Manish Sisodia on Monday at 11 am. The Delhi chief minister compared Sisodia to freedom fighter Bhagat Singh in the midst of heightening probe in the excise policy case. The 2021-2022 liquor policy, which has now been scrapped, is being probed by two central agencies - the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Three arrests have so far been made in the case even as the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has rebuffed any claims of corruption.
