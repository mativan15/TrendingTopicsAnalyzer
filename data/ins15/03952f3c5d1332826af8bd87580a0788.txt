PHILADELPHIA – The private meeting took place two weeks ago in St. Louis, the birthplace of this magical Philadelphia Phillies postseason run, where they were warned there'd be nights like this.

They were told they would have games in which they stunk up the place. They would have moments of glory, moments of failure. Lose games they should win. Win games they should lose.

Well, on Friday night, in front of a frenzied sellout crowd of 44,607, they went through all of the range of emotions, and survived, winning 4-2 over the San Diego Padres to take a 2 games to 1 lead in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
