Coming off back-to-back losing seasons, the Chicago Cubs are reducing ticket prices for full-season packages.

Season tickets at Wrigley Field for 2023 have been cut by an average of 5%, said Cale Vennum, senior vice president of Marquee 360, which oversees the team's ticketing. All 22 season ticket sections, including the bleachers, are receiving a price reduction, ranging from 2.7% to 6.7%.

The Cubs' annual analysis of trends and review of ticket prices — in conjunction with feedback from current season ticket holders after a disappointing season — factored into the decision.
