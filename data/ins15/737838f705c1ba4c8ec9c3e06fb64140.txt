U.S. President Joe Biden may have promised that Western sanctions would wreak economic havoc in Russia, but Kechin's business is still drawing in customers in the town of Saransk, which lies 510 kilometers (320 miles) southeast of Moscow. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.
