(Bloomberg) -- Eye-watering price surges in smaller euro-zone nations are redrawing the economic divide between the continent's east and west.In the Baltic region, where inflation is the bloc's quickest and has topped 25%, Estonia has seen the cost of goods and services leapfrog Italy and Spain since last year, making it the most expensive country in central and eastern Europe. Slovakia and Slovenia are also gaining ground and now aren't far behind.The hope was always for the continent's formerly communist economies to converge over time with their richer neighbors, raising living standards along the way.
