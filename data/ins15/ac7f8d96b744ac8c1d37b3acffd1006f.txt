Red Bull supremo Christian Horner has lambasted the "overcomplicated" nature of regulations in Formula 1 and called on the FIA to simplify them to allow a smoother running of the sport. The team principal has suggested F1 could benefit from changes to the current rules set out by the FIA amid the team's ongoing cost cap crisis, after being found to have incurred a 'minor' breach of the regulations.Red Bull are currently in discussions with the FIA to determine what their penalty could be after it was found they had exceeded the £114million budget cap by a reported £2m for the 2021 season.
