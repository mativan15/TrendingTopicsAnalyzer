The federal government has tabled a bill that includes a national freeze on handguns. For some Albertans, the move is a step in the right direction, while others say it won't properly address gun violence. Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino presented the bill, C-21, in the House of Commons on Monday. Along with it came a freeze on the purchase, sale, importation and transfer of handguns in the country. Measures that intend to ban guns or limit the use of them by citizens are a step in the right direction, says Jose Neto.
