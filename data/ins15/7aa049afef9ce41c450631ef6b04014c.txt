Dan Pickle, who lives in Kitchener Centre, says the environment is an important issue in this election but housing affordability is at the top of his mind."I can't afford to buy a house," Pickle said. At the start of the pandemic, he was looking at homes, but as prices rose quickly, home ownership became out of reach for him."Family and friends have home ownership already," he said. "For the larger group, I would say the environment is our overall, broadly number one issue," as it will impact every facet of life.
