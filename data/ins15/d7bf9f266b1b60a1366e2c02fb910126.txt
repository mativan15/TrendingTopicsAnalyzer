How much money drought-stricken California should spend to build new dams was a big part of the debate over the bill that Gov. Jerry Brown signed last month to put a $7.5 billion water bond on the November ballot.

Republicans and Central Valley Democrats who pushed hardest for new reservoirs highlighted the fact that California built many of the world's most ambitious dam projects during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but a large state- or federally-funded reservoir hasn't been built in 35 years.

But why did the era of big dams end, when California has built new roads, schools, universities, hospitals and freeways?

Experts say there are a confluence of factors, from environmental laws to funding to a lack of suitable sites.
