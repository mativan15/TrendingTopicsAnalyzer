Rajeev Thakkar and Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund don't need introduction. Most mutual fund investors can't stop talking about the PPFAS Flexi Cap Fund and the fabulous returns it has been offering to investors in the last few years. Shivani Bazaz of ETMutualFunds spoke to Rajiv Thakkar to get his perspective on the current volatility in the market. 'The current market is nothing special or different and one has to rely on fundamental principles of investing in terms of investing with good promoters / managers in businesses which have good economic characteristics, and which do not borrow too much and at a price that is attractive for investment,' says Thakkar.
