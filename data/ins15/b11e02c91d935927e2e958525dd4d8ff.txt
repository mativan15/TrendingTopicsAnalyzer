Tensions in Haiti are reaching new levels after gangs took control of the fuel supply, leading to shortages of food, gas, and medical services.

The government of the troubled country is asking for foreign troops to be deployed and the U.N. security council is considering proposing sanctions on gang members. Amidst the unrest, one of the country's most influential gang bosses has proposed a plan to stabilize the country that involves including his henchmen in the government.

Jimmy Chérizier, a former police officer turned gang leader who goes by the alias Barbecue, recently released a video reading a proposal to pacify the country, which includes giving gang members amnesty and voiding outstanding arrest warrants, according to the Associated Press (AP).
