'I don't find anything wrong in that because it is done as per the process of law,' Joshi was quoted as saying by NDTV. The minister asserted that 'there is a provision' for release for all the convicts who have spent ample amount of time in prison.
'Accordingly, as per law, it is done,' Joshi said while campaigning in Gujarat which is gearing up for Assembly elections in December.
On Monday, the Gujarat government told the Supreme Court that it decided to release the 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case as they had 'completed 14 years and above in prison… their behaviour was found to be good' and the Centre had also 'conveyed (its) concurrence/ approval'.
