President Biden on Friday bashed Republicans who have attacked his student loan forgiveness plan, calling out certain lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (Ga.).

'Ted Cruz, the great senator from Texas, he said it's for slackers — quote slackers — who don't deserve relief. Who is the hell do they think they are?' Biden said in remarks at Delaware State University.

The president specifically criticized lawmakers who have opposed his student loan forgiveness plan but who received small business loans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
