BP PLC (NYSE: BP) is buying Archaea Energy Inc. (NYSE: LFG), a renewable natural gas company that moved its headquarters to Houston last year around the same time it went public.

The deal is valued at approximately $4.1 billion, including about $800 million of net debt, the companies announced Oct. 17. BP agreed to pay $26 in cash for each Archaea Class A and Class B share, representing an approximately 38% premium to Archaea's volume weighted average share price for the 30 days ending Oct. 14.

Current owners of approximately 27% of Archaea's outstanding shares have agreed to vote in favor of the deal.
