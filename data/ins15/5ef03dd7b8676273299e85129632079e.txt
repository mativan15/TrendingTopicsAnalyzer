Netflix on Tuesday reported that it gained more than 2 million subscribers in the recent quarter, calming investor fears that the streaming giant was losing paying customers. The company said it ended the third quarter with slightly more than 223 million subscribers worldwide, up some 2.4 million, after seeing subscriber ranks ebb during the first half of the year. Netflix shares shot up more than 14 percent in after hours trading to $275.80 on the earnings news. "After a challenging first half, we believe we're on a path to reaccelerate growth," the company said in an earnings letter.
