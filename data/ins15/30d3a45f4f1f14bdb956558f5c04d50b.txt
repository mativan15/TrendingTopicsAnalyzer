Since then, the stock price has come down substantially from its highs of ~$43/share. In 2022 alone, the stock price has declined more than 25%, significantly more than the overall market. Data by YCharts Although Li Auto has exhibited significant growth and continuously improving financial results in the previous quarters, we are yet to see positive earnings.
