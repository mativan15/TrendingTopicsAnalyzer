UK Prime Minister Liz Truss resigned Thursday after a catastrophic 44 days in office.

Her plan to radically reshape the UK economy was brutally rejected by financial markets.

With her authority shot, it did not take long for Conservative MPs to force her out.

Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, resigned on Thursday after just 44 days in office.

Her departure came after her authority over her own party melted away, decimated after an attempt to defy economic gravity fell apart, leaving her to face the wrath of her furious MPs.
