The head of the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog has cited the Berejiklian government's notorious $252m Stronger Communities fund as a clear example of pork-barrelling, saying almost its sole motive was political, calling it 'clearly on the other side of the line'.Peter Hall QC, the chief commissioner of the state's Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), told a forum, examining the legality of pork-barrelling in politics, that the fund was 'on the other side of the line' of what was 'permissible'.
