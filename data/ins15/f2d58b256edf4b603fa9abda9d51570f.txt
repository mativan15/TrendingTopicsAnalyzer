Sheryl Sandberg, who has been chief operating officer at Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has announced that she will be stepping down from the role after 14 years. 'When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years,' Sandberg wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday. 'Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life. I am not entirely sure what the future will bring – I have learned no one ever is. But I know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work, which is more important to me than ever given how critical this moment is for women.
