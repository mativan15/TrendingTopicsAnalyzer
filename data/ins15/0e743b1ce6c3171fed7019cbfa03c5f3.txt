Markets are seriously underpricing the risk of 1970s-style stagflation, Deutsche bank said, warning that investors could be in for long-term negative returns in both stocks and bonds.Soaring inflation has helped spark a steep sell-off in the market this year, with the S&P 500 now 25% below where it started in January. Some market bulls have pointed to easing inflationary pressures, which could fuel a rally before year-end – but those investors are underestimating the risk of inflation becoming entrenched in the economy, Deutsche analyst Henry Allen warned in a note on Monday, which could bring more headwind to stocks and bonds.
