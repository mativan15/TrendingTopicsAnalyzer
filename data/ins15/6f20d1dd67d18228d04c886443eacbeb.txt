West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu has asked central leaders to allow his government to purchase foodgrain from other states to stave off near-famine conditions arising from a calamitous drought. 'We have got only two weeks' rations in our godowns', he said. Sri Lanka is likely to be put under a state of emergency soon after polling ends on October 20. Quoting 'informed sources', a Colombo English daily, sympathetic to the ruling United National Party, reported that a decision to this effect was taken at a recent national security council meeting presided over by the President J R Jayawardene, to forestall post-election violence.
