The stock market is at a tricky phase. Investors are increasingly getting worried about the volatility and uncertainties. Manish Suvarna of ETMutualFunds reached out to Shridatta Bhandarwaldar, Head of Equities, Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, to make sense of the market. 'I see this situation as an opportunity for retail investors because in the last one and half years they have been chasing something at a very high valuation. Now, the next three to six months will be a time where a lot of volatility is likely to remain, so you will get a lot of good businesses at reasonable valuation,' says Bhandarwaldar.
