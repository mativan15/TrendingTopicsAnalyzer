CryptocurrencyOn the Move Liliya Filakhtova/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Data center developer Soluna (NASDAQ:SLNH) shares have jumped as much as 10% in afternoon trading, as Upstate New York gets closer to banning Proof-of-Work crypto mining, which uses energy from carbon-based sources. Soluna (SLNH), based in Albany, New York, develops data centers for eco-friendly crypto mining, so if the states' new legislation gets approved by Governor Kathy Hochul, Soluna may be able to grow its market share as more crypto miners using clean energy sources take over those using fossil fuel-based power.
