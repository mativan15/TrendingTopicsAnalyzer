Many investors believe that Wall Street favors Republicans over Democrats. But try telling that to the U.S. stock market over the past 12 months. As you can see from the chart below, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.80% has tended to rise and fall in fairly close correlation with the odds that the Democrats will retain control of the U.S. Senate after the midterm elections in November. (These odds are based on the pricing of the Smarkets electronic futures contract tied to post midterm U.S. Senate control.) Eyeballing a chart can be an unreliable guide.
