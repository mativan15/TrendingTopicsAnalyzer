Baltimore's famed Artscape festival will return in 2023 with new dates and a larger footprint.

The free arts festival will take place Sept. 20-24 next year, about two months later than its usual sweltering mid-summer dates. The event has for years been held in late July in Baltimore's Bolton Hill and Mount Vernon neighborhoods, and this year will grow to include the Station North Arts & Entertainment District. Artscape 2023 will also span five days instead of the usual three.

Baltimore's Office of Promotion & The Arts (BOPA) revealed the changes Thursday, the second time new dates for the return of the festival in 2023 have been announced.
