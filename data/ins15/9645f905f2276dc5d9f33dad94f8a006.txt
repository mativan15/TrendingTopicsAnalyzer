The big data industry was valued at $162.6 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to grow at a rapid 11% compounded annual growth rate [CAGR] up until 2026. All this "big data" needs storing somewhere and traditional databases just aren't very scalable. That is where MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) can help, as it provides a fast and flexible modern database service. The company serves a variety of elite customers which include; Verizon, Coinbase, eBay, Forbes and many more. The high inflation and rising interest rate environment has butchered growth stocks, and MongoDB's share price has slid down by over 68% since November 2021.
