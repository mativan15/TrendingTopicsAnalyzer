Can't get enough of watching Nathaniel Hackett and the Broncos in prime time? Well, you're in luck. Denver is in prime time for the fourth time in the first six weeks Monday. 
While watching Hackett try to coach and this Broncos offense sputter in the red zone is painful, at least we get to make money off the guy. If you got the 49ers on the early numbers of +2 a couple of weeks ago, Hackett has started his career 0-5 ATS. That's pretty impressive. 
Luckily for me, I've been riding the Hackett fade train right here in The Post.
