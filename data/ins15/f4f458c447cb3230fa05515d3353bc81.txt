Indiewire Television Dame Judi Dench is calling on Netflix to firmly declare that 'The Crown' is a 'fictionalized drama' series.Dench shared a letter with UK's The Times (via Deadline), in which the Academy Award winner slammed the series for presenting an 'inaccurate and hurtful account of history' without a formal label of being a work of fiction. In her piece, she invoked recent criticisms made by former Prime Minister John Major about an episode in Season 5 suggesting that, in 1991, Prince Charles (now King Charles III) complained to Major about waiting to take over the throne.
