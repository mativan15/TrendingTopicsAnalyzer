 Chinese telecoms giant Huawei wants in on the data center construction business, and claims it can build them significantly faster than the competition.According to The Register, the company recently took to local social media to distribute an advertising video, which shows shipping container-sized modules being stacked into a larger building, in a fashion similar to how Lego bricks are assembled.The offering is called 'Next-Generation Data Center Facility', and apparently, Huawei can get a new facility up and running within six to nine months, instead of the usual 18.
