'The Last Chairlift' by John Irving (Simon & Schuster)

After 54 years and 15 novels, John Irving's finally done it. He's written a book longer than most editions of 'Moby-Dick.' And by the time you're done reading it, you'll chuckle every time you see the hyphen in Melville's title.

It's difficult to do justice to this book in a short review. Every Irving fan will read it and even readers trying Irving for the first time will find it an accessible introduction to the New England-born novelist whose work has always been stuffed with serious themes like religion, sex and politics, tempered by a fair dose of satire and absurdity, delivered by narrators in an endearing, matter-of-fact prose.
