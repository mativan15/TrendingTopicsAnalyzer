Reggie Jackson To Start At Point Guard For Clippers

The LA Clippers plan to open the season with a familiar face at point guard. Reggie Jackson will be the opening lead ballhandler when the Clippers start the regular season. There was a thought that offseason addition John Wall might start at point guard for the Clippers. While Wall will be a big part of the rotation for LA, Ty Lue is sticking with Jackson. It's also unlikely that Wall will play in back-to-back games, at least in the early part of the season.
