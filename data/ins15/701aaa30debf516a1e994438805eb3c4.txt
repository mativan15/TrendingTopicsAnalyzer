Two widely followed strategists on Wall Street — Bank of America's Michael Hartnett and Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson — see more trouble ahead in the stock market and are urging investors to not breathe a sigh of relief just because of the latest rally. "Is there a bull case? We find it difficult to construct here," Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a note. "The latest rally looks more like a bear market rally, which could carry another 5% in our view." Investors got a reprieve from a painful sell-off as the S & P 500 jumped 6.
