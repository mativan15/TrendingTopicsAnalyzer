Alexander Downer, Australia's former foreign minister and high commissioner to London from 2014 to 2018, has described Hintze as a 'brilliant mind' who 'will go down in history as one of the great benefactors'.LoadingPeerages have become increasingly controversial within British politics, drawing accusations of cronyism as many recipients are donors and political allies.Historically, most Lords were hereditary peers, with a small number of other peers appointed to the house for life. A change in legislation in 1958 provided for the creation of more life peers, which also gave the prime minister the power to bring non-elected individuals into the government.
