Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, one of the world's largest hedge funds, is the latest co-investor to join Elon Musk in his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. Griffin, whose net worth is estimated at $29 billion, has committed only than $20 million to the deal, according to Bloomberg.

Musk had also approached Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn—both former associates of Musk when they all worked at PayPal—but both passed on participating in the deal, The Washington Post reported on Oct.
