As it stands, residents living in England who are in their 60s can claim free prescriptions. The state pension threshold is currently 66 years of age which means pensioners more than qualify for this freebie benefit. It should be noted that there is a consultation into hiking the eligibility threshold to the state pension, but those who are 60 are still able to claim free prescriptions.Furthermore, those who live in Scotland and Wales can claim free prescriptions no matter what age they are.To receive free medication on the NHS, pensioners may have to bring evidence of their age to their local pharmacist when picking up prescriptions.
