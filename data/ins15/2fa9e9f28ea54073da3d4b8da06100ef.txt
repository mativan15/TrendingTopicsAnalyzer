The Labor government in Australia has reversed a decision to recognise West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, drawing complaints from the Israeli prime minister but delighting Palestinians.The decision made by the previous Canberra government in 2018 had undermined peace and put Australia out of step with other nations, Penny Wong, the Australian foreign minister, said.Britain is considering moving its own embassy to Jerusalem. Apart from the United States, which moved its embassy there under President Trump, only Honduras, Guatemala and Kosovo presently have embassies in the city.
