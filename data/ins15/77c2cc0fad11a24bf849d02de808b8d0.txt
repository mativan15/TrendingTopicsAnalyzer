A question mark hangs over five of 10 concerts the Motueka Music Group planned for 2023 after Arts on Tour NZ missed out on funding from Creative New Zealand. 'To lose five, if we do, is a terrible blow for us,' said Motueka Music Group president Colin Hooker. 'We're very concerned about it.' The popular New Zealand String Quartet was one of those five Arts on Tour NZ-supported concerts earmarked to perform at the Chanel Arts Centre in Motueka during 2023. Other potentially affected Arts on Tour NZ-supported concerts are ​Jackie Goes Prima Diva, folk-pop duo Looking For Alaska, Austen Found and Whirimako Black.
