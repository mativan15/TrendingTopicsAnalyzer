Economists have warned that Rishi Sunak will come under pressure to deliver another emergency aid package next year to help millions of people deal with high energy bills.The Chancellor on Thursday announced a £15 billion support package including a £400 energy bills rebate for all families in the autumn and additional payments worth £650 for eight million of the poorest households.But with energy prices set to remain high well into next year - partly caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine - economists fear Mr Sunak may have to dish out billions more next Spring, risking pushing inflation higher.
