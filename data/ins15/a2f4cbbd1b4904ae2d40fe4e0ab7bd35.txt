(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration's trade restrictions on China are wreaking havoc with the chip-equipment industry, but a pair of company forecasts shows that the pain won't be spread evenly. ASML Holding NV, a Dutch maker of semiconductor manufacturing gear, reassured investors with its latest outlook Wednesday, saying it sees 'fairly limited' impact from the export controls. As a European company, ASML expects to be spared from the brunt of the restrictions, which are aimed at keeping cutting-edge technology out of China and away from the country's military.
