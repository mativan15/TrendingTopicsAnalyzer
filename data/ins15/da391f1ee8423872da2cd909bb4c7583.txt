The next operator of the National Lottery has postponed its Wall Street debut as it acknowledged pressure from a 'significant drop' on the stock market to investors.Allwyn Entertainment, controlled by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, was initially slated to close its $9.3 billion blank-cheque merger in the second quarter. The transaction will now not be completed before the third quarter, according to a presentation made to investors.Global equities have endured months of turbulence since Allwyn's plans were announced in January, although Komárek's KKCG Group — its parent company — suggested the delay was due to a standard regulatory review of its pre-listing filings.
