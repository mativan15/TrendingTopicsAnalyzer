Abbott Laboratories ABT, +1.41% said Wednesday that it had earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.15 per share, in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $2.1 billion, or $1.40, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.15, against a FactSet consensus of 94 cents. The company reported that sales fell 4.7% to $10.4 billion in the third quarter, driven by declining sales in its nutrition business, which has been dealing with shortages of baby formula since the start of the year, and falling sales of COVID-19 tests.
