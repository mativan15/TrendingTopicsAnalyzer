Her book "Tomb of Sand" is the first book in any Indian language to clinch the prize, which honors international translated fiction. She was picked from a shortlist that included five women authors.

Translated by US-based painter and translator Daisy Rockwell (left), "Tomb of Sand" tells the story of an 80-year-old living in northern India who decides to travel to Pakistan and revisit the ghosts of the trauma following India and Pakistan's partition in 1947. The roughly €59,000 ($63,000) prize money will be split between New Delhi-based Shree and Rockwell, who lives in Vermont.
