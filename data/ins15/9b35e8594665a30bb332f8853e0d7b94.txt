Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lauded India's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Scheme as a 'logistical marvel' that has reached hundreds of millions of people and specifically benefitted women, the elderly and farmers. Paolo Mauro, Deputy Director in the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, praised the role of technological innovation in achieving this feat. Earlier this month, David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group, had also urged other nations to adopt India's move of targeted cash transfer instead of broad subsidies noting that 'India managed to provide food or cash support to a remarkable 85 per cent of rural households and 69 per cent of urban households'.
