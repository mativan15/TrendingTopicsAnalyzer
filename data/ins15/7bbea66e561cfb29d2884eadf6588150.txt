Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open slightly lower Tuesday, ahead of the release of key regional inflation data which could heighten concerns about the pace and scale of looming interest rate hikes.

At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.

Data released on Monday showed German inflation hit another all-time high while numbers from Spain also topped estimates.
