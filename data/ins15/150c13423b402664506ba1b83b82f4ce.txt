JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon may be calling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 'decentralized Ponzi schemes,' but this hasn't stop the world's largest investment bank from hiring a new head of digital assets regulatory policy.

Aaron Iovine, who held a similar position at the now-bankrupt crypto lending firm Celsius, joined JPMorgan, per a Bloomberg Law report.

Iovine's LinkedIn profile says he worked at Celsius between February and September this year, following an almost three-year spell at Cross River, a crypto-friendly New Jersey-based financial services company.
