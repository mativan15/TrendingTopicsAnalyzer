What do you think is the primary role of government? The primary role of government is to protect and provide for the people. Protection of the residents is accomplished through provided emergency response services that residents cannot provide individually themselves. Governments may also provide utilities and services to areas.

What would your top priorities be if elected? My top three priorities as Mayor would continue to be public safety, protecting natures resources including improving water quality, community engagement, and responsible spending that supports the resident needs of our community.
