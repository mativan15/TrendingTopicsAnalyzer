As the 2022 midterm elections near, what will the results mean for politics and policy going forward? Experts in Brookings's Center for Effective Public Management spent the year analyzing congressional primary data to better understand the candidates, the voters, and the party platforms.
On November 10, join Governance Studies at Brookings for a post-midterm election analysis as experts discuss voting demographics and turnout, policy implications in the House and Senate, candidate quality, top issues concerning voters, biggest surprises from Election Day, and what, if anything, do the results tell us about the looming presidential race in 2024.
