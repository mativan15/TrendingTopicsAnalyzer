 Oura has teamed up with Gucci to produce the Gucci x Oura Ring, a special-edition version of the Oura Ring that's painted black, laced with 18 karat gold, and priced at $950 (about AU$1,300) and £820 in the UK. Oura says the Gucci x Oura Ring is set to 'deliver all of Oura's research-grade technology, personalized guidance, and insights in a new ring design, exquisitely crafted with Gucci's legendary style'. In other words, it's got all the functionalities of the Oura Generation 3 in a shiny new design, including its seven temperature sensors which measure biometric data 24 hours a day, and its sophisticated sleep tracking capabilities.
