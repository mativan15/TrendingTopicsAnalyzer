Turkey prices and availability may be different this Thanksgiving, thanks to the ongoing spread of bird flu and the ongoing inflation crisis.
 
Currently, there is a 73 percent increase in the price per pound of an eight to 16-pound turkey, according to data shared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Right now, an average turkey is $1.99 per pound in 2022, compared to $1.15 in 2021.
 
Bird flu, which typically spreads during colder months, has affected flocks, with farmers reporting a large number of cases since July — a time when producers generally begin breeding for the holiday season, CNBC reported.
