The trailer for season five of The Crown has been released, teasing the next chapters of the royal family's journey during the 1990s.

The hit Netflix drama series, inspired by the real-life events surrounding the Queen and her family, returns with new episodes on 9 November.

Ahead of season five's release, a trailer was launched on Thursday (20 October), in which viewers can see new actors portraying the characters – including, notably, Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana.

In a prescient nod to the near future in the show's timeline, the trailer uses a cover of The Verve's song 'Bitter Sweet Symphony' as its soundtrack.
