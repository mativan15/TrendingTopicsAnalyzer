OnlyFans founder Tim Stokley is getting into the web3 game with a new NFT startup, Zoop, launching this summer.
On Zoop, people can buy, sell, and trade 3D NFT 'playing cards' of their favorite influencers and celebrities. The limited-edition digital cards on Zoop will be officially licensed, according to the company, though it wasn't clear whether the celebrities themselves would be directly involved in their creation.
Zoop said the platform will foster 'a closer connection between fan and influencer' in its announcement.
