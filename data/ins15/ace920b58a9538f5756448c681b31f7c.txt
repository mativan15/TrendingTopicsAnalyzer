Denver Nuggets fans pay more for beer than fans of almost any other NBA franchise.
That's according to Bookies.com, which recently calculated what it costs for a family of four to attend a game at each U.S. basketball arena. And just in time, too – the Nuggets' 2022-23 season tipped off this week in Salt Lake City against the Utah Jazz. The team's first home game at Ball Arena is Saturday against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Nuggets fans pay $14.72 per 16-ounce beer at home games, Bookies.com found.
