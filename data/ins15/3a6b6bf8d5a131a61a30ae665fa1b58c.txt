The couple officially tied the knot just a year after they met in September of 2014 with a beautiful Venetian wedding, and welcomed two children, twins Ella and Alexander, in June of 2017.


The 'Ticket to Paradise' actor recalled how his agent knew he was "going to marry" the barrister as soon as he met the 44-year-old beauty in 2013, and though the 61-year-old star was initially skeptical, the pair quickly hit it off.
