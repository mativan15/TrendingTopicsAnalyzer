Skyrocketing energy costs could lead to a rise in extremist sentiment across Germany, Bavarian President Markus Soder told Bild am Sonntag on Sunday. 'The mix of crises, such as energy and coronavirus, can lead to overstrain and destabilization of democracy,' he said, urging 'democratic parties' to 'take a clear position, argue less, and encourage citizens.'Soder pointed to the increasing electoral success of the right-wing AfD party as proof that extremism is on the rise. He argued for a cap on gas prices and financial relief for citizens, as well as aid to small and medium-sized businesses to head off growing anti-government sentiment.
