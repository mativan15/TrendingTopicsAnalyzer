A prominent Florida art dealer has been accused of selling fake works from the likes of Jean Michel-Basquiat and Banksy for hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to a federal criminal complaint.
Daniel Elie Bouaziz, who ran two galleries on Palm Beach's exclusive Worth Avenue, allegedly bought cheap reproductions online and passed them off as authentic to unsuspecting clients.
In one deal, he picked up a $100 Andy Warhol facsimile and sold it for $85,000 to a bamboozled customer, according to federal court papers filed in Florida.
