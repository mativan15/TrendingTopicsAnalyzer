HBO has responded to the leak of the House of the Dragon finale episode, decrying it as ‘unlawful action' as the network ‘aggressively' pulls copies that have arisen online.
On Monday, the finale episode of the first season of the Game of Thrones prequel is set to be released, following the civil unrest breaking out within the Targaryen family.
In episode 9, the King's death resulted in Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) ensuring her son Prince Aegon Targaryen (Tom Glynn-Carney) was crowned as the new monarch, despite the late ruler's first-born child Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) having been publicly named as his heir several years prior.
