Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg's daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union.Poland is poised to win approval today for its plan to spend 36 billion euros of the EU's post-pandemic stimulus. The deal has been delayed for a year as the country's ruling coalition resisted demands to roll back some contested changes in the judiciary. A vote last week striking down a key piece of Poland's court legislation eased the deadlock. The government in Warsaw needs the money to help with more than 3 million refugees fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine.
