ROLANDO ROMERO claimed he spent more money on sparring than he earned for his fights - after knocking out too many people in the gym. 
The unbeaten American, who fights Gervonta Davis on Saturday, did not have a massive amateur background, having just 35 bouts.

He instead made a name for himself in Floyd Mayweather's Las Vegas gym, where he treated sparring sessions like world title fights. 
It caught the attention of Mayweather, who in 2016 alongside right-hand man Leonard Ellerbe signed Romero.
