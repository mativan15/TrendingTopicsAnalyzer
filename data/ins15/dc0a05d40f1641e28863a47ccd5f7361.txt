WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee will hold an emergency session Thursday to advance a legislative package of gun violence prevention measures following a series of recent mass shootings across the country. The package, called the Protecting Our Kids Act, includes red flag law incentives for states, new federal offenses for gun trafficking and straw purchases, and an increase in the legal age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21 years old. Democrats are trying to harness momentum for changes to the nation's gun laws following several successive mass shootings.
