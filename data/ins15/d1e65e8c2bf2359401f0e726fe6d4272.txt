Oct. 15—It may be October 2022, but the Crawford County Fair Board formally has set the dates for next year's fair.

At its meeting Thursday night, the Fair Board approved Aug. 20 through 26, 2023, as the dates of the fair.

"We're very pleased with how this year's fair went and happy to set the dates for next year," said Dean Maynard, the board's president.

This year, the fair had a short online survey to help improve the fair and received approximately 1,100 responses, he said.

"We got a lot of feedback," Maynard said.
