Students at St Andrews braved the grey autumn skies of Scotland to celebrate 'Raisin Monday', a tradition in which first year students take part in a mass foam fight.
The convention in different forms dates back to the early days of the university, which was founded in 1614. 
New arrivals would give senior students a pound of raisins to thank them for their help in adapting to university life, in exchange for a receipt written in Latin. Failure to produce the raisins could result in them being doused in a fountain.
