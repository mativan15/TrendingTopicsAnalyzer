[Photo/Xinhua] BEIJING -- China will step up its food supply capacity to keep prices stable, authorities said, citing challenges brought by COVID-19. The country encourages local governments to get a clear picture of the acreage, variety, output of vegetables in the field, and the variety and output of aquatic and livestock product stock on hand, according to a circular jointly released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and other government organs Wednesday.
