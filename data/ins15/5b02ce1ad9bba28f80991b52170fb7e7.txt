Crypto credit cards are a new genre of credit cards that allow cardholders to earn rewards in bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies, rather than traditional points, miles or cash back. While some of the rewards rates and other perks may seem attractive on first glance, it's important to keep in mind the additional risk and volatility that comes with crypto over earning US dollars or an issuer-branded currency. The crypto market is unproven and turbulent, with crypto prices recently plunging in response to stimuli like the Fed raising interest rates and the collapse of the luna cryptocurrency.
