Kyle Richards is one proud mama.
 
"Anybody who knows me knows that I am obsessed with my kids," Richards said in season 1 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. "Bordering on abnormal, but that's okay."
 
Since then, viewers have watched Richards' daughters grow up on TV over several seasons of the show. She and her husband Mauricio Umansky have been there for all their daughters' big moments, including engagements, graduations, birthdays and plenty of other family events.
 
Richards' eldest daughter, Farrah, has nothing but sweet words for her mom.
