The Orionid meteor shower is approaching its period of peak activity, with the number of shooting stars expected to climax on October 20 and 21. And this year, conditions are right for an excellent light show.According to NASA, the Orionids are known for some of the brightness and fastest meteors, which reach velocities of almost 150,000 miles per hour as they zoom into Earth's atmosphere.Meteor showers are celestial events that occur when the Earth passes through streams of cosmic debris left behind by comets and, in some rare cases, asteroids.
