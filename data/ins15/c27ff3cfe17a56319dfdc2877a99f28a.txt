Variety - Film News South Indian cinema A-lister Prithviraj Sukumaran is an integral part of the cast of 'Salaar,' starring Prabhas (the Baahubali franchise) and directed by Prashanth Neel (the K.G.F. franchise).Though he was approached for the role more than 18 months ago, Sukumaran nearly could not do the film because he was busy with Jordan and Algeria shoots for Blessy's pandemic-delayed magnum opus 'Aadu Jeevitham.' As luck would have it, 'Salaar' was also delayed and the dates finally aligned.
