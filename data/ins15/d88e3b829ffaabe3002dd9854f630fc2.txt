This December will see the unveiling of Milan's hottest and most exciting new hotel. One of Milan's most fascinating secret places is opening its doors to the world and will be home to the new Portrait Milano from 1st December 2022. The former Archiepiscopal Seminary, Europe's oldest and the world's second oldest seminary, was built in 1564 and commissioned by San Carlo Borromeo. Until now, it has never been open to the public. Thanks to a careful renovation project by Ferragamo-owned Lungarno Collection, entrusted to architect Michele De Lucchi and his studio AMDL CIRCLE, this amazing space in Corso Venezia 11 will become a new destination in the city that combines the values of Portrait Collection with food, fashion, design and wellness experiences, aimed at locals and visitors alike.
