The boss of one of Britain's biggest energy suppliers has claimed that National Grid is 'not fit for purpose' and was the biggest challenge to building more renewable energy sources.Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus Energy, which supplies three million homes and businesses, argued that while it can take less than a year to do the engineering work for a wind farm it could then take six or seven years to get permission to connect to the National Grid.In comments to the Times Earth Business Summit yesterday, Jackson said the grid system was originally designed to ship energy from a small number of coal plants to population centres.
