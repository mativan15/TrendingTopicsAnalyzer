A sharp slump in diesel reserves across the EU is expected this winter once the ban on exports of Russian oil and petroleum products comes into effect, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.According to Wood Mackenzie estimates, diesel reserves in northwestern Europe will plummet to 210.4 million barrels in February, the lowest since 2011, while the looming embargo on Russian crude scheduled for the same month is driving diesel prices up.'The drop in February is expected due to the end of Russian imports, at a seasonally high demand period,' the principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie, James Burleigh, said, warning that imports from alternative 'longer-haul sources may be constrained.
