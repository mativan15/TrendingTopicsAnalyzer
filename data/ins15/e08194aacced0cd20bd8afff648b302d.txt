Oct. 21—NEW LONDON — A park is what the founder of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum requested in her will and that is what she is getting 90 years later.

The museum can now transform part of its 12 acre property into Lyman Allen Park after receiving unanimous support by the Planning and Zoning Commission on Thursday.

In her will, founder Harriet Upson Allyn requested her estate money be used for a museum and park. The museum opened in 1932, six years after Allyn died.

Executive Director Sam Quigley and others are working to complete the founder's request.
