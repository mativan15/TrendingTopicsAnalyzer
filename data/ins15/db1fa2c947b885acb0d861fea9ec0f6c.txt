A statue of Baroness Margaret Thatcher has been officially unveiled in her home town despite the presence of a small number of protesters.The £300,000 memorial had previously been guarded by fences, which did not deter university worker Jeremy Webster from throwing eggs at it shortly after it was lowered on to a 10ft-high granite plinth in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on May 15.Lincolnshire Police said officers were also investigating possible criminal damage after red paint was thrown at the statue on Saturday.
