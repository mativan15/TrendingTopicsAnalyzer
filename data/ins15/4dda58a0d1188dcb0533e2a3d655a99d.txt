We'd love to see the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet get an upgrade, we're just not sure this is it. You'll need a microscope to find improvements over the 2020 model because the new tablet gets a slight boost in the processor and maybe a gigabyte more RAM, but that's it. You won't even notice those differences. The Fire HD 8 is a small, cheap tablet with the potential to be even cheaper. During an Amazon Prime Day-type sale, the older model dropped in price by about half later in its lifespan. Prime Days are a great time to buy the best Amazon Fire tablets.
