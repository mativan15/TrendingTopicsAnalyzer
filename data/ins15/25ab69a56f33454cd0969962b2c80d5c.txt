As his hands flash out in front of him, conductor-like, to illustrate what he means, it is easy to grasp his vision. He talks of an informality at ground level, of many doors rather than the usual office block atrium and reception desk. But then he's off elsewhere, enthusing vaguely about a 'pattern language' of 'thickened walls' and 'how your emotions are, in place' and the image flickers and fades. Perhaps it sounds good to the conscientious CEO. Are these the words of a visionary, or a salesman?
What is not in doubt is that Heatherwick places huge importance on embedding the natural within even his most urban projects.
