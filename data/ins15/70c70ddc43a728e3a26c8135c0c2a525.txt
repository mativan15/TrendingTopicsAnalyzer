A TIKTOKER ordered her Halloween costume on Amazon, but people said what she received should be a crime.
Asha @asherdasher1014 shared what she was supposed to receive, a frilly, gothic black dress ($28) but what she actually got was laughable in comparison.

Audio of a girl crying as she says "It's so ugly...this is what I wanted, and this is what I got," plays as Asha steps out into what looks like a frilly black raincoat.
