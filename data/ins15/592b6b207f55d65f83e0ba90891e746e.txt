I've had to evict three tenants this year – and it's only going to get worse

Choosing not to pay rent has ended up with the tenant in court. A black mark will appear against their name for many years meaning they will struggle to obtain any form of credit or rent again. They will also have the threat of legal action against them for the next six years, which is how long I have to pursue them for the owed money.
Likely they'll be forced, when they manage to find a new rental, to install a pre-payment meter, and pay higher rates for utilities. If they end up homeless, the cost of any short-term accommodation in a hostel or B&B, will be borne by the taxpayer.
