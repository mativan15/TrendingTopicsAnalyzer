Hours before Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is set to appear before the CBI in connection with the liquor policy case, he Monday called the case against him 'completely fake', while Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the agency was going to arrest him to stop him from campaigning in Gujarat.
'Nothing was found in Manish's house during the raid, nothing was found in the bank locker. The case against him is completely fake. He had to campaign in the Gujarat election campaign and they are arresting him to stop him.
