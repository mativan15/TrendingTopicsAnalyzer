As Halloween approaches, the cost of candy continues to surge — by more than 13.1% in the U.S. since last September, according to the latest Bureau of Labor inflation data.  That makes it more expensive than you're probably planning to budget this year. The average household says it's planning to spend nearly $30 on Halloween candy, according to a recent National Retail Federation survey. With costs rising, prices for Halloween candy could be closer to $35 this year. That's only $5 more than the average American candy budget, but unexpected costs are always significant — and when extrapolated across a full year, the extra money could add up.
