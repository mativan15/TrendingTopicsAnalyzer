Prices of cotton and yarn are at an 11- year high with the price of candy cotton i.e., 365 kg of cotton now costing Rs 1 lakh as compared to the comparatively lower cost of Rs 40,000 in October 2020. Similar inflation in the price of yarn has occurred with 1kg of yarn now costing Rs 481 against Rs 244 in the same period. Manufacturers complain that they have the worst part of the deal as the price of each garment manufactured by them is agreed upon at the time of signing the agreement. Any loss of profit caused due to the fluctuation in the price of raw materials is expected to be handled by them.
