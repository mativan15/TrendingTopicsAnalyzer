In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term Tamawood Limited (ASX:TWD) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 41% over a half decade. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 28% over the last twelve months.
