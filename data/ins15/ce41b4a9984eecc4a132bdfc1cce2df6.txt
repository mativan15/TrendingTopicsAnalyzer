A former Winnipeg mayor is back and looking to return to the City of Winnipeg's top job. It's been 18 years since Glen Murray served as the city's mayor, and since then he's sat as a Liberal MPP in Ontario and ran for the leader of the federal Green Party. Murray was also a city councillor for three terms before his time as mayor. 'I've served for 15 years at city hall,' he said in an interview with CTV News Winnipeg. Murray said when he was mayor the city was transforming for the better, but now he sees lack of policing and lack of infrastructure maintenance.
