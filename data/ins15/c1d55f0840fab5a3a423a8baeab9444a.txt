Companies in urban Boston listed some 1.1 million square feet of office space for sublease just in the last three months, according to research from commercial brokerage CBRE. That has grown the stock of space available in the sublease market by about one-fourth in the last year, to 3.4 million square feet, about equal to its pandemic high and far more was typical before COVID. It's not just the office market, either — lab space subleases in Boston have more than doubled in recent months 'as life science users continue to reevaluate their real estate footprint,' according to a recent report from brokerage Newmark.
