Graeme Souness is backing Virgil van Dijk to produce a superb performance against Manchester City and their talismanic forward Erling Haaland on Sunday afternoon. Liverpool take on the Premier League champions at Anfield and will be keen to avoid defeat after a tough start to the season. Jurgen Klopp's side are currently 11th in the table, 13 points behind City in second and 14 behind leaders Arsenal with a game in hand. The Reds started their campaign by beating Pep Guardiola's side 3-1 in the Community Shield at Leicester's King Power Stadium in July.
