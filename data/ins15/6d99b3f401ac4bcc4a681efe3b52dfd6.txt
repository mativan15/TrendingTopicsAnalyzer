In the aftermath of Sebi's actions against six persons for front-running the trades of Group (IIFL Group), the IIFL AMC has clarified that these persons have no relation with the mutual fund business. 'IIFL Asset Management Limited hereby clarifies that certain media reports on the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI)'s order dated June 3, 2022, captioned ‘Front Running by Employee of India Infoline Group' are grossly misleading,' the AMC said in a statement. Sebi on Saturday barred Santosh Brijraj Singh and Adil Gulam Suthar from the market for five years while Virendra Pratap Singh, Neha Virendra Singh, Gulammohammed Gulamabbas Shaikh and Mohammedidrish A Shaikh have been restrained for two years.
