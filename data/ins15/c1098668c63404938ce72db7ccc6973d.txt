"The View" host Whoopi Goldberg suggested Wednesday that people report and police arrest anyone with an AR-15 and compared it to what "women are being threatened with" if they seek out an abortion. Guest host Tara Setmayer said that it would not be easy to ban guns in a country that has "more guns than people." "It actually is easy," Goldberg said. "It is easy, but the things that you could say to people, which we don't say on this show, the things you could wish on people, that we don't wish on this show to people because we know, we've all met people who have had to deal with the death of a loved one at the hands of a gun," implying that they've been holding back.
