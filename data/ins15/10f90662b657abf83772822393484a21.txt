Bengaluru: New-age logistics company Delhivery does not see growth coming at the cost of profits, its senior management told ET on Tuesday, a day after the company reported its maiden earnings. The Gurugram-based startup, which listed on the bourses last week, more than doubled its revenue from operations to Rs 2,071 crore in the quarter ended March 2022, from Rs 1,031 crore in the same quarter a year ago. Delhivery cofounder and chief executive officer Sahil Barua and Sandeep Barasia, the chief business officer, told ET in a post-earnings call that its operating leverage would kick in even as it continues to chase growth.
