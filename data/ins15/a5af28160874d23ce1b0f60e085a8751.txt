President Joe Biden apparently got brain freeze during a pit stop at an Oregon ice-cream parlor over the weekend and forgot about the millions of Americans suffering financially when asked about the economy.
'I'm not concerned about the strength of the dollar, I'm concerned about the rest of the world. Does that make sense?' the commander in chief asked reporters Saturday when questioned about worries that the US dollar's surging strength is accelerating the rise of international inflation.
Asked to explain, Biden, 79, replied, 'Our economy is strong as hell' — as he munched on a waffle cone of Baskin Robbins chocolate-chip ice cream.
