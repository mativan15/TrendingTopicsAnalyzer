Capcom is back with another presentation, and this time, it's a Resident Evil showcase. The 2022 Resident Evil showcase promises a meaty look at two of Capcom's upcoming survival horror projects: Resident Evil 4 remake and the Resident Evil Village DLC, Winter's Expansion and, presumably, the Shadows of Rose campaign included in it. The showcase is nearly an hour long, rumored to run for 57 minutes, and with Resident Evil 4 remake due out in March 2023, Capcom could very well surprise us with a demo, a little horror as a Halloween treat, not unlike what they did with Resident Evil Village during a showcase prior to its launch.
