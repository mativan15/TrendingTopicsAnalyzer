Will County officials touted the green benefits, both environmental and financial, that will come from a renewable natural gas plant in Wilmington during a ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday.

The 20,000-square-foot facility sits on a 1.5-acre site next to the county's Prairie View Landfill in Wilmington, and will take the landfill gas and transform it into pipeline-quality gas, said Darren Nightingale, SCS Energy project manager.

'Instead of putting emissions into the atmosphere, we're reusing it for something useful,' said Christina Snitko, senior energy and conservation specialist with the Will County Land Use Department.
