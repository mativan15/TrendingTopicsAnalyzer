Inflation, though cooling in some areas of the economy, remains stubbornly hot overall. A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed that consumers raised their expectations for future inflation. It also showed that overall consumer confidence remains surprisingly strong despite high prices on a wide range of goods.'Core inflation is running at levels that are too high, and the University of Michigan's numbers today show that it is starting to feed into consumers' expectations, and that's almost exactly to a ‘T' what the Fed would like to avoid,' said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
