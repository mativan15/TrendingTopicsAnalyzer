Liam Payne has opened up about co-parenting with Cheryl, sharing how he plans to 'always glue' himself to their five-year-old son Bear.

In an appearance on the Impaulsive podcast, hosted by Logan Paul, on Tuesday 31 May, Payne revealed that Cheryl has taken the reins on parenting Bear.

'She gives me full autonomy of my own life to be able to go and do what I do, and at the same time I know [Bear] is being taken care of because he is all she cares about,' he said.
