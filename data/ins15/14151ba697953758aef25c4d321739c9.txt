The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the Centre to immediately stop giving funds or any other assistance to sports federations that have refused to comply with the requirements of the National Sports Development Code of India, 2011. The court issued the direction while hearing a petition filed by a senior advocate and sports activist, Rahul Mehra, seeking to ensure that the National Sports Federations (NSFs) comply with the sports code.
