Liz Truss is battling to save her premiership as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warned 'eye-wateringly difficult' decisions were needed as he tore up her economic strategy.

Mr Hunt scaled back the energy support package and ditched 'almost all' the tax cuts announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng less than a month ago as he tried to restore economic stability following weeks of turmoil on the financial markets.

Ms Truss became Prime Minister after winning the Tory leadership contest on the back of promises to dramatically cut tax, and the wholesale abandonment of the policies has left her fighting for her job after just six weeks.
