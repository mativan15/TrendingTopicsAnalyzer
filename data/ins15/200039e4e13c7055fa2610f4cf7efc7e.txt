In this article:

Needham analyst Charles Shi reiterated Buy on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE: TSM) and a $110 price target.

Shi added TSMC to the Needham Conviction List, replacing FormFactor, Inc (NASDAQ: FORM).

Shi saw a positive risk-reward as he updated the bull-bear debate.

Shi's bullish call on TSMC's double-digit growth in 2023 met with pushback.

Investors have expressed uneasiness about TSMC's 1H23 despite the general optimism about 2H23 and 2024.

Shi adds demand-side analysis to better capture cyclicality factors in our supply-side model.
