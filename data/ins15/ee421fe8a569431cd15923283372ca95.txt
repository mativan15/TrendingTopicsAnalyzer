 Some residents of Brandon are under a boil water advisory after a power outage at the city's water treatment facility.
The city says there has been a loss of water pressure in the western portion of the Brandon distribution system, which is south of the Assiniboine River to Richmond, west of 18th Street.This can lead to distribution depressurization which can compromise the safety of the water supply, leading to the advisory.
