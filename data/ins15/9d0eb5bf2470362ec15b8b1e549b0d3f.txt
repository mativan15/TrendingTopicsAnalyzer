Elon Musk has ordered Tesla to cut 10pc of jobs worldwide after saying he has a "super bad feeling about the economy".
The electric car-maker's chief executive also ordered an immediate hiring freeze in an email to staff sent on Thursday, which was seen by Reuters.
Around 100,000 staff are employed by Tesla around the world, according to its annual US Stock Exchange Commission filing.
Mr Musk's directive to shed 10pc of staff comes after he told Tesla staff their current work from home arrangements are effectively over.
