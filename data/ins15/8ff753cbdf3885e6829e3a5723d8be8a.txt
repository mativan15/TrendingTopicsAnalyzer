When investing for growth, it helps to have an appreciation for the general pace that different investments tend to multiply in value given certain economic conditions. A major pharmaceutical company like AbbVie (ABBV 1.03%) and a rising cannabis company like Tilray Brands (TLRY 7.32%) operate in different industries and have several other characteristics that make proper comparisons complicated.
Tilray's smaller size and strong position in a rapidly growing industry would suggest to some that its stock has great potential to 5x in value relatively quickly.
