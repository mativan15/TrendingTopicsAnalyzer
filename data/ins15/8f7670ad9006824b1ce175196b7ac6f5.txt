Ben Elton says picking up his Friday Night Live mic after more than three decades will be more than a little nerve-wracking. Yes, he's just finished a successful stand-up tour, and has a wealth of TV series, musicals and plays under his belt, not to mention a string of hit books. But somehow returning to the gritty, fully live show, which launched scores of comedy careers back in the day, has given him some jitters – mostly because he'll be showcasing brand new material. 'I guess I do know I can do it,' he says, when I tell him I can't wait to hear his take on this month's extraordinary Tory shenanigans.
