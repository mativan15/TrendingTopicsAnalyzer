The Swiss-based tobacco company raised its offer from 106 kronor ($9.46) to 116 kronor per share in a move it hopes will finalize the takeover, giving it a vast distribution network in the US, the world's largest market for smoking alternatives. Philip Morris said the bid is its 'best and final' offer.

The raised offer also comes just a day after Philip Morris struck a $2.
