Following a spectacular rise in his wealth that was the result of a historical rally in the stock prices of the listed companies in his debt-powered empire, Gautam Adani topped the 2022 Forbes list of India's 100 Richest with a net worth of $150 billion. He was followed by the long-time leader of the rich list, Mukesh Ambani, who was dethroned this year by Adani. His net worth is reportedly $88 billion. Radhakishan Damani, Cyrus Poonawalla, Shiv Nadar, Savitri Jindal, Dilip Shanghvi, the Hinduja brothers, Kumar Mangalam Birla and the Bajaj family completed the top 10.
