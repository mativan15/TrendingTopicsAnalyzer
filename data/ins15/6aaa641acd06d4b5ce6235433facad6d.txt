The Pac-12 hasn't placed a team in the College Football Playoff in six years. The conference's New Year's Six drought is almost as lengthy.
Both streaks — or only one — could end this year.
The CFP remains a possibility, particularly for the Los Angeles schools.
So is missing the CFP again but sending a non-champion to the Cotton Bowl, which is part of the New Year's Six and has two at-large slots available this season. One of them will be reserved for the highest-ranked Group of Five team.
The other could go to a Pac-12 team that finishes with one or two losses but doesn't win the conference title — yet another potential benefit to having a top-heavy conference.
