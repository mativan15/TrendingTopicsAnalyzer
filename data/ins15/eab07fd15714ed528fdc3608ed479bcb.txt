Chinese battery giant CATL has slowed its planning for investment in battery plants in North America on concern that new US rules on sourcing battery materials will drive costs higher, two people with knowledge of the matter said.The world's largest battery maker, which supplies one of every three electric vehicles, has been considering opening new plants in the United States and Mexico since earlier this year, Reuters reported previously.The planned investment in northern Mexico, South Carolina or Kentucky would be part of an expansion for CATL beyond China, where it controls almost half of the battery market, and serve major automakers who are customers, including Ford and BMW, people with knowledge of the process have said.
