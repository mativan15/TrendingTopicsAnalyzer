Chargers vs. Broncos matchups, how to watch and score prediction

By Jeff Miller

Austin Ekeler is coming off a career-best 173 yards rushing at Cleveland. He also has scored five touchdowns over the last two games. Offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said he sensed early against the Browns that Ekeler was about the break out.

'Man, this kid is on fire and ready to play today,' Lombardi said he recalled thinking. 'I'm sure he was feeling it.' Denver is middle of the pack against the run, ranking 15th overall.
