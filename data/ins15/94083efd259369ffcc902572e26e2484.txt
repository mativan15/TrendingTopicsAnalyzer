The announcement coincides with Black History Month, which is being marked at the school and is a fitting tribute to this year's theme ‘Time for Change: Action Not Words'.The scholarships are intended to support exceptional future leaders who will enhance the diversity of the MBA class and the wider School and will go on to be outstanding leaders within their sectors.Black leaders and ethnic minority leaders have historically been underrepresented in business, especially at leadership levels. In 2022, just six of the Fortune 500 Companies were headed by Black CEOs.
