The 435 winners, who live in Rhymney, South Wales, scooped a share of the prize money through the People's Postcode Lottery. Nine neighbours from Pen-Y-Dre shared the largest portion of the prize after their postcode, NP22 5DL, was named as the full winning postcode. Edward Owen, 76, who played with two tickets, won £370,000 while the other eight, each with one ticket, walked away with £185,000.
