Price Action

Bitcoin (BTC) is officially boring: The price was flat on Thursday at just above $19,000, and data shows that the largest cryptocurrency by market value's 30-day volatility is at its lowest in almost two years.

Today's drama came from Axie Infinity, the 'play-to-earn' gaming platform that has mostly been a disappointment this year. The platform's once-hot AXS tokens fell 8%, one of day's worst performers among digital assets, after a CoinDesk report that millions of the tokens are due to be unlocked – meaning that early investors who have been restricted from selling because of vesting periods might now choose to dump the token.
