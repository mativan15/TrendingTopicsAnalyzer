monsitj Bank of America is bullish on Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) despite EPS guidance from the household products seller that came in at the low end of the expected range. Positive developments for P&G that instill confidence for BofA that FY23 targets can be met are that volume is holding and more operating profit growth is expected for FQ2 and FQ3. Despite tough sales comparables and a greater negative FX headwind, BofA still sees a more favorable second-half 2023 environment as PG benefits from a robust pipeline of savings initiatives.
