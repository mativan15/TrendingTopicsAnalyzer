MOSCOW—Russian President Vladimir Putin, who this week gave local authorities new powers to maintain order, is also seeking to appease the public with compensation packages of money and goods for the men swept up in his unpopular mobilization campaign.

The subsidies—which range from payments that can well exceed average monthly salaries to distributions of animals and food—are billed as support for the families of the more than 200,000 men called away since last month to serve in the military.
