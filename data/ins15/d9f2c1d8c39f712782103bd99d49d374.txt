Lloyds Banking Group (LSE: LLOY) has had a tough year, along with other financial stocks. And for months, I've been fearing that the Lloyds share price could fall under 40p. Well, actually more like hoping, so I could buy more even cheaper.

It finally happened this week, and the 40p barrier was broken.

In a week when the government told us it wouldn't cut spending, but is still slashing taxes, economists everywhere were possibly tearing their hair out.

Unsurprisingly, stock markets didn't respond well.
