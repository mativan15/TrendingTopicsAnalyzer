President Biden attacked GOP candidate Mehmet Oz and sought to portray the Pennsylvania Senate race as a make-or-break moment for the country during an appearance in the Keystone State aimed at boosting Democrat John Fetterman.

'We need John badly. Not a joke,' Biden told those gathered for a fundraiser on behalf of Fetterman in Philadelphia on Thursday evening, according to pool reports,.

Biden praised Fetterman for having 'integrity' while seeking to paint Oz as an out-of-towner who would try to undo 'everything we have done' if elected.
