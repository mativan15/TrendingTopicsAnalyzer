nielubieklonu/iStock via Getty ImagesTwelve months ago, I advised investors to get long shares of leading helicopter services provider Bristow Group (NYSE:NYSE:VTOL) or "Bristow" based on strong free cash flow generation potential and prospects for a substantial recovery in offshore oil and gas activities this year.
