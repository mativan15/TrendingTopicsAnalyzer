Haryana's home minister Anil Vij on Friday hit out at Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over farm fires amid concerns in the National Capital Region (NCR) on air pollution, which increases significantly at this time of the year. It has been attributed in the past both to stubble burning and bursting of crackers during the festive season. With several states involved, it has been difficult to fix accountability over the matter, which has also been discussed in the Supreme Court.Taking a dig, the Haryana minister suggested that the Delhi CM is not blaming Punjab anymore because the state now has the AAP government, led by Bhagwant Mann.
