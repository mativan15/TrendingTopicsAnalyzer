John Kear spoke of his pride and disappointment after Wales suffered a battling 18-12 defeat to the Cook Islands in their Rugby League World Cup opener.Tries from Rhodri Lloyd and Ollie Olds gave the predominantly part-time Welsh a 12-8 interval lead at Leigh Sports Village but the more experienced South Pacific islanders wore them down in the second half.Even then, Wales had a chance to snatch a draw in the last minute but Caleb Aekins was unable to take advantage of an overlap out wide after Lloyd charged down a kick.
