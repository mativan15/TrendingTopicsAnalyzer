Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned for Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer this weekend in what's being considered a potential preview for a 2024 or 2028 presidential run.  Harris attended several events in Detroit to campaign on behalf of Whitmer and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, highlighting federal legislation like the CHIPS Act, which aims to bring more manufacturing jobs to the Motor City and the country at whole, FOX 2 Detroit reported. The gubernatorial race in Michigan is now being considered a "toss-up" between Whitmer and Republican candidate Tudor Dixon, according to polling outlet RealClearPolitics, which shows the Democrat ahead in the race by 5.
