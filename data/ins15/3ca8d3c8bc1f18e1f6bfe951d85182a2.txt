The government has asked state-owned lenders to set up a "single national helpline" to facilitate expeditious redressal of consumer grievances."The helpline number will be preferably of three or four digits, so that in case of need customers dial the given number to reach out to their banks and respective branches or departments by way of a hub-and-spoke model," said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.Preliminary work has begun on the proposal, which was discussed with the banks in September, said the official.
