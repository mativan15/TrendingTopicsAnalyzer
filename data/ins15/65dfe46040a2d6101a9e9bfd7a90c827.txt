This week in coins

It was the fourth consecutive week of losses or no movement for Bitcoin and Ethereum, both of which dipped lower at the end of this week after more high inflation readings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Bitcoin fell 2% over the past week and currently trades for $19,126; Ethereum fell 3.5% to a current price of $1,282, according to CoinGecko data.

On Monday, Bitcoin's mining difficulty hit a new all-time high after rising by 14%—the largest spike since May. As difficulty increases, miners could face slimmer profits if Bitcoin's price stays inert, since more computing power and electricity is needed to mine.
