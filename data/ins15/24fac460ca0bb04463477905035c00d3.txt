photographer3431/E+ via Getty Images Realty Income (NYSE:O) is the world's largest triple net lease REIT with a massive enterprise value of $58.1 billion. O has trademarked and assigned itself the name The Monthly Dividend Company to reflect its devotion to generating stable and steadily growing monthly dividend checks for shareholders. O owns over 6,500 real estate properties, virtually all of which are secured by long-term, conservatively structured, triple net leases. As a result, it has one of the most stable cash flow profiles in the market today, enabling it to pay out over 600 consecutive common stock monthly dividends over the course of 52 years, while also increasing the dividend payout by 109 times since going public in 1994.
