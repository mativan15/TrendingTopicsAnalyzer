Brazil's former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and incumbent Jair Bolsonaro clashed in their first one-on-one election debate on Sunday.

They repeatedly called each other liars and alleged corruption.

"The truth is that you didn't take care about people during the COVID-19 pandemic, you had fun, laughed and you said you'd not have the vaccine," said Lula.

"You said those who did would become alligators and homosexuals and that they should not have the vaccine.

"You made fun of people and imitated people drowning with no oxygen in Manaus.
