Wall Street tends to offer only one guarantee: change. Over time, today's largest companies by market cap are liable to be replaced by new and innovative businesses.
For instance, only one of the 10 largest publicly traded companies in 1999 is still among the top 10 by market cap today (Microsoft). The other nine stocks, which included the likes of Nokia and AIG, have fallen far down the list.
The same fate may await tech kingpin Apple (AAPL 4.08%).
