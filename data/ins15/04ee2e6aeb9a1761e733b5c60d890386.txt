ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — The African Union has scheduled peace talks to resolve Ethiopia's Tigray conflict for Oct. 24, the Ethiopian prime minister's national security adviser said Thursday.

The statement from Redwan Hussein came as fighting continued between Ethiopia's federal government troops and the authorities in Tigray.

Earlier this week, Ethiopia's government said it was aiming to control all airports in the region and announced the capture of three key cities, including Shire, which is home to large numbers of people displaced by the conflict.
