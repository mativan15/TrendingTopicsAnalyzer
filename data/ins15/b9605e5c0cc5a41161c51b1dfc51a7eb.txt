Almost five years after directions from the Supreme Court to State governments to frame guidelines to prevent cases of honour killings, mob lynching and mob violence in the State, the Maharashtra government issued directions to the Director General of Police (DGP) to set up helplines in every district to report such cases of hate crime. The Supreme Court in March 2018 and then in October 2018 had told the State government to identify districts, sub-divisions and villages where instances of honour killings at the assembly of khap panchayats were reported in the last five years.
