 Roosevelt Room 1:28 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ready, get set, go?  Well, good afternoon.  Earlier this year, because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the price of oil and gas increased dramatically, and I acted decisively at the time.  And thanks in part to those actions, the price of our gas has fallen 30 percent from the summer highs.  Now it's down about $1.15 a gallon from their peak during the summer, and gas prices have fallen every day in the last week.  Let me repeat: Gas prices have come down, and they continue to come down again.
