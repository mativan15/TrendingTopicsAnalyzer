Falcor It's been a rough year thus far for the Gold Miners Index (GDX), with the ETF down over 30% year-to-date, reversing to underperformance vs. the major market averages. Unfortunately, this bear market environment has made it very challenging for investors in the space to generate positive returns, given that miners are selling off on good news, great news, or mediocre news. This is exacerbated by tax-loss selling as we near year-end and certainly not helped by the declining gold price. For Torex Gold (OTCPK:TORXF), this has made it a frustrating year, given that even though the company is on track to beat production guidance and meet cost guidance, the stock has found itself down 35% year-to-date.
