Sam Shepard's 'True West' is a play about sibling rivalry between two brothers gone kablooey, and for the first third or so of the new film 'Raymond & Ray' on Apple TV+ starring Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke, there are hints that we're headed in a similarly intriguing direction.

A dark comedy from writer-director Rodrigo García, it feels like it's adapted from a play (it's not), with the focus on the two estranged half brothers of the title who reunite upon the news of their abusive father's death.
