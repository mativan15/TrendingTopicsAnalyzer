The Baltimore Ravens have seen wide receiver Rashod Bateman miss multiple games with a foot injury. As a result, the team's depth at wideout has been tested, and the results haven't been encouraging.
On Monday, it was reported by Adam Schefter of ESPN that Baltimore was bringing in veteran wide receiver DeSean Jackson for a visit. Just one day later, it's been reported by multiple outlets that the Ravens are in agreement on a deal with Jackson, and he'll join the team in hopes of resurrecting his career by providing big plays using what's left of his speed and playmaking ability.
