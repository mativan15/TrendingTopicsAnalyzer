(CNN Business)For much of her first decade at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg's public stature grew alongside the size and influence of the company she helped run. As second-in-command to Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg, she oversaw the massive growth of its core advertising business while positioning herself as an icon of corporate feminism. When she joined Facebook as COO in 2008, she was the rare woman in the C-Suite of a tech company. Her book, "Lean In," was released five years later, and it launched a movement of the same name to inspire a generation of women to speak up in the workplace and beyond.
