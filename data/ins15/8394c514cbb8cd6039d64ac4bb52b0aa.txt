NEW YORK, Oct. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Conference Board Leading Economic Index® (LEI) for the U.S. decreased by 0.4 percent in September 2022 to 115.9 (2016=100), after remaining unchanged in August. The LEI is down 2.8 percent over the six-month period between March and September 2022, a reversal from its 1.4 percent growth over the previous six months.
"The US LEI fell again in September and its persistent downward trajectory in recent months suggests a recession is increasingly likely before yearend," said Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director, Economics, at The Conference Board.
