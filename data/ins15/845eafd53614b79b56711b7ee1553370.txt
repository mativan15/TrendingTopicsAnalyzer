Office lettings in Aberdeen are on course to double this year as the high oil price pushes up demand for space.Transactions involving more than 304,000 sq ft have taken place in the city in the first nine months of the year.Knight Frank, the property consultancy, expects the figure to top 400,000 sq ft by the end of 2022 as talks progress on several deals. That would be a sharp upturn from the 197,000 sq ft of deals recorded in 2021.The largest deal in the third quarter was Dolphin Drilling taking on 9,000 sq ft at the D2 Business Park in Dyce, six miles northwest of Aberdeen city centre.
