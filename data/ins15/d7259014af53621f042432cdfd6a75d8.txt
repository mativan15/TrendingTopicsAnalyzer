The deadline for the beleaguered Scottish census has been extended again after it recorded the lowest ever response rate in the modern era.
National Records of Scotland said it will continue to accept returns until June 12, after it admitted that more than 400,000 households had failed to fill it in even after a previous four-week extension.
The response rate of 87.5 per cent is well below a 94 per cent target and compares with 97 per cent achieved in the rest of the UK, where the census went ahead as planned last year.
