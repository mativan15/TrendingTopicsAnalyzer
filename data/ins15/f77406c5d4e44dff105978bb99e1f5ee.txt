Elon Musk explains why one should not fear turbulence travelling in a plane. He stated, 'Commercial airliner wings can handle insane amounts of bending.' Turbulence occurs when an aeroplane travels through the air, clashing bodies that move at different speeds. Musk said a commercial airliner's wings could bend a lot and withstand many strong forces. While it all results in a bumpy ride, some people do not wish to travel because of it. Musk explains that turbulence will not crash a plane. Scientists have said turbulence will increase in the future because of climate change.
