Tomorrow is the start of Atlantic Hurricane season and forecasters already have their eyes on a disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico. A tropical depression could develop from the remnants of Hurricane Agatha, a Pacific storm that hit Mexico yesterday. The National Hurricane Center is putting cyclone formation at 60-percent over the next five days and forecasters are predicting heavy rain across southern Florida by the end of the week. Florida's Disaster Preparedness Tax Holiday is underway through June 10th giving you the opportunity to stock up on hurricane supplies without having to pay sales tax.
