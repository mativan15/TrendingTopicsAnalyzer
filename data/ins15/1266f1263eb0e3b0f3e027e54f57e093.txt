SAN DIEGO — This is what the stupid money was all about: the opening game of the National League Championship Series, with half a billion dollars' worth of Philadelphia Phillies superstars lifting the team to victory.

Zack Wheeler held the San Diego Padres to one hit, Bryce Harper homered to left and Kyle Schwarber homered to outer space. The Phillies won on Tuesday, 2-0, and will head home after Wednesday's matinee with no worse than a split — and a chance to clinch the pennant at home.

That is zipping far ahead, of course, but isn't that what sports fans do? It is when you own your hometown team, the one you rooted for as a boy at Connie Mack Stadium, as a young man at The Vet and as a billionaire at Citizens Bank Park.
