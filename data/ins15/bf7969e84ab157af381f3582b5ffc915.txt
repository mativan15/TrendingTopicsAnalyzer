Dear Katie,
My husband, who would have turned 65 last month, sadly died in January. I have been gradually going through all of the paperwork that follows someone's death, including his pension documents. I discovered he had a retirement fund from a company he worked for back in the 1980s.
The policy is now managed by Phoenix Life. In November last year he received notification that its minimum value would be £60,757, as of his 65th birthday.
