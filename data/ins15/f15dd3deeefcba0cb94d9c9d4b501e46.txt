Rockville's MacroGenics Inc. just struck a deal with a major U.S. pharmaceutical company that could mean more than $1.7 billion for the local biotech.

MacroGenics (NASDAQ: MGNX) said Monday it has formed a collaboration agreement with Foster City, California-based Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) — giving Gilead the green light to develop and exclusively license MacroGenics' blood cancer treatment candidate, called MGD024.

That molecule, now in early stages of development, was created using MacroGenics' DART platform, which creates antibodies that can help destroy cancer cells, among other applications.
