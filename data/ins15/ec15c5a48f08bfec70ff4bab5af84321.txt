I was laughing when I checked Twitter and saw that #Swedengate was trending. All this fuss because of the revelation that Swedish people don't – as a rule – serve food to guests (particularly to other children who are playing at their houses). It's true, but what's more confusing to me is why that's even a problem.

As a child growing up in Gothenburg, I remember not really caring at all that I wasn't being fed – I just continued playing and had a nice, quiet time while the other family had their dinner.
