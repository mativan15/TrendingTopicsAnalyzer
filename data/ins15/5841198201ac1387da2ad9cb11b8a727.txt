Best Buy
As Memorial Day passes, along with its yearly sales, we're back to looking at our traditional Best Buy TV deals, and today, we have an excellent one for this 50-inch Pioneer. While you're probably more familiar with Pioneer as a speaker company, they do have a bit of market share in the TV niche. While they aren't likely to compete with the big names, their TVs are still pretty good, especially given that they cost less yet still pack a bunch of features, and with this TV being discounted by Best Buy down to just $280, from $420 for just a few hours, it's worth a look.
