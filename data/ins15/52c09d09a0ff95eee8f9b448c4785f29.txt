The Foreign Ministry reported to authorities on Friday that it had received a suspicious envelope, prompting the Metropolitan Police Department's bomb squad to rush to the ministry in Tokyo, the police said.
The envelope contained a plastic bottle with its lid open, something like a warning flare and a letter. The police are investigating the case as a possible forcible obstruction of business. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.
