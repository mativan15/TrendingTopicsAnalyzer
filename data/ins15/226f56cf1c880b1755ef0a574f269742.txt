The Bank of England denied a Financial Times report saying the central bank is delaying the start of its program of gilt sales, prompting a selloff in UK bonds.

The newspaper reported earlier Tuesday the central bank was set to push back the start of its planned sales of government bonds beyond the current date of Oct. 31 because gilt markets have been 'very distressed.'
