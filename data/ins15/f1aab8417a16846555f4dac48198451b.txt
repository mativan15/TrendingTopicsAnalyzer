SAVANNAH, Ga. — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker met Friday for their first and only debate in a brutally competitive Georgia Senate race, clashing over abortion and inflation, but agreeing that the 2020 election was legitimately won by President Joe Biden.

The debate was marked by frequent interruptions by Walker, a first-time political candidate, who sought to portray the Democratic incumbent as a creature of Washington who votes with Biden too often. Warnock defended his votes on a sweeping climate and health care bill and gun violence prevention legislation during his two years in the Senate.
