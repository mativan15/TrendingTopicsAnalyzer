The demand for flexible workspaces from large enterprises has gone up multi-fold in the backdrop of the rising acceptance for hybrid work model that emerged post the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and so has the preference for customisation of these office spaces.The entire flexible workspace universe has shifted from a cookie-cutter approach of standard workspace options to a more customised, enterprise solution with a big focus on end-to-end space and amenities management.This has resulted in the emergence of a distinct managed space operator category within the flex ecosystem, in addition to other operators that are evolving to a more hybrid model to support large enterprises, now creating on-demand, new-age workspaces.
