Cal's season took a dramatic turn in the wrong direction on Saturday after a 20-13 overtime loss at Colorado.
The Bears (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) were 15-point favorites over the Buffaloes (1-5, 1-2), who had come no closer than 23 points in any of their five previous games.
Colorado made a coaching change after its most recent game, and a defense that had allowed more than 43 points per game gave Cal trouble all afternoon on Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado.
The Bears finished with just 35 net rushing yards against the country's statistically worst run defense.
