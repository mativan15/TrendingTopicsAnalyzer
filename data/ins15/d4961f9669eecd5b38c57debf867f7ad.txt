It doesn't get bigger than playing for your country, so to kick off the Rugby League World Cup with such a performance as England did against Samoa is really special.There was a lot of pressure, lots of us were nervous coming into it, and it was a massive game.Even so, it was probably the most enjoyable game I've had, maybe even more than Grand Finals where it's hard to enjoy in the moment because it's too close.This was one where you could take it all in, take the atmosphere in while we were scoring tries.
