Variety - Film News Tom Felton revealed in his new memoir, 'Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard,' that he still feels 'ashamed' for mocking co-star Emma Watson's dance moves on the set of the 'Harry Potter' movies. Felton was 12 years old when he started filming the first movie, while Watson was only 9. When Felton and his fellow Slytherin actor Josh Herdman (Gregory Goyle) heard Watson had 'put together a little dance show in her dressing room,' they walked over and were 'predictably dismissive' of her.
