A middle school principal called families after a student was caught passing out a 'significant amount of money' to other students at school, according to a voice message from the Florida principal.

The student had taken $10,000 from her grandparent and 'passed it out among their peers,' Jason Jacobs, principal of Lake Weir Middle School in Summerfield, told parents in a voicemail sent the evening of Oct. 20. Summerfield is about 70 miles northwest of Orlando.

Jacobs asked parents to help him get the money back.
