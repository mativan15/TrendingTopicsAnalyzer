Former NBA player Charles Barkley has agreed to a 10-year deal with TNT, expected to pay more than nine figures, according to a report from the New York Post.

Barkley's current contract with the NBA broadcaster — which pays him $10 million per season — still has three years left, ending after the 2024-25 season and overlapping with TNT's broadcast agreement with the league.

If Barkley fulfills his entire current contract, he would be looking at making over $100 million, approaching $200 million, but the exact amount is not yet known.
