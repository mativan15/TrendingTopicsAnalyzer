The ever-increasing number of jobless youths in the tiny hill state that lacks resources and industrialisation has become a major issue in the 2022 assembly polls. Although unemployment becomes an issue in every election in Himachal and the parties have promised 75% of jobs to Himachalis in the industrial sector, however, the ground reality remains otherwise. The bulk of the workforce in the industrial units in Himachal is from other states. Now, as Haryana is bringing legislation to ensure 75% of jobs for Haryana youth in the industry, Himachal is also likely to tread a similar path.
