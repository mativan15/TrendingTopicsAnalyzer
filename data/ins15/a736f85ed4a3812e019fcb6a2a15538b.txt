The job growth party isn't over — but it's starting to simmer down.

Employers have added at least 400,000 jobs a month for the past year, the longest such streak on record, providing lots of opportunities for people laid off in the pandemic-induced recession and those seeking higher-paying positions.

But the report on May's labor market, due out Friday, could reveal the start of a slowdown, with economists predicting job gains of 325,000, according to a median estimate of those surveyed.

That total would still be robust by historical standards— and the Labor Department could report a higher number.
