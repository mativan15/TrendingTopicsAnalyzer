The Green Bay Packers [3-3] enter Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders [2-4] desperate to snap a two-game losing streak. In their previous two games, the Packers have scored 32 combined points in losses to the Giants and Jets.
In last week's loss to the Jets, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers was sacked four times and hit nine times. Rodgers was frustrated after the Packers' loss and mentioned that the offense needed to be simplified.
