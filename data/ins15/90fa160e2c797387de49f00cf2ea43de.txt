Money can't buy you class, but it can buy you a ticket to BravoCon , which made its big return to New York City on Oct. 14-16. A weekend at the Javits Center gave Bravo fans the chance to shop, attend panels and say 'Hi, baby gorgeous!' to their favorite Bravolebrities. Many praised the convention for providing exclusive programming and allowing Bravholics to get up close and personal with reality stars, while others criticized the event for its long lines to partake in meet-and-greets, purchase drinks and attend panels.
