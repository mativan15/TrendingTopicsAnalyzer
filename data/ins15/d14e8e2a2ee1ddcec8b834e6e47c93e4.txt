U.S. stocks rose Thursday morning as markets remain on track to snap a 7-week losing streak.

The S&P 500 climbed as much as 1.8% in early trading, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 500 points, or 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.2% higher as the index attempts to claw its way out of bear market territory.

A rebound in retail earnings spurred markets early in the session, with Macy's (M) rising as much as 12% in early trading after the retail giant raised its profit outlook in an upside surprise to investors weighing a slew of downward forecast revisions from peers.
