Blizzard tucked some secrets into the Overwatch 2 maps, a few fans have discovered, and they may point to future overhauls or perhaps Overwatch 2's PvE mode, set to launch sometime in 2023. TikTok user Lowendwibs (first spotted by IGN) noticed the blocked areas while tinkering with the replay spectator mode's camera and uncovered substantial areas not normally reachable during regular play with pathways and complete assets – not what you normally expect from out-of-bounds areas in video games.
Lowendibs showed portions of the Rialto map, though Havana and King's Row also appear to have unreachable, complete areas.
