Guinea's top prosecutor is calling for a crackdown on the organisers and participants of anti-junta protests while the opposition and justice minister said Friday three civilians were killed in the unrest.

Young protesters clashed on Thursday with security forces in the capital Conakry in demonstrations called by an outlawed group against the country's ruling junta.

Conakry's Prosecutor General Yamoussa Conte said six security forces personnel were wounded, five of whom were in serious condition, adding that two civilians were injured.
