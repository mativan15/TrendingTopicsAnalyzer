In a striking early scene in Year One: A Political Odyssey, the newly inaugurated US president, Joe Biden, enters the White House on January 20 last year to meet his staff.Entering a room alone, wearing a face mask, Biden faces a bank of TV screens showing the faces of hundreds of employees from the White House and other agencies, tuning in via Zoom to greet the new commander-in-chief.'Hello Cathy,' Biden said to his head of White House presidential personnel, also welcoming him remotely.'This was not business as usual, this was not normal.
