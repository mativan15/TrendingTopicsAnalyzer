Weaponry that Washington and its allies in Europe and beyond send to Kiev are likely to end up in the global black market, Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock said on Wednesday. Various criminal groups already have their eye on these weapons, the official told the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris.Stock has urged the Interpol member states to actively cooperate in tracing the arms delivered to Ukraine, adding that those who supply the weapons should play a major role in this effort. The Interpol chief has also said he expects a 'wave' of not just small arms but heavy weapons to flood the international black market as soon as the conflict between Moscow and Kiev ends.
