Nashville, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona's household as a child was filled with music. Both his parents were performers, and he and his siblings were their backing band.

'My brother played the guitar and I played percussion. My sister joined in on choruses. We grew up together singing, and music was a huge part of our growing up and our connection to our roots," he said.

But he says in too many school systems, students don't have access to music education or instruments.
