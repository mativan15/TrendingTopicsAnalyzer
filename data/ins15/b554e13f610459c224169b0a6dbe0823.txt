TechCrunch is thrilled to be shining the spotlight on one of my favorite cities, Columbus, Ohio. TechCrunch Live is hosting a special, extended event today, and we hope you can join us. It's free, it's (mostly) live, and the event features some of the best startups, business leaders, and investors from the great state of Ohio.
The event streams live on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter Spaces, but if you register for Hopin, you can chat with other participants, and participate directly in the event.
