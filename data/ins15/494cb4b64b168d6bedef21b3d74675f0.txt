A feud between two Jewish bagel shop owners in Columbus, Ohio, has spilled out of the oven and into full public view, resulting in a lawsuit and restraining order.

The Columbus Jewish News reports that the owner of Block's Bagels, a local Jewish deli mainstay since 1967, last week sued former business partner Jeremy Fox, owner of the Fox's Bagels & Deli chain after the latter moved to rebrand two shops the parties had been operating jointly.

In court earlier this week, the judge in the case ordered two Fox's locations to continue purchasing products from Block's, saying the latter 'has met its burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it is entitled to a TRO [temporary restraining order],' the Columbus Jewish News reports.
