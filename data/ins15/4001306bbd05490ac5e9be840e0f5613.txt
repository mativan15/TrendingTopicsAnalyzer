EvgeniyShkolenko/iStock via Getty Images Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM) came out of Wednesday's market open down 4.9% as Barclays downgraded the stock to Equal Weight, from Overweight. "We expect it to continue to deliver strong revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and (free cash flow) growth thanks to its exposure to structural growth drivers," said analyst Mathieu Robilliard. "However, we believe that the share price now reflects this," he adds.
