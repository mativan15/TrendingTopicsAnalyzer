COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 17-2022 Today FLSmidth announces a strategic change to enhance long-term profitability and to accelerate growth in the core Mining business. This change includes the decision to divest or wind down risky and unprofitable mining activities. This is the result of a planned strategic review of the combined FLSmidth Mining and former TK Mining technology product portfolio against FLSmidth's long-term strategic direction and ambitions. With this change, FLSmidth is creating a new platform for improved profitability, lower risk and strategic focus on the core value creating parts of the Mining business.
