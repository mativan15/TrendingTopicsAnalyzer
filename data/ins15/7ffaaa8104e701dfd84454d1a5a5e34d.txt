Just Stop Oil activists perching on the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in Dartford, London inspired an unplanned display of fireworks after they caused major disruptions to locals on Monday. Footage emerged on social video showing members of the public aiming pyrotechnics towards the two protesters to manifest their discontent at the chaos the pair sparked since climbing over the crossing. The two climate activists insisted they will remain atop the bridge until the Government agrees to put an end to all new gas and oil extraction licensing in the UK.
