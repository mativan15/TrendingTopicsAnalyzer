The Kothanur police have taken up a robbery case against four persons who allegedly waylaid a car, vandalised the vehicle, dragged out the man driving it, assaulted and robbed him. The men snatched a gold chain and fled the spot as soon as the members of the public gathered at the spot. The victim identified as Anurag KP, a 26-year-old resident of Yelahanka, has filed a complaint with the Kothanur police. Turns out, he had recognised his assailants.

 Anurag told the police the men are also behing cheating several nursing students from West Bengal and Kerala of which Anurag's friends and relatives too were victims.
