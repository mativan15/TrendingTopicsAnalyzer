A new Pokemon generation is coming, and it's a big change from the standard formula. Nintendo calls Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet ($59.99 each) the first open-world Pokemon games (realistically it's just one game, as all Pokemon generations have variant versions with some differences, but that are effectively the same). Based on an hour of hands-on time with a Scarlet/Violet demo on the Nintendo Switch, we suggest that fans who are hungry for an open-world Pokemon game keep their eyes on these upcoming titles that are set to drop on November 18.
