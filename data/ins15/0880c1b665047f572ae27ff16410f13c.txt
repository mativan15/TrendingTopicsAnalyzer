It all starts so well for Card Shark, like a hand you think you're winning. An interesting concept, a unique protagonist, a conspiratorial story and a nice, tactile UI with satisfying clicks and clacks. It's a fantastic starting point – one that at some point gets lost among dull minigames, frustrating memorisation, repetitive gameplay, and a plodding story. It's a shame, but there's a glimmer of light in there for those who find the aesthetic trumps everything else.
On that, you will know immediately from a trailer whether the music and art style of Card Shark is going to hold up for you.
