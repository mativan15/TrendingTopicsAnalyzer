Chandler police are asking for the public's help in locating a suspect whom officers fired upon as the man fled Wednesday evening.

Detective Eva Zermeño, a Chandler Police Department spokesperson, said officers responded to a business near Arizona Avenue and Erie Street about 7:02 p.m. after receiving reports of an armed man threatening a customer inside the business.

According to Zermeño, the suspect flashed a gun in his waistband before leaving the business.

Officers confronted the suspect and asked if he had a gun, which he denied before fleeing on foot.
