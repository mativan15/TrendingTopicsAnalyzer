Oct 18 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index touched a near two-week high on Tuesday, helped by optimism around earnings, while shares of Iamgold Corp jumped on sale of its interest in some gold mines.

At 10:40 a.m. ET (14:40 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was up 162.1 points, or 0.87%, at 18,783.12.

All sector indexes were trading higher except for energy , which was hit by a decline in oil prices.
