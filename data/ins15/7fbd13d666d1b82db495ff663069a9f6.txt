Liverpool always knew that their indomitable centre-back Virgil van Dijk was unbeatable on the pitch and the statistics prove he might just be Jurgen Klopp's lucky charm as well. The Reds claimed an important 1-0 victory over West Ham United thanks to Darwin Nunez's first-half strike.The Merseyside outfit also had goalkeeper Alisson Becker to thank for keeping out Jarrod Bowen's penalty, which could have put their position under question, while Van Dijk was once again assured at the back, and his team-mate Joe Gomez produced a mixed performance after conceding the penalty.
