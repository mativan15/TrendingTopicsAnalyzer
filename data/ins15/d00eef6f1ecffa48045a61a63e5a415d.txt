By Reuters Published: 20:16 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 20:16 EDT, 17 October 2022 The Los Angeles Rams are exploring trade options to help disgruntled running back Cam Akers find "a fresh new start with another team," coach Sean McVay said Monday. Akers missed multiple days of practice, citing "personal" reasons, and did not suit up for the Rams' 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. "As of right now, I think the best option for all parties I think would be to explore if there's a good situation for him with another team," McVay said Monday during a news conference.
