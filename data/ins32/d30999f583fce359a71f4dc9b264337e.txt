High-performance, additively-manufactured atomic spectroscopy apparatus for portable quantum technologies(arXiv)Author : Somya H Madkhaly, Nathan Cooper, Laurence Coles, Lucia HackermüllerAbstract : We demonstrate a miniaturised and highly robust system for performing Doppler-free spectroscopy on thermal atomic vapour for three frequencies as required for cold atom-based quantum technologies. The application of additive manufacturing techniques, together with efficient use of optical components, produce a compact, stable optical system, with a volume of 0.
