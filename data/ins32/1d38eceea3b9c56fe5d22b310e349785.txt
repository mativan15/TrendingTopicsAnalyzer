Federal and state Liberal politicians have accused the Albanese government of 'playing favourites' with infrastructure spending, complaining about the allocation of funding between states and the unpicking of controversial announcements by the former Morrison government.The federal Labor government announced $9.6bn in infrastructure commitments on Sunday for next week's budget, formalising numerous election promises and pledging to reform how money is spent on large projects.But the New South Wales infrastructure minister, Rob Stokes, and the transport minister, David Elliott, claimed the federal government 'shortchanged' their state, pointing out that other jurisdictions were receiving far more cash.
