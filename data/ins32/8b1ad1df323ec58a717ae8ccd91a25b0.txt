More than 250 residents this week asked Osceola County for slower growth until area roads have been improved enough to handle it, but commissioners say their hands are tied by state law.

At the center of residents' complaints during a commission meeting Monday is the fast pace of high-density development without a corresponding expansion of roads, which they said is causing hours-long traffic congestion.

Among the agenda items that angered residents were a plan to build 872 mixed-use homes west of Canoe Creek Road and south of Mildred Bass Road; a plan to build 34 townhomes and 153 parking spaces on Leon Tyson Road; and a plan to build 210 townhomes on Kissimmee Park Road.
