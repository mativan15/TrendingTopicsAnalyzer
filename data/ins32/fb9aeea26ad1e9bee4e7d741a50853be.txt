Federal prosecutors want Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to former President Donald Trump, to be sentenced to six months in prison for contempt of Congress, according to a recommendation filed Monday.

In addition to serving time, the government is seeking $200,000 in fines.

'For his sustained, bad-faith contempt of Congress, the Defendant should be sentenced to six months' imprisonment – the top end of the Sentencing Guidelines' range – and fined $200,000 – based on his insistence on paying the maximum fine rather than cooperate with the Probation Office's routine pre-sentencing financial investigation,' prosecutors wrote in their court filing on Monday.
