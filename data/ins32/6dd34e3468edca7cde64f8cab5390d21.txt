Voters in Colorado's 2nd Congressional District will soon decide if they want to continue to be represented by Joe Neguse — who has held the seat since 2018, when he replaced Gov. Jared Polis — or break the district's extended history of Democratic representation.

The congressional district, which is now anchored in Boulder and Larimer counties but also includes some of the state's top tourist destinations, like Breckenridge and Vail, has been represented by a Democratic candidate consistently since the 1970s.
