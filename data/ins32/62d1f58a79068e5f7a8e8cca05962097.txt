Oct. 20—Defense lawyers for Adam Montgomery, who goes on trial next month on charges related to the 2019 theft of an AR-15 and a shotgun, plan to mount a Perry Mason-like defense and cast blame on another suspect — the wife of the gun owner.

Their defense strategy is spelled out in a flurry of recent filings in Hillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester. Montgomery, the father of the missing and presumed murdered child Harmony Montgomery, will face a Hillsborough County jury next month on the weapons charges.
