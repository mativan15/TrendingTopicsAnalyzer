There are fewer Anglo-Indians than there used to be in Tamil Nadu. But the small yet vibrant community is striving to make a difference, with many of the youths taking to diverse fields. Anglo-Indians have had their own share of challenges. From the abolition of job reservation in Central government services in 1960 to the recent scrapping of nominations to the Lok Sabha and the Assemblies and a shrinking population due to migration, the community has seen it all. There is an estimated population of 40,000 to 45,000 Anglo-Indians in Tamil Nadu, including in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore.
