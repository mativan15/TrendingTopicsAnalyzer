Russell Wilson's injury status will be worth watching in the coming days, but it's not his ailing throwing shoulder at issue.
The Denver quarterback had a Tuesday MRI on his hamstring after injuring it late in the fourth quarter Monday night against the Chargers in Los Angeles, head coach Nathaniel Hackett said.
Hackett wouldn't divulge exactly what the imaging showed — 'we're still looking at it, evaluating it, getting a feel for it,' he said — but did affirm that the team considered Wilson 'day to day' and that he had a chance to play Sunday against the the New York Jets.
