Ethical sponsorship has become a hot-button issue in Australian sport in recent weeks, with athletes raising concerns about corporate backers in a number of competitions. Australia test and one-day Pat Cummins told Australian media this week he wanted climate to be a "real priority" when choosing sponsors and said he had spoken to CA boss Nick Hockley about his concerns.
