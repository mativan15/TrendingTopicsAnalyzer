(Bloomberg) -- Inflation shows few signs of cooling in the economy.

Shocking as that's been for investors, it's one of the few things happening anywhere that actually accords with the Fed's goal of draining the economy of bloat. Recently, the toll in terms of wealth destroyed -- about $15 trillion to date -- has started to approach that of the 2008 financial crisis, when measured against US gross domestic product.
