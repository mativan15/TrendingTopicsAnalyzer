Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday its forces continued to hit military and energy targets in Ukraine over the last 24 hours.
It also said Russian forces had repelled a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the southern Kherson region, from which local Russian-installed officials are currently evacuating tens of thousands of residents.  
Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine's energy minister, said Russia had launched more than 300 air strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities since October 10.
