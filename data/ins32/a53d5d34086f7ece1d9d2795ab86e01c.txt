The Jets hosted veteran defensive tackle Linval Joseph for a visit on Friday, per Mike Garafolo of NFL Network.

Joseph, 34, is a two-time Pro Bowler and former second-round pick. He's a Super Bowl champion, with the Giants back in 2011, and has plenty of experience, looking to embark on his 13th season in the NFL.

The defensive tackle was in his prime with the Vikings in 2016 and 2017, during a six-year stint with Minnesota. Over the last two seasons, Joseph has racked up 63 tackles over 30 games with the Chargers.
