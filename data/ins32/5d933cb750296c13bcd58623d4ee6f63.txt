Published: 14:46 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 14:46 EDT, 31 May 2022 Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has demanded a meeting with aviation bosses to find out 'what's gone wrong' as travel chaos worsens across the country. Airlines continued to axe flights on Tuesday with passengers forced to wait for hours at airports including Manchester, Heathrow, Gatwick and Bristol. Heathrow passengers trying to board their flights claimed they had 'never' seen queues as long as those on Tuesday morning. Passengers have been hit by disruption for several months, with the situation worsening this week due to the rise in demand sparked by the half-term school holiday and the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday period.
