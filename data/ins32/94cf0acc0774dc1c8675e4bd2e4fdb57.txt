October 15, 2022 / 9:05 AM / CNN By Jen Christensen, CNN (CNN) -- Abbott Labs said Friday that it is recalling certain lots of 2 fluid ounce/59 milliliter bottles of Ready-to-Feed liquid formula for infants and children due to a problem with the bottle caps on some bottles that may not have sealed completely and could result in spoilage.If a child were to consume spoiled formula, the company said, it could cause stomach problems such as vomiting or diarrhea.A company spokesperson told CNN that the recall involves "less than a day's worth" of the total infant formula used in the US and should not affect the overall supply.
