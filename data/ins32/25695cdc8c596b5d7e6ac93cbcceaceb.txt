TOKYO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average slid below the key 27,000 mark on Friday, tracking overnight Wall Street losses amid worries that U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes could trigger recession.

However, strong gains by chip-related stocks amid a rise in the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index overnight and strong earnings from IBM capped losses.

The Nikkei slipped 0.21% to 26,951.59, by the midday break, but it was off earlier lows of 26,875.36. Of the index's 225 components, 171 declined, while 51 gained, with three remaining unchanged.
