Bharatiya Janata Party Women's Wing National President and Coimbatore South MLA Vanathi Srinivasan on Friday urged the State government to close all liquor shops for three days - before, after and on Deepavali. She claimed that the reason for 90% of deaths of men aged around 40 was due to alcohol addiction. "The Tamil Nadu government must take responsibility for the all women who lost their husbands due to addiction and ensure they get jobs to support the family. Similarly, the State must take measures to educate the children who lost their father.
