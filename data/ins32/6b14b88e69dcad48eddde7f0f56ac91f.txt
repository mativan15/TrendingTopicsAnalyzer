MoJoe RobertsBy MoJoe RobertsOct 21, 2022The Vegas Golden Knights and adidas revealed the club's 2022-23 Reverse Retro Authentic Uniform, which features black as the primary color for the first time in franchise history. It includes the word "Vegas" across the front, paying homage to its home city, the Sports and Entertainment Capital of the world, as the jersey's crest. We'll get to see it in action during eight games in the 2022-23 season. The Reverse Retro program, driven by adidas and the National Hockey League, intends to celebrate each team's history by throwing it back to a notable time period in that club's history.
