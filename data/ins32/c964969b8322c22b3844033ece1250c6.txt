Dutch Crown Princess Amalia, 18, has been placed under heavy protection after threats of murder and kidnapping likely linked to organized crime, King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima said on Thursday.

Amalia had to leave the student dormitory in Amsterdam, and had moved back home and was largely confined to one of the royal family's palaces in The Hague. The princess is only allowed to go to university under heavy security.

Princess Amalia started her politics and economics degree last month and was living in rented accommodation she shared with several other students in Amsterdam before she had to move back home.
