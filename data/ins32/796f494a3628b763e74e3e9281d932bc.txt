Robert Scott Barnack, a former Roseville financial executive, has pleaded guilty to two felony counts related to state charges of fraud and fraudulent intent to appropriate client money for his own use.

Barnack, 67, formerly ran investment business Balance Point Retirement Analytics LLC in Roseville, which has since been dissolved.

In September, the Placer County District Attorney filed state charges against Barnack of fraud and fraudulent intent to appropriate client money for his own use. The client was Pleasant Grove-based Van Dyke's Rice Dryer Inc.
