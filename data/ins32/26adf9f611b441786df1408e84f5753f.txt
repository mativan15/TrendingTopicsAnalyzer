LANSING — When Voyages Wine Shop opens its doors later this month on the city's east side it will carry about 400 different wines, many of them from small producers all over the world, craft beers and an assortment of groceries.

The concept behind "Greater Lansing's first boutique wine and beer delivery shop" — a wine and beer shop that delivers orders to people's doorsteps — was born during the pandemic, owner Justin King said.
