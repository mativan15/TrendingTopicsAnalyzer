Credit Suisse analysts Susan Roth Katzke and Jill Shea on Friday downgraded shares of Citigroup Inc. C, -1.25% to neutral from outperform after the stock has risen 15% from its recent lows and climbed to within 10% of their $58 a share target price. "We realize that the downside to C shares may prove more limited given a valuation within reach of prior cyclical troughs; but we believe the upside, relative to peers, will also prove more limited given the long road ahead in Citi's transformation process," analysts said.
