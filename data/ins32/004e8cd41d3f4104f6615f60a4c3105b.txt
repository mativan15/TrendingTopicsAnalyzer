The current turmoil in British politics needs to be understood not just as a response to Liz Truss's short time as prime minister, but as the result of problems within the governing Conservative Party since it came to power in 2010.

The Conservative party is a group of about 180,000 people who tend to be wealthier and older than the average UK citizen. It was this group, more than Truss's fellow MPs, who chose her as leader of the Conservative Party. It was also this group that endorsed the policies she tried to impose on the country, causing outcry from the populace and the markets.
