New Delhi: Following a stellar performance in the September 2022 quarter, emerged as the top index gainer on Friday as brokerages remained bullish on the third-largest private lender of the country. Axis Bank reported a 66.29% jump in its consolidated net profit for the September quarter at Rs 5,625.25 crore, driven by a substantial decrease in bad loan provisions and margin expansion. The private lender surged more than 6% and topped a new record lifetime high of Rs 879.95. Brokerages further see a 40% upside potential in the counter from its previous close.
