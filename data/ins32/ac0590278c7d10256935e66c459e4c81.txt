Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images News Stock index futures point to a mixed higher open Wednesday, but premarket earnings will have a lot to say about direction. Nasdaq 100 futures (NDX:IND) +0.1%, S&P futures (SPX) +0.3% and Dow futures (INDU) -0.1% are mixed. The S&P closed above 3,700 on Tuesday, which Citi says raises the odds of a squeeze with half the notional short positions on the index in the red. "It's interesting that we appear to be back in a ‘no news is good news' dynamic for risk sentiment, given how long the bears have been in control for, though I'm still not convinced how prolonged the gains will prove to be," Caxton's Michael Brown said.
