In one of the largest tech deals in history, chip-maker and infrastructure solutions provider Broadcom announced Thursday it is buying operating system virtualization pioneer VMware in a cash and stock deal valued at $61 billion. If the deal, which is expected to be completed in 2023, goes through, it will be the third largest tech acquisition in history just behind Microsoft's 2022 purchase of game maker Activision Blizzard for $70 billion and Dell's purchase of EMC for $67 billion in 2015.
