Protesters who attended Sarah Everard's vigil are being prosecuted by the Metropolitan Police for ‘breaching Covid-19 laws'.
Their case was due to be heard earlier today, behind closed doors and away from the press and public. 
Reports of the closed hearing was a shock to many after the Met lost its bid to appeal a High Court ruling against its handling of the Clapham Common vigil in March 2021. 
Hundreds spontaneously gathered in memory of Sarah – who was raped and murdered by serving officer Wayne Couzens.
