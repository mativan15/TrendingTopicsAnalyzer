A gigantic jackpot has become even larger. There were no winners in Friday's LOTTO MAX jackpot, which offered a $70M grand prize plus 43 million-dollar prizes, but few tickets bought in Calgary will be bringing smiles to their owner's faces. According to the Western Canada Lottery Corporation (WCLC), a ticket worth $722,006.40 was purchased in Calgary for the June 3 draw. It matched six of the seven numbers, plus the bonus number of 42, the lottery's website says. https://www.wclc.com/winning-numbers/lotto-max-extra.
