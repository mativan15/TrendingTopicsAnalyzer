An arts fundraising platform is celebrating after injecting more than $10 million towards helping homegrown creative projects off the ground. Founded in 2013, Boosted is Aotearoa's only dedicated arts crowdfunding platform, and recently passed the impressive eight-figure milestone. The money went towards helping more than 1400 Kiwi creatives - including the Polynesian Panthers, Christchurch's student radio station RDU 98.5FM, musicians Shayne Carter and Reb Fountain, opera singer Jonathan Lemalu, and Pacific Dance company Black Grace.
