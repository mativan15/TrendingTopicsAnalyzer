What started as a simple business idea by a LaSalle, Ont. woman has led to collaboration with a local winery. Her business takes the concept of an outdoor picnic and gives it an upgrade, allowing customers to purchase a high-end picnic at a location of their choosing. But thanks to a recent partnership, Proper Picnics founder Ceana Ussoletti has been able to offer luxury beachside picnic experiences at Sprucewood Shores Estate Winery. After taking part in "something similar to a luxury picnic" in New York five years ago, Ussoletti launched Proper Picnics in May 2021 — at a time when indoor gatherings were restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
