Stanford forward Harrison Ingram on Saturday announced that he will withdraw from the 2022 NBA draft and return to school for his sophomore season.
Ingram, who was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, averaged 10.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and three assists in 32 games. He was one of two true freshmen in the country (Paolo Banchero, Duke) to average at least 10 points, six rebounds and three assists.
He declared for the NBA draft on March 30 while maintaining his remaining collegiate eligibility. Ingram was widely projected to be a second-round pick but ultimately opted to return to school for at least one more season to improve his draft stock.
