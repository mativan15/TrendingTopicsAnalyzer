AgenciesLast week, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman too defended the rupee's depreciation saying the currency has performed much better than many other emerging market currencies as geo-political tensions continue to rise.Market analyst Sunil Shah on Thursday said even though the rupee as a currency has weakened in comparison to the US dollar, but it is still "far stronger" than other currencies. Shah added that the weakening of the rupee will be stable once the FDI (foreign direct investment) flow increases, which the analyst feels is likely from next month.
