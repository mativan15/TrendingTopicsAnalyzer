Qatar's efforts to host football's first 'carbon neutral' FIFA World Cup are being heavily criticised by climate advocates.The Gulf Arab state claims it will either offset or eliminate emissions resulting from the matches that contribute to global warming.But the organisers are "omitting some greenhouse gas emissions from their calculations" and will rely on "flimsy carbon offsets" to reach carbon neutrality, said a report released today, compiled by Carbon Market Watch, an advocacy group.In a statement, Qatar's tournament organisers dismissed the conclusions as speculative, saying emissions will be calculated using "best-in practice" methods after the matches end, to ensure they are based on actual activities.
