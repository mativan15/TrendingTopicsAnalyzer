The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed charges against former NewAge Inc. Chief Executive Brent David Willis, accusing him of a 'multi-year fraud' that included misleading public statements meant to promote the wellness-focused beverage maker that once hoped to take advantage of the nation's CBD craze. The SEC alleged that Willis' statements created the 'illusion' that NewAge NBEVQ, +1900.00% was a pioneer in beverages containing CBD — a cannabis compound that is viewed as non-intoxicating — and that its beverage products overall were taking off with big retailers and distributors worldwide, in an effort to boost the company's financials and stock price.
