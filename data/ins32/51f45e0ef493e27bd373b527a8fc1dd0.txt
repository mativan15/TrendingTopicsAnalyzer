Southwest Tennessee Community College announced it will be holding remote classes on Fridays in an effort to save students gas money. The college began remote Fridays on May 27 and will continue the practice through Aug. 27. The policy comes as gas prices skyrocket across the U.S., both due to inflation and economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine."The well-being of our students and employees is a top priority at Southwest Tennessee Community College," a college spokesperson told Campus Reform.
