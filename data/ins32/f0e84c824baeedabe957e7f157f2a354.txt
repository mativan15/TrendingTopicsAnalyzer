Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei charged Saturday that recent unrest in Iran was due to foreign 'enemies' trying to destroy the Islamic Republic.
The US and its allies are waging a 'psychological war' against Iran, he said, by calling the country out for piracy for seizing two Greek ships — after the US confiscated Iranian oil from a tanker, Reuters reported Saturday.
'Today, the enemies' most important hope for striking a blow at the country is based on popular protests,' Khamenei said, alluding to a week-long protest over the collapse of a building in southwestern Iran last month that killed 37 people.
