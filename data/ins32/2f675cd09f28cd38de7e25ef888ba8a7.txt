Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Meta Platforms stock (NASDAQ:META) remains one of Citi's top picks in the Internet space going into third-quarter earnings reports, marking a "compelling" risk/reward opportunity at current levels. Expectations going into the report are "relatively muted" given industry chatter around engagement, social media competition, and monetization, analyst Ronald Josey says: "Meta is one of the most debated names in our coverage universe into 3Q results." The broader online advertising environment improved during the quarter, Josey says, despite a deteriorating macro environment; with the reined-in expectations, Meta's revenue and profitability are likely to be in line or slightly ahead of expectations.
