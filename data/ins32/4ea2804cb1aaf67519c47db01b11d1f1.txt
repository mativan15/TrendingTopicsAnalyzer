Before billionaire investor Ray Dalio built the world's largest hedge fund, he went broke.On a recent episode of actor Dax Shepard's "Armchair Expert" podcast, Dalio said he nearly tanked hedge fund Bridgewater Associates less than 10 years into running it: After incorrectly predicting that the world market would crash in 1982, Dalio lost investors, clients and a lot of money.Nearing bankruptcy, Dalio said, he had to borrow $4,000 from his father to support his growing family. "[It] was very, very painful, yet it changed my way of thinking," he said.
