Many people will be heading back to work Tuesday after spending a three-day weekend doing things like hanging out on local lakes.

This unofficial start to summer could be an indicator of how busy and profitable the season could be.

Like a fine-tuned machine, there was a parade of boats in and out of the docks near the Buster Boyd Bridge on Lake Wylie.

'We just sun people. We like the sun. Like the weather. Like the water,' boater Tony Lowder said.

Lowder and his family said they did their part by coming to the lake three days in a row.
