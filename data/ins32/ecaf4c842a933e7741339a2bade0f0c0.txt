Tyler Perry almost had a close call with the IRS that could have short-changed him by $9 million.

During the 2022 Earn Your Leisure Conference, Perry revealed his inadequacy when it comes to taxes, which had him in several financial pickles.

'Money isn't something that I had, and nobody taught me that taxes had to be paid,' Perry said, according to Finurah. 'I didn't go to college, but I paid for Harvard many times over in the mistakes that I made.'

Although Perry acknowledges taxes are a grey area, he knew the importance of ensuring taxes need to comply with a certain standard, especially with the dollars he is raking in through his growing media empire.
