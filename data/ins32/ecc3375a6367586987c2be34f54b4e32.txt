Making ice cream at home is undeniably fun (and saves money) but churning out batches with one of those old-fashioned hand-crank machines loses its luster pretty quickly. An electric ice cream maker is a far more realistic way to go if you plan on using it regularly. Right now, Cuisinart's popular 1.5-quart machine is down to $49 on deals site MorningSave. That's about $21 cheaper than we found it anywhere else, and about as good a way as any to kick off frozen treat season.While we haven't had the chance to test this Cuisinart model yet, the compact ice cream machine scores high marks on Amazon and other retailers.
