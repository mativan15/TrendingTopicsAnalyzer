Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad Friday alleged that national interests were compromised under the previous Congress-led UPA government which was always wary of annoying China. The scenario has changed with the ascendance of Narendra Modi as prime minister and policies were now being framed and implemented "with no worries of pressure from the US, China or other major powers", the former union law minister said. Addressing a press conference here on the completion of eight years of NDA in power, Prasad recounted an experience he had when BJP was in opposition and he used to visit Jammu and Kashmir as part of a party delegation.
