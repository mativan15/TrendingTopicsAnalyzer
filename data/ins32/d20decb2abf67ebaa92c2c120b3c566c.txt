Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter has defended the Rugby Football Union over its treatment of Wasps and Worcester and questioned what other punishment the two financially-stricken clubs could have expected.The Gallagher Premiership is in crisis after Wasps followed Worcester into administration on Monday when all 167 players and staff at the Coventry-based team were made redundant.Wasps had already joined Worcester in being suspended from competition with both currently set to be automatically relegated from English rugby's top tier, which will only make it harder to find a new buyer.
