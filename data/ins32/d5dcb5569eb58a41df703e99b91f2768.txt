The long-running stoush between the New South Wales government and the state rail union is escalating again, with the union poised to deactivate Opal card readers in a move that could cost the government millions.The readers will be turned off for the afternoon peak from Thursday, after members of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union voted in favour of taking protected industrial action last week.From 3pm to 7pm every weekday – for an indefinite period – the readers will be switched off, RTBU's secretary, Alex Claassens, said on Monday.
