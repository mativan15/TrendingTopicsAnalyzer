CLEVELAND (AP) — Browns quarterback Jacoby Brissett committed three turnovers, the defense allowed a season high in points, and their fans lustily booed them throughout the second half.

A once-promising season is turning ugly in Cleveland.

Rookie Bailey Zappe threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns as the New England Patriots rolled to a 38-15 victory Sunday, handing the Browns their third consecutive loss and their most lopsided defeat of the year.

'Everyone had their handprint on this one, including myself in a big way,' said Brissett, who was intercepted twice and lost a fumble.
