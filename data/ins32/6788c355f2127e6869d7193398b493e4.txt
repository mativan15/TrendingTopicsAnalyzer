Published: 12:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 12:24 EDT, 21 October 2022 The Boston Bruins and Minnesota Wild both needed more than 60 minutes to secure wins on Thursday. Despite not playing at their best, both bring momentum into Saturday afternoon's meeting in Boston. The Bruins were undefeated before falling Tuesday at Ottawa, but Taylor Hall's goals in the second period and shootout and Linus Ullmark's 30 saves led the way to a 2-1 win over Anaheim on Thursday night. "I thought Taylor Hall was our best skater (and) Linus was our best player," coach Jim Montgomery said.
