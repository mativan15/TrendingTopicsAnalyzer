The government has begun a drive to verify the payments it sent to almost nine million Canadians through the Canada Emergency Response Program (CERB) — and a big chunk of those recipients are being told they have to pay back some or all of the money they received.Some have to return money received through the program because they were ineligible for the amount received and some because they received an advance payment that was never reconciled. Advocates are calling on the government to forgive these debts, which they say will be debilitating for many low-income workers.
