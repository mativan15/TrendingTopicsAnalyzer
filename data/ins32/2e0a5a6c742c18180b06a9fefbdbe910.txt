EDITOR;S NOTE: Michelle Goldberg is a New York Times columnist and author of several books about politics, religion and women's rights.  She was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 2018 for reporting on workplace sexual harassment.The Jan. 6 committee, which held its ninth and likely final hearing Thursday, has lionized the figure of the Decent Republican.Liz Cheney, vice chair of the committee, was its obvious star, imbued with moral authority by the fact that she'd sacrificed her position in Republican leadership, and possibly her political career, to stand up to Donald Trump.
