Perhaps the hottest bet among U.K. bookies is not whether to sell the pound, but whether to short their embattled head of government.  Betting odds overwhelmingly predict Prime Minister Liz Truss will be turfed out before the end of the year. For bookies, the only question remaining seems to be whether a head of store-bought lettuce can outlive her rocky six-week term at 10 Downing Street, which has seen poll support for her conservative Tory Party plunge to historic lows.  As things stand, it's not looking good either: she's losing to the leafy vegetable (at least figuratively).
