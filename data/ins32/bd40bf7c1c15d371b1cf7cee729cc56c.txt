The winner of the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction will be chosen on Monday from among six novels that explore the impact of personal and historical traumas on individual lives. Two books by American authors are on the shortlist for the 50,000 pound (USD 57,000) award: Elizabeth Strout's symphony of everyday lives "Oh William!" and Percival Everett's novel about racism and police violence, "The Trees." The other contenders include Zimbabwe's NoViolet Bulawayo for the animal fable "Glory;" Irish writer Claire Keegan's "Small Things Like These;" and "The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida" by Sri Lanka's Shehan Karunatilaka.
