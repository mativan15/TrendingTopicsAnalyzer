Manchester City believe that Jürgen Klopp unnecessarily and irresponsibly inflamed tensions before Sunday's match at Anfield because of the comments he made in his pre-match press conference.Liverpool's 1-0 win over City was overshadowed by chants about the Hillsborough disaster in the away end and Pep Guardiola being targeted by coin throwers during one flashpoint in the second half.The Times understands that City's team bus was also attacked on its way out of Anfield. Part of the windscreen was damaged after it was struck by objects thrown by Liverpool fans.
