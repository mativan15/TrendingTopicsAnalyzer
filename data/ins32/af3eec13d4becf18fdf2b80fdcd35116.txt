Procter & Gamble beat on earnings and revenue, but trimmed its full-year outlook. Here's the key level it has to hold now.

Procter & Gamble (PG) - Get Procter & Gamble Company (The) Report is trading roughly 2% higher on Wednesday after the consumer-products company's third-quarter earnings results.
