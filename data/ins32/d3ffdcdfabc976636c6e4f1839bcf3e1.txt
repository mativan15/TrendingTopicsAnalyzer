Abstract Aerial Art LAVA "Predicting rain doesn't count. Building arks does." - Warren Buffett I recently wrote a research article on Seagen (SGEN). That is to say, the company is entering into a partnership with LAVA Therapeutics (NASDAQ:LVTX) for the use of its Precision Gammabody platform. As I was analyzing the aforesaid development, my intuition tells me that there has to be substantial unlocked value/growth in LAVA for Seagen to be interested in the firm. After all, a highly reputable firm would not form a partnership with a smaller operator unless there are tremendous promises.
