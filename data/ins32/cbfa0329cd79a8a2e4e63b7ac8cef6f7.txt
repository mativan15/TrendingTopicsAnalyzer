Ovo Energy has launched an eleventh-hour bid to prevent rival Octopus Energy from swallowing the nationalised supplier Bulb.Sky News has learnt that Ovo - founded and run by Stephen Fitzpatrick - has written to Bulb's special administrator to inform it that it is renewing its interest in buying Bulb.
Industry sources said on Thursday that Ovo was confident that a takeover of Bulb would not, unlike the deal being discussed between Whitehall officials and Octopus, require additional taxpayer funding.
