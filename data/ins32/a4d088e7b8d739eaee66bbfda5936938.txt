During the Meta Connect 2022 live keynote last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed his new plans for Meta to bring avatars—uncanny digital stand-ins for human workers—to video chats.  They would be customized to match a person's exact skin tone, hair style, and outfit choices. According to Zuckerberg, an entirely virtual roundtable meeting would consist of you and your coworkers' avatars chatting in something like a 'third mode' between fully camera-on and camera-off.  'You can still express yourself and react, but you're not on-camera, so it's kind of like a better camera-off mode,' he said.
