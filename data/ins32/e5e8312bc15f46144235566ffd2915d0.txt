The time to pause the rise in interest rates is when the Federal Reserve gets its benchmark policy interest rates up to about 2.5%, said San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly on Wednesday. 'We need to get the rate up to neutral, which I put about 2.5% in nominal terms. We need to do that expeditiously,' Daly said, in an interview on CNBC. 'I need to see some real progress on inflation. Otherwise, I would think we just move the rate until we find ourselves at least at neutral and then we look around and see what else needs to be done.
