Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.55% climbed 2.6% in premarket trading Friday, after the social media company said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act with respect to the buyout agreement with Tesla Inc. TSLA, +4.68% Chief Executive Elon Musk has expired. The expiration of the 30-day waiting period was a condition of the closing of the deal. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock slumped 4.6% ahead of the open, as buyout of Twitter by Musk has been viewed by some investors as a distraction for Tesla's CEO, and could potentially lead to Musk selling some of his Tesla stock.
