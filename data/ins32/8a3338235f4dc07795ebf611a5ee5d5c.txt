Realty firm Unitech Ltd on Thursday announced the appointment of Uma Shankar as nominee director on the company's board. She has extensive working experience of 37 years with the Reserve Bank of India, according to a regulatory filing. Presently, Shankar is associated with EbixCash and IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd as independent director and with Karnataka Bank as an additional director. 
 A few years back, the Supreme Court had directed that the erstwhile board of directors of Unitech Ltd be superseded and the management be taken over by the new board of directors in terms of the proposal submitted by the Union government.
