'The Crown' isn't leaving everything controversial in the past.

The Emmy-winning Netflix series' fifth season, dropping next month, will depict the 1993 leaked audio in which then- Prince Charles told Camilla he wanted to 'live inside' her trousers but would probably be reincarnated as her tampon.

'I remember thinking it was something so sordid and deeply, deeply embarrassing [at the time],' Dominic West, who plays the now-newly minted King in the new season, told Entertainment Weekly in a new interview.
