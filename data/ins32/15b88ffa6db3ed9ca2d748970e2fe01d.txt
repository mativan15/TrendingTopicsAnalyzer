Lawrence Bishnoi (file photo)The Punjab and Haryana High Court Thursday dismissed a petition of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi who was seeking appropriate directions for not handing over his custody to the Punjab police in the singer Sidhu Moosewala murder case. Bishnoi, who is suspected to be involved in Moosewala's killing, had moved this high court Wednesday after withdrawing his plea from the Delhi High Court in which he said he feared he would be killed in a "fake encounter" by the Punjab police, and sought necessary safeguards.
