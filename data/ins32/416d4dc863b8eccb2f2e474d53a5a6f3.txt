MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — A man drowned Friday while scuba diving in Lake Minnetonka.
The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office says that water patrol, police and DNR crews responded around noon to a report of a missing diver in Maxwell Bay, on the north end of the lake near Orono. The man had been diving with a partner.
With the help of sonar equipment and the other diver, the crews found the missing man about 30 feet from where he was last seen. While paramedics attempted life-saving measures, the man was pronounced dead on the shore.
