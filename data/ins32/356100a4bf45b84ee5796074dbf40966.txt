Four juveniles have been detained in connection with a violent attack and robbery outside an MBTA station earlier this week.

Transit Police Supt. Richard Sullivan said two men, ages 69 and 47, were surrounded by a group of teenagers while they were at the bicycle rack that is just outside Shawmut Station.

The victims told Transit Police a group of teenage boys pulled out a knife and demanded money around noon Monday. When the 69-year-old and 47-year-old men said no, the boys punched them several times, leaving them bloodied, according to witnesses.
