After a stellar run in equities for much of 2020 and most of 2021, the stock market pendulum began to swing back in December 2021. The negative trend began with foreign investors withdrawing funds from Indian markets because of unprecedented inflation levels in the United States, which was then compounded by the unexpected war in Ukraine. Both events caused the Indian stock market to fall by 15 per cent from its high, causing widespread concern among investors.According to analysts, the volatility index of the market has been at levels not seen in a decade.
