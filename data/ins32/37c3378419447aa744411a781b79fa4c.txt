The number of pages seized at Donald Trump's estate was much smaller than previously estimated and a special master reviewing the documents encouraged lawyers for Trump and the government on Tuesday to narrow their disputes about them so the review can be completed by a Dec. 16 deadline.

U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie, the special master, said the number of pages of non-classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago he is reviewing is 21,792 – much less than the 200,000 pages estimated.

A vendor estimated the larger figure based on the length of typical business documents, according to Stephen Marzen, a Justice Department lawyer.
