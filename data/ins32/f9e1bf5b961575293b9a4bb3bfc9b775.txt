Gabrielle Blair has a message for men. And the women who love them. It's all right there in the title of her new book, "Ejaculate Responsibly: A Whole New Way to Think About Abortion" (Workman Publishing), out October 18.

To cut to the chase: They're called condoms, they're easy to buy and not expensive. Men, Blair is saying, it's time to man up.

If you are guessing Blair is a leading feminist thinker who perhaps is a professor at a small liberal arts college, you'd be impossibly wrong. She is a mom of six and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who has a flair for interior decor and lives in a small town in western France.
