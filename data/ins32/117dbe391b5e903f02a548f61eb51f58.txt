Dick and Dom have waded into the chaos seen in Westminster on Wednesday night and labeled Liz Truss' government ‘twisted f***s.'
The comedy double act are best known for presenting popular noughties children's show Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow, as well as Bananas in Pyjamas and Diddy TV.
But their OG audience are now grown up, and the pair – real names Dick McCourt and Dominic Wood – aren't holding back.
The CBBC favourites took to Twitter on Wednesday as the House of Commons descended into carnage, with the Home Secretary quitting, claims of bullying and manhandling, and news anchors dropping the C-bomb.
