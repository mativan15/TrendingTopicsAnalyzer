My mother died in 2017 and, in her will, left everything to be divided equally between her four children. Her estate consisted of the family house, valued at €170,000 at the time of her death and a small amount of cash which covered her funeral expenses. There was also an outstanding mortgage of €50,000 on the house.At the time, it was agreed with my siblings that I buy the house and pay each of them their share after expenses (around €25,000).For various reasons, and mainly due to Covid, we never applied for probate or followed through with the transfer.
