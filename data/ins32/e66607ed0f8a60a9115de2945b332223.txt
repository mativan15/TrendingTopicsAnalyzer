DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Schalke and Hertha Berlin have more in common than they'd like to admit.Their club colors are blue and white, they see themselves as traditional powers of German soccer — and they've won only one league game each this season. At both clubs, lofty dreams of Champions League glory lie in ruins.When they meet in the Bundesliga on Sunday, 17th-place Schalke and 15th-place Hertha will be looking for a win to kick-start their seasons and get as far away from the relegation zone as they can.
