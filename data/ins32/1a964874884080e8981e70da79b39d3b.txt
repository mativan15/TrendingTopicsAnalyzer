A New York Times/Siena College poll out Monday has attracted media attention for affirming the argument that the economy trumps abortion when it comes to voters' priorities. Conservative journalists said the poll debunked Democrats' messaging that this November would be "Roevember," referring to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June.Some liberal journalists, however, expressed skepticism about the poll results. Both sides took to Twitter to give their takes. Inflation has skyrocketed since President Biden took office.
