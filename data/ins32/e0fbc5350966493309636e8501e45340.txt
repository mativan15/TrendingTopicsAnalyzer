Casemiro has hailed Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag as a 'great manager' and compared the Dutchman to former bosses Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti.

The Brazil international arrived at Old Trafford in August following a £60million move from Real Madrid.

The 30-year-old was handed his first Premier League start last weekend as the Red Devils picked up a 2-1 victory over Everton. Casemiro produced a man-of-the-match performance and even set up Cristiano Ronaldo for the match winning goal.
