Marking the start of commercial operations, a Dornier 228 aircraft operated by Alliance Air landed at Tezu airport in Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday, officials said. The 17-seater aircraft, manufactured by Limited (), took around 20 minutes to reach Tezu from Dibrugarh in Assam, they said. The cost of the ticket is Rs 1,600. "We extend our deep gratitude to the government for bringing Tezu on the aviation map of the country, which will benefit the people immensely during medical emergencies, besides promoting tourism," said Ojimso Tayeng, who along with his wife, were the only passengers on the maiden flight.
