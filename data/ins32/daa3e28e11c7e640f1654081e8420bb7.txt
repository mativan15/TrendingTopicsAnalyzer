Shares of United Airlines (UAL) are soaring this afternoon, last seen 7.5% higher to trade at $40.06 following the company's third-quarter financial results. Specifically, United Airlines yesterday reported earnings of $2.81 per share on revenue of $12.88 billion, both of which beat Wall Street's estimates, and hiked its fourth-quarter forecast on 'strong COVID recovery trends.' What's more, the event reignited interest in UAL options, and premium is flying off the shelf after the session's halfway point.
