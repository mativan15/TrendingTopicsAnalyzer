Uganda has ordered two areas of the country into lockdown amid a terrifying outbreak of deadly ebola.
Houses of worship and entertainment venues have been shuttered in the east African nation's Kassanda district about 20 miles from the capital of Kampala, as well as in the neighboring district of Mubende.
Curfews were imposed in both districts, too, as were limitations on travel in and out of the region.
'These are temporary measures to control the spread of ebola,' Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said in a televised address as he announced the moves Saturday.
