May 27—Tyrese Hunter went from potential Gonzaga point guard to future Gonzaga opponent on Friday afternoon.

The Iowa State transfer who'd been considering a move to Mark Few's program instead committed to Texas, choosing the Longhorns over Gonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Purdue and Tennessee.

Hunter, the reigning Big 12 Freshman of the Year, could have bolstered a relatively inexperienced, albeit talented, Gonzaga backcourt in 2022-23. Instead, the Bulldogs will have to plan for the sophomore-to-be ahead of GU's Nov.
