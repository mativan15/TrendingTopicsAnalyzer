Oct. 19—Santa Fe police and the FBI are searching for a man accused of stealing an undisclosed sum of money Tuesday from the First National 1870 bank on Cordova Road.

Law enforcement have not yet identified a suspect but called the bank robber the "Skinny Swoosh Bandit" in an FBI news release issued Tuesday evening. The statement described the robber as a skinny man with short, black hair and facial hair who stands about 5-foot-2.

He was wearing a long-sleeve black shirt with a Nike swoosh symbol on the left chest, dark pants and tennis shoes, the statement said.
