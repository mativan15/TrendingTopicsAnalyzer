Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It's Friday, Oct. 21. I'm Corinne Purtill, a science and medicine reporter at The Times.

Earlier this year, my husband and I decided to take our two children to Yellowstone National Park, a place none of us had seen.

It was snowing in Yellowstone during the week we booked our tickets, more than typical for the season. By the time we got the kids new hiking shoes a few months later, it was warm at the park, unusually so, and the streams and rivers swelled with clean, cold melted snow.
