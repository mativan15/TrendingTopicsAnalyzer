ANALYSIS: Auckland's new mayor Wayne Brown wants the council and its water company to halt work on the government's Three Waters reforms. But can he do that? In a word, no. But that's not to say that this and other public calls, issued in his regular end-of-day media releases, don't have a purpose. Brown was elected on a platform of change and 'fixing' an Auckland Council which he said was broken. His winning share of the vote was significant at 45% though slightly less than his predecessors enjoyed.
