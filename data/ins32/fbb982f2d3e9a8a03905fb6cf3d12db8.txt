In a single span of conversation, Madhu Chitkara will leave you impressed and inspired. The lady behind the Chitkara brand of institutions is an institution in herself. If her illustrious husband Dr Ashok Chitkara is the super brain behind the Chitkara name, Madhu is the heart, a force of nature – unstoppable, relentless and enviably patient. Niyati Chitkara, her daughter in law, on the other hand, is a bright spark charting her own course, transforming the school ecosystem innovatively. Together, they have done groundbreaking work, raised the bar of education through their institutes and strengthened the Chitkara name.
