As Optimus Prime would say, "You picked the wrong planet!"
 
New robots are invading Earth in the seventh installment of the Transformers franchise — and fans will see the fight go down on June 9, 2023, when Transformers: Rise of the Beasts hits theaters.
 
The film will incorporate themes and characters from the 1996 TV series Beast Wars: Transformers, which made the movie's lead, Anthony Ramos, all the more excited.
 
"Beast Wars was my joint, that was the one for me. I was [in front of the TV] every week watching Beast Wars," Ramos said during a virtual press conference.
