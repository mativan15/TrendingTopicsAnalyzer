Consolidated other income increased 4% to ₹4,476 crore, led by a 20% growth in fee income, especially retail fees.Mumbai: Axis Bank's consolidated net profit in the second quarter climbed 66%, driven by growth in both interest and non-interest incomes, even as provisions dropped in response to improving asset quality at the country's fourth most valued private lender. Consolidated net profit increased to ₹5,625 crore in the quarter ended September, from ₹3,383 crore a year earlier. CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said strong profitability, adequate capital and good prospects for growth mean the bank is in no hurry to raise money to fund its acquisition of Citibank's retail business announced earlier this year.
