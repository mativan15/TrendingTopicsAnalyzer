Ashley Darby is opening up about co-parenting with her ex-husband Michael Darby following their split in April.
 
At BravoCon 2022 on Saturday, the Real Housewives of Potomac star, 34, told PEOPLE that Michael is a "very hands-on" father to their sons Dean, 3, and Dylan, 13 months.
 
"Michael is a great dad. A-1, such a wonderful dad," she said.
 
The reality star shared that Michael, 63, was spending time with their children while she was at the fan convention.
 
"He's with my kids right now, and he's at the Caps game, sitting at a hockey game with two toddlers, bless his heart," she said.
