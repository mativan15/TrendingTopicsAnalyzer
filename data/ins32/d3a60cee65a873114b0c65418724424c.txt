Max Rose, the former Democratic congressman who's running against Rep. Nicole Malliotakis to reclaim his former seat in New York's 11th Congressional District, has accused his rival of violating ethics rules for using her government podium at a campaign event.

A supporter of Rose plans to file a formal complaint with the House Committee on Ethics by Monday morning, according to sources close to Rose's campaign.

That complaint is expected to be based, in part, on a photo posted on the Bay Ridge Democrats' Twitter feed that shows Malliotakis campaign staffers affixing a campaign poster to her official House of Representatives podium.
