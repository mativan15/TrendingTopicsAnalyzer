The Golden State Warriors received their 2022 championship rings. They also defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 123-109, and the Boston Celtics topped the Philadelphia 76ers 126-117 as the NBA opened its 2022-23 season.

And TNT's Charles Barkley was in midseason form when addressing Lakers guard Russell Westbrook's role with the Lakers. 'I admire him. I respect him,' Barkley said. 'It's time for the Lakers to move him. They are taking all his joy out of life and basketball … and it pisses me off.'

There rest of the league's teams open the season Wednesday and Thursday, including the much anticipated return of New Orleans forward Zion Williamson, who missed all of last season with a foot injury.
