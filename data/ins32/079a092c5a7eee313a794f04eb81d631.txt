The Boulder-based startup Stylo raised $3 million in seed funding to push out its software that automates customer-support functions.

Matchstick Ventures, a venture capital firm dually located in Boulder and Minneapolis, led the round. Former Techstars leaders Natty Zola and Ryan Broshar run Matchstick and focus their investments on pre-seed and seed-stage tech startups based in the northern United States and the Rocky Mountain region. Also participating in the round, which was oversubscribed, were Vitalize, Converge and Caffeinated Capital.
