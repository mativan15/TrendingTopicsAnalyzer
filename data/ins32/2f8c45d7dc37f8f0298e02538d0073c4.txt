Valve has released a new Steam Deck Beta update that allows users to skip the device's opening movie and get straight to playing games.Detailed in a blog post on Steam, the update is only available if Steam Deck users have opted into its Beta and Preview channels, meaning the features are still being tested but will likely be made widely available soon.For those taking part, however, pressing the B button during the opening movie will now skip straight to the Steam Deck's main menu, shaving vital seconds from the boot time (or 90 minutes for the user who set Shrek to play as their opening movie, below).
