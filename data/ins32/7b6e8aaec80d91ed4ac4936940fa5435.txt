Sean Roberts speaks during his KXnO radio show "The Drive with Heather Burnside and Sean Roberts" on Oct. 4.

Moments before the start of the Oct. 3 radio show 'The Drive with Heather Burnside and Sean Roberts," Keith Murphy walks to the door in the third-floor studio in the iHeart building. Murphy, who co-hosts the show that airs before this one, looks back at Roberts and Burnside before leaving for the day.

'Have a good show,' Murphy says.

Roberts has his computer turned on and has leaned to the front of his chair so he speak clearly into the temporarily turned-off microphone when when he hears Murphy's last-second words before the show starts.
