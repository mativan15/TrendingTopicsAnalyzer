A group of Democratic Senators is sounding an alarm that anti-abortion prosecutors and vigilantes may use personal information tracked by smartphone apps to target women seeking to end their pregnancy.The four Senate Democrats, along with Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, sent letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google outlining their concerns and asking them to halt certain data collection practices. The letters show how digital privacy concerns are intersecting with concerns from abortion-rights advocates that have become increasingly urgent amid declining legal protections for the procedure.
