Adding subscribers has been Netflix's bread and butter for measuring the streamer's success for as long as it's been around. But as the company continues to grow, Netflix's leadership indicated on Tuesday it's no longer the only metric they want Wall Street and the industry at large to evaluate them on moving forward.

After seeing some positive subscriber growth in Q3 and forecasting an even greater result for Q4 2022, Netflix announced in its letter to shareholders Tuesday that it would no longer provide guidance on the streamer's paid membership in future quarters.
