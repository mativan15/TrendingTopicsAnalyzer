RESIDENT Evil 4 is making a comeback with a full from the ground up remake being released 18 years after the original.
In this time, console generations have come and gone, and things we take for granted now simply didn't exist when the original released.

A lot has changed in 18 years, from the area layout to the item placement, and even the control and pace of the game.
