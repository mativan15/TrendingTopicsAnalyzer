Kuwait is an oil-rich emirate, tucked up in the north-western corner of the Gulf. Its immediate neighbors are Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. One factor that distinguishes it from other Gulf states is that Yasser Arafat founded Fatah there in 1959 and it became home to a large Palestinian diaspora. Before the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 1991, some 400,000 Palestinians lived in Kuwait, amounting to 20% of its total population. Subsequent deportation and emigration have reduced that figure to 70,000, at most.
