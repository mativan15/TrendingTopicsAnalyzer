(CNN) — Another week, another spate of terrible behavior from tourists in Italy.

Hot on the heels of a woman posing naked on the steps of the cathedral in Amalfi, two tourists to Venice have been apprehended for allegedly stealing a gondola.

The pair, said to be French nationals, are accused of stealing the gondola from the Accademia station, beside the famous bridge of the same name, to go for a spin along the Grand Canal around 1.30 a.m. on Thursday.

The gondola's owner, Giorgio Bognolo, said the contents of the boat -- a cover, cushions, decorations and other items worth several hundred dollars -- were thrown into the canal, before it was paddled away like a canoe.
