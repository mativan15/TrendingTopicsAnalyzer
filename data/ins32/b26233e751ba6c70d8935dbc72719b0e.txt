The surplus that the Reserve Bank of India transferred to the government in the last fiscal year fell sharply mainly due to a jump in expenditure, which was led by interest payments to banks on their excess funds parked with it, the bank's annual report showed. While income for 2021-22 increased by 20%, expenditure rose by 280%, which resulted in the overall surplus transferred to the government decreasing 69% to ₹30,307.45 crore from ₹99,122 crore in 2020-21. Apart from the higher operational expenditure, the RBI also had to pay interest on the excess funds kept by banks with it through the reverse repo window.
