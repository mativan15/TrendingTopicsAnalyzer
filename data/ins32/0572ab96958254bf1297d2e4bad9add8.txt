Traveling with strangers can be hard, but traveling with strangers and a murderous alien parasite proves considerably worse in 'The Passenger.' This sharply executed, good-humored horror opus represents a promising first dual directorial effort for Fernando Gonzalez Gomez and Raul Cerezo, each of whom has a number of shorts under his belt. ('Viejos,' aka 'The Elderly,' another horror already in post). Dark Star and Bloody Disgusting are releasing to limited U.S. theaters on June 3, with VOD and DVD release June 28.
