Troubled actor Ezra Miller appeared virtually in court on Monday as part of their felony burglary case in Vermont. The 30-year-old pleaded not guilty to stealing liquor bottles from a neighbor's home this past May. Despite facing a maximum sentence of 26 years in prison and over $2,000 in fines if found guilty, Miller appeared in "a jovial and chipper mood" according to Deadline.

Miller, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, sat next to their attorney Lisa Shelkrot during arraignment on the two charges.
