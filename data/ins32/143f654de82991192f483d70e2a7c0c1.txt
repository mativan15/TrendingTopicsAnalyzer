Netflix's June 2022 is filled with starpower, and it is perhaps led by Adam Sandler's Hustle and Chris Hemsworth's Spiderhead. In Hustle, Sandler plays a struggling basketball scout who is trying to bring a foreign star to the states and the NBA without his team's approval. In Spiderhead, two inmates form a connection in a state-of-the-art prison that is run by a "brilliant visionary who experiments on his subjects with mind-altering drugs."

June will also see the return of The Umbrella Academy, as its third season will premiere on June 22.
