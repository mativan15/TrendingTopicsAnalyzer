Garoppolo was up and down through his first three starts, but Sunday he looked better than he has in a long time. He was moving around in the pocket, extending plays, and hitting his checkdowns to create yards on plays that might've gone for losses. He was also a couple drops away from connecting on some deep throws we don't typically see him hit. The two interceptions on his ledger aren't ideal. His second of the two was a typically bad one where he tried forcing one in to Samuel as a cornerback closed and got a hand on the ball to deflect it to another defensive back.
