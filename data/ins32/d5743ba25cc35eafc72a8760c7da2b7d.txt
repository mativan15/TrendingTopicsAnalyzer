Dzmitry Skazau/iStock via Getty Images Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) on Wednesday said a phase 3 trial showed that its cancer drug Opdivo reduced the risk of death by 58% as an adjuvant therapy in patients with completely resected stage two melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. The trial, called CheckMate -76K, met its main goal of recurrence-free survival, BMY said in a statement. Opdivo reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 58% versus placebo in patients who had their stage IIB or IIC melanoma completely resected, which means removed in a medical operation.
