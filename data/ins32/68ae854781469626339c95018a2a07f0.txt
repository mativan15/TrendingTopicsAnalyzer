CNN —

Former President Donald Trump is claiming that records, such as clemency requests, that were kept at Mar-a-Lago are his personal property and shouldn't be handed back to the federal government, the Justice Department said in a court filing late Thursday.

The filing only addresses a dispute over 15 documents but it demonstrates the potential legal slog ahead given there are roughly 22,000 total to review.

Special master Raymond Dearie is reviewing Trump's claims of executive privilege over the documents, which were seized from the former President's Florida home in August.
