Kari Lake, the Trump-endorsed Republican candidate for governor of Arizona, was questioned about her debunked claim that the 2020 election was stolen. On CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, host Dana Bash pushed back as Lake insisted that there is "plenty of evidence" that the election was stolen."You called the 2020 election corrupt, stolen, rotten and rigged. And there was no evidence of any of that presented in a court of law or anywhere else that any of those things are true. So, why do you keep saying that?" Bush asked.
