Chief Minister Eknath Shinde-led government's decision to allow free travel to individuals in the age group of 75 years and above in all buses operated by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation has received overwhelming response. The special concession to 75 years plus was announced by Chief Minister Shinde in the monsoon session of the state legislative assembly.
While the government has made travel for 75 years and above absolutely free, it has extended 50 per cent concessions on tickets for the citizens in the age bracket of 65 to 75 years.
