Former Wasps and Highlanders flanker James Haskell has accused rugby authorities of 'faffing around for too long' as the English game plunges into a financial crisis. Famous club Wasps has joined Worcester in administration and made major redundancies that include New Zealanders John Mitchell and Brad Shields. English international Haskell, who played over 200 matches for Wasps in two stints and took his game to France, Japan and New Zealand where he played Super Rugby with the Highlanders, said it was 'a very dark day for rugby across the whole game'.
