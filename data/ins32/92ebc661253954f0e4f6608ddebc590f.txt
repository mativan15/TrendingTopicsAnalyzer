Two of Ontario's four major political parties are calling for an end to for-profit care inside the province's child-welfare system in the wake of a joint investigation from Global News and APTN.
NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said her party is pledging to remove profit-motivated group homes and foster care operators.'It's a commitment that we make right now to get rid of the profits in the child-welfare system,' she said in an interview Monday.'The (investigation's) findings are tragic, but they unveil a system that's been broken for a long time.
