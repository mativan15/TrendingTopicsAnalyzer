Albertans have a clearer idea of who will run what government departments under Danielle Smith after the new premier revealed her cabinet on Friday. Several key ministers under the former premier Jason Kenney will keep their jobs, including Tyler Shandro as Minister of Justice, Jason Copping as Minister of Health and Adriana LaGrange as Minister of Education. As well, Demetrios Nicolaides will stay on as Minister of Advanced Education and Rick Wilson as Minister of Indigenous Relations. However, Jason Nixon lost his positions as finance minister and government house leader.
