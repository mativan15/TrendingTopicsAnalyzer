Coal prices are at record highs and royalties payments to state coffers are forecast to grow by billions, but some coal communities say not enough is filtering down to their towns.It comes as the election of a Labor government and Greens to seats in south-east Queensland leaves some in regional parts of the state feeling apprehensive about their mining and agriculture communities. Coal exports have hit a record $110 billion this financial year, with prices in Australia soaring to more than $400 per tonne for thermal coal.
