A class of 2023 defensive back out of Pennsauken High School (Pennsauken, N.J.), the offer from Rutgers is the first from a Power Five program. Earlier this month, Wynn was offered by UConn.
Wynn plays as a defensive back and as a wide receiver for Pennsauken. He is averaging 27 receiving yards through seven games and 20 tackles along with two interceptions, three passes defended and three fumble recoveries.
