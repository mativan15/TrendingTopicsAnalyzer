Aptos Labs blockchain launched its mainnet on Monday, becoming the first of the Facebook spin-off networks to premiere and putting to the test its multibillion-dollar valuation.

Aptos is the brainchild of several ex-Meta employees who pioneered the company's failed diem stablecoin. The Aptos blockchain's code is written with Move, the Rust-based programming language also to be used by Mysten Labs' Sui blockchain, another upcoming network.

While Aptos Labs has declared its network "live," its ecosystem is far from completed, with dozens of teams yet to launch the wallets, trading venues and non-fungible token tech essential to decentralized finance (DeFi).
