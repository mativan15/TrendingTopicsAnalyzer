Only rarely have I exited an exhibition having learnt as much as I learnt from Hieroglyphs at the British Museum. It's the perfect show — deep, fascinating, full of beautiful things, full of beautiful ideas. While so many exhibitions get bogged down in narcissistic identity issues and evening-class politics, this one is driven by that utterly commendable old-fashioned aim: the pursuit of knowledge. Bravo, British Museum.What is it about hieroglyphs? Why the pull? Why the romance? In a smart piece of exhibition stagecraft, the BM begins its investigation with a gripping object that pressed my art button and my knowledge button, and did it so violently I kept returning for another dose: the temple lintel of King Amenemhat 111.
