aluxum/E+ via Getty Images Cantor Fitzgerald was quick to defend PTC Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PTCT) after the rare disease-focused biotech announced Tuesday a pause in enrollment in its Phase 2 PIVOT-HD trial for Huntington's disease candidate PTC518 in the U.S. The enrollment in the global trial designed to test up to three dose levels of PTC518 came to a halt as the FDA requested additional clinical data before moving to higher doses, Cantor analyst Kristen Kluska pointed out. Citing a discussion with the management, Kluska highlighted the company's view that the event was not a clinical hold, and PTCT expects to resume enrollment following initial data from the patients who are part of the ex-U.
