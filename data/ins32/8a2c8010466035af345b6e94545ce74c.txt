In a joint operation, the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UP-STF) and Gautam Budh Nagar police on Sunday arrested two Chinese nationals for allegedly duping hundreds of Indians on the pretext of liking videos in exchange of money. The alleged fraudsters used to send video links to their victims, asking them to like the video and promising ₹40 for each like. Under the scheme, the miscreants asked the victims to deposit more money in different bank accounts to become a ‘gold member' of the scheme.
