New York CNN —

The United States has charged seven Chinese nationals over an alleged long-running plot to intimidate a US resident into returning to China to face criminal charges.

The case is related to the ruling Chinese Communist Party's Operation Fox Hunt, an international anti-corruption campaign targeting Chinese fugitives. The Chinese government launched Operation Fox Hunt in 2014 to target wealthy citizens accused of corruption, who had fled the country with large amounts of money.

The US Department of Justice said the Chinese government had taken such law enforcement actions on US soil 'in a unilateral manner without approval of, or coordination with, the US government.
