For the first time all six Republican candidates for governor gathered for a candidate forum on Thursday night. While the candidates articulated policy ideas, the forum featured several episodes of personal attacks.

The forum was hosted by ABC 7 in Chicago and the League of Women Voters of Illinois.

During the debate, state Sen. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, turned to Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin.

"I want to let you know something. I'm not interested in defeating you just because you're a Democrat," said Bailey.
