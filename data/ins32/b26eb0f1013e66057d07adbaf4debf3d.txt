Furious Star Trek fans are boldly going nowhere – after their eagerly awaited annual convention was suddenly destroyed. Thousands of Trekkies, some from abroad, planned to beam down to London to meet stars including William Shatner, 91, who played the USS Enterprise's Captain Kirk. Back to the Future actor Christopher Lloyd, 83, a Klingon commander in Star Trek III, was also due to be at the Destination Star Trek event. Star Trek: Voyager actors Jeri Ryan and Ethan Phillips and British actress Marina Sirtis, who appeared in TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation, were also lined up for the three-day convention at London's ExCel centre from September 30.
