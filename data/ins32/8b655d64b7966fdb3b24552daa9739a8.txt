Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh on Friday lashed out at the BJP for another Kashmiri Pandit exodus and said the BJP-led government is wasting time playing politics instead of actually working on the ground. "Today, horrible incidents are being reported from various parts of Kashmir, causing a deep sense of anguish to take over the entire country. The Kashmiri Pandit community is fleeing the valley in droves. They have been compelled to feel alien and foreign in their own land by divisive and violent forces," Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP, said at a press conference here.
