States like Montana, Idaho and Utah have been growing at a faster rate than much of the rest of the country, which political and business leaders in Montana attributed to both the lifestyle, business environment and politics of the state.  "As people are looking for places to live, they're looking for a quality of life, but also quality leadership from government officials," Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., told Fox Business. "They see that in Montana." "When you see the increasingly heavy hand of big government in coastal states like California, New York, Washington, the American people are yearning for freedom, they're yearning for a quality of life as well as quality of leadership," he added.
