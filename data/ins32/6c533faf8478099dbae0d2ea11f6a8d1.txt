Weeks after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in police custody for wearing the hijab too loosely, massive protests have continued to rage on the streets of all major Iranian cities. The chant ‘Women, life, liberty' has been ringing everywhere as demonstrators take to the streets with some removing their veils or cutting their hair in an act of civil disobedience against the government's strict policies towards women.
The images of the protests offer a striking resemblance to a similar uprising that took place on the streets of Iran in 1979 during the Islamic revolution.
