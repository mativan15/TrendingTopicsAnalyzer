Dabo Swinney and his undefeated Tigers have a big matchup this week as the only other undefeated team in the ACC, Syracuse, takes a trip to Death Valley Saturday for a battle between unbeaten teams.
Things are shaping up for this one to be an exciting one at home for No.5 Clemson, with No.14 Syracuse starting quarterback Garrett Shrader making things a little more interesting. Shrader recently joined the Gramlich and Mac Lain podcast this week to discuss his team's matchup with the Tigers, with Shrader showing a ton of confidence in the Orange.
