Later today, Crocodile Dundee II will air on Channel 4 at 6:25pm. And, while the romantic comedy made waves when it hit cinema screens back in 1986, it made an irreversible impact on the lives of the movie's stars. The 55-year-old actor behind Crocodile Dundee, Paul Hogan, was married during filming, but he was left smitten by his co-star, Linda Kozlowski. The young American actress played his love interest, Sue Charlton, and - eventually - things got a passionate between them.Reports began to hit Australian news outlets that Hogan and Kozlowski had struck up a romance behind the scenes of the movie set.
