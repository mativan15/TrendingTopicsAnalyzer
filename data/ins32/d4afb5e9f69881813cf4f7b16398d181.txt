Most of us could recognise Becky Hill's voice a mile off, as the pop star has made a name for herself as a chart-topper with hits like Remember, History, and My Heart Goes.
But, do you remember where she came from? As Becky actually started out as a contestant on a well-known singing show.
Yes, the pop queen garnered a legion of fans after she appeared on ITV's The Voice in 2012, during the show's first UK series.
Now 28-years-old, the then-teenager impressed the judges with her powerful first audition in which she covered John Legend's Ordinary People.
