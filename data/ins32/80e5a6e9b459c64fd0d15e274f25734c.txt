Whether you cut a pie into 10 pieces or 100 pieces, it shouldn't affect how much the pie is worth. But in the stock market, a stock split — which is essentially cutting shares into smaller pieces — can have some meaningful consequences.

According to Bank of America, S&P 500 companies that announced stock splits since 1980 have returned an average of 25.4% over the following 12 months, versus the S&P 500's average return of 9% over the same period.

In fact, the bank says that after a split is announced, these stocks have also outperformed the benchmark index in the three- and six-month periods as well.
