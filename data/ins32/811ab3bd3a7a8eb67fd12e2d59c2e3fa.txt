zimmytws/iStock via Getty Images After successfully entering Tampa and Orlando in 2021, Century Communities, Inc. (NYSE:CCS) is launching new expansions in Alabama in 2022. In my view, if Century Communities invests enough in digital marketing, and we see more demand for move-in-ready homes, CCS will most likely experience sales growth. I also believe that the total amount of debt is not small, so careful management of debt will be necessary. In any case, I believe that Century's stock price in the market is cheap considering potential future free cash flow growth.
