County star Carrie Underwood opened up about what disappointed her the most when she would attend her favorite singers' concerts as a child."I love to sing, and I've always taken pride in the work I've put in on my vocals. I do want to sound good," she told Rolling Stone. "Growing up and going to concerts or seeing my favorite artists on TV, if they didn't sound like they were supposed to sound, it was always so deflating."Underwood continued, "I'd lose respect for them. Or when I'd go to a concert and hear them drop keys, I was like, 'You can't hit the notes! Why'd you record them if you can't sing them?' That stuff is important to me.
