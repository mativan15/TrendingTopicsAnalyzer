Goaltender Stuart Skinner gets his first start of the season Tuesday night when the Edmonton Oilers host the Buffalo Sabres (630 CHED, Faceoff Show 5:30 p.m., game at 7 p.m.).
'I feel great. I'm really excited and just grateful I get another opportunity to play a game in the NHL,' said Skinner, who relieved Jack Campbell in Saturday's 4-3 loss to the Calgary Flames. He stopped all 31 shots he faced.'I thought there was a maturity and a mental toughness to Stuart,' said head coach Jay Woodcroft.Skinner, 23, appeared in 13 NHL games last season, spending time on the Oilers roster while Mike Smith was injured.
