No. 9 Texas baseball is one game away from the Super Regionals after a hard-fought victory over Louisiana Tech. The 5-2 win marks the eighth straight regional win for David Pierce and Texas.

Lousiana Tech starting pitcher Ryan Jennings kept the Texas bats off balance all game. The hard-throwing righty spread out three hits across six innings of work. Dylan Campbell's solo home run in the second inning is all Texas could muster against Jennings.

Texas' bats woke up in a big way in the seventh inning.
