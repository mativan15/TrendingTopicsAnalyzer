On June 24, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years in a decision that will transform American life, reshape the nation's politics and lead to all but total bans on the procedure in about half of the states.

The decision in the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, did not outlaw abortion in the United States, but it did end the constitutional right to the procedure, meaning that it is now up to individual states to determine its legality.
