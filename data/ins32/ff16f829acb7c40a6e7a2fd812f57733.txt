The streaming giant Netflix said Tuesday that it picked up 2.4 million subscribers this summer, making up for losses during the first half of the year.

In its third-quarter financial results, Netflix said it came back from a loss of around a million subscribers in the first half of 2022 with a surge from July-September for a new total of 223 million subscribers.

'After a challenging first half, we believe we're on a path to reaccelerate growth,' the company reported in a letter to shareholders Tuesday, noting that the key to growth moving forward is 'pleasing members' with Netflix series and movies so that they spread word of the service to their friends and stay subscribed.
