Kyle and Jackie O's fiery exit from their radio show this morning marked a dramatic new development in the pair's relationship with their network.

Kyle Sandilands' past blow-ups have occasionally seen him abandon the pair's top-rated show mid-episode – but usually, Jackie O's stuck around to smooth things over with listeners. This time, the cool-headed radio veteran followed her co-host off-air, both of them fuming over what they considered to be heavy-handed censorship of their show.

It comes amid a drama-filled year for the radio titans, starting with a furious walkout from Kyle back in February and culminating in a recent headline-making on-air spray against their own radio station in which Kyle insisted he was 'sick and tired' of working at KIIS FM.
