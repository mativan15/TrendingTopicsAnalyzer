CONAKRY (Reuters) - At least five people were injured after security forces fired at anti-government protesters in Guinea's capital Conakry on Thursday, an opposition coalition said.

Demonstrators pushing for a junta that took power in a September 2021 coup to restore civilian rule set up road blocks across the city and burnt tyres.

They clashed with security forces, who responded with tear gas and live bullets.

"Five suffered gunshot wounds. One is in critical condition," the National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC) said in a statement.
