Once among the most visible faces of the Manmohan Singh Government, Kapil Sibal transformed into a trenchant critic of the Congress leadership under the Gandhis before quietly bowing out. In his first interview after becoming a newly elected independent member of the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Sibal speaks about his new role, plans to bring Opposition parties together but stayed away from discussing Congress.
