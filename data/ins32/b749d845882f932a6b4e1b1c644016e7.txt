Netflix has stopped losing customers, after struggling to hold on to them in the face of competition and pressures from the rising cost of living.

The streaming giant said it added 2.4 million households to its subscriber base over the July to September period.

That reversed the losses it suffered in the first half of the year after raising its prices in key markets.

Hits such as 'Stranger Things' and 'Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story' helped draw viewers back to the site.
