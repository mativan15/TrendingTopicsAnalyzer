Share prices of sports-centric streaming service fuboTV (FUBO -5.22%) are down more than 90% from their all-time high and down more than 70% year to date. A big reason for the drop is that the company is burning tons of cash and racking up a net loss of $485 million over the past 12 months. That's a pretty astounding loss for a small-cap stock with a market capitalization hovering around $710 million.

Investors knew it would be a tough business model to succeed with, but some hoped fuboTV would turn the corner on profitability by monetizing its large user base in more lucrative ways.
