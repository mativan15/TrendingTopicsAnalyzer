The clock on my father's car dashboard was always 10 minutes fast: we were dropped off at parties 10 minutes early and collected before the cake was cut (I had to try very hard not to do the same thing with my children). I think he picked up this trait during his time doing National Service and not much else apart from some very funny stories. I have no such excuse; my timekeeping is largely anxiety based.I've recently bought a wristwatch — nothing too fancy, just swapping out my little bits of tanking crypto for something more analogue.
