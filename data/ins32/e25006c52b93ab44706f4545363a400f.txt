Here is a terribly meagre experience from writer-director Rodrigo García, a silly, pointless movie which never delivers on its promises of drama and comedy and contains not a single funny or believable moment. As a filmic meal, it is pretty much entirely without nutritional or calorific value.Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke play Raymond and Ray, half-brothers who had lost touch with each other. One is in a boring office job, the other is a construction worker who has abandoned his talent as a jazz musician – both are losers.
