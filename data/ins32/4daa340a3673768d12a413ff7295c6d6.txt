By Alice Uribe SYDNEY--AMA Group Ltd.'s shares fell after some analysts cut their price targets for the stock amid tough conditions for the Australian collision repair specialist. The company's shares were 8.3% lower at 19 Australian cents (14 U.S. cents) in early afternoon trade Wednesday, after earlier hitting a high of 21.5 Australian cents. AMA Group held its investor day Tuesday, outlining that its sites wouldn't be operating at capacity until fiscal 2024, when parts and labor inflation were also forecast to stabilize.
