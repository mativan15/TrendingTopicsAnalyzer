A new research report out today from Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital found that Ethereum NFT creators have been paid a total of $1.8 billion in royalties from secondary sales on marketplaces like OpenSea.

In the report, Galaxy Digital researchers Sal Qadir and Gabe Parker also found that NFT creators' royalty rates on OpenSea—the top overall marketplace by trading volume—have doubled over the past year on average, jumping from a 3% cut of sales to 6%.

The researchers also discovered a concentration of royalties among just 10 entities, data that suggests the NFT economy may be more centralized than some might have thought.
