THE HAGUE, The Netherlands, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Increasingly, criminal hackers are not just trying to get into someone's computer, but also into the minds of the user. By playing on someone's emotions, they might try to get them to part with their money. However, state actors also try to manipulate public opinion via cyber attacks, warned several speakers on Tuesday and Wednesday during the ONE Conference in The Hague, Europe's prime cybersecurity event.
The solution is to make users more resilient.
