NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A well-known Baptist minister in New Orleans and Baton Rouge for more than 30 years has admitted defrauding his church, its housing ministries, his congregations and a charter school of almost $900,000.

At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey, the Rev. Charles Southall III, 64, pleaded guilty Tuesday to money laundering.

Prosecutors said Southall, who led First Emanuel Baptist Church in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, solicited and then stole tithes and donations from church members.
