You're the youngest of five kids. What was money like growing up in Smithton, population just over 3000? There wasn't a great deal of it. I made money in the pub car park on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Back in the day, people used to drink-drive without a problem. So when they stumbled out, they'd pull their car keys out and all their spare change. I used to earn a lot of money. There's something dark about that. But it's also deeply industrious and I respect it. I'm a hustler in my own way.You started doing stand-up around the same period you were homeless.
