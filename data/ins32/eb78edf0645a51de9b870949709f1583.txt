Westside Atlanta is in the midst of a growth boom, accelerated by forces such as plans by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT) to build a 90-acre campus that could have enough space for more than 15,000 workers.

As jobs and investment pour into once-overlooked Westside neighborhoods, it will be crucial to replenish the stock of both market-rate and affordable housing, said Atlanta City Councilmember Byron Amos.

"Housing in this city — and I would push to say the country — is becoming a crisis," said Amos, who represents Knight Park/Howell Station, Bankhead, Vine City and other Westside neighborhoods.
