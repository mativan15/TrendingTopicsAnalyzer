It is not enough to condemn the spate of targeted killings that have taken place in Kashmir Valley. Everyone is in agreement that terrorism needs to be stopped in its track before it starts feeding on itself again. The blame game that has ensued the latest acts of xenophobic terror - eight killings over this week alone - helps no one, certainly not the migrant or minority residents in the Valley, who are understandably shaken. The high-level meeting in Delhi with Amit Shah taking stock of the situation with J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha on Friday comes a day after the home minister sat down with national security adviser Ajit Doval and intelligence officials.
