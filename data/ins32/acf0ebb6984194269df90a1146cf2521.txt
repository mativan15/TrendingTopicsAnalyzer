An entire city block of prime property in downtown Orlando has been put up for sale.

Just under two acres at the southeast corner of South Orange Avenue and Anderson Street have hit the market and already are fielding interest from local and national developers, Orlando Business Journal has learned.

Why this matters: It's not often that two contiguous acres in downtown go up for sale. Given the proximity to Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, highways and city hall, the site one day could be home to a signature mixed-use development for the central business district.
