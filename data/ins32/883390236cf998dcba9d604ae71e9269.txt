EAU CLAIRE, Wis. - Derrick Van Orden, the Republican nominee for an open swing seat in Wisconsin, was outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 - and his Democratic opponent is trying to make sure voters don't forget it.

Brad Pfaff, the Democratic state senator running against Van Orden, is running TV ads in which a veteran accuses Van Orden of participating in "a riot that injured over 100 cops" as a footage of the insurrection plays.

He's pointed to polling showing that voters are less likely to support Van Orden when they learn about his conduct on Jan.
