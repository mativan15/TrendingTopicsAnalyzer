ANKARA, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he has agreed to meet with Sweden's new prime minister in Ankara to discuss the Scandinavian country's bid to join NATO, describing the visit as an opportunity to test Stockholm's "sincerity" in meeting Turkey's conditions.

In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden abandoned a longstanding policy of military nonalignment and applied for NATO membership this year together with neighboring Finland. Turkey, already a member of the military alliance, threatened to block the process.
