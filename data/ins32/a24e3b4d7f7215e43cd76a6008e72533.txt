The takeover at Chelsea has finally been completed, and Thomas Tuchel is set to be given a £200million transfer budget to improve the side ahead of next season. Although it may sound like a lot, a 'large chunk' of that money could be set aside for one signing.Chelsea are set to prioritise the signing of Sevilla defender Jules Kounde, with a number of defensive stars leaving the club this summer.Due to the club being unable to operate as normal after former owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned, it contributed to Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta all nearing moves away from Stamford Bridge.
