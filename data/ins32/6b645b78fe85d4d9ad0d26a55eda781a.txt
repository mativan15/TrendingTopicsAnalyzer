Is the billion-dollar COVID-19 testing sales boom over? That's what Abbott Laboratories ABT, -6.52% is predicting now as sales in its COVID-19 testing franchise have started to drop off. The company said Wednesday it expects to bring in $500 million in COVID-19 test sales in the final three months of the year, for a total of $7.8 billion in sales in 2022.  'We haven't really planned for a big winter surge,' Abbott CEO Robert Ford said on an earnings call. 'It's more of an endemic-like forecast for Q4, and I think that's the kind of endemic forecast that we'll see going into 2023.
