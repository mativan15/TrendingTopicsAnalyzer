It's a bit scary at times, but what should actually be done about it? Ultimately Tavares wants tariff barriers against Chinese car makers lasting for a decade; De Meo isn't so sure, but both agree it's a problem and the EU should have seen this coming. The Telegraph motoring team has been warning about this issue for a decade, but no one listens to us, either.
'There is a risk of Europe losing its automobile industry,' warns Tavares. 
It was a similar situation in the Eighties when Japanese firms were accused of dumping cars at lower than their production cost in European markets, which resulted in a series of non-trade restrictions and 'gentlemen's agreements', that some think assuaged the worst effects on Europe's car makers and others think were ineffectual and toothless.
