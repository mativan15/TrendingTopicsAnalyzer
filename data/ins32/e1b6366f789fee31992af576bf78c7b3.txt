D.C.'s EngagedMD, which helps fertility clinics handle paperwork and educates patients about treatments, has raised $11 million in new funding to grow its team, break into new markets and move into new areas of health care.

The 8-year-old company said Boulder, Colorado-based growth investment firm MonCap Holdings Inc. led the round, and declined to disclose other investors. Jonathan Sockol, managing partner of MonCap, joins the company's board as part of the raise.

The money builds on about $2 million in lifetime funding, according to EngagedMD co-founders and co-CEOs Jeff Issner and Taylor Stein, who said they funded the business until now with seed capital from angel investors and customers.
