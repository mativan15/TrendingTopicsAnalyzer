Hello, OnPolitics readers!

The Supreme Court has sided against Texas in banning Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies from moderating content.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill last fall that blocked the companies from restricting or removing content. The move was in response to complaints from conservatives and former President Donald Trump that the social media sites censor their voices and viewpoints.

The court's 5-4 decision temporarily blocks enforcement of the law while the underlying case continues through lower federal courts.
