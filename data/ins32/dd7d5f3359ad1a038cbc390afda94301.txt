The Treasury raked in a record amount in death duties in the first half of this tax year as grieving families were stung by frozen inheritance tax allowances and higher property prices.
Inheritance tax receipts hit a record £3.5bn for the first half of the 2022-2023 tax year, overtaking the previous high of £3.1bn collected in the same period last year, according to HM Revenue & Customs figures published today.
Under current government plans, the nil-band rate thresholds will remain frozen until 2026, with experts warning the likelihood of this being reformed was "vanishingly small" as the Treasury scrambles to plug a huge hole in the nation's finances.
