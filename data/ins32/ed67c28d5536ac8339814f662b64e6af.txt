By Reuters Published: 10:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 10:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 Aaron Rodgers hears the suggestion for fixing the Green Bay offense and ending the Packers' two-game losing streak: More Aaron Jones. "We do, we've gotta get Aaron Jones the ball more," Rodgers said on the Pat McAfee Show. "When he touches the ball good things happen." Jones has 87 touches for 532 yards this season but is second to AJ Dillon with 70 rushing attempts. He's averaging 5.8 yards per carry in 2022 and had only nine carries last week in a loss to the Jets that dropped Green Bay to 3-3.
