The Crown season 5 will not show the exact moment of Princess Diana's death but will depict the events leading up to it, Netflix has confirmed.
Netflix fans are gearing up for the release of the fifth and final season of the hit period drama, which recounts key events in the British Royal Family's history with creative licence, and will star Dominic West as King Charles III, Elizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana and Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II.
The next set of episodes will follow Princess Diana and the breakdown of her marriage to the then-Prince Charles, while also featuring their children Princes William and Harry.
