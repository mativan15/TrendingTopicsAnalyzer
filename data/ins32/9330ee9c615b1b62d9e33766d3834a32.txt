By Reuters Published: 14:09 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 14:09 EDT, 20 October 2022 By Brian Ellsworth Oct 20 (Reuters) - The Dominican Republic has approved a request by a trading firm to export 20,500 gallons of diesel to Haiti for use principally in hospitals, according to letters seen by Reuters, as gangs continue blocking a key fuel terminal in Haiti. Fuel shortages created by the gang blockade have left Haitian hospitals without diesel to power their generators, which are the only way they can ensure consistent electricity due to chronic outages in Haiti's power grid.
