(RTTNews) - The Malaysia stock market has finished higher in back-to-back sessions, gathering more than a dozen points or 0.9 percent along the way. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index now rests just above the 1,385-point plateau and it's tipped to open in the green again on Tuesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on bargain hunting after several days of volatility and heavy selling, while stability in the bond markets adds to the positive sentiment. The European and U.S. markets were up and the Asian bourses are tipped to open in similar fashion.
