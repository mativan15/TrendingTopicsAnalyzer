The ET Startup Awards (ETSA) are now in their eighth year and we are happy to report that we have begun the hunt for the brightest stars in India's startup world for the 2022 edition. A jury of achievers led by Salil Parekh, chief executive and managing director of Infosys, will pick the winners of this year's awards on October 28, marking the launch of India's most coveted recognition of entrepreneurial excellence.
ETSA comes at a time when the global tech startup ecosystem is surrounded by economic and geopolitical turmoil.
