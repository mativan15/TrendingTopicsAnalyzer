It hasn't been the best quarter for BlueScope Steel Limited (ASX:BSL) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 11% in that time. But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. In fact, the company's share price bested the return of its market index in that time, posting a gain of 70%.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
