The New Orleans Saints are a mediocre football team. That's just the reality right now. Their offense struggles to shift gears and their defense has a hard time finishing games. They rank last in the NFL in turnover differential (having given up 7 more fumbles and interceptions on offense than they've taken away on defense) and are tied at No. 21 in scoring differential (having put up 141 points on the scoreboard while yielding 158 points on defense).
And, yeah, that's kind of the story for all four NFC South teams right now.
