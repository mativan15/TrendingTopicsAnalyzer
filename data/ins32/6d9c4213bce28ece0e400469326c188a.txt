Houston-based Shell Midstream Partners LP is now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Shell USA.

Shell USA announced Oct. 19 that it completed the approximately $1.96 billion acquisition of the master limited partnership. The company paid $15.85 in cash for each of the common units representing limited partner interests in SHLX not held by Shell USA or its affiliates.

The SHLX units are no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange, effective with the opening of markets Oct. 19.

Shell Midstream began trading in October 2014 via an upsized initial public offering that was priced higher than expected.
