As the cost of living keeps rising, public sector workers in New South Wales could find themselves $6,000 worse off over the next three years.

A Unions NSW report pointed to a real loss in wages for teachers, police, firefighters, prison guards and bus drivers under current inflation forecasts and the state government's 2.5 per cent wage cap.

‘Real wages' refers to the amount of purchasing power someone has as opposed to the actual money received.
