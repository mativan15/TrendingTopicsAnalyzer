Published: 07:47 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 07:53 EDT, 20 October 2022 Cristiano Ronaldo has arrived at Manchester United training just hours after storming down the tunnel before the full-time whistle in his side's 2-0 win against Tottenham on Wednesday.Ronaldo refused to give much away to reporters as he drove into Carrington for the first time after his actions the previous evening. The Portuguese forward was somewhat surprisingly left out of the Erik ten Hag's team for the game at Old Trafford after starting United's previous two matches, as the Red Devils went with a front three of Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford.
