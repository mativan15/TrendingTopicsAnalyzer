By Reuters Published: 11:39 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 12:19 EDT, 19 October 2022 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Britain's Suella Braverman quit as interior minister on Wednesday, saying she had to go after she breached government rules but that she had concerns over the direction of Prime Minister Liz Truss's government. The second senior minister to leave the government in less than a week, Braverman's departure heaps yet more pressure on Truss as she fights to stay in power just over six weeks after she entered Downing Street.
