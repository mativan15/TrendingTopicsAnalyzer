Riley Burruss has had a front-row seat to conquering the entertainment business for more than a decade now, having been able to watch her mother's success grow over the years.

The public first met Riley back in 2009, when her mother, singer-songwriter Kandi Burruss, joined The Real Housewives of Atlanta in Season 2. Since then, Kandi has expanded her empire beyond music and recently became the longest-running Real Housewife on any franchise in Bravo history.
