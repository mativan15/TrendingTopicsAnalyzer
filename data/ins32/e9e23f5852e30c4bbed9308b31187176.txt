Congratulations, bettors! The real winners of the Christian McCaffrey trade.
When the Carolina Panthers handed their star running back to one of the best team's in the NFC, bettors officially gained a sure winner to throw into their parlays each week for the remainder of the 2022 season.
No, the lock I speak of isn't the San Francisco 49ers, who got a B- trade grade for gaining one of the best and most versatile running backs in the league. Though McCaffrey makes the Niners better, I wouldn't just write them in to win every week.
