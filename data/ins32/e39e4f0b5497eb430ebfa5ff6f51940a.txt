The language debate continues in the Quebec provincial legislature where Liberal MNA Saul Polo was presenting a motion during Wednesday's question period, in part, to acknowledge that language spoken at home should remain a personal choice.
While he was doing so his colleague David Birnbaum claims he heard Quebec Premier François Legault say, off-microphone, 'Ah, c'est le West Island qui s'énerve.'Roughly translated it means, 'It's (Montreal's) West Island that gets angry.' The West Island is historically home to the city's anglophones, but now is home to a plurality of multilingual residents.
