Tokyo prosecutors have charged a former director of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics organizing committee with bribery for the third time. Takahashi Haruyuki was indicted along with his acquaintance, Fukami Kazumasa, former head of a Tokyo-based consulting firm, on charges of taking bribes. Taniguchi Yoshikazu, an executive of the Osaka-based advertising agency Daiko, was also indicted on charge of offering bribes. Prosecutors say Takahashi accepted a total of 15 million yen, or about 100,000 dollars, from Taniguchi over a three-year period through February this year in exchange for helping Daiko undertake the Games' sponsorship contracts.
