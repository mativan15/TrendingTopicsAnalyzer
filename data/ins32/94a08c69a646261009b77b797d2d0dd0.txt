New fears have emerged for the safety of Chinese activist Peng Lifa who is believed to be behind the rare public protest against leader Xi Jinping in China last week.

Some believe the protestor is facing "secret torture" or even execution.

The demonstrator stunned Beijing residents when he hung banners of political protest from an overpass in the Chinese capital on Thursday, swiftly leading to his arrest and the signs being removed.

A person was reportedly arrested over the rare display of political protest in China.
