Carson Wentz is expected to miss four to six weeks with a fractured ring finger on his throwing hand, according to a report.

The NFL Network reported Monday that the Washington Commanders quarterback needs surgery and the team will consider placing Wentz on injured reserve as he recovers. Wentz broke the finger in Thursday's 12-7 win over the Chicago Bears and visited a hand specialist in Los Angeles on Monday for the injury.

The injury is a blow to Wentz and the Commanders as the team now likely turns to backup Taylor Heinicke for Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers and beyond.
