TV Insider Paramount+ has released a new trailer for its upcoming crime drama Tulsa King, starring Sylvester Stallone as a New York Mafia capo sent to set up shop in Oklahoma. The teaser (watch below), which debuted during Sunday's (October 16) Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs game on CBS, shows Stallone's Dwight 'The General' Manfredi as he's released from prison and relocated to Tulsa to establish criminal operations there. He soon finds that things are very different in the middle of nowhere compared to life in New York City.
