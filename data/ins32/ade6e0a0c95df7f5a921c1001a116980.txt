Lionel Messi is ready to lead the Argentinian attack at the World Cup and Scaloni's team will pose a threat to most if not all defences at the global stage. In attack, he will have Lautaro Martinez up top with Angel Di Maria and Giovani Lo Celso featuring out wide. Leandro Paredes could get the second slot in the double pivot, with Rodrigo De Paul making the other slot his own in recent games. Tagliafico and Molina look like the best bet to flank the formidable centre-back pairing of Otamendi and Romero.
