By Maria Martinez Sentiment in the French manufacturing sector rebounded in October, following three consecutive monthly drops amid increasing energy prices and weakening demand. French manufacturing sentiment came in at 103 in the month, up from 102 in September, according to data from the national statistics office Insee released Thursday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a reading of 101. The increase in the headline index was led by improving opinions regarding past production and orders, according to the survey.
