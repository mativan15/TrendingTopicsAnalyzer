Trust us, finding the best kids' hiking boots and walking shoes is probably the most important thing to sort ahead of a long family ramble or countryside hike. The reason? If the youngsters don't feel their feet are comfortable, dry and well-supported in their shoes, your hike just isn't going to happen (well, it might – you'll just end up carrying a child for three hours).For kids, the best hiking boots need to be durable yet lightweight, weather-resistant to handle all conditions, and should tread just as easily across forest floors and muddy trails as over sand dunes.
