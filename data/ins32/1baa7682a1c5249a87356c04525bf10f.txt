A pair of Sault Ste. Marie doctors-turned-authors are collaborating on a fundraiser for the Sault Area Hospital Foundation. They'll be sharing a stage next month for a discussion on their books - as well as a broader discussion on the state of healthcare and those who work in it. Doctor Pat Zehr, a retired obstetrician, will be reading excerpts from her memoir, The Beatles, Babies and Broken Bodies. It's a personal reflection on more than 30 years in healthcare. Zehr will be joined by Doctor Graham Elder, an orthopaedic surgeon and author of three medical-fiction novels set during the pandemic - A COVID Odyssey, Second Wave and Variant Reset.
