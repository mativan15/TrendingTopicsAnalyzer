On Wednesday, the Pittsburgh Steelers released a statement from defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt that he is planning to retire from the NFL after eight seasons. If you were at all curious about the timing of the announcement, it was at least due in part to money.
There's no shame in saying Tuitt had one of the worst contracts on the team. Tuitt's cap hit for the 2022 season was set at $13.975 million. His retirement will give the Steelers $9.05 million in cap space but also park $4.925 million in dead money on the books.
