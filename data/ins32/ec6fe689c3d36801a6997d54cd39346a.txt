Salesforce has a long-standing tradition of promoting professional learning communities around its software products. In doing so, it has bucked a widespread emphasis in talent management circles on employee retention. Salesforce, in contrast, has built a 'Salesforce ecosystem' of talent, involving all of its own and its customers' present and potential future employees. This approach to community-building sets Salesforce apart from other major IT corporations. For example, IBM promotes a 'culture of learning' among its own employees but outsources much of its customer training to licensed partners.
