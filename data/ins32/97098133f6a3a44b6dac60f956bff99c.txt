In what is a first among our Shopping Pools, Lab7 Pool has formed a partnership with JEXchange, a peer-to-peer decentralized exchange built on Elrond Network. This is a massive stepping stone for the Shopping Pools, highlighting the scope of what it means to own one. We are excited to showcase such innovation emerging from within the ZoidPay ecosystem and expect this to be the first among many. The rise of the Web 3.0 Digital Bank is happening here and now!Please note that this partnership has been done in its entirety between Lab7 Pool and JEXchange.
