It's easy to feel disappointed if you buy a stock that goes down. But often it is not a reflection of the fundamental business performance. So while the Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) share price is down 20% in the last year, the total return to shareholders (which includes dividends) was -19%. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 25%. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 8.4% in three years. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.
