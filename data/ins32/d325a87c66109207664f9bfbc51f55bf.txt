Justin Sullivan I was arguably one of the largest bears when it came to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Seeking Alpha, and one of my articles amassed over 3,100 comments without a single response from me. After the Q2 earnings call, I changed my investment thesis from being bearish to neutral, and I am on the verge of turning bullish on TSLA. I am not quite there yet, but the progress and success that TSLA has produced are undeniable. I had 3 major issues with TSLA when I was bearish. Those were: the valuation based on its free cash flow (FCF), 100% of its gross profit and net income were generated from the automotive segment, and TSLA didn't have a vehicle at a price point that was appealing to the average consumer.
