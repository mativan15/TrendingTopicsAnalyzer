Unions could organise co-ordinated strike action 'very soon' after the 'horror story' of the past few weeks, a union boss has warned.Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, told Sky News that the union had been in discussion with other unions following strike action by the RMT and Unison.'I think there could be up to a million people on strike very, very soon,' she said.'What we're seeing - and I think we just have to take this back as to why people go on strike - is that they [the government] can put in all the anti-trade union they want, they can pretend it is union barons pressing big red buttons but this is about anger, anger in workplaces, both in the public sector and in the private sector.
