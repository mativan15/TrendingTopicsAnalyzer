When I was 17, I brought my younger sister, who was three, to the UK to join my mother. 
Until then, we'd been living in Nigeria, where my sister's life was at risk because she had cerebral palsy. 
Her disability meant that not only was she was treated differently by the community, but her life was also at risk as people in Nigeria often kill children with disabilities. 
We moved around in Nigeria to keep my sister safe, but eventually my mother saved every last penny and sold all she had to come to the UK, planning for us to join her once she arrived.
