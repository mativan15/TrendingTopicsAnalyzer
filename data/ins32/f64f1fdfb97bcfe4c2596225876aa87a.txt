CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico, Oct. 20, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The past two years of travel and human interaction restrictions have encouraged people to take a good look at their lives and the things on which they spend their time and money, so Cabo Luxury Villas & Concierge has recently launched additional unique, local activities and excursions tailored to these travelers. "We have noticed a shift, seeing fewer and fewer people settling for commonplace vacation activities. Consumers are pursuing more authentic experiences with expert local guides, distancing themselves from mainstream tourism providers and venturing into private tours that feel more meaningful," said Becca Meyer, Brand Director of Cabo Luxury and travel industry veteran.
