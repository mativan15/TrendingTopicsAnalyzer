StefaNikolic/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ) is a mobile gaming company founded by current CEO Andrew Paradise back in 2012. It went public in 2020 through a SPAC merger with Flying Eagle Acquisition Corporation. The company was the poster child of the SPAC craze with ARK Invest (ARKK) acquiring millions of shares. The stock skyrocketed from its SPAC price of $10 to over $40 in just a few months. As the hype dies down and the broad market started to sell off high-growth tech stocks, Skillz got obliterated.
