A finance assistant has been jailed after she stole £100,000 from her employer to fund an "Instagram lifestyle".

Laura Howarth, 41, stole "every single week" from British Independent Utilities in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.

Preston Crown Court heard that she bought a white SUV car, hair extensions and VIP concert tickets using the stolen money, copying the lifestyles of other glamorous women, including her boss's wife, and posting the results of her spending spree on Instagram.
