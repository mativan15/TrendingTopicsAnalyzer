STORY: During a televised speech Zelenskiy described the taking of the city as Russia's "principal aim" right now.

The Ukrainian leader used wry humour during the evening address to the nation, quipping that Russia had attacked a hotel in the city named the Peace Hotel 'Peace is indeed the primary target for Russia, ' he said.

"Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city's housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication," he said.

Constant Russian shelling has destroyed all of the critical infrastructure in Sievierodonetsk, the largest city Ukraine still controls in Luhansk, one of the regions in Donbas, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, while pledging to do everything to hold off the advance.
