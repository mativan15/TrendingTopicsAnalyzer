According to artist Geraldine O'Neill's website, the theme of her work is that 'decay is inevitable, our time is limited and our fragility exposed'. That message may not have been fully accepted by Patrick Prendergast, the former provost of Trinity College Dublin, whose portrait she painted recently.According to sources in the art world, Prendergast was not satisfied with her final painting, and it is not expected to join portraits of other Trinity academics on the walls of the university. Prendergast, whose term as provost ended last summer, did not respond to an email seeking comment last week.
