The Japanese government launched a nationwide discount campaign last week to kick-start domestic tourism. However, some people have said on social media that accommodation operators could be price gouging by ramping up their room rates. The government says it will advise operators not to introduce unreasonable price hikes. Japanese tourism minister Saito Tetsuo said on Tuesday no such cases had been reported yet. He said not all price increases are necessarily inappropriate. He said there are instances in which prices have to rise to pay for the staff needed.
