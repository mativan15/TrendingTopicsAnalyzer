MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A state legislator appears to have lost to a primary challenger by a single vote after provisional ballots were counted Tuesday, setting up a possible recount in the race. The state GOP also plans to certify the results of another legislative race where some voters may have gotten the incorrect ballot. The losing candidate can pursue election contests, or a recount, if they choose. Republican state Sen. Tom Whatley of Auburn trailed primary challenger Jay Hovey by a single vote after provisional ballots were counted Tuesday, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl said.
