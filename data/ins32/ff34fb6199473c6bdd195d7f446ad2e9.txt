Hello, it's Thursday, Oct. 20, and before diving into the top news, we want to shout out a story by our colleague (and Essential Arts author) Carolina Miranda that opens with Kylie Jenner's private jet. It's a story about climate damage — but also jet flaunting, racket and 'unbelievably bad' fumes.

Carolina told us how she came to write the story: 'I was at a party and a friend of mine who lives in the San Fernando Valley happened to mention in passing that he had just moved out of his neighborhood — where he's been for a couple of decades — because he couldn't take the jet noise anymore.
