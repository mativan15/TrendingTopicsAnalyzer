Although the first recorded baseball game in Panama history dates back to 1883 in an area known as Chiriquí Plaza, some country historians have the sport going back even farther. Maybe as far back as when the United States first started playing ball in the 1850s -- when American traders and Panama railroad workers took up the game.
Either way, baseball has, for a long time, been part of the lifeblood of the Central American nation. They've developed legendary players who've reached the Hall of Fame and won World Series championships.
