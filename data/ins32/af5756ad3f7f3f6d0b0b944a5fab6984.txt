Bridgerton actress Ruby Barker has been discharged from the hospital where she received mental health treatment, she shared in a video posted to her Instagram.

Barker, 25, posted on the platform last week that she had "been really unwell for a really long time" and was getting help.

"I just want to be honest with everybody, I have been struggling," she said in May 26 Instagram video. "So, I'm in the hospital at the minute, I'm gonna get discharged soon and hopefully get to continue with my life and I'm gonna take a little bit of a break from myself.
