Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as a wondrous new stage of technology, filled with opportunities to work, play and communicate. You could watch an Imax movie on the moon, host a work meeting in a Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired tavern or rock out on a stage with your favorite musician. But while you watch how the metaverse unfolds, Zuckerberg is preparing for what appears to be the fight of his life. His opponent is Apple.During his Meta Connect conference keynote last week, Zuckerberg laid out his vision for the future, including games like Iron Man VR, a suite of business productivity apps from Microsoft and a new $1,500 headset called Quest Pro, whose top feature includes sensors that can read your real-life facial expressions.
