Nicola Sturgeon's plan for a border between an independent Scotland and England has been labelled a 'smugglers' charter' after it emerged that check points would be installed on only two of its 25 crossings.The first minister's economic prospectus for a new state has conceded that checks would be required on goods heading between the two countries.It said that physical examinations 'would likely only be undertaken on the two main trunk routes between England and Scotland or at rail freight terminals'.
