Ontario's education minister announced a new round of direct payments to parents on Thursday, encouraging them to use the $200 on offer for help with students' learning recovery.That's after newly released results from Ontario's standardized tests — administered in the spring after a two-year break during the COVID-19 pandemic — which suggest students are struggling in math, with a majority of Grade 6 students failing to meet the province's bar.The Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) data, published on Thursday, shows no improvement in math scores for students in both Grade 3 and Grade 6 from the 2018 school year.
