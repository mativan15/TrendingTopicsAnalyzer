Salesforce Inc. shares were on track for their second-best day ever Wednesday, after Wall Street analysts described the software company's earnings as 'better than feared,' and cheered an outlook that balanced prudence and optimism. Salesforce CRM, +11.04% shares surged as much as 15% Tuesday to hit an intraday high of $184.42. Though gains slipped to about 10% later in the session, that would still be good enough for their best one-day gain apart from Aug. 26, 2020, when shares rocketed a record 26% following quarterly results that were turbocharged from businesses rushing to shore up their digital footprints as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world.
