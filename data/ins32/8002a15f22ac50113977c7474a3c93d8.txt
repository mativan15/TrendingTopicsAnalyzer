KPMG is set to cut the number of companies it audits to focus on improving standards after a string of scandals, including the collapse of its client Carillion.Its decision to rein in its number of clients comes as more than 70 stock market companies put their audit contracts out to tender under rules demanding that they rotate every ten years.Last week, KPMG confirmed it had stepped down as auditor of fund management giant M&G, to be replaced by PwC.Cath Burnet, head of UK audit for KPMG, said the firm had already stopped working for some clients and would now be 'selective' about competing for tenders as they were put out.
