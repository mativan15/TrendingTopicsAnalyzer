The new king

Congratulations to Aaron Judge, the new legitimate single-season MLB home run king. Bonds, McGwire and Sosa were all on the juice. I don't care how the record book reads, those juicers' names are in there because MLB doesn't hold them accountable. If those juicers were legit and worthy of their stats, they'd be in the Hall of Fame.
