The first time All-Star didn't want to be left behind the rest of his Dodgers teammates.

The MLB unveiled the new PitchCom devices in an effort to prevent another "sign stealing" scandal as the Astros have done in the past. PitchCom helps to speed up the game and allow for quick exchanges between the catcher and the pitcher and can even do so in multiple languages.

PitchCom also allows the shortstop to listen in on what the pitch is going to be and possibly help them prepare even more for the pitch, but as all technology goes it's not perfect.
