India, already in the process of implementing changes to make the nation healthier, has doubled down on its efforts to create a robust healthcare infrastructure after the pandemic took a massive toll on its population. The states and federal government have been working hand in hand to improve healthcare in the country and give individuals living in even the most remote areas of the nation access to all levels of healthcare. As part of the initiatives undertaken to improve healthcare at all levels in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Bilaspur - a premier level medical institute-cum-hospital equipped with ultra-modern facilities in the country's northern Himachal Pradesh.
