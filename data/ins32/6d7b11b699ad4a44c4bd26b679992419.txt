During Scott Moe's white paper presentation in North Battleford earlier this week, he outlined the actions his government will take to protect Saskatchewan families from federal policies.
During the presentation, the premier took a moment to address how the provinces should be handling immigration.'Our Immigration Minister, Jeremy Harrison… has already put forward a document to the Federal Government saying that we do want to increase Saskatchewan's influence on where our immigrants are coming from,' Moe said during the conference.
