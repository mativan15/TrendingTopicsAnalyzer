By Kyle Morris Mind Gym PLC said Tuesday that it expects to report a rise in first-half revenue after booking underlying growth in the U.S. and benefiting from the recent strengthening of the dollar. The business-transformation and training company said it expects to report revenue for the period ended Sept. 30 of 26.8 million pounds ($30.4 million), a gain of 11% on year. Performance to date is in line with the board's expectations and guidance for the year remains unchanged, the company said. Price increases have helped offset cost inflation, it said.
