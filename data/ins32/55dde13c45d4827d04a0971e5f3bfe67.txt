The chancellor is reversing almost all tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago that have not started parliamentary legislation.

In an emergency statement, Jeremy Hunt said these measures were intended to provide confidence and stability in the financial markets.

Mr Hunt also announced that the government will stand by it's energy cost support bill, but that help with bills is now only guaranteed until April 2023.
