Warning: This story contains major spoilers for Halloween Ends.

So now we know: Thanks to Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, evil really does die in Halloween Ends.

First, the final-girl-turned-ass-kicking-grandmother kills masked murderer Michael Myers at the conclusion of a lengthy kitchen-set brawl. Then, just to make sure, Strode grinds Myers' body to a pulp in a giant car-cruncher as her fellow Haddonfield residents look on. The result is a happy coda to the saga for Strode and her daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), albeit one that follows a ton of death and bloodshed, both in Halloween Ends and its predecessors.
