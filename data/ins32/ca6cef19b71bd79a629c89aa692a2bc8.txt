JALANDHAR: Having faced severe criticism from

for remaining silent on

topping National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021, education minister

on Saturday attracted sharper criticism for his reported statement that Punjab's top rank in the rating was based on fudged figures.

Having already questioned the

government's silence on the state's achievement, several Punjabi netizens have now expressed shock at Hayer's comment. Opposition leaders also used strong adjectives to describe the minister's remarks, with their common refrain being that he made the comments in desperation to appease his party's supremo, as the Arvind Kejriwal-headed Delhi government had lagged behind Punjab even as AAP had been propounding the Delhi model during the Punjab elections.
