STOCKHOLM, 3 June — Financing for environmental action must be massively scaled up, diversified and quickly disbursed if countries are to stand a chance in reversing the business and policy trends that have long degraded their natural ecosystems, delegates said today during the third and last leadership dialogue held alongside the Stockholm+50 international meeting. Throughout the afternoon, representatives of non-governmental groups and Governments alike engaged in two rapid-fire dialogues held under the theme 'Accelerating the implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development in the context of the decade of action and delivery for sustainable development'.
