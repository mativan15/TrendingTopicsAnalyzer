Andi and Kenny Jun 2, 2022After losing both their parents in the span of a few months, kind strangers from around the world donate enough money to four young brothers in Ireland for them to buy the home they've grown up in. The Clifford brothers have had a rough year. Their mother, Elaine Clifford, passed away in August of 2021 from cancer and then just five months later, they lost their father, Padraig Clifford, to cancer, too. The boys' aunt, Mary Hayes, set up a GoFundMe to help Patrick, 21, Jack, 14, Andrew, eight, and Conor, five, raise enough money to buy the rental house where they'd shared many memories with their parents.
