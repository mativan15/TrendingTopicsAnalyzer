Mumbai: In order to ensure a speedy rollout of 5G telecom services, the state government has decided to streamline the grant of right of way (RoW) permissions for erecting telecom towers and laying optical fiber cable (OFC) networks. This will also give a push for 4G telecom service providers to widen their subscriber base.This ease of doing business initiative will create an enabling eco-system for telecom and internet service providers to add infrastructure and deepen the reach of these services, said state officials.
