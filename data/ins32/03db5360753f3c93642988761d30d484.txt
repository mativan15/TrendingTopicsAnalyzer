Michael Avenatti, the brash California lawyer who once took on then-President Donald Trump, was sentenced on Thursday to four years in prison for defrauding his best-known former client, the porn actress Stormy Daniels.
A federal jury had convicted Avenatti in February of wire fraud and aggravated identity after a two-week trial, agreeing with prosecutors that he embezzled nearly $300,000 in book proceeds intended for Daniels.
US District Judge Jesse Furman imposed the sentence in federal court in Manhattan.
