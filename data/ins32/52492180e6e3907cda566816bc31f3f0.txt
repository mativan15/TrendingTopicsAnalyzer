Elon Musk's Starlink satellites could produce a worldwide global broadband internet service for anyone on the planet.
But at what cost?
Astronomers have cautioned against the billionaire's rollout of the satellite system for years. 
Now, one professor is suggesting the low-level satellites could come into contact with commercial airliners.
Andy Lawrence, Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, suggests the amount of satellites up in space will inevitably lead to collisions. From there, it wouldn't take much for debris to rain down on Earth.
