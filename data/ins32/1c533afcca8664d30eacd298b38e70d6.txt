Kirill Kaprizov was on the ice for a shift of 59 seconds Thursday night when he scored the overtime game-winner against Vancouver — and that was after the Wild winger started the overtime with a minute-long shift.

But he didn't describe those efforts as the most taxed he's felt through Week 1 of the season.

"Every single shift feels like it's tiring when you make a lot of mistakes [and] you don't do well in your own zone," Kaprizov said through an interpreter after the 4-3 victory, the Wild's first of the season.
