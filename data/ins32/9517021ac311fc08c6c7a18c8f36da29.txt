The first piece of U.S. currency to carry the likeness of an Asian American will begin shipping on Oct. 24, according to the U.S. Mint. On the tails side of a new quarter coin design will be the Chinese American actress Anna May Wong, chin resting on her hand, framed by the 'bright lights of a marquee sign,' the Mint said. Wong's coin is the fifth in a series of quarters to feature prominent American women. There has been 'overwhelming demand' and most of the coins are already sold out, according to the Mint's website.
