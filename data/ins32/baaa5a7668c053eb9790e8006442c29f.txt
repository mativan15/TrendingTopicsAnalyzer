LONDON, October 17, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KBRA UK (KBRA) releases research highlighting the impact to commercial real estate (CRE) borrowers in purchasing interest rate caps to utilise pre-existing loan extension options in a rising interest rate environment.

In the report, KBRA reviewed 20 European loans across 18 CMBS transactions from 2018 to 2022 in our rated universe. We used the latest information found in quarterly servicer reports along with loan-level documentation to calculate the maximum strike rate that borrowers could purchase interest rate caps.
