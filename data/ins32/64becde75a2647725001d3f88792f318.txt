Citing Merriam Webster Dictionary, Tharoor said that the use of the word, doomscrolling, has increased. The parliamentarian helpfully shared the meaning of the word too. Doomscrolling means the act of continuously seeking out and reading bad news. He also said that increased consumption of negative news can cause political depression and affect one's mental well-being.
