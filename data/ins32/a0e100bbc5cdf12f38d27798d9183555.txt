Young Achutha Shenoy is using his creative skills for a charitable cause. The proceeds from his maiden solo art exhibition at Government Law College, Ernakulam, will be used to fund the medical expenses of the wife of the person who has been supplying tea to students on the campus over the last four decades. A second-year student of the college, Achutha is the son of artist Dinesh Shenoy, famous for his paintings of heritage structures displayed at their art studio in Mattancherry.
