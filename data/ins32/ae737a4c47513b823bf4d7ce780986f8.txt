WASHINGTON — Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Thursday rejected a challenge to President Biden's student debt relief program from a taxpayers' association in Wisconsin that said he had overstepped his authority in adopting the sweeping measure, one that could cost the government hundreds of billions of dollars.

Justice Barrett denied the association's challenge without comment, which is the court's custom in ruling on emergency applications. She acted on her own, without referring the application to the full court, and she did not ask the administration for a response.
