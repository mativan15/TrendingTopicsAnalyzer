Michigan freshman Caleb Houstan will stay in the 2022 NBA draft and forgo his remaining collegiate eligibility, the program announced on Wednesday.

Houstan, a former five-star recruit from the Montverde Academy, averaged 10.1 points, four rebounds and 1.4 assists on 35.5% shooting from 3-point range in 34 games. He started in every game for the Wolverines and led the team with 60 3-pointers.

The 6-foot-8 forward was once viewed as a potential lottery pick but failed to live up to expectations last season.
