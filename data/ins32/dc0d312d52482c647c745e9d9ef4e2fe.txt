Jada Pinkett Smith is the first to admit she has "really crossed the line" before. In a new episode of "Red Table Talk" on Facebook, the actress and her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, spoke with Pinkett Smith's husband Will's ex-wife Sheree Zampino. Zampino was filling in as a guest host for the Smiths' daughter Willow, who is on tour. Discussing their relationship, Pinkett Smith said candidly that when she came onto the scene, she did things incorrectly. In hindsight, she says, "I would have definitely taken a beat as far as putting myself within the dynamic of you guys," speaking on the dissolution of Zampino and Smith's marriage.
