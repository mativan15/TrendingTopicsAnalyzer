PTIExternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar India has said Europe must see not oil imports from Russia from a political lens. Speaking at Globsec 2022 Bratislava forum, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, "We don't send people to buy Russian oil, we send people to buy oil in the market, buy the best oil."
 Jaishankar also highlighted Europe's continued purchase of gas from Russia."Buying Russian gas is not funding the war, why it's only Indian money and fund coming from India and not gas coming to Europe which funds war, let's be even-handed out here," he said in response to a question.
