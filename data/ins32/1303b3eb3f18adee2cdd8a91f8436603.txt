Sri Lanka, reeling under its worst economic crisis since independence and hit by political turmoil, has asked India for bridging finance until the economic adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can be negotiated and finalised. The two sides explored the possibility of increasing and restructuring the assistance provided by India in the form of credits for essential commodities and fuel as well as balance of payments support, officials said. The meeting in New Delhi on Friday was attended by Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to India Milinda Moragoda.
