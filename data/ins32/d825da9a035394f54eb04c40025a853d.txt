The White House is considering whether to subject some of Elon Musk's business ventures to national security reviews, including his proposed acquisition of Twitter and his satellite internet company Starlink, according to a report.Bloomberg wrote on Friday that Biden administration officials are concerned by the Tesla chief executive's plan to buy Twitter in a deal part-funded by non-US investors and his recent threat to pull the plug on the Starlink service to Ukraine, as well as the publication of a series of tweets containing proposals over the Ukraine conflict favourable to the Putin regime.
