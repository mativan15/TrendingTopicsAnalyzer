But the main game is to find enough winners to more than offset the losers So we wouldn't blame long term PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 33% over a half decade. More recently, the share price has dropped a further 14% in a month. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 6.1% in the same time period.
