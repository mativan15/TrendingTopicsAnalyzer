Liz Truss's government has been thrust further into disarray with the apparent resignation of her chief whip in a row over a contentious vote on fracking.Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig Whittaker are understood to have quit after a minister withdrew the threat that the Commons division would be treated as a vote of confidence in the Government.And there were complaints that Tory MPs considering voting with Labour to ban fracking were shouted at within the voting lobbies and even physically manhandled into the No lobby by ministers.
