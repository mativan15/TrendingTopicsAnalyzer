Revlon Inc. REV, -5.34% said late Thursday a New York Stock Exchange committee rejected its appeal to not delist its stock and expects to be delisted "in the hear future." Back in August, Revlon shares tumbled when a bankruptcy judge denied minority shareholders a special committee to represent them. Revlon shares fell 5.3% to close Thursday at $3.90, and were halted from after-hours activity before Revlon's announcement.
