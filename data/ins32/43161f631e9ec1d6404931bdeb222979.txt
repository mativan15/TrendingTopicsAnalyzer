Elon Musk says Tesla AI Day has been delayed until September 30.

He tweeted that the electric car maker may have an "Optimus prototype" ready by then.

Musk said in May that AI Day aimed to convince top tech talent to join Tesla.

Elon Musk has pushed back Tesla's AI Day to September 30 from the planned date of August 19.

This will be the second time the electric car maker has held such an event.

Last year's AI Day aimed to lure top talent to the company, Musk said, but also provided insight into Tesla's progress toward fully autonomous cars.
