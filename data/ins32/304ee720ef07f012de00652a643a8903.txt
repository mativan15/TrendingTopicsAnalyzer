Deontay Wilder announced his much-anticipated return to the heavyweight scene with a first-round destruction of Robert Helenius in New York and now appears to be targeting a massive showdown with Oleksandr Usyk.

Fighting for the first time since his epic trilogy defeat by Tyson Fury at Barclays Center on Saturday night, the ‘Bronze Bomber' dropped his Finnish opponent - the former European champion - with a massive right hand to end a short, one-sided contest with three seconds left in the opener.
