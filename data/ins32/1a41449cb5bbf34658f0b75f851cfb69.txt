Autodesk's Maya 2023 is an impressively large, comprehensive, and powerful 3D digital content creation program—sometimes called 3D modeling software—one that does more than just modeling. Maya's modules, which include modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, dynamic simulations, and rendering, are mature and full featured. Because of its breadth and depth of tools, as well as certain idiosyncrasies and legacy features, learning Maya takes a lot of time and patience. If you're willing to invest months and endure some crashes and frustrations, however, you'll be well equipped to wield one of the leading animation programs in the entertainment industry, and an Editors' Choice winner for 3D content creation software.
