Insiders who purchased US$2.3m worth of Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:VCTR) shares over the past year recouped some of their losses after price gained 7.2% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be an expensive wager as insiders are yet to get ahead of their losses which currently stand at US$426k since the time of purchase.

While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
