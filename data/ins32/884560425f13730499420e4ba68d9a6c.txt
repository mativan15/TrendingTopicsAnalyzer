JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Argus Research analyst Kevin Heal upgraded regional bank Comerica (NYSE:CMA) to Buy from Hold after it posted record Q3 earnings, primarily due to the rise in short-term interest rates. "Looking ahead, we expect Comerica (CMA) to benefit from higher short-term interest rates for longer and continued strong credit quality in the loan book," Heal wrote in a note to clients. In addition, he expects mid-single digit loan growth with gains in General, National Dealer Services, and Environmental Services offset by lower Mortgage and Equity Fund Services.
