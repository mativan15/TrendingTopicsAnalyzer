When Bridget Hayes was growing up in Dublin's Smithfield, her family's 'back garden', as her publican father described it, was the Phoenix Park, where she regularly looked through the fence at Dublin Zoo and said "I want to work there", writes Brian Byrne. She eventually did, and her experience there is part of why she now has her own business outside Kilcullen offering boarding and care services for small and exotic pets.Though her childhood home was over their Keoghs of North King Street pub, today known as The Cobblestone, there was always contact with animals.
