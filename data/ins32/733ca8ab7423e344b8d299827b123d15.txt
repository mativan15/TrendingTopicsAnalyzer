The Conservative Party is in free fall, and it is not yet clear if it has a parachute. This week, my polling firm has the party on just 14 per cent of the national vote. This is simply the lowest share of support for the Conservatives in the history of British polling. Today, with Labour on 53 per cent, the party is weaker than it was in the aftermath of the ERM crisis in 1992, or on the eve of its historic defeat to Tony Blair in 1997, or amid the depths of austerity, or even during partygate, or the mass resignations that brought down Boris Johnson.
