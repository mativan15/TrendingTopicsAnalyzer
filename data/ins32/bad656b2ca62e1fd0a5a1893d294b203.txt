Credit Suisse (CS -3.09%) has been in trouble all year long, with its stock now trading below $4.60 per share, near all-time lows. The Swiss bank also now trades around just 25% of its tangible book value, or net worth.
In recent years, Credit Suisse has suffered a number of scandals, including having lots of exposure to funds like Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital, both of which collapsed and have led to billions of dollars in losses for the bank.
Credit Suisse now faces the tough task of transforming its operations and trying to get back into the good graces of its shareholders.
