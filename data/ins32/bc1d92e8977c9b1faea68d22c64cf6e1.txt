The Manitoba government signalled on Monday that it will likely raise the minimum wage above the set increase planned later this year to keep up with inflation and the rest of the country. While anti-poverty groups in the province say wages are too low and should go up by three or four dollars, one small business owner fears a large jump could force her to close her doors. Gisele Manaigre is the owner of Beausejour Restaurant and told CTV News that inflation is eating away at her bottom line all while she is still trying to recover from the pandemic.
