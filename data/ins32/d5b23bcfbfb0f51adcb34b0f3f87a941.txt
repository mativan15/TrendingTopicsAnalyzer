The most tragic aspect of Liz Truss's truly bizarre decision to come to the House of Commons and spend 40 full minutes auditioning for the role of her own waxwork at Madame Tussauds is that they probably won't bother making one of her anyway.Perhaps she will be remembered as one of those weird ceremonial figures, who appears roughly once a century to carry out some ancient heraldic function or other when the country buries a monarch and then vanishes again. A bit like the bloke who broke that stick in half, except with the economy.
