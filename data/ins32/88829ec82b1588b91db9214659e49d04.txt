HYDERABAD: Wondering how discom staff would penalise homeowners, Hyderabad electricity court, a consumer grievances redressal forum, has directed the Medchal electricity authorities to withdraw the back billing case they slapped against Sterling Heights Villas at Gundlapochampally in Medchal division. A forum bench comprising chairperson N Jaya Raj and three members also directed the discom officials to adjust Rs 1.77 lakh excess bill in future bills if already collected from the villa owners, besides reversing their power connection to their previous LT-II category from the current LT-VIII category.
