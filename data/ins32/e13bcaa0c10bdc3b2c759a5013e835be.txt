Russia has "infiltrated" Georgia's political establishment and its security apparatus, an opposition MP told the Express. She claimed that Tbilisi was allowing Putin's intelligence agencies to run amok in Georgia, a NATO ally since 1992, and this posed a threat to the country's independence. The country's dominant political force is the Georgian Dream party, which has been in power since 2012.The party was founded by the billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia and is believed to have close ties with the Kremlin.
