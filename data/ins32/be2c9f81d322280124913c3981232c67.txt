Gazing out from the new offices of online bank Starling, Anne Boden sees the familiar, modest surroundings of the Welsh capital Cardiff rather than the skyscrapers of London's City financial district.

"We have great universities in Cardiff, and we have great talents here, we're using that talent to create something that's really special for the customers," say Boden.
