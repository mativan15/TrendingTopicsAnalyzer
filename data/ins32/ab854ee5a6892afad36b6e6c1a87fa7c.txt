Gaborone, Botswana — 
Cattle farmers in Botswana, one of Africa's top beef exporters to the European Union, have welcomed renewed beef exports to Europe. The move follows a two-month ban that followed an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and the culling of thousands of cows.
Botswana officials on Monday said the August outbreak near the border with Zimbabwe has been brought under control, although a ban on cattle from the area remains in place.
Due to tough restrictions, beef exports to the European Union had been suspended because of the outbreak in August.
