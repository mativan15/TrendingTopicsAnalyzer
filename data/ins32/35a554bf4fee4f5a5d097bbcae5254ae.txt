As the Democratic Party's fate grows increasingly uncertain this midterm election season, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) says he remains resilient in a notoriously 'purplish' state by focusing on the empowerment of individual voters.
'Colorado is a very independently minded, freedom-oriented state, and they don't want Republicans or Democrats telling them what to do,' Polis told The Hill.
'They value accurate information, they value facts, and people should be empowered to make their own decisions, whether that's marijuana, whether it's wearing a mask — we're a state that values freedom.
