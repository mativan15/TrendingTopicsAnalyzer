Born from the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT phenomenon of digital art collectibles that are procedurally generated and traded for thousands of dollars, Apecoin is a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.Unlike NFTs, which can vary in value from one minute to the next, a single Apecoin has the same value as any other Apecoin and can be traded on a crypto exchange like Bitcoin or other altcoins.The value of Apecoin, like many cryptocurrencies, has gone up and down since its introduction this year. The volatility of crypto assets has led the UK finance watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to issue repeated warnings to would-be investors.
