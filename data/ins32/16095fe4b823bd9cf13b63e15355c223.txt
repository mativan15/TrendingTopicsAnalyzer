Some investors feel pulled to Warren Buffett's stock picks like a magnet, hoping that if they follow his lead, their portfolios might imitate to some degree the wild success of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he runs. But individual investors have different goals and resources when compared to a holding company with a $700 billion market cap, and Buffett's not-necessarily secret recipe is very unlikely to produce the same results for anyone who tries to replicate it.
It does, however, make sense to look at the various stocks he buys and consider whether specific companies make sense for your portfolio.
