Some of the fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. are related to the field of computer science. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that computer science jobs will grow 21% between 2021 and 2031. These in-demand jobs, though, typically require candidates to have a master's degree. As a result, more top universities have decided to offer computer science master's degree programs to meet the growing industry demand. Most recently, the University of Illinois at Urbana—Champaign, which Fortune ranks as having the best online master's in data science program in the country, announced the launch of its professional master of computer science program (MCS) to be hosted in Chicago.
