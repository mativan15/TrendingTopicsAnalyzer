The 'oil piggy bank' is running low — but President Biden says he'll replenish it when prices hit a range of $67 to $72 a barrel. Will the plan work?

President Biden is drawing another 15 million barrels from the U.S. emergency reserves — and 'is prepared to authorize' additional sales in the coming months if needed.

The White House announced on Tuesday that the Department of Energy will deliver more crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to the market in December, in order to drive down prices at the pump.
