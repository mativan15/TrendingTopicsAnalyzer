The Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray hit out at Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and the BJP on Sunday alleging that the BJP is using Shinde and his faction as a 'contract killer' against the Sena.
In the weekly column ‘Rokhthok' in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana', the Sena said, 'There was no problem if Shinde wanted to break away from Shiv Sena and work on his own but Shinde faction is being used as a ‘contract killer' by the BJP but they should know that contract killers have terrible endings. There is still time and they should know when to stop.
