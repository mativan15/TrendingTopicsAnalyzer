TAIPEI: Taiwan's export orders contracted slightly though at a less severe rate than expected in September, coming off a high base and supported by strong sales of new consumer electronics products like iPhones.The government said momentum for the rest of the year would be helped by the year-end holiday season in Europe and the United States, traditionally the high point for export orders. But it highlighted uncertainties like global inflation, the war in Ukraine and China's lockdowns to contain COVID-19.
