The UK government's plans for growth driven by tax cuts lasted just three weeks. In an extraordinary U-turn, new chancellor Jeremy Hunt today announced that he and prime minister Liz Truss would scrap most of the 'mini budget' of Sept. 23 in an attempt to appease financial markets. In some cases, the measures announced today even roll back tax cuts planned by former chancellor Rishi Sunak during the previous Boris Johnson government.'Firstly, we will reverse almost all the tax measures announced in the growth plan three weeks ago,' which have not started yet, Jeremy Hunt, who became chancellor on Friday, said in a video statement.
