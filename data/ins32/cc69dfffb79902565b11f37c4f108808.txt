Oct. 19—Done with work for the day, Jasmine Ross and Antwone D. Thurston II were enjoying the evening of Sept. 26 on the porch of their shared Jeannette home.

They were accompanied by a neighbor, but things turned sour when William Osselburn, 62, of Jeannette joined in, Ross said. Osselburn began arguing with the neighbor over rent money and then started insulting Ross and Thurston when they asked him to leave. Osselburn and Thurston got into an altercation that left Osselburn on the sidewalk, bleeding from stab wounds, Ross said.
