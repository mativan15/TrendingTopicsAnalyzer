Joe Raedle/Getty Images News Costco Q3 Numbers Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is just off the back of announcing its third-quarter earnings numbers where net sales grew by over 16% and net profit (which included a one-off $77 million charge related to the updated employee agreement) increased by approximately 10.7%. The Q3 bottom line number ($1.35 million) is not a bad comparison because there was a similar Covid-19-related charge in the same quarter 12 months prior for the sum of $57 million.
