'Not even tonight were they tipping us – $5 [the betting agencies] were giving us,' said John Aloisi. 'If I could bet – I'm not a betting man, but if I could bet – I would've put so much money on that. They must have lost a shitload of money on that.'Had Aloisi had a bet, he may well have been one of the only souls to wager that Western United would win the A-League Men's grand final. Most did not think it feasible they would make it there in the first place. And, after seeing off defending champions Melbourne City 2-0, the figure with the biggest right to feel vindicated is the club's head coach.
