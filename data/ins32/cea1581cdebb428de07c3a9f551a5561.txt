First lady Jill Biden has insisted her embattled stepson Hunter is 'innocent' and has broken no laws amid an ongoing federal investigation.
'Everybody and their brother has investigated Hunter,' Jill Biden told NBC News in an interview published Friday. 
'They keep at it, and at it, and at it. I know that Hunter is innocent. I love my son, and I will keep looking forward.'
Investigators have reportedly gathered enough evidence to charge the 52-year-old Hunter with potential tax crimes and allegedly lying about his drug abuse so he could buy a gun.
