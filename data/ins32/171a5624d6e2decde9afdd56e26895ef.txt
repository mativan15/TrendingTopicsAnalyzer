A version of the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain will take to the seas on Saturday offering 298 passengers – paying a minimum of £5,020 a week – a cruise holiday designed to ape life on a billionaire's superyacht.Evrima, launched by the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel chain, boasts a restaurant designed by a three-Michelin-starred chef, 'dedicated personal assistants', four pools, a champagne bar, humidor (cigar room), nightclub and even 'non-surgical facelifts'.The yacht will embark on its maiden voyage from Barcelona, Spain, to Nice in France, on 15 October after a three-year delay caused by the Covid pandemic and the supply chain crisis.
