LONDON, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Idexo continues its mission of empowering creative entrepreneurs to create industry-disrupting blockchain applications by greatly simplifying the economic experience of building and growing those projects. By stabilizing the gas cost of running blockchain transactions through its new method credits system, now project founders can plan predictable business models. Before this release, founders and executives had to contend with high gas price volatility in their input costs, meaning something that is profitable one day could be unprofitable the next.
