It's been challenging for investors in Pinduoduo Inc (PDD -3.36%), China's up-and-coming e-commerce platform. In a little over a year, not only did the young company see its founder step down, its market capitalization fell by nearly 75%.
Under such circumstances, it'd be totally understandable to run away from such a stock. But the company's latest quarterly results also provide some good reasons for investors to be optimistic.
