The war in Ukraine, from which millions have fled, has presented neighbouring countries with unprecedented challenges. Since February 2022, more than half a million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border into Bulgaria alone, with some staying and others passing through. To meet their multi-faceted needs and provide coordinated support, the WHO Country Office in Bulgaria has joined forces with Bulgarian civil society, the Government of Bulgaria, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Bulgarian Red Cross and other international non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
