Developers of the Sui Network introduced Mist units for the project's native SUI tokens in a move geared towards more efficient micropayments.

Mist is not a separate token, but functions similar to how 100 cents become $1. Each SUI will be broken up into 1 billion MIST, developers said, allowing for low gas fees while conducting transfers worth a few dollars.
