Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Jackson Financial Inc. (NYSE:JXN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date.
