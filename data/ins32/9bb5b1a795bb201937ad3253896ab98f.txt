Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary D Purandeswari arrived in the state capital on Monday to reiterate the party's booth-level focus, and also to caution the party cadres to guard against complacency. 'Under prime minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has become the world's biggest political party. It is acceptable across castes and communities. Still, you need to guard against complacency,' said Purandeswari, who had earlier represented Bapatla and Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha constituencies in Andhra Pradesh and also served as the Union minister of state for commerce and industry, and human resource development.
