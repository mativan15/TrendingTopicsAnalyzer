PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- An abandoned dog who was injured in a Philadelphia hit-and-run is getting a new lease on life with some high-tech intervention. Prosthetic technology has reached new heights. In July, we first told you about a special team trained at Jefferson that's changing lives for animals.

Now, they're working with a dog who needs a home. He's a bundle of joy, who's full of happy energy in spite of a horrific past.

Only having three legs doesn't seem to bother Rowan, his front leg was amputated after he was hit by a car in Philadelphia and abandoned.
