The integration of DeFi into the crypto landscape is one of its leading innovations and a feature that powers the system's main value proposition, which is decentralization. Daily, we see top DeFi cryptocurrencies contribute immensely to the ecosystem's growth, and Avalanche (AVAX) and Tezoz (XTZ) are two cryptocurrencies doing well in that category.

Avalanche is one of the leading DeFi platforms with a high throughput smart contract system for users, while Tezoz is also a smart contract platform with an on-chain governance protocol.
