All good things must come to an end. That's how the co-founders of Lattice, Jack Altman and Eric Koslow, view employee retention. The San Francisco-based maker of people management software lets its new employees know that Lattice will not be their forever-job. "I always tell all the new hires on literally day two of their onboarding, 'There will come a day that you will want an opportunity that Lattice can no longer provide, and that is okay,'" says Koslow. Indeed, a little more than a month after telling me this, the 31-year-old stepped down from his role as Lattice's CTO to launch VStream, a new company for video creators.
