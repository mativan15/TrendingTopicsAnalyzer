A developer is asking the city of Clayton for feedback on a proposal to build a $50 million, 200-unit mixed-use residential complex with apartments and townhouses, bridging the gap between downtown Clayton and some of the city's more residential neighborhoods.

Clayton-based Keeley Properties is proposing the seven-story complex at 201-215 N. Meramec Ave. and 8015 Pershing Ave., the current site of a vacant lot and a car rental business, according to documents submitted to the city.

The properties add up to about 1.
