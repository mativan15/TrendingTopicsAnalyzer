(Bloomberg) -- Denim maker Levi Strauss & Co. is scaling up investment in its stores and website, as well as women's apparel, to reach a sales target of $9 billion to $10 billion by 2027.

In a new set of strategic targets, Levi now sees sales growth of 6% to 8% annually, up from its prior goal of 4% to 6%. The company also expects its own website and retail stores to generate 55% of annual sales, compared with the 39% they generated in the first quarter.

Levi's revenue was $5.8 billion in the fiscal year ended in November 2021.
