Business leaders have responded with anger and dismay to the UK's political crisis, saying that Liz Truss's replacement must act rapidly to stabilise the crisis-hit economy.The prime minister announced her resignation on Thursday afternoon, after only 45 days in the job, leaving businesses uncertain of the government's plan for policy issues such as the taxes they will pay and the extent of future energy subsidies.Industry bosses have been almost unanimous in their condemnation of recent political turmoil, which they say has caused investment in the UK to stall as economists predict a long recession.
