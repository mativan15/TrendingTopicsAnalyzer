CUSTER, S.D. — A silver minivan decorated with a large sticker reading 'Love Your Neighbor Tour' recently circumnavigated South Dakota.

Catholic nuns, Protestant pastors, a synagogue president and a Muslim nonprofit professional were among the interfaith leaders who packed into the rented six-seater or caravanned behind.

The road trip's mission: to register voters and urge them to support expansion of the state's Medicaid program to cover thousands more low-income adults.
