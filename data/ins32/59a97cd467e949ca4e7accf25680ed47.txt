Contra Costa District Attorney Diana Becton's re-election bid has received a hefty financial boost from billionaire George Soros while her opponent is getting a big lift from law enforcement unions, campaign finance records show.
The June 7 primary race shares themes with other California district attorney elections that featured competing visions for the future of criminal justice and law enforcement accountability. Becton's progressive values have come under fire from her more conservative challenger, Deputy District Attorney Mary Knox.
