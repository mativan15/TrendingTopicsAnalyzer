A mother 'self disconnected' the gas supply to her home due to surging energy prices, an anti-poverty charity has claimed.

Kirsty McKechnie, from Child Poverty in Action Group Scotland, said the woman was still being hit with a standing charge after making the decision to disconnect her gas last year.

She told BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: 'We've already had one parent contact one of the advice agencies who had disconnected, self-disconnected, her gas over a year ago because she was struggling with the prices.
