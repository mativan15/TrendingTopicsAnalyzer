May 27—Following a two-year break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Barton County Tax Sale returns this year, the County Commission decided in January. It takes place at 10 a.m. Oct. 11 at the Great Bend Events Center, 3111 10th St.

The commission approved a resolution authorizing the sale, allowing specified tracts to be sold for back taxes. It also authorized the necessary abstract work be done to prepare for the sale.

As of now, the Treasurer's Office has 158 tracts that would be for sale, said County Counselor Patrick Hoffman, giving the commission an update Wednesday morning.
