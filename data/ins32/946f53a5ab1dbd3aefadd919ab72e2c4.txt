grinvalds fuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) was a stock that I was incredibly bullish on until the start of 2022. This was a massive failure on my part. However, despite my horrendous call, I now attempt to look beyond that and appraise the situation dispassionately. fuboTV preannounces its Q3 earnings and the stock soars by 9%. Today, FUBO is significantly off its summer lows of approximately $2.40. Arguably the most significant takeaway from its Q3 earnings preannouncement is that fuboTV has decided that its Sportsbook should immediately cease operations.
