An Illinois regulatory panel that delayed an approval needed for Advocate Aurora Health to proceed with a proposed business combination with Atrium Health is scheduled to reconvene on the matter Nov. 14.

The Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board in mid-September voted 3-2 to reject a certificate Advocate Aurora needs to create a joint operating agreement with Atrium Health — and then tabled the action. The board sought additional information from Advocate Aurora, which has co-headquarters in Milwaukee and suburban Chicago, before reconsidering a possible approval.
