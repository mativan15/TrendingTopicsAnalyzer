(Reuters) - International Cricket Council (ICC) chair Greg Barclay said women's test matches should be played over five days, but raised doubts over the place of the longer format in the future of women's cricket.

 Women's test matches are played over four days as opposed to five in the men's game, and the five test matches that have been played since 2017 have all ended in a draw. England captain Heather Knight has backed five day-tests and England bowler Kate Cross said women cricketers were fit enough to cope with the physical demands of longer matches after the drawn Ashes test in January.
