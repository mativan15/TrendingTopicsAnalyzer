Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse has added two "space entitlements" and an official craft beer vendor — Great Lakes Brewing Co. — in preparation for the Cleveland Cavaliers' home opener against the Washington Wizards on Sunday.

One of the revenue streams for Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert and his Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse organization is the brand sponsorship of spaces in the publicly owned arena in downtown Cleveland.

This season, the Cavaliers have added luxury car brand Lexus and mobile ticketing platform SeatGeek to the mix, both of which will entitle two existing clubs for the team's premium members, the Cavs said this week.
