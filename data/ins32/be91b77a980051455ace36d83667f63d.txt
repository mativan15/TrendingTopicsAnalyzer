June 1 (Reuters) - Video game retailer GameStop Corp reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as more shoppers bought video games and consoles.

Store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic affected GameStop's physical retail business, for which it is primarily known. The retailer has, however, been focusing on growing its online business to meet consumer demands.

Net loss widened to $157.9 million, or $2.08 per share, for the first quarter, from $66.8 million, or $1.
