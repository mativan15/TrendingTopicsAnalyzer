cagkansayin/iStock via Getty ImagesI've been told that I have the 'curse of the gab' because I'll never pass up the opportunity to express in 1,000 words what it would take a normal man to express in 10. That said, this article's long, even by my standards, so strap in. You may not believe me, but I actually whittled this down quite substantially. I could have droned on about each of the topics below for much, much longer but even my cruelty has limits. I only touch on each of these issues in the article, but I'd be very happy to discuss any particular point in greater depth in the comments section.
