FatCamera Elevator Pitch My investment rating for Teladoc Health, Inc.'s (NYSE:TDOC) stock is a Hold. In my earlier initiation article for Teladoc Health written on July 23, 2021, I touched on TDOC's poor share price performance for the first half of last year, noting that its "current valuations are still demanding." TDOC's stock price subsequently fell by -84.0% in the 15-month period following the publication of my prior article, and this has prompted me to share my thoughts about Teladoc Health again in this new article.
