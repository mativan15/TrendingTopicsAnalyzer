LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Vice President Kamala Harris is set to depart from Los Angeles International Airport aboard Air Force Two Tuesday morning, bound for San Francisco, concluding a four-day visit to Los Angeles that included a discussion on efforts to protect reproductive rights. Harris said Monday Congress will have to act to ensure women's ability to seek an abortion is ensured. "This is about freedom and liberty," Harris said during the event at the Nate Holden Performing Arts Center in the Mid-City area.
