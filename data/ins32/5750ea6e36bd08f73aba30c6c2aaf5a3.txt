When he was growing up, Lincoln-Way Central's Eddie Rafacz always wanted to follow in the footsteps of his dad.

Rafacz would go to indoor soccer games at Hallmark Sports Club in Frankfort to cheer on his father, Martin.

'My dad was the biggest influence on me,' Rafacz said. 'He'd always play in a men's league. At Hallmark, I'd run right up to the glass to watch the games, just hoping it'd be me out there one day.'

Rafacz's day came Tuesday night.

The senior forward/midfielder and captain rose to the occasion in the Knights' playoff opener, scoring twice to lift sixth-seeded Lincoln-Way Central to a 2-1 victory over 11th-seeded Thornton co-op in a Class 3A Reavis Regional semifinal.
