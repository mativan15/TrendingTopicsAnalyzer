Legal & General has been having a tough time of it since Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous mini‑Budget: its shares have lost about a 10th of their value in those four weeks, compared with (for example) 5.6pc for Direct Line, a more bread‑and‑butter insurer, and 4.3pc for the FTSE 100.

It's not hard to see the reason: L&G is involved in the 'liability‑driven investments' that caused such trouble that the Bank of England had to step in with a multi-billion pound rescue package. But this apparent weakness in L&G's business model may, perversely and we might say undeservedly, turn into a strength.
