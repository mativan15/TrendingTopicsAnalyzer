 Researchers have created a new method for fabricating the high-precision, ultrathin mirrors needed for high-performance x-ray telescopes using femtosecond laser pulses. The method might assist advance the capabilities of space-based x-ray telescopes that are used to observe high-energy cosmic phenomena like the formation of supermassive black holes and new stars. "Detecting cosmic x-rays is a crucial piece of our exploration of the universe that unveils the high-energy events that permeate our universe but are not observable in other wavebands," said research team leader Heng Zuo, who performed the research at MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and is now at the University of New Mexico.
