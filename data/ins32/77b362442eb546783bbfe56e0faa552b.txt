Boris Johnson has revealed to a close political ally that he is going to run in the Conservative leadership contest to replace Liz Truss as he seeks a return to Number 10. Tory MP James Duddridge told Sky News' chief political correspondent Jon Craig that he had spoken to the former prime minister, who is reportedly on holiday in the Caribbean, over the phone.
Mr Johnson told his friend he was "up for it", adding: "I'm going to do it, Dudders!" - and he said he would be returning to the UK to take part.
