Jason Pierre-Paul is fairly remarkable. You get the feeling you could wake him from a deep sleep and he would get to the opposing quarterback. The Giants' first-round pick from 2010 is still doing his thing in his 13th NFL season. 
Pierre-Paul spent the first eight years of his NFL career with the Giants, wreaking havoc on the field and enduring some horrific moments off it, most notably permanently damaging his right hand in a fireworks accident. He spent the past four years with the Buccaneers and in 2019 broke his neck in a car accident.
