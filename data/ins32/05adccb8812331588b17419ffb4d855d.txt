Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine discusses proposals to improve school safety in the state following this week's massacre of 19 children and two teachers in a Texas elementary school, on Friday, May 27, 2022, in Columbus, Ohio. The Republican governor's proposals include spending "a significant amount of money" on unspecified safety improvements to school buildings that need them, and dramatically increasing the number of school officials who work with schools on safety issues.
