Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 's traders once again helped rescue results from a sharp slowdown in investment banking just as the firm prepares for a reorganization that will combine the two business units.

The trading operation posted $6.2 billion in third-quarter revenue, an 11% increase that was better than analysts had forecast. Fixed income led the gains, according to a statement Tuesday that showed a 43% profit plunge.
