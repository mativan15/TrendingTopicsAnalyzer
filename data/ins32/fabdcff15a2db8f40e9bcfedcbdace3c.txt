CAMDEN, N.J.–The Philadelphia 76ers are sitting at 0-2 following two extremely tough games to begin the 2022-23 season. They had to face off with the Boston Celtics on opening night and then had to take on the Milwaukee Bucks.
Those are two of the best teams in the league and they have been together for years. They know each other like the back of their hands and they know what to do in clutch situations when the time calls for it.
So far through two games, Matisse Thybulle has been used merely as a defensive substitution.
