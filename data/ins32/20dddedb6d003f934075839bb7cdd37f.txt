Home Depot (HD -2.51%) has been one of the market's best stocks for a long time, delivering monster returns for its shareholders over the years. Even accounting for the stock's 30% year-to-date decline, shareholders enjoyed a phenomenal gain of 350% over the past decade.
Stocks with exposure to housing and home improvement dropped significantly this year as investors consider the impacts of rising mortgage rates and a slowdown in home sales. But that makes this a great time to go hunting for the next Home Depot -- a stock that can do in the decade ahead what that stock did in the last one.
