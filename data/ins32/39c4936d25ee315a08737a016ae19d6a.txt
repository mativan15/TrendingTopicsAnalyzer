The Southern Baptist Convention must do more to aid survivors of sexual abuse by Baptist pastors and laypeople than its Sexual Abuse Task Force recently proposed, a group of survivors said Sunday. The 13.7 million-member denomination should create a perpetual independent commission to process reports of sexual abuse 'directly from survivors, whistle-blowers and others,' the group said.  An independent and publicly accessible database of clergy 'credibly accused' or convicted of abuse should also be maintained, the group said.
