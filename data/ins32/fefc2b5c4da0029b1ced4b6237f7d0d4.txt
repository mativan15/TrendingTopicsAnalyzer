The RBI is set to overhaul the rules governing primary dealers, who act as the vital intermediaries for government borrowings, perhaps for the first time since they came into being in 2005. 'It is proposed to undertake a comprehensive review of the extant operational guidelines for primary dealers,' RBI said in its annual report. The guidelines relating to basic eligibility criteria, viz., net-owned funds (NOF) requirement and targets, remain largely unchanged. The consolidated operational guidelines for PDs issued in 2005 are updated from time to time.
