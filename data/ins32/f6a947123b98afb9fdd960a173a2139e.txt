The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday claimed that the Centre plans to rake up a three-year old case to implicate Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. During a media briefing, senior party leader Atishi claimed that the Centre had given a mandate to all its investigative agencies -- Income Tax, Enforcement Directorate, Delhi Police and CBI -- to start preparing "fake" cases to get Sisodia arrested. She claimed that Satyendar Jain, who had various portfolios, including health and power, was arrested in a case by the Enforcement Directorate "without any new proof".
