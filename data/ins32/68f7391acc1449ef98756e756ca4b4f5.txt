Anti-fossil fuel activists in London sprayed orange paint on the front of Harrods, a luxury department store, and videos of the incident have surfaced online. On the 20th consecutive day of their protest against new oil and gas, about 20 protestors gathered in front of the store.
A video shared on Just Stop Oil's Twitter account showed two agitators spraying paint on the large windows of the store. As the camera pans, the store's windows are seen entirely covered with orange paint. Since being shared on Thursday, the clip has amassed more than 8 lakh views on Twitter.
