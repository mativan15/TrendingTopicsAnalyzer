Jurgen Klopp rejects claims he inflamed Liverpool vs Man City tensions - PA

Jurgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, is taking legal action over media claims he inflamed tensions with alleged xenophobic remarks against Manchester City's owners ahead of his side's 1-0 weekend win over the champions.

Klopp had voiced concerns last Friday about City's spending power compared with rival clubs but said on Tuesday that his remarks were 'misunderstood'.

The enthralling encounter on Sunday saw Klopp receive a red card for berating an assistant referee and yesterday the Football Association charged him with misconduct.
