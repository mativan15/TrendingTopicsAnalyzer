Are you a high-powered stock analyst looking for a new stream of income? Perhaps consider delivering pizza. While it may not qualify as a bona fide recruiting pitch, Domino's CEO Russell Weiner found a unique way to underscore the importance of the pizza giant's franchise system during an Oct. 13 earnings call.  "I would like to spend a few seconds just talking about what it means when we refranchise stores in this particular instance because really, it's what makes Domino's so special," Weiner said.
