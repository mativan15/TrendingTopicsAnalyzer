That's not what's happening at all but it did make a big announcement that might lead you to being able to borrow more money from a bank if you are in the market for a house.The top line is that from January, the amount first-time buyers can borrow as a multiple of their income goes from 3.5 times income to four times income.It's bigger than you might think. It means would-be homeowners will be able to borrow 14 per cent more than they can now, which could be the difference between being able to find a house and being priced out of the market.
