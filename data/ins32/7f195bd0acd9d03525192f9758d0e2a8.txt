The cancellation of lease of 15 acres of land in Pahrawar village of Rohtak, originally granted to a Brahmin body, has not only upset a section of the community but also pitted sitting BJP MP Arvind Sharma against Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana. 
Sharma has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention for a probe in the alleged delay in the restoration of land lease to the Brahmin community that wants to build a temple, school, college and hospital there. 
'The work of giving the land to the community should have been completed in just two hours but was delayed.
