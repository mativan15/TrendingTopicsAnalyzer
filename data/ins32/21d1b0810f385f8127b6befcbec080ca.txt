(Bloomberg) -- Liz Truss's UK premiership looked on the verge of imploding late Wednesday, after a Parliament vote triggered allegations of government bullying and the resignation of two of the prime minister's senior officials.Many Conservative lawmakers now want Truss to resign immediately, rather than wait until after the government announces a new economic plan on Oct. 31. Asked if the government can survive the night, one Tory MP replied: 'I hope not.'Even in the context of Truss's tumultuous six weeks in office, the events in the House of Commons were extraordinary and have turned a vote on whether to ban shale gas fracking -- which the government won by a routine-looking 326 votes to 230 -- into a moment of great political peril.
