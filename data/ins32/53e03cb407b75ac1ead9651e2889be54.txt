I was still in primary school, in sixth class, and I was drinking and experimenting – drinking anything that wasn't too expensive to buy. And taking pills. I was doing everything that wasn't what a normal child would do.I was hanging around in the Clarence Street and Dunne Street flats. Sitting on the wall. There'd be me, Ango, Lizo, Lindsay, Linda, Jade. There'd be boys as well. David and Joe would have been there, and Paul – we called him Batman.We'd have a big radio, a three-in-one, and we'd put CDs in it and tapes, and we'd be listening to Hot FM, an illegal pirate station that played all the best tunes, the best house and dance music.
