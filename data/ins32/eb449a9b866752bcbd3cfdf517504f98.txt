MEXICO CITY -- They traveled the world, crisscrossing the globe to spread a brand new game of baseball to fans new and old. There was music, there was food, and there were so many home runs. 
On Saturday at Mexico City's legendary Campo Marte, the Red Sox, Dodgers, Cubs, and Yankees battled one more time in the grand final. The winner in CDMX would be named the champion of the entire tournament.
After losing in the finals in both London and Seoul, the Red Sox once again played in the finals. Thanks to an amazing performance by Mexico City MVP Award winner Jocelyn Alo -- the all-time NCAA leader in home runs among both men and women -- Boston got its title.
