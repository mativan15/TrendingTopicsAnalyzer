NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street surged and benchmark Treasury yields hit pause on Friday following reports that the Federal Reserve might consider less aggressive inflation-curbing tactics after November.

All three major U.S. stock indexes gathered momentum as the session progressed, remaining on track to post gains from last Friday's close, capping in a week marked by a mixed bag of earnings, soft economic data and political turmoil in the UK.

Risk sentiment was stoked after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said inflation is not becoming embedded in the economy, and also by a Wall Street Journal report that the Fed is likely to consider decreasing the size of its interest rate hikes after its upcoming policy meeting.
