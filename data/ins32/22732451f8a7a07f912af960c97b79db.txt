Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had last week invoked charges under stringent provisions of MCOCA against fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, his brother Anees and Chhota Shakeel and some other members of the gang, including Salim Qureshi aka Salim Fruit. The federal agency wrote to the special court informing about its decision after the senior authorities granted sanction for the same.
