By Australian Associated Press Published: 21:50 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 21:50 EDT, 29 May 2022 Tasmania's push for an AFL team faces its "hardest yards" in convincing club presidents to vote for the bid, Brisbane coach Chris Fagan says. But Fagan believes Tasmania has a compelling case to win an AFL licence at a vote of the 18 club presidents in August. Fagan, a proud Tasmanian, is the latest in a string of high-profile AFL identities to throw his support behind the bid. "When you think of the players that we have contributed to the game, I think it's a no-brainer for me," Fagan has told a podcast organised by the bid.
