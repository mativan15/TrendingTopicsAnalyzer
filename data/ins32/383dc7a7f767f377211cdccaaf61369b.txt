A Denver real estate investor has landed an anchor tenant for a 25-acre technology development and life-sciences campus it has renovated in Longmont, leasing 207,000 square feet in what's considered the biggest lease this year for a Colorado flexible industrial office space.

Broe Real Estate Group and Alvarez & Marsal Capital Real Estate attracted semiconductor and computer memory maker Micron Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: MU) to fill about 43% of a long-vacant tech property.

The Boise-based company already has a presence in Longmont, about 25 miles north of downtown Denver, but the large lease suggests its expansion aims to add several hundred employees.
