It was Monday at San Francisco International Airport, and there was no place to eat.Nor on Tuesday. Or Wednesday. For three days last month, 1,000 food-service workers at SFO went on strike over wages and working conditions. On a typical day, some 130,000 passengers fly through the Bay Area's largest airport, and nearly all of them buy something to eat or drink. But during the walkout, not a food-service creature was stirring at SFO — except, that is, for the robots serving up espressos and green-tea lattes at two automated coffee kiosks with the ominous name Cafe X.
