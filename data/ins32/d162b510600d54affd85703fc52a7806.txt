'Don't send money overseas en masse, because in Colombia there are opportunities,' Petro said Wednesday during a speech in Uraba, a banana-producing region near the border with Panama.

Petro's plea, just two months into his government, comes as Colombian assets dropped amid investor concerns over the agenda of the first leftist president in the history of the Andean nation.
