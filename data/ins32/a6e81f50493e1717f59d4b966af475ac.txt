Greggs, the bakery chain, has won a landmark ruling in its legal battle over a £150 million pound insurance claim triggered by the coronavirus crisis.A High Court judge yesterday backed the majority of the FTSE 250 company's claim for business interruptions caused by the pandemic, in a move that could cost Zurich Insurance tens of millions more than it argued was its liability.Lawyers for Greggs, which employs about 25,000 people across more than 2,200 shops in the UK, said that each outlet suffered some interruption or interference with trading as a result of government lockdowns imposed to combat Covid-19.
