​Former President Donald Trump gave Rep. Lee Zeldin his 'Complete & Total Endorsement' on Sunday, touting the Republican challenger to Gov. Kathy Hochul as 'strong on the Border, Crime, our great Military & Vets.'
'I have watched and known Congressman Lee Zeldin for many years. He is a great and brilliant lawyer who was a ‘must see' for others in Congress when they had a complex legal problem that was holding up legislation,' the 45th commander-in-chief wrote Sunday on the Truth Social media platform.
