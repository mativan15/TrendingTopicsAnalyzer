EA-Land, the service previously known as The Sims Online will shut August 1, despite a much hyped revamp announced late February.
The Sims Online was generally regarded to be a failure for EA, with the company unable to turn the success of The Sims franchise into an online hit. The service wasn't helped by a complete lack of customizable features (outside of the usual Sims customization tools) and EA charged for access.
The new (but now never to be launched) EA-Land was to be EA's second shot of success, and promised Second Life style customization and land ownership, with a free client and free to use service.
