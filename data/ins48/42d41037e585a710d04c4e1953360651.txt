The 2019 Tar Heel Bus Tour was a special one — and not just because of the cool 'Heels on a Bus' shirts the participants wore.
That was the year then-Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz decided to 'go big and go bold' with the annual tradition. Over three days, 90 faculty and administrators traveled 1,600 miles and visited 28 towns on three separate routes — east, west and southeast — crisscrossing the state.
They came back tired but energized, filled with ideas about how they could work with each other and the people they had met across the state to improve the lives of North Carolinians.
