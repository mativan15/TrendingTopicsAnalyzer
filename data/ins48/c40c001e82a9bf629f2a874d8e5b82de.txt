May 28—DODGE CITY — Deputy David Pitts is bringing a more personal approach to his duties within the Cullman County Sheriff's Office, offering the businesses and residents of Dodge City a direct line to law enforcement.

After his service as a security officer in the United States Air Force, Pitts worked for 18 years in a K-9 unit in Florida. This brought about what Pitts describes as "one of the highlights of [his] career" when after five days of extensive efforts all local units had exhausted their efforts to locate a missing person deep in the everglades.
