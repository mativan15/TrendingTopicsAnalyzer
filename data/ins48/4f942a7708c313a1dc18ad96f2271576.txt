The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the Centre to immediately stop giving money, funds or other assistance to national sports federations (NSFs) that have till now not complied with the requirements of the National Sports Development Code of India, 2011. 'No money will go henceforth to any entity which does not comply with the Sports Code. That is the long and short of it. What is suffering is the rule of law,' the high court ordered while hearing a petition filed by senior advocate and sports activist Rahul Mehra, to ensure the compliance with the Sports Code by the NSFs.
