juankphoto/iStock via Getty Images There are things we like about The Vita Coco Company (NASDAQ:COCO), such as the fact they are a B Corporation (Public Benefit Corporation). The way they went public, however, is something we disapprove of. We believe they went public at an inflated valuation, and most of the shares were offered by selling shareholders and not to the benefit of the company itself. Shares are now trading significantly below the IPO price, and we do not see any catalysts or reasons for shares to recover in the short/medium term.
