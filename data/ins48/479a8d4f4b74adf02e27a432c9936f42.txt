Kate Garraway has thrown her support behind Dame Judi Dench after the screen icon wrote an open letter requesting that the new season of The Crown carries a ‘factual disclaimer'. 
Season five of the popular period drama, which recounts key moments in the history of the British Royal Family, will debut on Netflix in November. 
It will come just two months after the death of Queen Elizabeth II which thrust King Charles III and the rest of the royals under the spotlight during their period of mourning.
