Three months after declaring he was 'fully committed' to the PGA Tour, Dustin Johnson is among 42 players in the field for next week's LIV Golf Invitational, which offers a $25 million in prize money that's backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. It was his damaging remarks in February that led to Johnson and other top players to say they would stay on the PGA Tour. The LIV Golf Invitational is scheduled for June 9-11 at Centurion Club outside of London.
