Mortgage approvals in the UK fell in April to the lowest level since June 2020 as higher interest rates and the cost of living squeeze cooled people's desire to buy homes with a mortgage. Mortgages approved last month slid to 65,974, from 69,531 in March, the lowest level since the height of the first wave of the pandemic when 40,706 mortgages were initiated, according to Bank of England data published on Tuesday. Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the housing market had previously remained relatively immune to higher rates and the real income shock but these figures showed slowing demand.
