Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel today called on companies doing business with Kanye West to end their relationships with the outspoken rapper. West has been making the media rounds following his infamous 'Death Con 3' tweet (see below), doubling down on his claims of alleged mistreatment by Jewish people. In a Financial Times op-ed response, Emanuel wrote, 'Those who continue to do business with West are giving his misguided hate an audience. There should be no tolerance anywhere for West's anti-Semitism,' Emanuel wrote in a Financial Times piece.
