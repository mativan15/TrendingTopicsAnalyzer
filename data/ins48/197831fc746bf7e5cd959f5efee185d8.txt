NEW YORK — A shift in the Biden administration's border policy seems to have stanched the flow of Latin American asylum-seekers coming to New York City, Mayor Eric Adams said Thursday — just as the city brings online costly emergency shelters.

'It's clear that we navigated through this storm,' Adams said at an unrelated press briefing. 'We don't believe we're there yet, but we need to really look at how this administration dealt with a real crisis.'

Migrants have been coming to New York by the thousands — many sent by GOP Texas Gov.
