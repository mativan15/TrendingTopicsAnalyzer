By National CineMedia Inc., which runs advertisements on movie-theater screens, missed an interest payment that was due to bondholders on Oct. 15 and plans to make it belatedly as it struggles with the rest of the cinema industry to recover from a pandemic downturn, people familiar with the matter said. The company missed the roughly $11 million payment to help it satisfy a near-term liquidity requirement at the end of this month, but still plans to pay within the next couple of weeks, the people said.
