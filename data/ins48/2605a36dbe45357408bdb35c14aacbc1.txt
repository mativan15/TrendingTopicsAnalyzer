NicoElNino An Intro To Arthur J. Gallagher If we look at a technical chart of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (NYSE:AJG), we can see that the insurance company continues to make higher highs and higher lows. Furthermore, AJG is trading close to the lows of its range which may entice swing traders to put long deltas to work here on the upside on a convincing swing. From a stock trader or options trader standpoint (liquidity allowing), the play here would be to simply buy the stock or put on something like a call debit spread once we get a convincing swing above the stock's 10-day moving average.
