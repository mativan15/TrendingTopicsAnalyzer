Razer is getting into the gaming handheld market with a new portable device, dubbed the Razer Edge. Able to stream cloud games and play mobile games natively, the company calls it the 'world's first dedicated 5G gaming device.' It boasts an impressive screen and comes with an updated version of the Razer Kishi V2 controller.
Like the recently released Logitech G Cloud Gaming Handheld, the Razer Edge takes a stab at the growing cloud gaming market with a standalone portable device. Razer plans to release two separate versions of the handheld: a $400 Wi-Fi version set to launch in January and a first-of-its-kind 5G edition.
