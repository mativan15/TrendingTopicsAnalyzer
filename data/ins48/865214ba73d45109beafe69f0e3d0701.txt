David Martindale is looking forward to his side's trip to face Rangers at Ibrox given VAR will be in operation.T﻿he Livingston boss believes the teams with the bigger supports tend to "help make the referee's mind up". "It's the referee's impulses, I don't think they are biased. I just think when there are 8,000 [away fans at Livingston's home games] or 50-60,000 fans calling for a foul, the balance of probability falls in their favour rather than ours," said Martindale."So I am quite happy to be going to Ibrox with VAR in place to be honest.
