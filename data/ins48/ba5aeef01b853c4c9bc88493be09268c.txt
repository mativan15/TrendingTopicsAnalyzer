Amazon's Prime subscription is great if you order a lot from the e-commerce platform. It offers early access to deals, faster delivery options on some products and also complimentary access to Amazon Prime Video, Amazon's own streaming platform that hosts a range of movies and TV shows like Panchayat, a tale of an engineering graduate working as a Panchayat secretary in a remote village.
Getting an Amazon Prime subscription has become a little more expensive since 2021 after Amazon hiked the price of membership from Rs 999 per year to Rs 1499 per year.
