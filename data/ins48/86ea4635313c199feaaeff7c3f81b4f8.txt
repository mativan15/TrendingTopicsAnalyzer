An analysis suggests Canada is using questionable methods to dramatically underestimate greenhouse gas emissions from the forestry industry, which it says equal those from Alberta's oilsands in some years."Canada is taking credit for carbon removal from vast forests that have never been logged as a way of masking emissions," said Michael Polanyi of Nature Canada, which co-sponsored the report.The report released Tuesday, also sponsored by the Natural Resources Defense Council, uses federal data and methodology to attempt to find out how much carbon is emitted by Canada's forestry sector.
