Former prime minister and opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu will be acquitted from accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust for which he is currently standing trial, Religious Zionism Party (RZP) leader MK Bezalel Smotrich said in a press conference on Tuesday.

Smotrich made the comment during a press conference in which he and party member MK Simcha Rothman presented their plan for "restarting" Israel's judicial system. The plan includes canceling the fraud and breach of trust offense, but this will not apply to Netanyahu, Smotrich said.
