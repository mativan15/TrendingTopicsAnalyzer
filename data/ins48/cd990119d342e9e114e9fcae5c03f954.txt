TORONTO, Oct. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - XNET, a new Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) provider and operator and BLiNQ Networks, a pioneer manufacturer of CBRS-ready and multiband wireless broadband solutions, have partnered to bring true mobile wireless connectivity to customers and businesses using blockchain technology and the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).  
XNET's DeWi model is remarkably different from others in the space, bringing full-service carrier features like voice, SMS, e911 and data rather than focusing primarily on data connectivity.
