Shares of Chewy (CHWY 23.61%) were trading up 24% as of 1:08 p.m. ET on Thursday. The leading pet e-commerce retailer delivered better-than-expected sales, but management reiterated its previous full-year guidance.
Slowing sales growth over the last year can be blamed for the steep slide in the share price. Even after the post-earnings pop, the stock is down 50% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's fall of just 13%.
