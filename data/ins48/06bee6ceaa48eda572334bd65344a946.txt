On Wednesday, Saints coach Dennis Allen called the starting quarterback a 'game-time decision.' It's still a few hours from game time, but the Saints apparently have made their decision.

Ed Werder of ESPN reports that Andy Dalton will start 'as expected' against the Cardinals in Thursday Night Football.

Jameis Winston, though, will dress as the No. 3 quarterback.

Dalton was limited Monday and Tuesday with a back injury but practiced fully Wednesday.
