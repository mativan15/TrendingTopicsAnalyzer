A key factor driving political polarization in the United States today is religion — not what religion you are, but how religious you are.

Here's the paradox: Americans have been losing their religion for years.

The Pew Research Center reports that 'the country has been growing less religious over time,' evidenced by a decline in the share of the population identifying as 'Christian' from about 90 percent in the early 1990s to a little over 60 percent in 2022, plus a growing number of Americans who claim no religious affiliation (those with 'no religion,' atheists and agnostics now total about 30 percent).
