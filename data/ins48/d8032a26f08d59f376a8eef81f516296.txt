Variety - TV News Former 'The Real Housewives of New York City' star Dorinda Medley is staying mum on whether she's apart of Bravo's mysterious 'Rhony: Legacy' spinoff, but she's open to the idea.'I swear to you, you know as much as we do. I promise you,' Medley told Variety at BravoCon. 'I've heard more about the new girls [on the rebooted ‘Rhony'] than I have about ‘Legacy.' Listen, if you hear something, call me! I'll be at Blue Stone Manor waiting, decorating for Halloween.
