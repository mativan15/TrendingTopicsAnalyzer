Marcus Lindstrom Prologis, Inc (NYSE:PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, just reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. With shares already down nearly 40% YTD, double the losses in the broader S&P 500, much already seemed priced-in prior to the earnings release. Yet, shares dipped another 3.5% following disappointing guidance. Though the stock is still off their 52-week lows, they are trading at early 2021 pricing. This is despite reporting over +$1.0B in adjusted funds from operations ("FFO") during the quarter, a feat not achieved in earlier periods.
