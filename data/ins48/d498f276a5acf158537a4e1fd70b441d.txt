Governor Kathy Hochul and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer today announced the signing of the formal Record of Decision for the Interstate 81 Viaduct Project in Syracuse, which will allow the Community Grid Alternative to proceed with construction beginning this fall.  As part of the $2.25 billion project, the existing elevated structure that has divided the City of Syracuse for decades and disproportionately impacted residents of color will be replaced by a new Business Loop 81 with an integrated Community Grid that will disperse traffic along local north-south and east-west streets.
