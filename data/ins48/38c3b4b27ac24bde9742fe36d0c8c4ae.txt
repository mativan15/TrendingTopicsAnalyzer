Stephen Graham might be one of the most recognisable actors on TV but one of his confused co-stars from The Walk In genuinely thought he was Craig from Big Brother.
Craig Phillips won Big Brother in 2000, its first ever winner, and while he's a reality TV icon he has no place being on the set of the gripping ITV thriller.
Regardless, one the actors in The Walk In thought Craig was ‘doing really well for himself' by landing the lead in a massive new show.
Stephen appeared on The Graham Norton which airs tonight and revealed his case of mistaken identity.
