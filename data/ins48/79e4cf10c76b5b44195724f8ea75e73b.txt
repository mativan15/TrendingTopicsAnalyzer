Dane Evans and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats did more than just exorcise a few demons with last week's road win in Calgary. They also reclaimed control of their playoff destiny.Evans's seven-yard TD pass to Tim White with 22 seconds remaining rallied Hamilton to a 35-32 win over Calgary, its first at McMahon Stadium since ‘04. More importantly, it moved the Ticats (6-10) ahead of idle Saskatchewan (6-10) in the battle for the final East Division playoff spot.Hamilton can cement a post-season berth with a home win over Ottawa (4-12) on Friday night and Calgary victory over Saskatchewan on Saturday night.
