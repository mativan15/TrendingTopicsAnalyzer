Movie star Anna May Wong will be the first Asian-American to be featured on a US coin. 
Wong will appear on the back of a quarter as part of the US Mint's American Women Quarters Program, with coins set to be shipped in 2023 through 2025.
According to the US Mint, Wong's career spanned across motion pictures, television, and theater, leaving a 'lasting legacy' for Asian-American women in the entertainment industry. Many consider her Hollywood's first Chinese American movie star.
Wong will appear on the reverse side of the quarter coin, with the design showing a close-up picture of her head in her hand, surrounded by bright lights.
