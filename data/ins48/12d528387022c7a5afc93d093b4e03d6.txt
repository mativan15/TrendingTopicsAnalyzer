The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Delhi Minister Satyendar Jain in connection with a money laundering case on May 30, officials said. The agency had said last month that assets worth ₹4.81 crore of Mr. Jain's family and companies "beneficially owned and controlled" by him were provisionally attached as part of a money laundering probe against him. In 2018, the ED had questioned the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader in connection with the case.
