BELOIT − The last time the Fire Department sought additional tax money was 2009.

The 26-member volunteer department is asking voters to consider a 6-mill, additional tax levy on the Nov. 8 ballot for operational expenses.

If approved, the permanent tax would generate about $59,463 annually. It would cost $210 a year per $100,000 in property valuation.

"We go after as many grants and donations as we can, and we try to save money in any way we can," said Assistant Fire Chief Greg Hutton.
