Rachel Reeves reacted to the Chancellor's plan against the soaring inflation which would see households on middle income receiving the same amount of money as 'millionaires with multiple houses'. In light of the new measures, Ms Reeves claimed the plan 'has been rushed through because the Prime Minister needed better headlines after partygate stories'.Speaking at TalkTV, Ms Reeves said: 'It is a massive issue.'But it shouldn't have been designed like this.'And it's something about the fact that this has been rushed.
