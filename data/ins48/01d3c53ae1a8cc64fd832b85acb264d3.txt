Chinese President Xi Jinping opened the Communist Party's congress on Sunday with an ominous warning that China would not be 'deterred by intimidation' or 'cowed by pressure' from other global powers.Xi is expected to be handed a precedent-shattering third term at the event, further solidifying his status as the most powerful Chinese ruler since Mao Zedong.Speaking for almost two hours as the congress commenced, Xi said China's 'international influence, appeal and power to shape the world' had increased 'significantly' since delegates last met five years ago.
