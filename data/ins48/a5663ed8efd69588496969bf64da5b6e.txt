The official All-American teams aren't going to be announced until much later in the year, but with the 2022 college football season now at the midway point, it makes sense for a lot of outlets to be taking stock of what we've seen so far.

One of the outlets doing that is The Athletic, who put out their votes for the All-American first and second team at the midway point of the season. While not refined to specific conferences, it's impressive to see how many members of the Pac-12 got the nod, as the conference experiences a bit of a positive regression in 2022 after a dismal few years.
