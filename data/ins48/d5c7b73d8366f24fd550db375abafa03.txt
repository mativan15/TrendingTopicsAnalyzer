Sometimes it's better to do less. There's plenty of room for disruption in the real estate industry, but the partners at Presidio Bay Ventures say some startups in the industry are doing too much.

K. Cyrus Sanandaji and Kabir Seth founded Presidio Bay as a real estate development firm in 2012, and have also been investing in startups for more than a decade. They were early investors in smart lock and building management company Latch (its stock has cratered more than 90% since its IPO, trading below $1 as of Monday) and failed co-living startup Starcity.
