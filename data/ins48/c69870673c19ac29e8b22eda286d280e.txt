Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller asked residents to support a nearly $15 million tax increase during a speech Monday night and outlined a sweeping plan to boost funding for the city's schools and senior services, plus make greater investments in roads, parks, and school building projects.The proposal, which Fuller hopes to put before Newton voters on the ballot next spring, would ultimately increase taxes by about $470 a year for a single-family home assessed at the city's median value of $1.2 million.
