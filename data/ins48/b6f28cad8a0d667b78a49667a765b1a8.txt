The Bank of England has denied making a decision to further postpone plans to start selling government bonds in an attempt to allow battered gilt markets to recover following the mini-budget chaos.Senior officials at the central bank were reported to have decided to delay the plan to offload at the end of this month some of its £838 billion of UK government bonds – or gilts – bought under the so-called quantitative easing programme.As part of its emergency bond-buying action launched late last month, the Bank said it would postpone this plan – known as quantitative tightening (QT) – from October 3 until the end of October.
