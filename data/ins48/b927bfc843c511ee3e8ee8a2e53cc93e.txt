The Labour leader started writing his long essay, now published as a Fabian Society pamphlet, when he was travelling the country this year, talking to people whose votes the party had lost.He claims to have sensed that Boris Johnson's appeal was beginning to wear thin, and that people were prepared to look again at Labour, so he tried to set out the kind of argument that might win them back.The pamphlet begins by declaring: 'People in this country are crying out for change.' He sets out where the country went wrong in the 'lost decade' of the 2010s; what it learnt about 'the power of people working together' during the pandemic; and the choice for the future.
