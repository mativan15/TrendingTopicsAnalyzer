 MEXICO CITY — A Mexican judge issued an injunction against bullfighting in Mexico City on Friday, and ordered a hearing on whether to ban the practice. The constitutional injunction orders that no fights be held until after a hearing early June. It is not clear whether the suspension in late May and early June would affect any fights. Bull fights were apparently scheduled at the city's main professional ring in July and September. Since 2013, four states in Mexico have already banned bull fights, and polls indicate substantial support for a ban.
