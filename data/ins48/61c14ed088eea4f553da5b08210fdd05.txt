Gemini Trust Co. provided bitcoin pricing to Cboe Global Markets Inc., which launched a bitcoin futures product in December 2017. An auction run by Gemini determined how the bitcoin contract would settle on its final day before expiration, ensuring a tight link between the futures and the market for bitcoin itself.
