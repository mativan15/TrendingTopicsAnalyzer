abuja, nigeria — 
Rights group Amnesty International says more than 40 people arrested in Nigeria during the 2020 protests against a controversial police unit are still in jail two years later without having been convicted of any charges.
Amnesty's report, released as part of the second anniversary of the massive youth-led protests against police brutality in Nigeria, said arbitrary arrests and detentions by police have continued unabated in the country. It said authorities have attempted to justify the detentions by resorting to trumped-up charges, including theft, arson, possession of unlawful firearms and murder.
