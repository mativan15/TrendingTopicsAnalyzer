Eve Sleep has called in administrators after failing to find a buyer for the business and has warned that shareholders are unlikely to see any payout from its collapse.The mattress maker has drafted in administrators from Kroll Advisory after facing an 'economic tsunami' that has seen its share price plunge by more than 80 per cent this year.Eve Sleep won the backing of Neil Woodford, the disgraced former investment star, ahead of its stock market flotation in 2017 when his now-defunct investment management company took a 31 per cent stake in the business.
