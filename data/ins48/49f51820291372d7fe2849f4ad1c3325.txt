joebelanger One gold and silver mining stock getting little positive attention in the second half of 2022 is Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE). Expensive mining costs vs. major miners, share issuance earlier in the year to help finance its Rochester mine expansion, and sliding precious metals pricing have hammered the share price back near the lows of 2019-20. However, I find plenty to like about the company including a diversified list of mines in the top mining jurisdictions of the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
