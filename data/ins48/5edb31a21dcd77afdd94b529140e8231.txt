Yes, WhatsApp will soon stop working on some Apple iPhones. Know if yours is on the list.  Do you still use an older iPhone model? If yes, then you are in big trouble. Your iPhone might lose WhatsApp support soon. In effect, that means you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your iPhone. The Meta owned instant messaging platform is dropping its support from some of the VERY old iPhone models. WhatsApp will drop support for all those iPhones using iOS 10 and iOS 11 versions- the date is sometime in October 2022.
