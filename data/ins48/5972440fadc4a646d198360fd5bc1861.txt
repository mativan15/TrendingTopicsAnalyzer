In September 2020, our CEO Chuck Robbins, challenged us to think radically different about Cisco's role and to take bold and deliberate actions in support of social justice. With our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All as our north star, we embarked on a remarkable journey that has brought us to where we are today.

This September marks our two-year milestone since establishing Cisco's Social Justice Beliefs and Actions backed by a 5-year $300 million commitment.
