The UK Government is taking immediate steps to deter and penalise Chinese recruitment of British military pilots.

We are taking immediate steps to deter and penalise this activity," tweeted the Ministry of Defence Press Office on October 1801:2703:4900:4301:3401:3803:5400:5203:3701:0702:1304:2102:0701:4404:2103:3902:3601:3801:3701:3402:0201:0300:5601:0702:4202:0
