One of North Carolina's most recognizable homes is on the market.

The oceanfront property served as a backdrop for the central love story in the 2008 movie "Nights in Rodanthe," based on a Nicholas Sparks novel by the same name and starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane. It's in the tiny village of Rodanthe on Hatteras Island.

Known as The Inn at Rodanthe, it's actually a single-family home that's most recently been used as a vacation rental.

Spanning 2,933 square feet over multiple levels, the six bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom house has been decorated to match the film, according to a vacation-rental website.
