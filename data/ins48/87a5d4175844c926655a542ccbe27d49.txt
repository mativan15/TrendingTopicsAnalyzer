PosterWith a new season, Tripling and the trio of on-screen brothers Chandan, Chanchal, and Chitvan are back. This one is more of an emotional roller coaster than the one known for unexpected turns, amusing situations, and comedy. The third season of Tripling opens with Chandan, the oldest child, learning that his parents have decided to split. To his estranged siblings Chanchal and Chitvan, he becomes the bearer of bad news. They must manage this so they set out on their journey to their parent's house, which they won't be taken by road this time.
