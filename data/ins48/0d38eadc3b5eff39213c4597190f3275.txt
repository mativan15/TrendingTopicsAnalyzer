The royal train's "days must be numbered", a royal financial expert has warned. David McClure broke down the monarchy's accounts in 2021, after they were released for the annual Sovereign Grant Report. He explained to Mail Plus' Palace Confidential why the transport was "not really financially viable" for the Queen anymore.Mr McClure said at the time: "William and Kate on one single rail journey to Scotland spent £49,000."Interestingly it was the only time the royal train was used this year."Last year it was only used three times.
