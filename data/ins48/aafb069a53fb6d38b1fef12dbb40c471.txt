Nate Chastain, a former high-ranking employee of dominant nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, has been indicted for fraud and money laundering in a case federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York characterize as 'insider trading in Non-Fungible Tokens.' 
In 2021, Chastain, then the head of product, was in charge of selecting what NFTs would appear on OpenSea's homepage.
