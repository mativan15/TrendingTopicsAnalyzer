Launch and expansion of approximately 163 hotel projects such as Radisson and Hyatt as envisaged by 2030, is expected to act as a catalyst for the increased demand of fitness equipment required at their respective fitness facilities.
Consumers shifting preference towards availing digital fitness services followed by the advent of COVID-19 will positively contribute in accelerating the demand of home based fitness equipment such as yoga mats, resistance bands and dumbbells along with exercise bike, elliptical and treadmills in coming years.
