"First class will not exist on the 777, or for that matter at American Airlines, for the simple reason that our customers aren't buying it," American Airlines's chief commercial officer Vasu Raja said during an investor call, according to Business Insider. Instead, the airline will focus on selling business class seats and the airline's new "Flagship Suites," which feature seats that recline into a bed and a door to provide privacy.
