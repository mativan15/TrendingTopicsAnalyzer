In the cavernous basement of Sabathani Community Center in south Minneapolis, two massive, 50-year-old boilers are undergoing maintenance before another long winter.

Thelma and Louise, as the boilers are known, are the primary heat sources for the city's original African American community center. Sabathani spends about $20,000 annually just getting the machines prepped for winter, building manager Jesus Dominguez said.

The nearly 100-year-old building had an Energy Star rating of zero when Sabathani conducted an audit in 2019.
