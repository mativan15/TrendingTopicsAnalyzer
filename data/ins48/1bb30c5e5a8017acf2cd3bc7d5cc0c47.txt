Britain's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, has announced that 'almost all' of the tax cuts set out in the government's mini-budget less than a month ago will be reversed.

Hunt, appointed chancellor on Friday after Prime Minister Liz Truss sacked his predecessor after just 38 days, announced plans to tackle the government's deficit, two weeks earlier than planned, in an effort to calm markets.

He warned that no government could control markets, but every government 'can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances'.
