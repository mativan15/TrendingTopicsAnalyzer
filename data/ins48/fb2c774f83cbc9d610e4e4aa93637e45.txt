Union Minister Kiren Rijiju while speaking to media persons at the All India Conference of Law Ministers and Law Secretaries on October 15 said that they will see if laws are relevant to the current scenario . He said, 'We will see if all laws are relevant to the current scenario, even from point of view of business and people's way of life. We will take suggestions from all Law Ministers and take the collective decision.' 'We spoke about the Mediation Bill where if there's a problem between a husband and wife, they can appoint a mediator to solve the problem as court procedures are very long and many people are even scared of going to court,' he further added.
