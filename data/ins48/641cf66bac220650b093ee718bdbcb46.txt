Real Madrid and Barcelona are two of three clubs, along with Juventus, campaigning for the Super League - AFP/File Paris (AFP) – The new CEO of the company promoting the Super League, German businessman Bernd Reichart, says European football must hold talks to reshape its future and warns it is "becoming unsustainable" under the current system. Reichart, the 48-year-old former boss of the RTL media group in Germany, was on Wednesday appointed head of A22 Sports Management."European football needs an open and honest dialogue about its future," Reichart told AFP, 18 months on from the botched attempt at a breakaway 12-team Super League designed to supplant the UEFA Champions League.
