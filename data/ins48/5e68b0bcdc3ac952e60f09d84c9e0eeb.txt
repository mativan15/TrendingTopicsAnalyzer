Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb didn't break his ankle in Sunday's loss to the Jets, but he did suffer an injury that will keep him out of action for a while.

Head coach Matt LaFleur said on Monday that the team expects Cobb to miss multiple weeks as a result of the injury, which happened when players rolled into his legs at the end of a play in the third quarter.

'It's not going to be like a one-week deal or anything like that; I think he's going to miss some time,' LaFleur said, via Rob Demovsky of ESPN.
