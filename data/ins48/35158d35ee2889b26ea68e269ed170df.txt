The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have kept their children's lives relatively private, but what do we know about them as parents?According to parenting expert Gifty Enright, 'we are all fascinated by celebrity mums, and you could hardly get a bigger celebrity mum than the Duchess of Sussex'.As Meghan made her return to the UK earlier this week, all eyes have been on her, her husband, and her children.
