HOUSTON — Matt Carpenter provided a huge boost to the offense when he signed with the Yankees in May. 
After fracturing his left foot in August, the Yankees hoped to get him back for the postseason. 
They did, but he has yet to do anything for the lineup. 
Carpenter whiffed in two pinch-hit appearances in the ALDS before fanning four times in his first start since the injury in Game 1. 
Aaron Boone turned to the lefty-swinging Carpenter again Thursday with two outs in the top of the ninth and the tying run on first after Josh Donaldson walked and was replaced by pinch-runner Tim Locastro.
