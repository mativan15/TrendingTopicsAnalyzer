An injured woman froze to death in a cemetery after PCSOs called off a search to find in her in less than 10 minutes.

Officers from Humberside Police didn't step foot outside of their car to look for Jacqueline Parsons, 56, as she lay dying in Western Cemetery in Hull, East Yorkshire, on 27 October, 2018.

Ms Parsons had fallen off her bike and injured herself, prompting a passer-by to call police from home as he didn't have a mobile and feared she'd be locked in overnight.
