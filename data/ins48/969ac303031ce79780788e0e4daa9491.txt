This November, two conservative counties in Oregon will vote on ballot measures that could someday change the map of the western US.

The initiatives propose merging large swathes of rural, conservative-leaning eastern Oregon with its neighbouring state to form 'Greater Idaho.'

'It makes more sense for Eastern Oregonians to get state-level governance coming from Idaho, where they share their values, share their culture, share their politics than it does to be governed by Western Oregon,' a spokesman for the movem, Matt McCaw, told Fox News.
