 We're urging the federal government to make flying more accessible and comfortable for people with disabilities by requiring accessible bathrooms on all new single-aisle planes with more than 125 seats.'It is long past time to apply this requirement to single-aisle aircraft and ensure that travelers with disabilities are afforded the opportunity to use aircraft lavatories in a safe and dignified manner,' David Certner, AARP legislative counsel and legislative policy director, wrote in a letter to the Department of Transportation on Friday, noting that accessible restrooms are already required on two-aisle planes.
