PM pledges deregulation to promote flexibility in labor market SEOUL, Oct. 19 (Yonhap) -- Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said Wednesday that the government will continue to push for deregulation and structural reforms in a bid to promote flexibility in the labor market. The government "will not neglect regulatory improvement and structural reforms for labor market flexibility," Han said at a job fair in Seoul. Han said the government will help the private sector create sustainable jobs, instead of focusing on short-term jobs created by fiscal spending.
