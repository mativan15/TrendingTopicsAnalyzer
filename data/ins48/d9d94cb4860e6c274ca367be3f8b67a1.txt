Rep. Madison Cawthorn belatedly disclosed suspected cryptocurrency transactions that earlier this month led the House Ethics Committee to open an investigation for his possible promotion of crypto he secretly owned. Cawthorn, 26, revealed Friday he bought between $100,001 and $250,000 worth of "Let's Go Brandon" cryptocurrency eight days publicly suggesting on Dec. 29 that its price would "go to the moon." A day later, the dollar value of that crypto — which is named after a derogatory phrase about President Joe Biden — soared 75% on news of its sponsorship deal with a NASCAR driver.
