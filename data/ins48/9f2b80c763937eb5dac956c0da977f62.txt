ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkey's main opposition party will apply to the Constitutional Court to request annulment of a media law that would jail people for spreading "disinformation" and which it has described as unprecedented censorship, the party leader said on Tuesday.

The law, proposed by President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party (AKP) and its nationalist allies, was approved by parliament on Thursday and published in the country's Official Gazette on Tuesday, completing the legislative process.
