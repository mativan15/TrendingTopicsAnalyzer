In the Lenovo ThinkPad range, the X1 Carbon Gen 10 is cleverly pitched to businesses looking to spend decisively on hardware but aren't ready to indulge their staff with expensive mobile workstations.That might suggest that this is a more affordable machine, but it's still a significant chunk of change to blow on equipment that could easily be trashed by careless handling.Where there was more commonality between the previous X1 Carbon and its predecessor, this hardware is almost an entirely new machine where every aspect has been either uprated or replaced.
