The Wrap John Oliver returned to a subject he's talked about before on Sunday night's episode of 'Last Week Tonight': trans rights. The late night host debunked 'heartbreakingly stupid' theories being used to attack trans kids around the country, including the idea that they are identifying as trans simply as part of a massive cheating scandal.In discussing the war on trans rights, Oliver specifically highlighted how many lawmakers are attempting to pass legislation to keep transgender kids out of school sports, claiming that trans women have a biologically unfair advantage over cisgender women.
