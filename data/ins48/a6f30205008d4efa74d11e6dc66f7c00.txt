Pulitzer-winning photojournalist Sanna Irshad Mattoo was barred from flying out of India's New Delhi airport on Wednesday. Mattoo was attempting to fly to New York to receive her Pulitzer Prize in feature photography with Reuters.
Mattoo, 28, said in a series of tweets that she was barred from leaving the country by Indian immigration officers and informed that her ticket had been "canceled without prejudice." Authorities did not offer further explanation.
This is the second time the Kashmir journalist has been barred from leaving the country this year.
