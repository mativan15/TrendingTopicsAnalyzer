'India's voice on the global stage can only gain in authority and credibility from a strong commitment to inclusive human rights also at home,' United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stated during a recent visit to India. He said that India, as the historical leader of the non-violent anti-colonial struggle, should condemn hate speech 'unequivocally,' and 'protect and promote rights of all individuals including members of minority communities.' Guterres notably stressed this concern even as he praised India for its humanitarian actions and sought support from one of the world's largest economies for debt relief and to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda.
