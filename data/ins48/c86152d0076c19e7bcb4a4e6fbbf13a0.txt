The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) on Sunday termed the 2022 Global Hunger Index report 'irresponsible and mischievous' and urged the Union government to take action against its publishers for 'defaming' India.
India was ranked 107 out of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2022, much behind its South Asia neighbours, with the child wasting rate at 19.3 per cent, the highest in the world. The report was recently released by the Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, non-government organisations from Ireland and Germany respectively.
