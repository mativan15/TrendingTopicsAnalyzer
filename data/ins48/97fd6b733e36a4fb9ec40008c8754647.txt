Back in 2014, the race for the Pinellas County Commission's countywide District 2 seat was a down-to-the-wire drama, featuring two candidates awash in campaign money and the partisan makeup of the board hanging in the balance.

Pat Gerard, then the mayor of Largo, won, securing the first Democratic majority on the County Commission in 50 years. Gerard and her Republican opponent, then-state Rep. Ed Hooper, had combined to raise more than $440,000 in campaign contributions, a figure that Gerard recalls marking a record for a Pinellas commission race.
