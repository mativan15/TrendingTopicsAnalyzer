The actor-wrestler Dwayne Johnson has been focusing on "Black Adam" for a considerable amount of time; in fact, he was first considered for the part more than 15 years ago. But Teth-Adam (Johnson) has now taken off in order to alter the power structure in the DC Extended Universe, as the actor has emphasised in the weeks leading up to the movie's Friday release.

Teth-Adam, who shares some abilities with Shazam (Zachary Levi), approaches super heroism very differently. Mostly because he isn't hesitant to go over the line and kill opponents to protect the Kahndaq people.
