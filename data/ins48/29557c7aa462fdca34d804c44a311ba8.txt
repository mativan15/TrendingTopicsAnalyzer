San Antonio-based My Education Solutions LLC is moving forward after reaching a settlement over a lawsuit filed by Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton 's office.

The settlement, reached in September, ended a more than two-year process for the student loan forgiveness resource, which started on June 12, 2020.

'We are happy to put this lawsuit behind us so that we can focus on providing valuable services to our clients who rely on us to help navigate shifting federal loan forgiveness program requirements,' said My Education Solutions President and CEO Christina Randell in a news release.
