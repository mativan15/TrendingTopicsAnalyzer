Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday for the Deepotsav celebrations, a day before India gets soaked in the revelry for Diwali - the festival of lights. He is also expected to offer puja at the Ram temple. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is set to visit the holy city to take stock of preparation for the Deepotsav celebrations. This will be Adityanath's fourth visit to Ayodhya in about a month's time.
