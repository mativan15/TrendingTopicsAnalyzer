Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday wrote a letter to Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena seeking his attention towards the rising crime rate in the national capital. The letter came a few hours after he was summoned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the liquor policy. 'It feels like Delhi has now become the crime capital,' Sisodia letter read.

Earlier this month Sisodia wrote to L-G demanding a CBI probe into the alleged Rs 6,000 crore scam in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).
