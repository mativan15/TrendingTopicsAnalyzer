Published: 08:50 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:50 EDT, 20 October 2022 Former DUP first minister Paul Givan has said it would take a 'miracle' for a new Stormont executive to be formed ahead of a deadline for calling another Assembly election. If the DUP do not agree to form a new powersharing administration before next Friday, the UK Government assumes a legal responsibility to call another poll. The DUP has blocked the formation of a fully functioning ministerial executive since May's Assembly election as part of its protest against Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol.
