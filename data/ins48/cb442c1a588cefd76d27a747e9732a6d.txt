HOURS after Punjab Vigilance arrested BJP leader and former minister Sunder Sham Arora, Cabinet minister Aman Arora said that cracking down on 'corrupt leaders is one of the biggest achievements of Aam Aadmi Party government in the state. '
He said in the past seven months, the state government had arrested 'over 220 influential people, senior politicians and bureaucrats who had looted the Punjab and were being patronized by the successive governments,' he said. Replying to a media query over ongoing inquiries against opposition leaders, Arora said that unlike previous governments, AAP is not doing vendetta politics and actions will only be initiated against them after investigation team found them guilty in the probe.
