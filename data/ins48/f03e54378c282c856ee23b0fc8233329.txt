Three Colts regulars who were out of the lineup for last Sunday's win over the Jaguars were back on the field at practice on Wednesday.

Reporters at the open portion of Colts practice noted that running backs Jonathan Taylor and Nyheim Hines were both participating in the session. Linebacker Shaquille Leonard is also on the field and wearing a red, non-contact jersey.

Taylor has missed the last two games with an ankle injury while Hines and Leonard have been sidelined by concussions.
