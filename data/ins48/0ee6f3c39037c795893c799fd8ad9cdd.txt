The House Jan. 6 select committee forged new territory with its vote to issue a subpoena to former President Donald Trump for documents and testimony related to role in the Capitol insurrection.

This is the first time a congressional subpoena has been issued to a former president related to ongoing criminal investigations of that individual.

Prior to Trump, only three former presidents received congressional subpoenas: John Quincy Adams, John Tyler and Harry Truman. Only one testified.

In 1846, Adams and Tyler were subpoenaed to provide testimony related to payments made from a presidential contingency account, known as the 'secret service fund.
