by Robert Graves.Doubleday, $3.50.The erudite and heterodox Mr. Graves has written another historical novel which, of course, is sui generis, though it contains the customary ingredients of the costume romance. As a matter of fact, the book shows that a poet and superior literary craftsman such as Graves can make the confectioners of synthetic historical fiction look like sissies when it comes to dishing out passion, high adventure, and deeds bloody and most foul.The high adventure is that of a flotilla which set sail from Peru in 1595 in search of gold and conquest in the Solomons for Philip II of Spain.
