Taiwan's government has announced a "major breakthrough" in talks with the European Union about cooperation in the semiconductor industry, which could pave the way for the island nation's chipmakers to build new plants in Europe.
Reuters reported Thursday that Wang Mei-hua, Taiwan's Economy Minister, made clear in a statement that the country will continue to be a "trusted partner" for the EU in the semiconductor industry so that Europe's supply chain can stablize.
Wang held talks on the semiconductor industry with a senior EU official, Sabine Weyand, director-general for trade at the European Commission, who is focused on working with other countries on industry matters.
