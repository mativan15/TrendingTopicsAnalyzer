Under the normal laws it should at least rise each year with inflation. However, successive Chancellors have instead frozen it to bring in a bit more cash for their pet projects. The latest from Rishi Sunak freezes the allowance until April 2026. If the normal rules had applied since 2009, annual rises with inflation would mean it was set at £438,000 today.
IHT is 40pc on everything above the threshold. So compared to what it should have been, the frozen allowance means extra tax of £45,200 on a half-million pound estate.
