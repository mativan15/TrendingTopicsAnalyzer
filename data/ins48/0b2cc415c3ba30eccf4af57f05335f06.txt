BLACKSBURG, Virginia — Hits and runs were hard to come by for the first five innings of Friday's NCAA baseball regional opener between Gonzaga and Columbia.

Eventually, the Lions' potent offense found its groove, but the Zags never settled into a rhythm at the plate.

Third-seeded Columbia totaled 10 hits and seven runs across the final four innings at English Field to breeze past No. 2 seed Gonzaga 8-2 and send the Bulldogs (36-18) to a loser-out game in the four-team, double-elimination tournament on the campus of Virginia Tech.
