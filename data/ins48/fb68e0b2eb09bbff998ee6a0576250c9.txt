PARIS — Canada striker Jonathan David is peaking at the right time for the World Cup as the co-leading scorer in the French league going into Lille's match against Monaco on Sunday.

David's nine goals put him level with Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar. He's on a hot streak after scoring in four straight games. He has also provided two assists for Lille, which is in seventh place and two points behind Monaco after 11 rounds.

He can even move ahead of Neymar if he scores against Monaco, because Neymar is suspended for PSG's game at Corsican side Ajaccio on Friday.
