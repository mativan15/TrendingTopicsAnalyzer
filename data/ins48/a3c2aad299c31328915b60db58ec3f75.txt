Leonid Ikan Investment Thesis Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) has been a volatile stock in the past 6 months. But unlike other pockets of the equity market where volatility has been commensurate with negative returns, in the case of Marathon Oil, volatility means that the stock has gone up and down, yet remains unchanged in the past 6 months. The bear thesis is widely known and priced in, in a slowing economic environment, there's likely to be demand destruction, that could crumble oil prices. In this analysis, I add some nuance to the investment thesis and wish to explain why investors will be positively rewarded for staying long this name.
