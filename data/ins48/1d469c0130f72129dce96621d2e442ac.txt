The University of Dundee was partially founded on wealth derived from a family with links to the transatlantic slave trade, a study has shown.Members of the Baxter family, whose company Baxter Brothers & Co had immense wealth and exported linen in the 19th century, gave money to the institution to further access to education.The Founders Project final report found that Mary Ann Baxter and her cousin, John Boyd Baxter, bequeathed £140,000, equivalent to about £14 million now, towards the founding of University College Dundee in 1881, the root of the city's main university today.
