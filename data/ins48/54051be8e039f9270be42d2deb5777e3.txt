So that was quite a weekend of football. USC and Utah played a Pac-12 thriller which followed the Alabama-Tennessee epic. The Trojans finally played the shootout we expected to see more often in 2022. They came up just short for numerous reasons, one being that Utah's Cam Rising bounced back from an underwhelming first half of the 2022 season to play at the level he attained for much of 2021.

This was the Cam Rising we saw last year. This was the second-half Utah offense we saw last year. Utah put 44 points on the board at home against UCLA in 2021, and was similarly potent in other second halves throughout the 2021 season.
