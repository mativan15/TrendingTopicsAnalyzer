As the nation braces for a recession, North Carolina will be in a better place than most states thanks to fiscally responsible budgeting and tax cuts that put money back in families' pockets. The national economy is flashing warning signs, 'but there is good news on fiscal policy. A wildfire of state income-tax cuts is sweeping the nation,' according to Chris Edwards of the CATO Institute.

Bold tax cuts are a hallmark of a good budget. That's what North Carolina experienced after the state's bipartisan budget became law in November 2021 — the first state budget in three years.
