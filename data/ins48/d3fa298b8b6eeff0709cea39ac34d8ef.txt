A German news reporter didn't hold back in cursing in English mid-way through a summary of Liz Truss' final days before her resignation.
Earlier today, Ms Truss announced she was stepping down as Prime Minister, after holding the role for only 44 days, during which the economy crashed and both her Chancellor of the Exchequer and Home Secretary departed.
Before becoming the shortest serving PM, an unprecedented night of chaos erupted in the House of Commons, as MPs voted against a Labour motion on fracking.
