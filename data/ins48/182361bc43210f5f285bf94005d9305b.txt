Dolphins cornerback Byron Jones underwent surgery in his ankle/Achilles area on March 9. He is eligible to return from the reserve/physically unable to perform list.

He is not ready.

Jones will remain on the list this week with no timeline for his return.

'It is a big deal to put someone out there on the field, a cornerback that's trying to perform at a high level, with a lower body extremity injury,' Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said Monday, via a transcript from the team.
