We love supporting local businesses — and sharing what to buy from them. All products or services are selected independently by our L.A.-obsessed editorial team, and we may earn a commission when you purchase through our links.

The weather sorta says summer but our closets are calling for fall. Level up your looks as the leaves turn brown by shopping these online and IRL sample sales that'll have you saving on everything from dresses and outerwear to accessories and plants. This week, you're in for discounts from The Sill, Rocky Barnes' The Bright Side, ba&sh, Maison Kitsuné, and more.
