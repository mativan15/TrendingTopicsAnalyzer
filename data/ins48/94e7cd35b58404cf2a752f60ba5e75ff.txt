Beaufort police are investigating a Tuesday shooting in which two people were shot during what police say was a drug deal.

The situation started around 9 p.m., when officers were dispatched to what was reported as a possible burglary in progress at The Salvation Army, 2505 North St. The first officer to arrive heard several gunshots as a vehicle sped out of the parking lot and two people ran, at least one carrying a firearm as he fled toward Waters at Ribaut Apartments, 2500 Duke St., according to a news release.
