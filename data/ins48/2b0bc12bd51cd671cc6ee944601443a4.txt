Consumer prices rose by an annual 8.7%, while German import prices registered their biggest increase since September 1974. Spanish 12-month inflation resumed its upward trajectory in May after a dip in April. Meanwhile, risky asset prices were up after news that Shanghai authorities would cancel many conditions for businesses to resume work from Wednesday.
