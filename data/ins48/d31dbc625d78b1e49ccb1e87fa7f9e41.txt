Voters used to be able to count on debates to insert some policy discussion fiber into campaigns that were often filled with feel-good TV ads and stunts, the equivalent of campaign junk food. But debates are slowly fading away, the victim of our polarized politics and the belief of many campaign consultants that turning out their respective party's base is all that matters.
