Bill Fenick, VP Enterprise, Interxion argues that emerging technologies will reach a new level of maturity. He claims, 'with the IT industry booming over the past few years, it's hard to imagine that there will be any huge surprises in enterprise IT next year. However, I do expect that the new decade will bring new levels of maturity to leveraging technologies including the cloud, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. These technologies have transitioned from emerging trends that organisations were trying to figure out, to established staples of businesses' IT strategies.
