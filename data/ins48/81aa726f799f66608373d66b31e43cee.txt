How does SGA boost the Thunder's potential this season?

After missing all of the Oklahoma City Thunder's preseason games, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was available in the Thunder's first regular season game. We expected him to play solid, and he delivered. He scored 32 points on 12-for-23 shooting while adding on six rebounds and five assists. For a player that missed preseason, he played incredible.

Since he scored over 30 points, he's scratched the 30-point mark in 15 of his last 23 games.
