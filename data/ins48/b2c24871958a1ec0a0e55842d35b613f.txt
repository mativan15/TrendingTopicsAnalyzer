The premiership of Liz Truss has effectively been over for days, perhaps even weeks, but cruelly she's yet to be put out of her misery. It is coming, there's no doubt. And for everyone's sake, it should really hurry up. The problem is that her colleagues can't agree on a replacement and don't want to further spook the financial markets. There's also a Conservative rule that a new leader cannot be challenged within 12 months. So, that would have to change with a majority vote of the party room, or 179 of the 357 MPs.
