powerofforever Shares of Bally's Corporation (NYSE:BALY) have lost about 60% of their value over the past year as concerns about a recession have led to questions about consumer spending on discretionary categories like gaming. Additionally, Bally's has a very aggressive financial policy. If things go well, there is meaningful upside, but investors need to believe there will not be a downturn in results between now and 2026 as there is limited operational cushion. Seeking Alpha I would begin by separating out operating results from financial policy as they are two separate things.
