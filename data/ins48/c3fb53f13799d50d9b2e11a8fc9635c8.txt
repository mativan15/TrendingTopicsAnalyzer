A New Orleans pastor pleaded guilty on Tuesday to money laundering and admitted to defrauding donors of almost $900,000 meant to benefit his church, according to the Department of Justice. Rev. Charles Southall III, the executive pastor of First Emanuel Baptist Church in New Orleans, diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds to accounts under his personal control, prosecutors said. In a Facebook Live prayer session he held after Tuesday's court appearance, Southall apologized to his congregation and claimed that he had not laundered money, but said he had pleaded guilty to "something that went against the banking laws.
