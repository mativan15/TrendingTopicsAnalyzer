There's reason to celebrate at Heavy Smoke BBQ.

The St. Peters-based barbecue restaurant last weekend won the title of grand champion at the 33rd Annual Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational Barbecue competition in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Winning one of the nation's biggest and most prestigious barbecue competitions netted co-owners Chris Schafer and Chad Brewer a $25,000 prizer, bragging rights and a chance to defend its title next year.

But in a sign of the times in restaurant economics, Schafer said Heavy Smoke isn't planning, for now, to use the winnings for expansion or other big investments.
