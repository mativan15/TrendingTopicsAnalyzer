Matthew Skinner, 45, who in 2014 founded a company called Empire West Equity Inc. and later established Simple Growth LLC, has agreed to enter his plea to a federal count of securities fraud. Skinner admitted in his plea agreement that he fraudulently sold securities. Skinner used social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube to promote himself, falsely claiming to be an experienced and successful real estate investor with more than $200 million in deals under his belt, according to court documents.
