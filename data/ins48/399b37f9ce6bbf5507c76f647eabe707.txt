Dame Deborah James has thrown a ‘last impromptu party' as she celebrated her brother's engagement with her loved ones.
The You, Me & The Big C presenter is currently receiving end-of-life hospice care at her parents' home in Surrey after treatment for her bowel cancer stopped last month.
She was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016 but was recently told it had become terminal. 
Over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, Dame Deborah celebrated the happy news of her brother's engagement, sharing some sweet pictures on Instagram in which she looked ecstatic over the news, posing beside her sibling and her new sister-in-law to-be.
