It seems like every week I get at least one email or a question on my live-stream sessions about inflation. I'm by no means an economist, but I've seen enough full moons to know that inflation is raging, and it's going to get much worse.I do the grocery shopping in my household, and I'd estimate food prices are up at least 35 percent. Gasoline is now up 85 percent where I live. Building material prices are rising faster than a bottle rocket on the Fourth of July. I'm bewildered how the reported inflation rate I see in the news is so much lower than what I'm experiencing.
