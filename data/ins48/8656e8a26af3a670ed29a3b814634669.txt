Research compiled by the Frank Recruitment Group has found that the majority of Fortune 500 companies with a female CEO are typically more profitable than those helmed by a male CEO. According to the findings, 87% of the top 500 companies last year led by a female decision-maker reported above-average profits, compared to just 78% of companies without a female CEO. 'It may be that women do already have leadership roles within your company, and the issue is down to their visibility,' said Zoë Morris, President of Frank Recruitment Group.
