Liz Truss will appeal to moderate Tory MPs to save her premiership on Monday after it emerged that powerbrokers had held secret discussions about ousting her and arranging a "coronation". The prime minister will address the One Nation group of centrist Conservatives after a weekend in which three of her MPs called on her to quit and her new chancellor tore up the agenda on which she was elected only last month. Senior members of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers held talks late on Friday evening about Truss's future, The Times can reveal.
