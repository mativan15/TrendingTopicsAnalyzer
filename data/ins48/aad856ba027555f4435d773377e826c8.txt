Disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti was sentenced to four years in prison by a federal judge Thursday for stealing nearly $300,000 in book advance money from porn star Stormy Daniels. 
A portion of his sentence will be served concurrent to time he's already doing in a separate extortion case – but the fallen lawyer will have to serve 30 months of the new sentence after that, Manhattan federal court Judge Jesse Furman ordered. 
During the sentencing hearing, Avenatti, wearing beige jail fatigues, choked up at times as he addressed Judge Furman, describing how his life had been upended since his arrests on a number of federal charges.
