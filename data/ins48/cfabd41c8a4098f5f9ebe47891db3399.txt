Lewis Hamilton accused Formula 1 of not doing enough to help W Series to save its season amid its financial woes. The all-female series was forced to cancel the final three races of its season after some funding that was expected never arrived. So W Series will not be supporting F1 in Austin this weekend, or in Mexico seven days later. It meant Jamie Chadwick was crowned champion for the third time, in her final season in the series before departing to further her motorsport career. But while the Brit was already leaving, many of the other drivers will be left concerned for their own future.
