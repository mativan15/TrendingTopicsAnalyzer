Apple would fare better than other technology companies in the event of a economic downswing, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Erik Woodring said the broader market will feel the impacts of a weakening economy and companies' earnings per share will see double-digit slides for the rest of the year as a result. But he said Apple is more insulated, making it the firm's top pick among overweight stocks. "While we do not believe Apple is completely immune from the weakening consumer hardware demand environment, we see Apple as better insulated, and our quarter-end checks show that demand has held up better than expected in recent months," Woodring said in a note to clients.
