The tallest tower in the province is being considered as part of a development in Burnaby. Those behind the mixed-use-building pitch plan to build two skyscrapers next to the Lougheed SkyTrain Station. One will be 73 storeys while the other is 80 – both record heights for the province. The tallest building in B.C. currently is the Shangri-La Vancouver, at 62 storeys. The buildings will be mostly residential, with condos set atop a "podium" of commercial and office space. They're proposed for a small triangle of land across Austin Road from the Lougheed Shopping Centre, part of which is currently occupied by the SkyTrain station and bus bays.
