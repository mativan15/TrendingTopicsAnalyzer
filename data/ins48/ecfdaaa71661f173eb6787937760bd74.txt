The Green Bay Packers ruled out wide receiver Christian Watson for Sunday's showdown with the Washington Commanders, meaning the rookie will miss a second-straight game because of a hamstring injury. Watson was joined by slot receiver Randall Cobb (ankle) and offensive lineman Jake Hanson (biceps) as the three players ruled out by the Packers on the final injury report of Week 7 released Friday.
All three players missed practice on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. Cobb and Hanson, who were injured last week against the New York Jets, could go on injured reserve come Saturday.
