Klaus Vedfelt/DigitalVision via Getty Images Pebblebrook Hotel (NYSE:PEB) sees its Q3 same-property total revenue and revenue per room both exceeding pre-pandemic comps for the first time, as business transient and group demand growth stay at healthy levels. Total revenue is expected to be $403.9M, up from $395.7M in Q2 and +2% from the same period in 2019, noting that Hurricane Ian resulted in a $2.0M hit to its top line. The lodging REIT targeted RevPAR of $233 vs. $221 in Q2 and +1% from Q3 2019.
