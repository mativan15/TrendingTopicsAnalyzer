GREEN BAY – Tundra Angels has quickly become an important investor group for startups since it was founded by the Greater Green Bay Chamber in 2020.

And now that the group has grown from six to a total of 29 investors, Tundra Angels will become a privately held company.

Privatization comes as part of another chapter that will allow growth, implementation of new processes and managerial expansion, said the group's manager since inception, Matthew Kee.

Tundra Angels was a key initiative within the Chamber's Economic Development Strategic Plan, established in 2017 with a set of 11 initiatives designed to support the creation of new jobs and investments in the area.
