There have been 34 winner-take-all Game 5s in Division Series history, since the best-of-five series was added to the postseason docket in 1995, when MLB expanded to allow a Wild Card team from each league.

We're in store for even more of those moments in 2022 after the Yankees, facing elimination, took ALDS Game 4 from the Guardians to send the series back to New York, forcing the only Game 5 of this year's Division Series round.
