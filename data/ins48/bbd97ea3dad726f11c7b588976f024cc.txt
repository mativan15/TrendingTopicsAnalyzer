New Zealand was promised health improvements with the creation of two new national health authorities, but logos are the only thing that's changed so far, doctors say. In July, the country's 20 DHBs were replaced by national health agency Te Whau Ora – Health New Zealand and and Te Aka Whai Ora Māori Health Authority, but many health statistics are only getting worse. The waitlist for elective surgeries across the country grew to 27,000 this year, up from 8000 in February 2020. The difficulty of getting a GP appointment is mounting, with one in 16 Kiwis not even enrolled in a practice.
