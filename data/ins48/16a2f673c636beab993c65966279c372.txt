As the co-founder of Nike, Phil Knight built his career around the world of sports. Nike is ubiquitous. Chances are, you've probably worn their shoes or a hoodie or something similar. Knight also built his vast wealth around sports—thanks to his work with Nike, he has a reported $47.2 billion net worth, per Forbes.
With all that money, it's his next really ambitious endeavor that is already sending massive shockwaves around the sports world.
According to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Knight and Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Smolinisky have submitted a $2 billion written offer to become co-owners of the Portland Trail Blazers.
