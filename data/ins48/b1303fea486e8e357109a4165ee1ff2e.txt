Sure, 'team Apple' folks go wild for AirPods. But if you have a Samsung Galaxy (or any Android phone for that matter), you can get your very own wireless earbuds that work just as well — or better.

Right now, Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro are on sale for $150, or $50 off, for Memorial Day at Amazon. That's a 25 percent markdown on these super-popular earbuds.
