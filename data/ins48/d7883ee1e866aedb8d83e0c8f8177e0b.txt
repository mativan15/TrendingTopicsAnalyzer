Indiewire Television Halloween is the season for horror, of course. But October also means fall TV is in full swing, so it's also the season for comedy, animation, drama, and more. TV shows of all kinds honor this spooky time of year, be it through explicit celebrations of the season or more abstract explorations of dark themes like existential dread, societal corruption, and the hubris of humanity.Instead of just binging television horror this season — 'Yellowjackets' is for winter! — why not truly frighten yourself with scary episodes of (generally) non-scary shows? 'Black Mirror' regularly borders on nightmarish, but falls squarely into the sci-fi category, and still one episode haunts us like the scariest movies do.
