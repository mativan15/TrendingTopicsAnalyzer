The leader of the Swedish Moderate Party and new prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, Stockholm, October 17, 2022. JONATHAN NACKSTRAND / AFP In the annals of the conservative Moderate Party, it is remembered as the Battle of Lycksele, named after the town in northern Sweden which in 1992 hosted the congress of the MUF (Moderaternas Ungdomsförbundet), the conservative Young Swedes. Their president since 1988, the 28-year-old Mr. Kristersson thought he would be easily re-elected. Criticized for his amateurism and preference for communication over political thought, he was defeated by three votes by Fredrick Reinfeldt, then 27.
