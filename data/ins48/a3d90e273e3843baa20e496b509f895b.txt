When Sheryl Sandberg first joined Facebook in 2008, she was often referred to as the 'adult in the room' that could help co-founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, then just 24 years old, turn it into a company Wall Street could trust. Nearly a decade-and-a-half later, Sandberg announced her impending departure Wednesday after fulfilling that job description as chief operating officer. She was a key force in developing the advertising business that is now the bulk of the revenue for a company worth more than half a trillion dollars, fostering relationships with big advertisers and small businesses as the social-media powerhouse spread its tendrils around the globe.
