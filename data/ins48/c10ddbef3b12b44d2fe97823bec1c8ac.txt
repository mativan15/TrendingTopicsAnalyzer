After months of speculation around the league and weeks of meetings between the Utah Jazz front office and its coach, Quin Snyder, the rumors appear to have become reality.

Snyder will not return as the Utah Jazz coach, a story broken by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and confirmed by Snyder and Jazz ownership.

'I am incredibly grateful to have spent the last eight years with such a respected and historic organization and in the beautiful, kind, supportive community of Salt Lake City. I could not have asked for better owners in the Miller family and with Ryan and Ashley,' Snyder said in a statement released by the team.
