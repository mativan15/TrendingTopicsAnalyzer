The Chancellor's new package includes a windfall tax which some politicians claim comes with consequences.Conservative politician, Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News: 'People need to understand that there is not a tax that you can take that is economically cost-free.'It doesn't matter which tax it is, it'll have an economic consequence.'Whether it's a pastry tax, to it's an excess profits tax, there is an economic consequence. There isn't a honeypot of free tax that governments can just pop into.'So as long as they raise the tax, knowing that it will have an economic consequence, which the Chancellor does, then it is a matter of choosing between one form of revenue-raising and another.
