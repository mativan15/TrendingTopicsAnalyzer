By Michael Abeyta October 17, 2022 / 9:28 AM / CBS Colorado For nearly one month, women and girls in Iran have been protesting government oppression, specifically the headscarf mandate for women. The protests were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was arrested by Iran's morality police for not wearing her headscarf properly. The Iranian government says she died of a heart attack, but many eyewitnesses claim she was beaten. In Denver, a man who wants to be known only as Rowshan began his one-man protest against the Iranian government and its treatment of women one year earlier.
