Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Canada has been "acting promptly" to his country's requests for support while condemning Iran for its involvement in supplying Russia with killer drones. Zelenskyy on Wednesday sat down CTV News Chief International Correspondent Paul Workman, where he said he's "truly grateful" for the military aid that Ottawa has provided. "This is more than a partnership. It's something more. It's something bigger. It's like being relatives, regardless of the distance," he said of Canada-Ukraine relations.
