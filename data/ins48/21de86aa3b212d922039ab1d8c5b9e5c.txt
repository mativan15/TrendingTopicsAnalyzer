Business leaders on Wednesday condemned a union for planning to cause six days of chaos for passengers after announcing a Tube strike and action on the railways.The RMT union on Tuesday night said its members would hold a 24-hour action on the London Underground on Thursday November 3 — which is likely to bring the network to a near standstill.The action, the latest protest in a long dispute with Transport for London over staff pensions and the loss of up to 600 station staff posts, will coincide with a strike on the London Overground.
