Phil Mickelson almost ended the Saudi involvement in golf before it had began with a damaging interview which had potential PGA Tour rebels rethinking their decision. In February the six-time major winner stated the Saudi chiefs were 'scary motherf*****s' after admitting he was talking with the controversial Saudi Golf League (SGL), now commonly known as LIV Golf. This was at the time when a new rebel series being led former world No 1 Greg Norman, with the mega-money funding of Saudi-backed company LIV Golf Investments, was looking to lure some of the game's best players away from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour.
