It's been a busy offseason for new Bears general manager Ryan Poles, who's done plenty of work fixing what former GM Ryan Pace left behind. So far, Poles has made good on his promise to build through the draft, and it's clear that this rebuild — or 'retool,' as Poles calls it — will take some time.
While Chicago wasn't in a terrible position with the salary cap, Poles has been clearing bad contracts — whether that's trading Khalil Mack to acquire draft capital and free up cap space in 2023 or releasing aging veterans — to start building the roster his way.
