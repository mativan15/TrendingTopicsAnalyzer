A $1000 mechanical keyboard design inspired by the Tesla Cybertruck.For example, a designer will release concept art for a component, like a set of keycaps (the plastic covering that goes on each key). Interested enthusiasts can pre-order it and if enough people pay, the production process can begin.This aligns the hobby with 'hypebeast' interests like car customisation or sneaker collecting, in which product runs are limited, sell out quickly and can hit the resale market for thousands more than their retail price.
