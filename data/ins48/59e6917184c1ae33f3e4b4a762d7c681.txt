DNA evidence led to a Kentucky man being charged in the 1994 rape and murder of a Gary woman.

Gerald Lynn Smith, 60, of Madisonville, Kentucky, was charged on Sept. 28 with murder, murder while committing or attempting to commit rape, and rape in connection with the murder of 69-year-old Gloria Hansell, according to a news release from the FBI's Indianapolis office and Lake County court records.

He was extradited to Indiana this week, according to an FBI spokesperson.

Hansell was a widow who lived alone at 3966 Buchanan Street and used an in-home oxygen machine due to poor health, the release states.
