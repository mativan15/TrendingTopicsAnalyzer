Just Stop Oil protesters remain on top of the M25 Dartford Crossing, threatening another day of commuter chaos.The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge linking Essex and Kent was closed after it was scaled by two climbers from the group, whose demands include that the government 'halts all new oil and gas licences and consents'.The closure of the major road bridge caused delays of two hours during rush-hour on Monday, with six miles of congestion on the anti-clockwise carriageway and five miles in the opposite direction, National Highways said.
