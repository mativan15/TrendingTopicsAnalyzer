Kolkata: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that it was not her but the then ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPM] government which forced the Tata Motors project out of Singur in 2008.'Some people are talking rubbish that I had chased away the Tatas and it is the Tatas who are now giving jobs. I did not chase the Tatas away. The CPM drove them away,' Banerjee told a social gathering traditionally held after the Durga Puja festival in West Bengal at Siliguri which was attended by Durga Puja committees from at least eight north Bengal districts.
