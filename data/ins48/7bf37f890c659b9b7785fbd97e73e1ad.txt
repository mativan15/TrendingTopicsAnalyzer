If there's one thing BTS ARMY will do, it's support their Bangtan Boys. After news broke that the seven-member K-pop group would go on hiatus until 2025 while the men fulfilled their military duties, most of their devoted fanbase, known as ARMY, decided to stand behind them with a singular message: 'Trust BTS.' Stan Twitter timelines were filled with live reactions to the news, first with disappointment in the South Korean government but later with support for BTS. While the news was not the outcome many hoped for, the group's members — Jungkook, Jimin, V, Suga, Jin, RM, and J-Hope — seemed to try and prepare the fanbase for the announcement during their massive concert in Busan over the weekend.
