Aria Bakhtiarizadeh's daily commute to Humber College's Etobicoke campus is a bit like playing hopscotch.The first-year student gets on a York Region Transit (YRT) bus in Richmond Hill, then hops on a separate YRT or GO Transit bus that takes him to Bramalea terminal in Brampton. From there, it's on to a third bus, this time operated by Brampton Transit. Some days, he goes part of the way on Toronto's TTC.In total, it costs him around $6 each way and takes up to four hours per day."It's quite a hassle," Bakhtiarizadeh told CBC Toronto in an interview at the campus bus terminal earlier this week.
