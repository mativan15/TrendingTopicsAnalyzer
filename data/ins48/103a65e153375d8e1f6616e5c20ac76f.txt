Since then, volunteers from all over the country have made their way to help, including Minnesotans.This week, volunteers from non-profits like the Salvation Army and American Red Cross are now returning home after a two-week deployment in Florida. But the work there is far from over, it's just time for a new cycle of volunteers to answer the call.
