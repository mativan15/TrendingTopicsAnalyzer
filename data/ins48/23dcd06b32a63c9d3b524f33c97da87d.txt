Ross KaminskyJun 2, 2022 Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy has (or will soon have) all charges against him dropped from his recent arrest. We had Arapahoe County Sheriff Tyler Brown on the show recently who explained that since Jeudy's argument was with a woman with whom he had a child, there's an automatic domestic violence enhancer and an automatic arrest. That seems to me as the sort of thing passed by virtue-signaling legislators, perhaps in the aftermath of a situation where an arrest wasn't made and something bad happened.
