Dame Judi Dench has called for a disclaimer to be added to The Crown for "the sake of a family and a nation so recently bereaved". The actress, 87, accused the Netflix series of "crude sensationalism" and warned there was a risk that "a significant number of viewers" would take its events as historical truth. She added that "wounding suggestions apparently contained in the new series" would prove "damaging" to the monarchy and could not go unchallenged. Dame Judi made the remarks in a letter to The Times, following previous concerns voiced by former prime minister Sir John Major, about the content of The Crown's highly anticipated fifth series, which will launch on November 9.
