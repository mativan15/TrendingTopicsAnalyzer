Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was seen leaving ‘crisis talks' with the Prime Minister just hours after insisting she is still ‘in charge' of the government.
Hunt, 55, was spotted making a swift exit from the Chequers estate in Buckinghamshire, after meeting with Prime Minister Liz Truss. 
It comes amid claims that Tories are still plotting to replace the Prime Minister after a disastrous six-weeks in Number 10.
Mr Hunt warned taxes will most certainly rise during an interview with the BBC, and said there will be ‘very difficult decisions' ahead for the government.
