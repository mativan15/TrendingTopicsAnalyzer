Oct. 18—MITCHELL — A few bins of corn.

That's all there is to decorate the Corn Palace murals this year.

The drought conditions that loomed over the area took a toll on the corn crops that are produced for decorating the Corn Palace murals. The amount of corn harvested this fall isn't enough to transform the murals into next year's theme, which will leave Mitchell's biggest tourist attraction with the same circus-themed murals for another year.

"We just flat out don't have enough corn. It was a tough decision, and it makes me feel bad," Corn Palace Director Doug Greenway said.
