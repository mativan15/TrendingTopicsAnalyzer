Collider.com After a long period spent in development hell, Paramount+ recently issued the green light to a revival of the hit NBC sitcom, Frasier. Given that it has been almost two decades since the curtains came down on the original show, the revival is certain to undergo a lot of changes. One thing however remains unchanged, its star Kelsey Grammer is returning to reprise the titular role as the egotistical psychologist Frasier Crane. Details on the revival have been sparse, however, Grammer has begun revealing some bits of information on the keenly anticipated revival including how it would address the absence of one of the major stars of the original show, John Mahoney.
