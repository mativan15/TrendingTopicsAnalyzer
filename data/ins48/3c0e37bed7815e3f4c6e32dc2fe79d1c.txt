Women taking part in anti-government protests across dozens of cities in Iran refuse to stop even as more than 200 people have been killed in protests, and the violent security force crackdown that followed. Iran has not given a death toll in weeks. There is also concern for Iranian female athlete Elnaz Rekabi who competed in a climbing event without her hijab, or headscarf, in South Korea, although she has said her hijab fell off "inadvertently", as protest intensifies in Iran. Women athletes must abide by the dress code when they are officially representing Iran in competitions overseas.
