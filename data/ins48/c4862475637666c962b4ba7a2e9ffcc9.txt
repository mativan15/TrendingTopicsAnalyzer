Bengaluru: Ecommerce roll-up platform Mensa Brands, founded by former Myntra CEO Ananth Narayanan, is aggressively expanding into international markets including the US, Middle East and Canada, after hitting a net revenue run rate of Rs 1,500 crore ($200 million) in its first year of operations. Net revenue is the sale value of goods excluding returns and discounts. This comes at a time when the roll up commerce sector is facing headwinds, with the likes of Thrasio cutting costs amid a change of CEO.
