Chip delivery times shrank by four days in September, the biggest drop in years, in a sign that the industry's supply crunch is easing.

Lead times — the gap between when a chip is ordered and when it is delivered — averaged 26.3 weeks in the period, according to research by Susquehanna Financial Group. That compares with nearly 27 weeks the prior month.

Wait times contracted for all key product categories, with power-management and analog chips seeing the biggest declines, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a research note.
