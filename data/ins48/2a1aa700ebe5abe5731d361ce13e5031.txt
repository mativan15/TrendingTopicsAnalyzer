Late Hollywood actress and fashion icon Anna May Wong (1905-1961) is set to become the first Asian American to feature on US currency. A quarter-dollar coin featuring a close-up image of Wong's face chin resting on her hand will begin circulating from Monday (October 24), the US Mint said, as the fifth coin in the American Women Quarters (AWQ) Program.

📷 On October 24, the @usmint will begin shipping quarters honoring Anna May Wong, a trailblazing Chinese American actress who left a lasting legacy for Asian American women with an accomplished career in motion pictures, television, and theatre.
