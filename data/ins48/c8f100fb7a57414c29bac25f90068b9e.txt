King Viserys (Paddy Considine) had to die so House of the Dragon could live, and a bunch of other people are going to have to die as well so House of the Dragon can live some more. At a certain point, maybe House of the Dragon shouldn't be alive? And yet, just try looking away from it. Go on, try! We'll wait!Okay, no, stop, come back! You can't leave yet, at least not until we've talked about all of the major ways this week's House of the Dragon, 'The Green Council,' interacted with George R.R. Martin's Fire and Blood, the fictional in-universe history book on which the Game of Thrones prequel is based! Will you consider turning around if I were to tell you there are some huge differences between the show and the book this time around—some of which are, dare I say, quite controversial from this book-reader's perspective?Phew.
