By Reuters Published: 14:34 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 14:34 EDT, 18 October 2022 Green Bay Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb avoided serious injury but will be sidelined 2 to 4 weeks with an ankle sprain, NFL Network reported Tuesday. The team originally feared that Cobb broke his ankle. Cobb, 32, was carted to the locker room during the second half of the Packers' loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. The team could place Cobb on injured reserve if it thinks he is likely to miss on the higher end of the reported timeline.
