Indonesia has rolled out its first domestically produced COVID-19 vaccine. It is hoped IndoVac will save the country money and even be exported. The state-owned pharmaceutical company, Bio Farma started developing it in June 2021 in collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine in the United States. At the launch ceremony in Bandung, West Java province, President Joko Widodo watched as the first 25 people received their shots. The government hopes that IndoVac will end the reliance on imported vaccines and save foreign-exchange reserves.
