Tory MPs who refused to back the Government's opposition to a ban on fracking last night risk being expelled from the party, Downing Street has said.
Downing Street has said Conservative MPs should have treated the vote, which was subject to three-line whip, as a vote of confidence in Liz Truss, the embattled Prime Minister.
The 36 MPs who abstained include Boris Johnson, Kwasi Kwarteng, Theresa May and Liz Truss herself.
In a message sent to lobby journalists at 1.30 am last night, a spokesman for Downing Street said MPs 'without a reasonable excuse for failing to vote can expect proportionate disciplinary action'.
