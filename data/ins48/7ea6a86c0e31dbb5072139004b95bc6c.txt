The 39th CHEO Telethon is today on CTV Ottawa, a chance for residents of Ottawa, eastern Ontario and western Quebec to support care for children and youth in our community. And CHEO says it's an opportunity to welcome you inside "Your Children's Hospital" to see how your generosity can change lives and build brighter futures. "First of all, it allows the community to see inside the hospital and see what inspires us every day," says Tammy DeGiovanni, CHEO Senior Vice-President, Clinic Services and Chief Nurse Executive.
