Greater Noida: Billu and Rakesh Dujana were neighbours before they were gangsters.The two -- both 35, wanted in dozens of cases and gunned down in separate encounters with the Ghaziabad police early on Saturday -- were from the same village, Dujana in Dadri, living barely 500 metres apart.On Sunday, Dujana was silent, almost eerily so. Their families sat outside their houses, and spoke little. They said they were not in touch since the two went into a life of crime -- Billu at 18 and Rakesh at 21.
