The New Brunswick government is launching a pilot project to help communities reduce substance use among youth. The five-year project is in collaboration with an Icelandic research consultancy called Planet Youth. The organization's guidance program uses the Icelandic Prevention Model -- an evidence and community-based process that has been credited with lowering substance use in Iceland over the past 20 years. The program also puts a focus on youth's family, peer groups, extracurricular activities and school well-being.
