By Reuters Published: 04:37 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 04:37 EDT, 30 May 2022 LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - The British pound traded little changed against a faltering U.S. dollar on Monday but was still set for its first monthly gain in five as the risk-sensitive currency benefited from improving sentiment. As markets have readjusted their rate hike expectations from the Federal Reserve lower, the dollar index has weakened over 3.5% from its mid-May peak. This helped lift sterling after it reached its lowest level since March 2020 earlier in the month.
