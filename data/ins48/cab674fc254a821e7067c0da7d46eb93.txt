Elon Musk could be forced to sell $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock next week as he prepares to complete a $44 billion buyout of Twitter, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a Friday note.Musk currently has $12.5 billion lined up in debt financing, but he's seeking outside investors to come in and help foot the other $32 billion that he needs to finish the deal. The currently bleak stock market environment makes Musk's sell to investors about the potential for Twitter that much harder."It's pretty simple, the more investors that bail on this deal is the more money that Musk needs to contribute and therefore sell more Tesla stock," Ives said.
