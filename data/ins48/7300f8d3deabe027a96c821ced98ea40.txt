WASHINGTON — Kathleen Buhle, the ex-wife of President Joe Biden's son Hunter, says she has "total control over my life now," five years after her divorce, as she opens up about her marriage in a new memoir. Buhle describes her ex-husband's drug addiction, her response to his infidelity — including an affair with her widowed sister-in-law — and her challenges integrating into the Biden family. Excerpts of "If We Break" were published Wednesday by People magazine. In the book, Buhle describes the pain she felt watching Hunter spiral into addiction, even as he denied it, and how "it became my own addiction" to document it.
