Telangana high court on Thursday pulled up the state government for not filing the counter-affidavit within two weeks, defending the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker from Hyderabad T Raja Singh under the Preventive Detention Act on August 25 for allegedly making blasphemous comments against Prophet Mohammed.A division bench of the state high court comprising justice A Abhishek Reddy and justice Juvvadi Sridevi, which was hearing a petition filed by Singh's wife Usha Bai, directed the state to file a counter by October 28, failing which it would have to give an ex-parte order.
