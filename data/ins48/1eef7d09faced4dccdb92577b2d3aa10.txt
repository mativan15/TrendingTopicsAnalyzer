Six-time Mirrorball Trophy winner and three-time Emmy-winning choreographer Derek Hough is happy to admit he owes all of those accolades to ABC's Dancing with the Stars, so when he was invited to join the judges' table full-time alongside Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonoli, he jumped at the chance. (He judged in place of Goodman, who couldn't travel due to COVID-19 during season 29.)

'I love this show so much, I always have and always will,' Hough said during a DWTS Zoom junket before season 29 launched.
