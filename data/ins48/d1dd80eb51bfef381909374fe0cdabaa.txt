Mumbai: A sovereign seed fund, jointly promoted by India and Israel, will fund ideas that can transform sectors and make a difference to people's lives rather than a narrow focus on the profits and returns on investment. Venture capital and private equity funds have their own limitations such as investing in a proven business model with an aim to look for massive returns and hence they can't afford to invest in ideas, said Dr Amiram Appelbaum, chairman of the Israel Innovation Authority. "We would like those disruptive technologies that people still don't believe in," he said.
