As India gears up to become 5G ready, with many Indian cities already identified for the first phase of the launch, the number of scammers pretending to be customer care representatives from telecom providers also increases. Under the pretense of helping you upgrade your 4G sim to 5G, they scam their way to gain access to your data. Scammers make use of these phishing methods to get your personal details, like bank passwords, OTPs, etc. The Mumbai Police also issued a tweet a few days back, alerting people to recognise these scam calls and not fall prey to them.
