The Broncos-Chargers series used to be a one-sided rivalry in favor of Denver, but Los Angeles has changed that of late and won two of the past four games between these clubs. The quest for dominance here will make their Monday Night Football contest quite competitive, meaning bettors will want the protection that Caesars Sportsbook promo code MCBETFULL provides - first-bet insurance up to $1,250.
