Published: 19:05 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 19:05 EDT, 20 October 2022 Only 10% of women in Northern Ireland know how to access abortion services, a survey has found. The poll also revealed that three years after abortion was decriminalised in the region, only 47% of adults realise it is lawful. The survey, conducted by Opinium on behalf of Amnesty International UK, surveyed more than 1,000 adults over the age of 18 in Northern Ireland. It finds that 87% say the public are often unaware of the circumstances that abortion is permitted and how to access it, and that fewer than half (46%) of women would be comfortable speaking to their GP about accessing abortion.
