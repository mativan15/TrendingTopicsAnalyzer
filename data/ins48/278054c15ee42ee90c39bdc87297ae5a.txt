The Supreme Court has issued notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation and Reserve Bank of India on a plea seeking investigations into alleged role of RBI officials in various banking and financial scandals. The plea has been filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and advocate Satya Sabharwal. A division bench comprising justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna said it would examine the matter. The petitioners contended the number and value of banking frauds detected by RBI and other agencies during the last couple of years showed that despite wide powers, RBI 'failed to protect the interests' of stakeholders including depositors, investors and shareholders.
