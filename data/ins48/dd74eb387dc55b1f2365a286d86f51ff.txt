A bill to shrink class sizes in New York City schools has passed the state legislature — despite strong opposition from Mayor Eric Adams, who is expected to maintain accountability over the school system for the next two years.
The legislation, tied up with an extension of mayoral control during negotiations, limits the number of students per classroom over a phase-in period of five years. 
It passed both the state Senate and state Assembly Thursday and into Friday. If signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul, kindergarten through third grade classes would be capped at 20 students; fourth through eighth grade at 23 students; and high school at 25 students.
