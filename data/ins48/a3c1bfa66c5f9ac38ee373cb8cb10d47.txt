The deputy governor of the Bank of Canada says it may need to raise its key interest rate to three per cent or beyond to ensure inflation doesn't settle in for the long haul.
'We're scared that this inflation becomes entrenched,' Paul Beaudry told reporters Thursday afternoon.In an earlier speech to the Gatineau Chamber of Commerce, he said the likelihood of even higher consumer prices on the horizon means the central bank will consider pushing its policy rate at least to the top end of its 'neutral' range— between two and three per cent, which neither spurs nor hampers growth.
