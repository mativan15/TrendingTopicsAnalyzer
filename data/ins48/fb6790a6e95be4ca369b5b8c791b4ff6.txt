Gangaikondan SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre, which was created with 2,000 acres on the city outskirts, has reached saturation point and hence acquisition of 1,500 more acres of adjacent land is going on.After the Industries Department failed to attract significant investments to the 20-year-old Nanguneri Multiproduct Special Economic Zone, which has only 13 small units even after two decades, steps were initiated to attract investors towards the Gangaikondan SIPCOT centre, which was functioning with only small and medium-sized industries.
