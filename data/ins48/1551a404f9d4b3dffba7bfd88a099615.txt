The long battle between Brightline and Universal Studios about the fate of the company's Central Florida service appears to have ended, thanks to a new federal grant given to the luxury passenger rail service Wednesday.

According to a press release, Brightline was awarded $15,875,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Combined with a matching amount from the company itself, the money will be used to support the preliminary engineering and environmental approvals to get the western part of its route started.
