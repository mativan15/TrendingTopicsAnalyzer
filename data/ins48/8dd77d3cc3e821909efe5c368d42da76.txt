Tesla CEO Elon Musk admitted on Wednesday that he is 'obviously overpaying' for Twitter — but the billionaire said he's nonetheless 'excited' to own the social media site. 
'Though myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,' Musk said.
The mogul's comments came during a Tesla earnings call that was held as his attorneys hammer out a final settlement with Twitter. 
Musk said this month that he would end an on-again, off-again flirtation with Twitter by buying the site for $44 billion.
