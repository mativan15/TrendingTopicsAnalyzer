The coming years are going to be ‘very difficult' with every government department told to find spending cuts and some taxes going up, the new Chancellor admitted.
Jeremy Hunt took over from sacked Kwasi Kwarteng just two days ago, and has already set forward a very different approach to finances.
He admitted that things are going to be ‘very difficult' – but insisted it wouldn't be a return to 2010-style austerity.
Mr Hunt, who was also in government during the cost cutting era of David Cameron and George Osborne, said the current administration was one of ‘compassionate Conservatism'.
