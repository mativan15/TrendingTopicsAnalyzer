Globoplay, the streaming platform of Latin American TV giant Globo, has picked up Brazilian rights to police noir thriller series 'Motel Valkirias,' a Spain-Portugal co-production handled by Onza Distribution.  Created by Ghaleb Jaber Martínez, writer-producer of Netflix's Galician TV drama hit 'O Sabor das Margaridas,' the series is directed by Álex Sampaio (Schibare') and Jorge Quiroga ('Atras das Nuvens'). In post-production, the eight episode 50-minute 'Motel Valkirias' is set in a cross-border motel between Galicia and Portugal, following three women with financial and personal problems who get in serious danger after joining forces to get their hands on some valuable merchandise from a guest in the motel.
