(Bloomberg) -- Crypto lender Voyager Digital Ltd. is pursuing settlements with two top executives after an internal probe uncovered potential claims of gross negligence stemming from risky loans made to defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, court papers show. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Ehrlich, in consultation with then-Chief Financial Officer Evan Psaropoulos, agreed to let Voyager lend nearly $1 billion of crypto to Three Arrows despite extremely limited financial disclosure from the hedge fund, according to court papers filed Monday.
