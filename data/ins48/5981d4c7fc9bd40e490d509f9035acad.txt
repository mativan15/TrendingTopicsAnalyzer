West Bengal Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Saturday slammed the Centre over recent killings in the Kashmir valley and called it the failure of the government's policy. The senior Congress leader also alleged that people are fleeing the Kashmir valley to save their lives. "People are leaving the Kashmir valley to save themselves; this is a failure of the government's policy. It's a delicate situation," Chowdhury told ANI. Several targeted killings of innocent civilians in the Kashmir valley took place over the past two months and the victims include members of the Kashmiri Pandit community, civilians, and those working with the government departments.
