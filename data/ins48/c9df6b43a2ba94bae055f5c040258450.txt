There are few things that President Joe Biden wants more than to see inflation subside.
 

 But the few tools that he – and governors – have in their arsenal to help Americans cope with high prices will probably prolong the pain, experts say.
 

 Biden has spent this week outlining his administration's plans to fight inflation while at the same time acknowledging there's not much he can do about it. 
 

 He has pointed to his ordering the largest release from US oil reserves in history. The President is also allowing year-round sales of fuel containing more ethanol, which is cheaper.
