WASHINGTON — The U.S. government may require commercial planes and ships conducting military lift operations to carry technology that lets them navigate and communicate even when an adversary is trying to jam their systems, according to the head of U.S. Transportation Command.

This requirement for carry-on kit for sealift and airlift partners comes amid the command's effort to mature its concept for sustaining the joint force in a fight in a contested environment.

Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost told reporters Friday that last year's collaboration between military and commercial aircraft to evacuate at-risk Afghans as the Taliban took control of their country foreshadowed what could happen in the Pacific region, which is a larger area and likely includes more dangerous airspace.
