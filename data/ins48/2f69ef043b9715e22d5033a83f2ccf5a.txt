GHAZIABAD: The partial takeover of Indirapuram by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) is expected to take place by next month, officials have said.Both the GMC and the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) are these days busy preparing the separate estimates of the three services — horticulture, streetlights and sanitation — that will be handed over to the former by the latter, TOI has learnt.The GMC Board gave its nod to the partial takeover of the township last month, ending the six-year-long impasse between the two government agencies over the contentious issue.
