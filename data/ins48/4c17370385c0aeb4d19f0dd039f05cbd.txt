Money markets on Thursday priced in a 50 basis point increase to the bank's deposit rate, making a move of that magnitude for the first time since 2000. In fact, traders are nearly factoring in the possibility that such a hike could come even sooner, at the bank's October meeting.

European rate-hike bets accelerated as inflation concerns were renewed by oil-price moves.
