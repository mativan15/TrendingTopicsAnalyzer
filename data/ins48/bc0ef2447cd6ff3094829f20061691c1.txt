Former Cincinnati Bengals cornerback William Jackson has demanded a trade off the Washington Commanders.
That might inspire a bit of deja vu for Bengals fans. Jackson, the team's 24th overall pick in 2016, remained in town through the 2020 season before leaving the team and taking shots at fans on his way out the door.

Washington removed Jackson from a game early last week, though he had been dealing with a back injury leading up to the game. His reps later issued a statement that he'd like to find a better team fit.
