Cardinal Health has put 400,000 square feet of office up for sublease, a consequence of the increased number of employees working from home.

The building at 5100 Rings Road was put up for sublease in August. Cardinal Health told Columbus Business First a new tenant has not been found yet.

Cardinal moved 2,000 workers into the Rings Road building in 2018. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. had been a tenant in the building before moving those employees to Grandview Yard.

In November of 2020, former Cardinal CEO Mike Kaufmann told Business First that the company would not be unloading office space post-pandemic.
