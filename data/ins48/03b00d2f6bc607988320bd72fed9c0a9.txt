Jun. 1—GRAND FORKS — All five candidates who are running for contested seats on the Grand Forks City Council say they are open to the idea of the city providing some sort of help for events to help boost visitor numbers in the community, although their level of interest in what kind of help the city should provide varied.

During a Tuesday evening forum sponsored by the Grand Forks-East Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce, candidates Tricia Lunski and Matthew Ternus made the biggest pitch for the city to push for more events, although neither outright said public funding should be used for it.
