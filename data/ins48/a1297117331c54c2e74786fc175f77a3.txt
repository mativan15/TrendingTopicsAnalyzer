Revolut's compliance chief has quit after bosses axed the number of staff working in the digital lender's risk division.
Harry Gill, Revolut's global head of regulatory compliance, and a member of its executive leadership team, resigned after Nikolay Storonsky, the company's chief executive, "significantly reduced the number of people working in the department", according to City sources. 
The resignation follows a string of senior departures at Revolut in recent months, including its head of operational risk and head of UK compliance.
