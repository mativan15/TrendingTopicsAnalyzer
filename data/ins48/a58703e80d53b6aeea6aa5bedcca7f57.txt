Jake Maizen scored the first hat-trick of the Rugby League World Cup as Italy, playing in their first international match for three years, produced a magnificent team display to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages with victory against Scotland.Italy's last fixture was a qualifier for this very tournament in November 2019, with the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the ability of Leo Epifania's side to play regularly. On this display, though, the Azzurri will be hopeful of becoming a regular presence in European rugby league.
