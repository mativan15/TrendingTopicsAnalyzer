A multimillion dollar renovation, curated retail and custom office upfits landed some leasing wins for Charlotte's One Independence Center this summer. Now the uptown tower is continuing to invest in suite buildouts to build on that momentum.

The 20-story, 546,878-square-foot tower at 101 N. Tryon St., landed back-to-back leases over the summer. Stays by Walker signed a multiyear lease for just under 3,000 square feet of space in late July, followed 10 days later by Bank of London's announcement that it signed an 11-year lease for 40,000 square feet to establish a tech hub in Charlotte.
