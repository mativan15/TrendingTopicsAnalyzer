ROME (Reuters) - Giorgia Meloni, expected to be named Italian prime minister this month, and her coalition partner Silvio Berlusconi had a cordial meeting on Monday and aim to quickly form a "cohesive" government, their parties said.

Tensions have been running high over the allocation of cabinet posts between Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party led a rightist alliance to victory at a Sept. 25 election, and Berlusconi, who heads the smaller Forza Italia party.

The two appeared to have largely settled their differences at Monday's meeting.
