Twenty-eight years after the 'brutal slaying' of a 69-year-old widow, the FBI announced the arrest of a Kentucky man accused of her death.

Gloria Hansell, who lived alone in her Gary, Indiana, home, was found strangled on June 17, 1994, according to the FBI. She was in poor health and used an in-home oxygen machine, authorities said.

An arrest warrant obtained by the Madisonville Messenger said funeral home employees found 'an electrical cord from a fan' wrapped around Hansell's neck following the 1994 killing.
