OKLAHOMA CITY, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a study by BofA Securities, the U.S. Cannabis industry saw a 67% revenue jump in 2020, and another 40% leap in 2021. These massive surges in interest took it far ahead of all international competition and made stepping in the market a tempting opportunity for many. In fact, years since have seen businesses turn more than 10 billion USD in profit from the crop or from other related products, and this sum is projected to increase all the way up to over 40 billion by 2025.
