The Government has won a vote against a Labour motion to ban fracking but the Tory chief has reportedly resigned in a furore as MPs were voting.

The government won by 326 to 230 against the banning of fracking. That reprsented a majority of 96 with 40 Tories not voting with the government - including Kwasi Kwarteng Nadine Dorries and Theresa May - and risking losing the whip.

Prime Minister Liz Truss lifted the moratorium in England despite the concerns of many Tories.
