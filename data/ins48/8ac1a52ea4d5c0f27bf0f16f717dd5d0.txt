'Kanye used to be fun crazy. Now he's like Hitler.''I'm really tired of people excusing his behaviour by saying ‘Well he's just mentally ill'.'Stern — who grew up Jewish — also criticised West's claims that 'the Jewish media' have stopped giving him coverage, saying, 'If a newspaper article doesn't point out the fact that you're some sort of designer or genius, maybe that's not because they're Jewish, but maybe because they just don't put that much thought into who the f**k you are and what your business is.
