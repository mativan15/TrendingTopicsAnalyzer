Amazon re:MARS Amazon 
As a frequenter of tech shows, I'm very familiar with the big-budget spectacle and fanfare that frequently accompany them. It can sometimes feel a bit overblown—data storage with a side of pyrotechnics is still data storage. However, one upcoming event on my calendar may warrant such a display. Amazon re:Mars, coming June 21-24 in Las Vegas, is Amazon's big showcase for its work on some of the hottest topics in tech and science—machine learning, AI, robotics and space. I'm very much looking forward to getting a closer look at the work Amazon is doing in partnership with educational and research organizations and those in the private sector.
