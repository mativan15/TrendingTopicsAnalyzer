Good morning from a somewhat damp Epsom Downs racecourse in Surrey, where the track has been getting a bit of a drenching this morning before the Derby, the most famous Classic of them all, at 4.30pm BST this afternoon.

The Queen will unfortunately not be in attendance, as was the original intention when Derby day was chosen to form part of the official jubilee celebrations, but many tens of thousands of her subjects will, to see the first Derby since 2019 with a full crowd in the stands and packed on to the Downs.
