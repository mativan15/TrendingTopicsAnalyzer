The exchanges were ranked based on BrokerChoosers' so-called safety methodology, which is built on four main pillars: regulation, consumer protection, market fairness and transparency, the report said. Those pillars contain a combined 16 sub-categories relating to a number of qualitative and/or quantitative factors.
