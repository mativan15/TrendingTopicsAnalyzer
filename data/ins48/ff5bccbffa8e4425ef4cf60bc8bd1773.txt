reported a 60% jump in its second-quarter revenue on rebounding demand for clothes and shoes even as its move to spend heavily on fresh stock ahead of the festive season pressured profit. The Indian department store operator's shares, which more than doubled this year, fell nearly 5% to 765 rupees at 0423 GMT on Thursday.

 "The stock is not cheap anymore as, in the past three to six months, it has significantly outperformed the market. So there could be some profit booking," Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy at Sharekhan, said.
