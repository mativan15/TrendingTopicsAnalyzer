The Houston Texans and Las Vegas Raiders spent their bye weeks in similar fashion. The AFC's only one-win teams had extra time to try to figure out why they are looking up at the rest of the conference in the standings despite being competitive almost every week. 'I actually got a really good feeling from watching the tape,' Raiders star receiver Davante Adams said. 'Obviously, you look at the record and none of us are proud of that part. ... But you even look at some of the power rankings and the fact that they have us where they have us after having one victory at this point shows that there's something that we're doing out there that people are taking notice of and just not finishing to the best of our ability.
