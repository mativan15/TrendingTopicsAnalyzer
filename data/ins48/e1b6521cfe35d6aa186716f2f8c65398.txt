Despite criticism for her daring dress sense, Holden, 51, is adamant that she will 'not be covered up'. As a health and fitness lover, Holden deserves nothing more than to flaunt the figure she works so hard to maintain. Seemingly unfazed by the complaints to Ofcom by viewers, the star added: 'My t*ts seem to become the show's biggest talking point every year. Will people be complaining to Ofcom? I hope so, I really do. I haven't done my job if they aren't." Back in 2020, the radio DJ and television judge opened up about something rather more serious, revealing that she technically died for 40 seconds after the birth of her daughter.
