funky-data/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Shares of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) had lost about 20% of their value going into Q3 earnings, and the results added to the pain, with shares falling another 4% in early trading. While investors are focused on a larger jump in credit provisions, I am impressed by the tremendous growth in the business. This validates the view that American Express is one of the highest-value brands in financial services. At 14x earnings, AXP shares offer attractive value.
