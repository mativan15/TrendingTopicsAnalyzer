Amber Heard's astonishing court loss against ex-husband Johnny Depp signals the worst is yet to come for the Aquaman star.

A jury has decided that Johnny Depp was defamed by his ex-wife Amber Heard after a bombshell five-week trial in Virginia.

The decision, reached today in the Fairfax County Court, will see Heard, 36, have to pay $15 million in damages to Depp, 58. Of that $10m is in compensatory damages and $5m in punitive damages. However, Virginia law only allows punitive damages up to a maximum of $350,000, meaning Depp was awarded a total of $10.
