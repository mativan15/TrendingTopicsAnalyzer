As significant as a 1-million-square foot distribution center for a major national company is for High Point, Guilford County, and the Triad, perhaps the most significant aspect of Wednesday's Ecolab groundbreaking in a rolling field is what it represents: The culmination of more than a decade of work to bring a new major industrial park to the area.

The Ecolab Customer Care Center warehouse will be the company's largest distribution facility and consolidate operations of other company facilities.
