EDMONTON - Supporters of open-pit coal mining say there's a chance new mines could be built in Alberta's Rockies after comments from the province's new premier.

'We're hoping with this little window with Danielle (Smith) that we can crack that open,' said Eric Lowther, a southern Alberta resident and president of Citizens Supportive of Crowsnest Coal.

Coal mining in the province's beloved Rockies was blocked in February 2021 by a ministerial order. The order resulted from a huge public outcry after thousands of hectares of summits and foothills were permitted for exploration following encouragement from the United Conservative Party government.
