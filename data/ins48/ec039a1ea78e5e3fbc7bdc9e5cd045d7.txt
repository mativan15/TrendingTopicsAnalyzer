The Maharashtra government has announced year-long celebrations ahead of the 75th Marathwada Mukti Sangram on September 17, 2023—the 75th anniversary of Marathwada's liberation from the princely state of Hyderabad by the Indian Army. As a first step, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde has constituted a sub-committee of ministers from the region—known administratively as the Aurangabad division on Maharashtra's east, bordering Telangana—for monitoring and implementing the plans over next year.
The minister for the Employment Guarantee Scheme, Sandipan Bhumre, health minister Tanaji Sawant, agriculture minister Abdul Sattar and minister for co-operatives Atul Save constitute the sub-committee, whose member secretary will be the region's divisional commissioner.
