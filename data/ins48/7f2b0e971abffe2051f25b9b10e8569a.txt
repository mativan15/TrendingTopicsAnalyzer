A shortage of coal at Australia's largest power station, Origin Energy's Eraring plant in New South Wales, has forced the company to slash the profit target for its electricity business and threatens to deepen a worsening energy crisis engulfing the east coast.Origin, one of the country's top electricity suppliers, on Wednesday warned that challenges sourcing black coal for the 2880-megawatt generator on the shores of Lake Macquarie had 'deteriorated significantly' over recent weeks because of production issues at supplier Centennial Coal's nearby Mandalong mine that are not expected to ease until next year.
