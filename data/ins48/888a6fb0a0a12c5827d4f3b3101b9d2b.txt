JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images The shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) tended higher pre-market Friday after Jefferies assumed its coverage with a Buy recommendation noting that the market has not yet fully recognized an impending growth inflection in the generic drugmaker. TEVA has recorded contractions in its topline since 2017, and Wall Street expects the company to report a ~3% YoY decline in revenue for 2022. However, Jefferies analyst Glen Santangelo and the team expect TEVA to record low-single-digit growth from 2023 and beyond as the company recovers from heavy debt load and significant legal concerns.
