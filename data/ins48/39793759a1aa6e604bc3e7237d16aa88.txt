Alan Carr had a good laugh at the queen of pop's expense as he has put his own spin on Madonna's ‘coming out' video. 
The Material Girl singer went viral last week when she shared a TikTok video in which she appeared to come out as a gay. 
In the clip, Madonna, 64, played a game where she had throw a pair of knickers into a nearby bin but there was one rule: ‘If I miss, I'm gay,' and naturally, she missed the shot. 
Chatty Man host Alan, who is openly gay, decided to remix the challenge in his own video which was dubbed: ‘If I miss, I'm straight.
