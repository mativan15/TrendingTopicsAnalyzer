Bitcoin Group SE is weighing a bid for Bankhaus von der Heydt, the 268-year-old German bank that's stumbled with its own moves into cryptocurrencies and digital assets, people familiar with the matter said. Founded in 1754, Munich-based Bankhaus von der Heydt has been talking to potential buyers after a deal to sell itself to crypto-derivatives exchange BitMEX fell through, the people said. A sale may value the bank at around ₹20 million ($19.6 million), the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.
