RIDGELAND, S.C. — The PGA Tour will have a four-month stretch of 12 tournaments that are either majors or have $20 million purses in what figures to be a taxing year for the elite players.The tour will announce Wednesday that the WM Phoenix Open, RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, Wells Fargo Championship, and Travelers Championship in Connecticut will be part of the 'elevated events' the top players will be required to play, a person with direct knowledge of the plans told the Associated Press.The concept of elevated events was announced in late August as a response to the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league, aimed at bringing the best players together as often as 17 times, including the majors and the FedEx Cup playoffs.
