MIRAMAR BEACH, Fla. — The third season of Mike Leach with Mississippi State football will begin in the fall, and a contract extension could be on the horizon.

Leach, who was in Florida for the SEC spring meetings this week, said he thinks an extension is a possibility.

"Everything is moving down the road pretty productively," Leach told The Clarion Ledger.

Leach's contract runs from Jan. 9, 2020 until Dec. 31, 2023. That means he has two seasons left on his four-year-contract. Mississippi State law limits contracts to four years.
