Top Gun: Maverick is proving to be a major hit with moviegoers worldwide, with the Tom Cruise-starring sequel outperforming its pre-release box office projections.
The film sees Cruise reprise his role as Pete ‘Maverick' Mitchell alongside Jennifer Connelly and Jon Hamm, as he coaches a cohort of young fighter pilots before they carry out a dangerous mission.
Arriving almost 40 years after Tony Scott's 1986 smash hit original, Top Gun: Maverick is obviously loaded with nostalgia and direct references to the previous film.
