Truss's Brief Time As Prime Minister Comes With A Lifetime Financial Perk

Duration: 01:23

Despite her short time in office, Ms. Truss is eligible for a taxpayer-funded allowance of £115,000 pounds a year for the rest of her life. The so-called Public Duty Costs Allowance is a government reimbursement plan for former prime ministers after they leave office. This has drawn scorn, however, from some of Ms. Truss's political opponents, who have called for her to be refused the payment. "Truss's legacy is an economic disaster — for which the Conservatives are making taxpayers foot the bill," said Christine Jardine, the spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office of the Liberal Democrats.
