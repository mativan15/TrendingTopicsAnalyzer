A TORY MP has told the Commons he has lodged a letter of no confidence in Liz Truss, underlining the Prime Minister's fragile grip on Number 10.

After Tory whips warned a Labour-led vote on fracking tonight would be treated as a vote of confidence in the Government itself, William Wragg revealed he wanted to vote with Labour.

However he said he wouldn't do so in case he lost the Tory whip and his letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, no longer counted.
