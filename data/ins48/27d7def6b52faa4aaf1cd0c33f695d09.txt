(Bloomberg) -- Renault SA's third-quarter revenue advanced on strong demand for new electric models such as the Megane E-Tech, even as ongoing supply-chain constraints weighed on production.Group revenue climbed 21% to €9.8 billion ($9.6 billion) in the period, in line with analysts' estimates, the French company said Friday. Renault reaffirmed its guidance for 2022.Commercial sales, however, were hampered by a persistent shortage of semiconductors, declining 2.4% from the same period last year, the carmaker said.
