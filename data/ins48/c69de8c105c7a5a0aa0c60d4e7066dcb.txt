Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has called on the Taoiseach to introduce an immediate ban on disconnections because up to 200,000 people are now in electricity arrears.She said Micheál Martin promised three weeks ago to help but claimed nothing had been done and she added that there was a lack of urgency in the assurances that Minister for Environment Eamon Ryan was working with energy companies on proposals to assist families on pay-as-you-go meters.'Asking people to wait on the ‘never-never' for your plan is simply not good enough,' Ms McDonald said in the Dáil on Wednesday.
