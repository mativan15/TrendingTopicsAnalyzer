A jury has found actor Kevin Spacey not liable for battery in a civil lawsuit brought against him from actor Anthony Rapp, who has alleged that Spacey made a sexual advance on him in the 1980s.

Jurors released their decision in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, shortly after they began deliberating earlier in the day.

Rapp has accused Spacey of sexually abusing him in Spacey's apartment when Rapp was 14 years old after a party.

Spacey has entirely denied the allegations.

Rapp was an original cast member of the Broadway musical 'Rent' and currently has a role in the Paramount+ series 'Star Trek: Discovery.
