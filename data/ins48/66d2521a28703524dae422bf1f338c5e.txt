The interest rate cycle is finally on its way up thanks to multi-year high global and domestic inflation. To control inflation, like many other central banks across the world, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the repo rate by 0.40% on May 4, 2022 and hinted that more rate hikes are coming. The next rate hike will most certainly happen during the next monetary policy meeting of the RBI, which will culminate on June 8, 2011. Home loan borrowers, especially those who have taken the loan on floating rate basis, will have to bear the brunt as they would end up paying higher EMIs as the interest portion will go up sharply in coming months.
