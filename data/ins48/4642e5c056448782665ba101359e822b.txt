Every day, Kevin Crowder has people talking to him about politics. He's a barber in the Derbyshire town of Bakewell. Often, he says, his clients will sit and put the world to rights as he clips their tops.'Do you know what I say back to them?' he asks today. 'I agree. Whatever they're saying, I smile and nod. That's the secret to this job. You always sit on the fence.'What has he been ‘agreeing' with for the last 24 hours?'Well,' comes the reply. 'People want Boris back.'Barely a full day after Liz Truss resigned as prime minister and talk everywhere is already of who will replace her.
