This study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological status of cheese made from unpasteurized cows' milk, to examine the safety of the cheese and to observe the changes that occurred in its microbial community during ripening and storage. Furthermore, the pH, the moisture and salt concentration were also monitored throughout processing, ripening and storage. Seven cheesemaking trials took place along with the microbiological and physicochemical analysis of the milk, curd and cheese produced. The milk used for the cheesemaking, two curd samples before the heating and two after the heating, two cheese samples at days 3, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 were subjected to microbiological analysis for total mesophilic bacterial count (for milk only), Enterobacteriaceae, E.
