Published: 17:47 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 17:51 EDT, 31 May 2022 Lisa Rinna and Kelly Dodd were engaged in a petty feud on Tuesday as they both made insinuations that their respective husbands are gay.Using being gay as a slur - which is a form of homophobia - the Real Housewives of Orange County alum Dodd, 47, accused Rinna's husband Harry Hamlin of being homosexual, by referencing rumors surrounding Chrisley Knows Best star Todd Chrisley's sexuality. It has been claimed that Chrisley, 53, had a same-sex affair with his business partner Mark Braddock in the early 2000s despite being married to his wife, and Dodd made a comment on Instagram writing: 'Harry Hamlin is next,' alongside a cry-laughing emoji.
