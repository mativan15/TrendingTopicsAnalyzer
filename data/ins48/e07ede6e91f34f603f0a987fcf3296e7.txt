The agreement was in connection with a dispute about the settlement of certain restricted stock unit awards granted to Okamoto, who retired from his roles at the company last year. He was succeeded by the current CEO and chairman, Fred Thiel. Okamoto, meanwhile, agreed to a broad release of known or unknown claims against MARA relating to its 2018 incentive plan, the filling said.
