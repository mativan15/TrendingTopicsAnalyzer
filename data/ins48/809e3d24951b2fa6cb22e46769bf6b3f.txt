Pineapple farmers, who have stayed in business despite the difficulties faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, are heaving a sigh of relief as the price of the fruit has remained buoyant and remunerative over the last two months up to mid-October. The average price of pineapple (raw and fruit) had remained around ₹30 a kg for about nine months, giving hope for the new season, said Baby John, a veteran farmer in Vazhakkulam.
