Slash Film "Reservation Dogs" is must-see TV, the kind of series that offers so much more than what anyone could expect from its marketing. The FX series follows the titular Reservation Dogs, a crew of four Indigenous teenagers living on a reservation in rural Oklahoma, as they try to navigate growing up Native in the wake of losing their fifth member, Daniel (Dalton Cramer), to suicide. The series, created by Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi, is equal turns hilarious and heartwarming, eye-opening and gut-busting.
