The justice system has been left ill-equipped to deal with a growing 'fraud epidemic' as most resources are allocated to fighting 'traditional' crime, MPs have said.Just 2 per cent of police funding is dedicated to combating fraud despite it making up 40 per cent of reported crimes in England and Wales, the House of Commons Justice Committee found.An estimated 4.6 million offences of fraud are carried out each year at a cost to society of £4.7 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
