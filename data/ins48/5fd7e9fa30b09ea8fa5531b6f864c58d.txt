Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, one of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winners, is auctioning off the gold medal he received to raise funds for Ukraine. Muratov was the editor-in-chief of the now-censored Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. He won the Nobel prize alongside fellow journalist Maria Ressa of the Philippines for "their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression, which is a precondition for democracy and lasting peace." Muratov is now following through with his pledge in March to donate the medal to Ukrainian refugees after calling for an auction house to help him put the item up for sale.
