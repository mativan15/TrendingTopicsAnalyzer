He has $1.8 million in Bitcoin and can't get into his cryptocurrency wallet to get it because he doesn't remember who his best friend was in 2005. He says he can't get into his wallet because the login information is stored in his Hotmail account, and Hotmail won't let him log in. Someone apparently tried to log in to his Hotmail and the account has been locked as a result, so Hotmail is requiring him to send a text from his cellphone…that he had in 2010, but no longer has access to.
