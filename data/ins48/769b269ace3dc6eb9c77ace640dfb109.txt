We have all grown up watching Cartoon Network. It was the first dedicated children's television channel in India, and was launched in 1995. Initially airing Hanna-Barbera cartoons in the ‘90s, the channel also started airing its original shows like Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls, well into the early 2000s. These shows helped shape the childhood of many. The Toonami programming block that began in 2001 introduced action shows from Japan, like Dragon Ball Z and Inazuma Eleven in India.
