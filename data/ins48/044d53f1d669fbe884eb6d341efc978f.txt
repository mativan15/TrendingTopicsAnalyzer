The Platinum Card® from American Express (Terms apply. See rates & fees) is one of the oldest and most well-known cards in the premium travel card segment. While the American Express Platinum card's annual fee is much higher at $695 per year, the Amex Platinum card offers plenty of value that most cardmembers would agree justifies the annual fee.
If you're looking for lounge access, the American Express Platinum serves up a compelling offering. In addition to an included Priority Pass membership, the American Express Platinum card offers access to American Express Centurion lounges, Escape lounges and also Delta Sky Club lounges when you are traveling on a same-day Delta Air Lines flight.
