da-kuk/E+ via Getty Images Telos (NASDAQ:TLS) shares gained sharply on Thursday after the systems software provider said it has received an approval to become identity management operator for U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Stock is up 12% at pixel time to trade at $9.35. The approval positions Telos as TSA's authorised PreCheck enrollment provider, according to the SEC filing dated Oct. 18. The Virginia-based tech provider said it has already started off the trial by providing TSA PreCheck enrollment services to a limited population of applicants in order to validate systems and processes in advance of its full implementation.
