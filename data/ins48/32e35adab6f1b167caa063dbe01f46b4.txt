A French cement company has been charged in the United States with making $10 million in payments to the Islamic State and another terrorist group in exchange for the protection of its plant in Syria, the Department of Justice said Tuesday.

Lafarge paid ISIS and the al-Nusrah Front from August 2013 to October 2014 when ISIS was carrying out kidnappings and beheadings and transmitting waves of propaganda designed to inspire terrorist attacks against innocent civilians, prosecutors said.

The company pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group and agreed to pay a financial penalty of $778 million.
