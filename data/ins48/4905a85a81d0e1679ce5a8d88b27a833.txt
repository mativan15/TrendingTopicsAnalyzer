The Jharkhand High Court on Friday accepted the maintainability of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking probe against Chief Minister Hemant Soren for his alleged role in the mining scam of the State. The court fixed June 10 as the next date of hearing.
The Division Bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad had concluded the hearing on Wednesday; on the directive of the Supreme Court, the order was passed on Friday.The two-judge Bench observed that there was no anomaly in the PIL filed by Shiv Shankar Sharma and there was no bar on why it couldn't be heard in the High Court.
