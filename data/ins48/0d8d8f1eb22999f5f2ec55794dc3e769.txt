House Republicans are eyeing reforms to Social Security and Medicare if they retake the lower chamber in November, but they're charting a cautious path when it comes to disclosing details on how they will change the programs in the final stretch to the midterm elections.

They're also keeping a safe distance from a proposal crafted by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the chamber's campaign arm, which calls for reigning in government spending — a blueprint that sparked backlash from Democrats and some Republicans.
