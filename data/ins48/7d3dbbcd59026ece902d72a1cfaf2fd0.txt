By Stuart Condie SYDNEY--Appen Ltd.'s shares slumped close to a five-year low after Citi analysts downgraded the stock on risk that the data annotation company could miss its annual earnings guidance.

"Appen management noted that... the weakness was primarily due to one customer, which we see as likely being Facebook based on our website visit analysis," the analysts said in a note.
