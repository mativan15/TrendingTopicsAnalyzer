October 19, 2022—Recently, nutrition research has been linking both hunger and obesity to the same problem—diets high in sugar and refined starch. Experts from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health commented in an October 5, 2022, Washington Post article about the growing consensus that the kind of food people eat is more important for healthy weight than the number of calories consumed.
'That puzzled me for many years—how could it be that people who were hungry or didn't seem to have enough money to buy enough food could be more overweight or obese than people who had lots of resources,' said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.
