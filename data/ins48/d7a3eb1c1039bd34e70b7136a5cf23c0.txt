In an industry long dominated by men, Cheryl Paglierani is among the female agents ushering in a new generation of leaders. Recently named a partner at UTA, where her clients include Post Malone, Dominic Fike, Flo Milli and Offset, Paglierani came up under Cara Lewis, another trailblazing woman in music. Since her start in 2008, Paglierani spent multiple years at premiere agencies WME and CAA, before landing at the Agency Group ahead of its purchase by UTA. Paglierani couldn't be better positioned at UTA today, as the agency's music department is seeing a 2022 peak with Bad Bunny's current stadium tour.
