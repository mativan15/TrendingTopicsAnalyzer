iStockThis is part of IRDAI's endeavour to boost ease of doing business.The government may infuse about ₹5,000 crore equity into state-run general insurers to help them achieve solvency requirements as they meet an inflated wage bill, said two executives aware of the matter. The employee wage revision approved earlier this month, along with five-year arrears payments, are expected to cost the four general insurers an additional ₹8,000 crore. This planned equity support is over and above the ₹5,000 crore already infused this year in National Insurance (₹3,700 crore), Oriental Insurance (₹ 1,200 crore) and United India Insurance (₹100 crore).
