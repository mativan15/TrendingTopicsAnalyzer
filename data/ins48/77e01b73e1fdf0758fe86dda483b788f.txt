The NSW government is facing calls to invest some of the proceeds from the record $100 million fine slapped on embattled casino giant Star Entertainment Group into independent initiatives to reduce gambling harm.Prominent doctors, religious groups, anti-gambling advocates and the NSW Greens are all urging the state government to allocate at least 25 per cent of the $100 million penalty into establishing an independent gambling harm reduction foundation.The casino group was handed the fine after a four-month independent inquiry, led by Adam Bell SC, found it had a deep-rooted cultural problem and had failed to stem criminal activity including money laundering.
