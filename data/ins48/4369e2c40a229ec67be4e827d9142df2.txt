Social media scams are nothing new, but cyberthieves continue to think up new ploys to get your personal information. If you use Instagram, you might've noticed a sudden uptick of strangers tagging you in posts about winning a free iPhone 13. All you have to do is click the link in the description to claim it, the post says. This scheme isn't new: It has reportedly resurfaced every few years along with the release of a new iPhone. If you've been tagged in one -- or several -- of these posts, sorry, but there's no free phone waiting for you.
