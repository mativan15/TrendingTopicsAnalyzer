: The Haryana cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance to amend the Haryana Sikh Gurdwaras (Management) Act. The ordinance which will be promulgated by the governor provides for constituting an ad-hoc committee on more than one occasion if the elected committee to manage the Haryana gurdwaras could not be constituted. The proposed amendment will help the state government settle the internecine struggle between Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Baljit Singh Daduwal and his predecessor Jagdish Singh Jhinda for the control of the Sikh body.
