Over the summer, as part of a broader Republican offensive against the FBI, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee went so far as to warn Fox News viewers of a 'cabal' within the FBI that she said has politicized the agency's work.Yesterday, as a Washington Post report noted, the GOP member of the Senate Judiciary Committee used the same word while taking rhetorical aim at the White House.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said Monday that White House staffers are trying to 'keep the pandemic going' so that they can spend more taxpayer money and prompt more people to vote via mail-in ballot.
