One of the most iconic and storied fighting games series returns to Xbox in 2023 when Street Fighter 6 launches for Xbox Series X|S. Powered by RE Engine, the same tech that has given us gorgeous photorealistic visuals to Capcom franchises like Resident Evil and Devil May Cry, Street Fighter 6 is shaping up to be the best-looking entry in the series. While we eagerly await the full cast of fighters to be revealed, we were stoked to see the return of some fan-favorite legendary warriors like Ryu and Chun-Li, as well as recent stars like Luke from Street Fighter V and the newest reveal, Jamie, who not only looks to be a master break-dancer, but also comes equipped with a wide range of fighting styles.
