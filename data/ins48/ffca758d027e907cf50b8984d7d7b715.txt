UVALDE, Texas—On a day meant to remember two of those killed in the massacre that took place last week here, the overall feeling was anger.

Many in the community are finding it hard to properly grieve the 21 lives lost when there seems to be so much injustice and an overall lack of trust in those who were sworn to protect and serve.

'Mistakes were made and we have no promise that they will never happen again,' said Peter Vasquez, a friend of 10-year-old victim Maite Rodriguez.
