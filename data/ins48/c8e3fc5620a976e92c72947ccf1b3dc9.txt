A man has been arrested after a dispute between an employer and former employee at an Aurora business led to a fatal shooting, the Aurora Police Department said in a news release.
Lloyd Clifford Love, 35, of Aurora, was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder in the shooting, but it's not clear whether Love was the employer or the former employee in the dispute.
Officers first responded to a report of a trespassing at a business in the 16800 block of Centretech Parkway about 7 p.m., but while officers were on their way, the call was upgraded to a shooting.
