Fireworks appear to have been launched in the direction of Just Stop Oil protesters in a bid to get them off the Dartford Crossing.

The bridge has now been closed for more than 24 hours, angering thousands of commuters who need to use the vital route each day.
A nine-second clip circulating across social media last night shows sparks lighting up the sky as people laugh in the background.
