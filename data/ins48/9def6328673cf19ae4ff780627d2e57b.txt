When it comes to good skincare, we're ready to try some pretty outlandish things to get our skin looking as good as Hailey Bieber's. This is how we ended up researching a baby ointment that, apparently, works just as well as our beloved Aquaphor—but for a lower price tag. For those who might not be familiar: Aquaphor is a use-anywhere healing ointment that's beloved by skincare obsessives for its ability to heal and repair dry skin. It's so good, Mrs. Bieber herself swears by it.

See, it started when we were perusing around online shopping (as we do daily) when we noticed that so many reviewers kept noting the similarity between an Amazon baby ointment and Aquaphor.
