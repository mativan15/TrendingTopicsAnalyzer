"Harry Potter" star Tom Felton is spilling the details on his co-star Daniel Radcliffe's celebrity crush. In Felton's new memoir, "Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard," he shared that Radcliffe used a photo of Cameron Diaz to help guide him on where to look while filming the flying broomstick scenes. "The approach was that if a piece of magic or any kind of special effect could be achieved practically, that was the best way to do it," Felton explained, according to excerpts shared by Insider.
