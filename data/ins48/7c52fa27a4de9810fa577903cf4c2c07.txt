Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler backs Community Kitchen for hungry families in West DerbyI don't normally talk about my charity initiatives, but I do want to bring some attention to the important and incredible work done by the football-related organisation, Fans Supporting Foodbanks. I've donated to fund a special project set up by Liverpool West Derby MP Ian Byrne, who is a co-founded of FSF, and who leads the Right to Food campaign in parliament.
