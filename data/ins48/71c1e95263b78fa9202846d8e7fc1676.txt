The demand for handsets and appliances has slumped due to high retail inflation but wearables and hearables seem to be booming with high growth in shipments and demand tailwinds from the pandemic, say company executives and analysts. Smartwatches grew at a record 173% on-year in the first quarter of 2022, while the wireless earbuds category surged by 66% on-year during the same period, according to Counterpoint Research. This was driven by low average selling prices, which analysts say are not pinching the pockets of consumers as much as smartphones.
