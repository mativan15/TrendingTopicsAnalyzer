This dividend stock yields 10.4%. But really it boasts an annual 'hidden yield' of 18.4% when we consider buybacks. Eighteen-point four percent per year. Wait, what?! (Your strategist pauses to point upwards towards the late, great Norm Macdonald.) Now what if I told you this stock was also being heavily shorted? Over 11% of this company's outstanding shares are being sold short. This is fuel for a potential rally because these positions must be bought back later.
