The criminal tax-fraud trial of the Trump Organization begins on Monday, and the outcome could impact more than the coffers of former President Donald Trump's family business.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office has charged two of the business entities within the Trump Organization—the Trump Corporation and Trump Payroll Corp.—with running a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities. Prosecutors allege that the scheme allowed certain executives to receive large portions of their compensation through disguised means, allowing them to underreport their income.
