Just objectively speaking, the funniest moment of the 2022 MLB season was when San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson said, in relaying a relevant backstory to reporters: 'He kind of came up and said, ‘You remember from last year?' and I said, ‘Fantasy football?‘ and he said ‘Yeah.''

The 'he' in question is Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham. The context is that Pham literally slapped Pederson across the face on the field before a game Friday night, in plain view of other players and, apparently, at least one camera.
