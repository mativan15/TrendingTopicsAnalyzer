This handout illustration released on October 20, 2022 by Paris 2024 Olympic Committee shows the Paris Paralympics opening ceremony on August 28, 2024 which will take place on Place de la Concorde, in Paris. HANDOUT / AFP Paris organizers on Thursday, October 20, announced their opening ceremony plans for the Paralympics, an event with 4,400 athletes that will follow the first post-COVID-19 pandemic Olympics in less than two years. The attention-grabber is the venue itself: In a first, the Paralympic opening show will be freed from a traditional stadium setting and instead be held in the open in the French capital's heart, on the Champs-Elysées boulevard and the city's biggest square, Place de la Concorde.
