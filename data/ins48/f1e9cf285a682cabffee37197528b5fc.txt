Help us celebrate Pro Bono Week! Pro Bono Week (October 23-29, 2022) is a global campaign that celebrates the power of pro bono service in communities. This week allows us to recognize the commitment of skilled volunteers providing their services pro bono and the social change organizations harnessing that talent to advance their missions forward.
