Lexus premiered the new, fifth-generation of its most popular SUV on Tuesday. The 2023 Lexus RX will offer four new powertrains (three of which are electrified), a new 14-inch multimedia screen and two new trims with all-wheel drive.The midsize RX is the current and longtime leader in sales against its luxury rivals. Initially hitting the market for the 1998 model year, Lexus sold about 115,000 RX SUVs in 2021, almost doubling its next closest competitors from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.The top-to-bottom redesign has resulted in a vehicle that's lower to the ground, 198 pounds lighter than the previous model and more spacious with wheels pushed further to the corners in a stance that recalls the LF-1 Limitless concept vehicle from 2018.
