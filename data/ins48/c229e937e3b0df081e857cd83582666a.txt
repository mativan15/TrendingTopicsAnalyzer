By Paul Vieira OTTAWA -- Canada's Liberal government said Wednesday it intended to introduce legislation before the end of next year that would ban the use of replacement workers in federally-regulated industries in the event of a strike or other labor dispute. Telecommunications, railroads, and airlines are among the key industries that fall under federal-government oversight. "This will make sure that all workers in federally regulated sectors continue to benefit from a meaningful right to strike," said Seamus O'Regan, Canada's labor minister.
