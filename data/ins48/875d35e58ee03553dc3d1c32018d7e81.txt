Oct. 15—TAZEWELL, Va. — Former Virginia Governor and U.S. Senator George Allen says he has no intention of running for political office again.

During a stop in Tazewell County Thursday with Attorney General Jason Miyares on a listening tour, Allen said he is now on the sidelines of the political arena.

"I am no longer on the field, I am coaching on the sidelines," Allen, the son of the late former Washington Redskins Coach George Allen, said, adding that Miyares is a good friend who helped in his Senate campaign.
