MÄNNEDORF, Switzerland — 'Crystals are fun,' according to Alexis Nasard, chief executive officer of Swarovski, a brand he believes represents 'joy and self-expression. Luxury doesn't have to be serious.'

In his first interview since taking the reins of the Austrian crystal-maker in July and speaking from the modern, light-filled and sprawling Swarovski offices in Männedorf, a 30-minute drive from Zürich, Nasard is set on leveraging the brand's 'strong personality' to steer the company through its next phase.
