Stakeholders in the cotton sector here have given their suggestions to a special committee on cotton formed by the Union government. J. Thulasidharan, president of Indian Cotton Federation, said the committee had a meeting recently in Mumbai to discuss the cotton crisis. With increase in cotton consumption and steady drop in yield per acre, the present trend of high cotton price and shortage of cotton may continue in the next cotton season that starts in October. During peak season the value of cotton arrival will be approximately  ₹ 1,200 crores a day.
