The announcement that Sunlight Batteries USA plans its American headquarters in Mebane was more than news of another factory, industrial investment, and jobs. It was a sign that the Triad may be developing a cluster of companies dealing in arguably one of the key technologies of the rest of the 21 st century: lithium-ion energy storage.

Sunlight, based in Athens, Greece, announced last week it plans a 130- employee, $40 million assembly plant, distribution center, and U.S. headquarters for Mebane.
