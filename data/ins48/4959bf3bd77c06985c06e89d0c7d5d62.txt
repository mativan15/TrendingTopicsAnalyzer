Balthazar owner Keith McNally is hitting back at James Corden.On Friday, Corden did an interview with the New York Times, where he claimed he "didn't do anything wrong" during his two visits to the restaurateur's upscale New York City eatery.Earlier in the week, McNally had taken to Instagram and called Corden out for being "abusive" to his restaurant staff and a "tiny Cretin of a man," which led him to briefly banning Corden from the establishment. A few hours later, McNally returned to Instagram to share that the "Late Late Show" host had called him and apologized.
