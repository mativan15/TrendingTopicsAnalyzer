Hello! I'll try to keep this brief. I am no fancy career woman by any means but I've come to an impass and I'm just looking for some advice from people who don't know me (family and friends have really only given the follow your heart spiel).

I have worked in the library world for the past two years as an americorps member (like the peace corps) I fell in love with library work and the library specifically I worked at I'll call it library A.

When my americorps term ended I really wanted to work for library A, as I loved my patrons and my coworkers.
