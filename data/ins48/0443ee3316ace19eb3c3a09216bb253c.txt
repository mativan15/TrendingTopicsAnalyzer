The ninth-ranked Bluejays received eight first-place votes from the league's coaches Tuesday. Creighton returns three double-digit scorers from last season's team that finished 23-12 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Coach Greg McDermott didn't put too much stock in the Bluejays' place in the preseason poll.
