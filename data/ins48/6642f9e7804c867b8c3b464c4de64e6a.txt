Regulators in four states simultaneously filed emergency cease-and-desist orders Thursday against virtual casino Slotie.

States law enforcement officials allege Slotie's owners were soliciting investors online to participate in an illegal gambling operation in the metaverse, a digital world where participants can interact with each other, purchase products and gamble. State securities boards in Texas, Kentucky, New Jersey and Alabama accused Slotie of defrauding investors and ordered it to immediately halt the sale of its non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, to retail investors.
