sykono Copper giant Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) reported third quarter earnings yesterday, and results were decent, but not great. The company has seen its share price crushed from 2022 highs as its principal commodity - copper - has had a rough go of it. The last time I covered Freeport, I said copper looked weak and that meant that Freeport would be weak as well. I slapped a sell rating on Freeport as a result, and after Q3 earnings, I still don't see anything to like here. I'm sticking with my sell rating, because I think there are numerous places where your capital will be better utilized.
