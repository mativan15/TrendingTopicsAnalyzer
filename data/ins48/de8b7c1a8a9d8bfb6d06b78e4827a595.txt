As We See It canceled after 1 season by Amazon Prime Video

As We See It will not see a second season.

The heartfelt Amazon Prime Video comedy-drama about three twentysomething roommates on the autism spectrum has been canceled, the streaming service confirmed on Thursday.

As We See It featured a trio of actors — Sue Ann Pien, Rick Glassman, and Albert Rutecki — who are on the spectrum in real life, and it was executive produced and run by Jason Katims (Friday Night Lights), whose son is autistic.
