BLOOMINGTON — In the biggest game of her young life, Newark's Kodi Rizzo needed a few warm-up pitches to get going Monday. But the seventh time seemed to be the charm.Her first six pitches against Heyworth were outside the strike zone.'It always takes me a batter or two,' Rizzo said afterward, shrugging her shoulders. 'But once I relax and get into a rhythm, it all comes naturally to me.'From that point on, Rizzo was The Natural.The sophomore right-hander threw a one-hitter and struck out 11 in 4 2/3 innings as Newark earned a 1-0 victory in the Class 1A Illinois Wesleyan Supersectional.
