A picture shows a dog peeing on a campaign sign for former U.S. President Donald Trump. Since at least September 2020, social media users have shared a picture that appeared to show a dog peeing on a 'Make America Great Again' campaign sign for former U.S. President Donald Trump. However, this was a doctored photograph. The original picture showed the dog urinating on a sign in support of U.S. President Joe Biden. The real photograph was still popular in Facebook groups in October 2022. One of the most popular postings of the altered picture that misleadingly showed the Trump sign was found on the r/pics subreddit on Reddit.
