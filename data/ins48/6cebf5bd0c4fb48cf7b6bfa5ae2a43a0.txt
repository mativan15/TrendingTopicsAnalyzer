So, the Bank of England is moving ahead with selling £80bn of UK government bonds from 1 November, a day later than originally announced, to avoid a clash with the government setting out its debt-cutting plan.With inflation booming, the Bank's planned sales serve as a secondary means of cooling prices, alongside raising interest rates. It currently has £838bn of government IOUs on its books, dating from 2009. The portfolio was built up during the extended spell of asset purchases or 'quantitative easing'.
