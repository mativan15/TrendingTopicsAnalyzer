LONDON (Reuters) - New British finance minister Jeremy Hunt will announce tax and spending measures on Monday, two weeks earlier than scheduled, as he races to stem a dramatic loss of investor confidence in Prime Minister Liz Truss's government.

Battling to rewrite Truss's economic programme since he replaced the fired Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, Hunt is expected to make a statement around 11:00 a.m. (1000 GMT) to try to halt a bond market rout that has raged since the government set out vast unfunded tax cuts on Sept.
