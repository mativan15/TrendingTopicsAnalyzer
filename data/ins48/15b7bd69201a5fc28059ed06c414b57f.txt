After Truss 

 A bookmaker takes bets for the next British Prime Minister after Liz Truss resigned on October 20, 2022. © Alberto Pezzali, AP Liz Truss said on Thursday she would resign as British prime minister just six weeks into the job, triggering another a leadership contest – the second in just four months – for the UK's fractured and demoralised Conservative Party. Truss will go down in history as Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, a leader whose grasp on power was so tenuous in recent days it spawned a jokey online contest to see whether she would outlast a head of lettuce.
