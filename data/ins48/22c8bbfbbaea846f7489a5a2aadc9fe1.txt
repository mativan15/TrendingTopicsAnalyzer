Indiewire Television Kanye West is facing a 250 million lawsuit from George Floyd's family.The potential suit follows West's comments on a 'Drink Champs' episode since removed from YouTube, in which West defamed Floyd, falsely saying he died of a fentanyl overdose instead of being murdered by Minneapolis police officers. The cause of death was formally listed as homicide. Former cop Derek Chauvin was convicted in Floyd's death and is currently serving a 22-year sentence.
