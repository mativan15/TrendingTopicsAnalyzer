OneTeam Partners, which represents the commercial interests of more than 10,000 athletes, is realigning its executives and centralizing its business units under a plan approved at a board meeting yesterday. The changes include 10% of the 60-person company losing their jobs, according to multiple people who were not authorized to speak publicly about the moves. The layoffs targeted the sales staff, as the company focuses on its core licensing business.

Eric Winston, former president of the NFL Players Association and a former NFL player, will have expanded oversight of OneTeam's group licensing business, including consumer products and college NIL.
