Something is up with Isaiah Wynn.
The New England Patriots left tackle is exercising his right to skip voluntary organized team activities. And though that's absolutely within the rules for every player, there's a reason why highly-paid tight end Jonnu Smith and receiver Nelson Agholor are in attendance for this year's sessions.
Wynn is entering the final year of his contract and will earn $10.4 million after the Patriots exercised the fifth-year option in his contract — and before the team watched him underwhelm in 2021.
