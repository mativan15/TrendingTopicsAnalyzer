The mum of a student with a rare condition that leaves her unable to eat without instantly throwing up has said seeing her daughter like that is 'soul destroying.'

Emma Tuck, 22, became ill 'out of the blue' three years ago when she developed a bilateral kidney stone which led to an infected kidney.

She had surgery and went on antibiotics to help fight the infection, but this suddenly killed her natural gut bacteria and paralysed her gastrointestinal system, meaning she could not digest her food.
