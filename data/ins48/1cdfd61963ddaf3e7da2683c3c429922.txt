This is the 2022 Audi SQ7, a luxury three-row crossover with tons of power and tech -- and a price to match. This rig comes standard with a few drive-centric features like adaptive air suspension and rear-wheel steering. Under the hood is a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine with 500 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque. An available Sport Package includes a torque-vectoring rear differential. The SQ7 has three rows of seats. Fold all those seats down and you've got room for a Costco run. For 2022 adaptive cruise assist with traffic jam assist as well as Audi's active lane assist with emergency assist are both standard.
