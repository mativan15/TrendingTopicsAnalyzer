A £900m class action claim against Amazon accuses the company of pushing customers towards 'offers' that benefit the online retailer, but aren't good deals for users.The complaint, which is to be filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, focuses on the company's 'Buy Box' feature, which artificially promotes certain items above the rest in response to user searches.'Many consumers believe that Amazon offers good choice and value, but instead it uses tricks of design to manipulate consumer choice and direct customers towards the featured offer in its Buy Box,' said Julie Hunter, a consumer advocate and the class representative.
