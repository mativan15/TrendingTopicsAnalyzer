Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has taken a swipe back at the cruel trolls calling her ‘mutton dressed as lamb'.
The head judge on the BBC show, who sits beside Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, and Anton Du Beke, has previously addressed the trolls who have sent her abusive messages online.
But over the weekend she'd clearly had enough, and responded to some of the messages calling her names including ‘fake' on social media.
Instead of taking a swipe and swooping as low as the trolls however, Shirley's appeared to adopt the kill them with kindness approach.
