European Union leaders are set to agree in principle to ban oil imports from Russia at a summit on Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, but after weeks of haggling they will leave decisions on how it will work for later, diplomats said.
We're going towards a deal on a sixth package of sanctions,' French President Emmanuel Macron said as he arrived at a meeting of centrist leaders ahead of the summit.
According to a new draft of the summit conclusions, the 27 nations will agree that Russian oil imports into EU countries will be banned, though with a temporary exemption for crude delivered by pipeline.
