June 01, 2022 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regions Bank on Wednesday announced the results of a new homeownership survey that finds an increasing number of people are remodeling their homes in an effort to raise its value. This comes as the homebuying market remains very competitive, with some people choosing to upgrade their current homes rather than look for a new house.



June is National Homeownership Month, and the survey was conducted by Regions Next Step, the bank's no-cost financial education program that serves people of all ages, regardless of whether they bank with Regions.
