The person who devised this brain-wracking game is David Mah. People call him an 'evil genius'. But he is sure that there are many like him who love to play word games. Most of you already know the rules, but for the first-timers, I shall go over them again. Well, Quordle is all about guessing the right word. The words are 5 letters and you have to guess all 4 words to win. Every day the hints are provided and if you have a penchant for words this would be a cakewalk. They are simple words, but the problem is that you have to guess them correctly.
