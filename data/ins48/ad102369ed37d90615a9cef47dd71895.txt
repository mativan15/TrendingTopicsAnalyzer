Geena Davis said this week she's "grateful" she had her three children later in life because she hoped she would be "more evolved" as a person and a better parent for them to model. The 66-year-old actress told the co-hosts of British talk show "Loose Women" on Wednesday "I'm just really grateful that I had children in my 40s. And I wanted to wait, hoping that I could still have kids but I thought I'll be more evolved the later – longer that I wait because I did have a sense that I wasn't – that I didn't have a lot of self-esteem, I guess is what you'd call it, but I was really determined that my kids would have self-esteem.
