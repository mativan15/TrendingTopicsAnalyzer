Neither Seth Curry nor Joe Harris will be ready for the Brooklyn Nets' season opener this week.

The Nets confirmed on Sunday that the two will miss their opener on Wednesday night against the New Orleans Pelicans while rehabbing their respective injuries. Curry is dealing with a left ankle injury, and Harris a left foot injury.

It's unclear how long the two will be sidelined, but coach Steve Nash didn't sound too worried about the setback.

"I'm not concerned. I'm positive. I'm optimistic," Nash said Sunday, via ESPN.
