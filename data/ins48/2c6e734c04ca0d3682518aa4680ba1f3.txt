The Karnataka High Court has quashed a Magistrate court order permitting the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to question five undertrials who are in judicial custody in a Special Court case. The case pertained to Harsha D, a first divisional clerk who was arrested in the police sub-inspector recruitment scam earlier this year. The first case against him was filed in the Chowk Police Station in the district headquarters town of Kalaburagi which was later transferred to the CID (Crime Investigation Department).
