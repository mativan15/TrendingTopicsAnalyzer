Spender says neither major party has done enough to increase housing supply. She will urge the federal government to pay the states and councils to increase and exceed their housing targets.When it comes to health and education - Labor's bread and butter - Spender wants to see greater scrutiny of spending. Teachers need to spend more time with their students, she says, while her experience working as a 'change leader' at a major UK teaching hospital highlighted a system in which people often occupy beds longer than they need.
