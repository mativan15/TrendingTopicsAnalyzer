Florida cannabis regulators are in need of additional funds to keep the state's burgeoning medical marijuana market up and running, reported Florida Politics. To address the growing demand for medical cannabis, the Florida Department of Health (DOH) has incorporated a $6.2 million increase for the Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) in its state Fiscal Year (FY) 2023-24 legislative budget request (LBR). Half of the $6.2 million request from OMMU would cover hiring additional 31 full-time employees to serve in its Tallahassee headquarters and new regional offices.
