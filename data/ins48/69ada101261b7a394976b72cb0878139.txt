A leading cardiologist at the BC Children's Hospital has helped uncover a link between electronic gaming and a possibly fatal heart rhythm in susceptible children.
The peer-reviewed report published this week documented an uncommon but distinct pattern among kids who lost consciousness suddenly while playing video games.It found cardiac arrhythmias triggered by the activity could be deadly in youth with predisposing, but often previously-unrecognized heartbeat conditions, said co-author Dr. Shubhayan Sanatani in Vancouver.
