Shonda Wells' — mother of Olympian Tamyra Mensah-Stock — ultimate dream may have been delayed, but it surely wasn't denied.

After having to hold off on running her BBQ establishment due to a lack of resources, the longtime chef has officially received her food truck, USA TODAY Sports reports.

A Dream Come True

As previously reported by AfroTech, Cameron Davies, owner of Cruising Kitchens — a San Antonio-based mobile food construction company — equipped Wells with a $250,000 food truck. In its building process of just about four months, he has kept his promise of getting Wells out on the road.
