Bird flu has been confirmed in domestic flocks in Orkney and Lewis.

The Scottish government said the small flocks of fowl at Tankerness in Orkney and Great Bernera, Lewis, had been isolated.

Exclusion zones have been put in place in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, which is fatal for birds.

The UK government has announced all bird keepers in England, Scotland and Wales must implement strict biosecurity measures to stop bird flu spreading.

The Department of Agriculture introduced the measure on Monday amid the country's largest ever outbreak of avian flu.
