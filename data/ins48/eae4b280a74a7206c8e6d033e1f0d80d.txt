Mike Keenan will be leading the Italian men's national hockey team as head coach, the Italian Ice Sports Federation announced Tuesday.

Keenan, 72, coached eight teams in the NHL over a span of 25 years from 1984 to 2009.

Italy, which did not compete in the 2022 Beijing Games, is set to host the 2026 Winter Olympics. Host countries get automatic entries into Olympic competition for hockey.

Keenan won the Jack Adams Award in his first year as a head coach with the Philadelphia Flyers and also led the New York Rangers to a Stanley Cup title in 1994.
