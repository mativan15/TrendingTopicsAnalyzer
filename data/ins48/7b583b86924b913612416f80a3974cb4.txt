Q: At my table at a recent event one male guest thought it was appropriate to belittle the women from other companies in an offensive way. As a business we have a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment, but how do we prevent 'rogue' employees from acting improperly in situations like that?A: Employers are unable to police what their employees do or say all the time and unfortunately there are still individuals who consider that making sex-related comments is fine if they are a 'joke'. Equally a workplace, or a dinner event, where social interaction is entirely constrained will not be good for morale, staff retention or the mood of those attending.
