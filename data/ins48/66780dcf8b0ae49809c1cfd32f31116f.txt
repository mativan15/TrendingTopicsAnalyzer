Roberto Gonzalez/Getty Images News With mortgage rates running higher unabated and mortgage demand decimated, homebuilder sentiment has continued to tank. The latest reading on homebuilder sentiment from the NAHB hit a new post-pandemic low in October, dropping from 46 down to 38. Outside of the weaker readings in May and April 2020, August 2012 was the last time the index was as low as it is now. Not only is the index at a new cycle low, but the 8-point month-over-month drop also ranks in the bottom 1% of all monthly moves.
