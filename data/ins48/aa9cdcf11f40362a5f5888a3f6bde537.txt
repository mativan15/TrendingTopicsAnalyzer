British Columbia, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following is a statement from Better Deltaport: For years, the Port of Vancouver, a federal government agency that reports to the Minister of Transport, has been undertaking advertising targeted at the federal government.  Billboards near Parliament Hill and at the Ottawa Airport. Ads in The Hill Times, iPolitics, National Newswatch and other media outlets. Ads on social media. All these ads have been promoting the Port's proposed Roberts Bank Terminal 2 in an effort to obtain Ottawa's approval for a flawed, massively expensive, taxpayer-funded, and unnecessary megaproject that will be devasting to the environment.
