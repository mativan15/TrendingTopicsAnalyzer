Every investor in Fossil Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FOSL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. I generally like to see some degree of insider ownership, even if only a little. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb said, 'Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.

Fossil Group is a smaller company with a market capitalization of US$383m, so it may still be flying under the radar of many institutional investors.
