Security forces in Iran extended their crackdown against protesters across the country as demonstrations aimed at bringing down the government enter a fifth week with little sign of abating.

Social media footage showed violent clashes in the northwestern city of Ardabil, which have gained in intensity since unconfirmed reports that a young girl was killed Thursday after plainclothes officers stormed her school. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency denied reports of the killing in Ardabil on Thursday, citing a police statement.
