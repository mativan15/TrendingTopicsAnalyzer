OPINION: Is the radical, anti-American left only outraged by shooting deaths of children, and not the far more prolific, drug-related shooting deaths? Do Second Amendment abolitionists realize that no action taken to deny a constitutional right to law-abiding citizens will deter the deranged? More despicably, are Biden supporters comfortable ignoring their man's non-legislative order (ending southern-border wall construction) that cruelly enables more child-killing fentanyl to reach us? Uvalde, Buffalo and Waukesha remind us of America's growing evils.
