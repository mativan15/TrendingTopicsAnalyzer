A COMMUNITY football tournament has helped raise tens of thousands of pounds for a leading homeless charity in Southend

The World Cup-on-Sea saw 32 businesses set-up teams and compete at Roots Hall in a seven-a-side football tournament to raise money for HARP.

Organisers say the event has already raised a staggering £27,000 and expect the total to keep on rising.

Funds were raised by teams paying an entry fee to play in the tournament, while spectators watching from the stands also paid an admission fee.
