Ivory peddlers may continue to sell elephant tusks after a new ban by disguising their products as walrus or narwhal derivatives, campaigners have warned.From Monday, trade in elephant teeth and tusks is illegal in the UK, punishable by fines of up to £250,000 or up to five years in prison under the Ivory Act. Pre-1975 musical instruments and antique items of 'outstanding importance' are exempted from the act, as well as ivory from non-elephant species.But Born Free Foundation, a wildlife charity, is calling for the ban to be extended to the ivory of other species, saying unscrupulous sellers might otherwise pass off elephant products as derivatives from unprotected mammals.
