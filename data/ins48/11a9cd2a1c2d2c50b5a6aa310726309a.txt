May 27—Letters from Will Rogers adolescences, glass slides of movie posters, studio contracts, movie scripts, and costumes are just a few of the 30,000 unseen items at the Will Rogers Memorial Museum that now have the chance to be on display.

Governor Kevin Stitt signed House Bill 4099 Thursday, which provides the Oklahoma Historical Society with $46 million to address needs at 23 historical sites — including the Will Rogers Memorial Museum.

The Will Rogers Memorial Museum will receive $7 million which will be used to create a new entrance, a new event center, add a new vault up to modern preservation standards and make the museum ADA compliant by adding elevators.
