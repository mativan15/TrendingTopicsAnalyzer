Now is the time for neighbouring councils to offer a helping hand with the rising costs of building a central Christchurch stadium, say two city councillors. On Wednesday it was revealed the budget for the city's 30,000-seat covered stadium is projected to rise by as much as $150 million, taking the total price tag up to $683m. The Christchurch public will be consulted on whether the project should proceed. The revelation of the blowout's extent has shocked Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel.
