What a strange, transitional year TV is having! So far, we've seen Netflix falter and CNN+ flop. A lot of fantastic old shows have recently returned from extended pandemic hiatuses—but, for me, the pleasures of getting reacquainted with Atlanta, Better Call Saul, et al. have been tempered by an awareness of how lacking we are in fantastic new shows. Especially ones that, like Barry and Better Things, originated on the small screen. If this spring's barrage of mostly mediocre docudramas is any indication of what's to come, we may well be months, rather than years, away from glimpsing the creative limits of intellectual-property-based storytelling on TV.
