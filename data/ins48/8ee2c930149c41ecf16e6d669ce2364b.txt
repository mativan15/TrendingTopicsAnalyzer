The London Transit Commission (LTC) is once dealing with a rash of incidents where the glass in bus shelters have been smashed out. Ashlaigh Potter heard strange noises during the early morning hours late last week. Then there was a jarring noise that gave her the most concern. 'I heard like this catastrophic shattering and the bus shelter was broken when I woke up the next morning,' she said. The shelter sits a few meters away from the patio of her ground floor apartment along Proudfoot Lane, south of Oxford.
