Helping People

The Miami Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired may be best known for its impactful work bringing free eye exams to local schools and hosting early childhood education for vision impaired youth. A year ago, Miami Lighthouse opened Florida's first CVI center to respond to the leading cause of pediatric visual impairment.

All this work continues, of course, but this 91-year-old award-winning Miami nonprofit organization has also long supported adults as well, and recently has been doubling down on its digital literacy programming as well as its website accessibility advocacy.
