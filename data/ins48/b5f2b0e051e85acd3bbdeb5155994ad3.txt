Growth stocks including MercadoLibre (MELI 11.62%), Etsy (ETSY 5.39%), and Wayfair (W 14.46%) were flying higher Monday morning as investors reacted to new fiscal policy announcements out of the U.K. and a strong earnings report from Bank of America. Investors were also looking forward to third-quarter earnings reports, which ramp up this week.
The biggest news of the day seemed to be a decision by U.K. finance minister Jeremy Hunt to ditch an earlier tax cut proposal, which had stoked concerns about inflation.
