If you live by politics, you end up dying by politics. Such is the fate of AGL Energy Ltd., Australia's oldest utility and biggest polluter. The company Monday abandoned plans to de-merge its coal power plants and said its chairman and chief executive officer would both leave amid a review of its strategic direction.

That brings an end to a sorry episode that's seen AGL lose nearly half its value since confirming the demerger program in June 2020. Part of the impetus for the change has been the shareholder activism of software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, Australia's fourth-richest man, who launched a A$7.
