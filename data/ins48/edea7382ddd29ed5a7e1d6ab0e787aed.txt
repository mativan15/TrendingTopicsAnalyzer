Inflation rates are top of mind for most consumers as the increasing cost of living can be felt at grocery stores, gas stations and in many cases, sports venues. Some Saskatchewan WHL teams have raised the cost of tickets this season as they face additional expenses, causing some fans to find other sources of entertainment. David Bernakevitch, who has been a Regina Pats fan since childhood, said he hasn't been to a game yet this season because of the cost. 'Every time I've looked at ticket prices I just can't justify it,' Bernakevitch said.
