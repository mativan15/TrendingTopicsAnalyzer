Published October 20, 2022 12:45pm EDT Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that its advanced driver assistant software won't be granted regulatory approval this year.  Completely autonomous vehicles would require regulatory approval. The automaker sells a $15,000 software add-on called "Full Self-Driving" that allows vehicles to change lanes and park autonomously, in addition to the "Autopilot" feature. "The car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend's house, the grocery store without you touching the wheel," Musk said in a post-earnings call.
