With less than three weeks to go until voters have their say in the midterms, a pollster is warning of a potential 'civil war' if Maga candidates don't accept the results.Republican pollster Frank Luntz made his ominous warnings while appearing on Friday morning's Morning Joe, where he predicted that the fallout from the midterms could have serious repercussions if politicians lose in states where candidates have been known to traffic in election-denying conspiracies.The GOP analyst also speculated that voters seem to be disenfranchised by candidates who they put their faith in at the ballot box, but who seem to 'become part of the system' once elected.
