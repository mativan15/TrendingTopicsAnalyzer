Published: 13:39 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 13:39 EDT, 20 October 2022 Luke Richardson collected his first win as a head coach in Chicago's last game. Following an unusual layoff, his Blackhawks will look for two consecutive victories on Friday when they host the Detroit Wings. It is the home opener for the Blackhawks, who lost at Colorado and Vegas before beating San Jose 5-2 on Saturday. "I try to downplay my role here," Richardson said. "(Patrick Kane) gave me the puck after the game and the team congratulated me, but really I'm here to try to help them.
