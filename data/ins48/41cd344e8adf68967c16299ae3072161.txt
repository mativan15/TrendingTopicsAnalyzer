Underlining the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Russia's war on Ukraine, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged people to make a 'resolve' and reduce expenditure on imports and make the country self-reliant.
Addressing ‘PM Kisan Samman Sammelan-2022', held in the national capital, Modi released the 12th installment of cash support the government had launched before 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He also launched a scheme to brand all subsidised fertiliser under one brand — ‘Bharat' — to eliminate product differentiation and confusion caused to farmers by multiple brands.
