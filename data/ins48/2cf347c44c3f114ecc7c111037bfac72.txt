The town of Elk Grove Village, Ill. is a pleasant hamlet about 20 miles northwest of downtown Chicago. Like many communities of its size, it bills itself as business-friendly. Unlike any other community in America, though, it's sponsored a college football bowl game, multiple Olympians and, now, a car in a NASCAR race.

Elk Grove Village, under its "Makers Wanted" banner, will sponsor former NASCAR champion Brad Keselowski's No. 6 Ford at next summer's Chicago street race. The town's hallmark is its proximity to transportation hubs and its emphasis on manufacturing, making it a good fit for Keselowski's own interest in manufacturing and machining technologies.
