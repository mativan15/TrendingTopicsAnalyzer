In the era of box sets, binge-watching and on-demand entertainment, many assume that patience for the dramatic cliffhanger has dissipated into nostalgia. However, publisher Soho Crime took a gamble with Kaoru Takamura's sprawling crime thriller 'Lady Joker' by splitting the 1,200-page novel into two parts published more than a year apart. It was an unconventional choice to keep readers dangling without completion for so long.
'Lady Joker: Volume One' was released July 2021, and the 15-month wait for 'Volume Two,' which will be out Oct.
