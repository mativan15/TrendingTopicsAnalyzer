When it comes to going public, Instacart is reportedly settling for deferred gratification.

The San Francisco startup, which confidentially filed its initial public offering paperwork earlier this year, has decided to delay going public until next year, according to The New York Times. The food delivery business is making the move in response to the turmoil in the markets that has sent stock prices down across the board and that has particularly hit the shares of newly public companies, The Times reported.
