The administration of the four French settlements of Pondicherry, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe will pass into the hands of the Government of India on November 1 following an overwhelming vote for the merger of these pockets with the Indian Union by the elected representatives of these settlements today. Out of 178 members of the 16 municipal communes from these settlements and the French India Representative Assembly who participated in the congress held at Kizhoor, 15 miles from Pondicherry, 170 voted in favour of merger and eight against.
