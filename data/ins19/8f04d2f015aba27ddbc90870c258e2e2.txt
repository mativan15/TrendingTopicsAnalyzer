Fiction, Penguin Random House, $28Geraldine Brooks was being wooed to tell another story when she overheard the tale of Lexington, the near-mythic antebellum thoroughbred: a horse so fleet of foot that clockmakers invented the stopwatch to time his races; sire to generations of champions, including the dauntless mounts of American civil war generals.In Horse, Brooks traces Lexington's reverberating life, from his birth in 1850 to the present, as scientists reconstruct his record-breaking bones.
