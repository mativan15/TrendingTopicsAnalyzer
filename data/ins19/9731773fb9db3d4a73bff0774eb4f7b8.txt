An article in The Atlantic essentially confirmed NBC journalist Dasha Burns' widely disputed claim that Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman appears to have problems making conversation without the use of closed captioning, noting he had difficulty responding "meaningfully" to voter questions.In a Sunday piece headlined, "Do Voters Care About John Fetterman's Stroke?," Atlantic staff writer Elaine Godfrey noted that Fetterman "still struggles to process the words that he hears, and sometimes he can't quite express what he means" five months after he suffered a stroke.
