(Bloomberg)—The US is planning to auction in December leases for offshore wind farms in California waters, the first off the Pacific Coast, which will require a new, more expensive turbine technology. The US Interior Department said Tuesday it will auction five leases spanning 373,000 acres (151,000 hectares) off central and northern California, enough space to install turbines with more than 4.5 gigawatts of capacity. The Biden administration is seeking to promote offshore wind development near the near large, power-hungry cities on the West Coast, but the region's deep waters will require floating turbines, a more expensive design that hasn't been deployed commercially in the US.
