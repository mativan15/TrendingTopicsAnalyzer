Calcutta High Court on Thursday allowed Trinamool National General Secretary and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee and his wife Rujira Banerjee to go to Dubai for the medical treatment of the MP. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) was unwilling to allow him to go to Dubai in connection with the alleged multi-crore coal smuggling case, in which Abhishek is being interrogated. Abhishek and his wife then approached the HC's vacation bench. Enforcement Directorate, which is interrogating Abhishek Banerjee in connection with the alleged multi-crore coal smuggling scam, had denied permission to Banerjee, following which he moved the vacation bench with the appeal that Banerjee and his wife be allowed to travel to Dubai for his eye treatment.
