Although still knocked by LUNA's recent collapse, the cryptocurrency market has started to bounce back recently. Over the last day, Terra Luna has recovered by 19.54 percent, according to CoinMarketCap, bringing its value to $0.0001877. The markup will prove encouraging for investors, but the coin still has a long way to go, having dropped from $96 in April.Terra Luna boss Do Kwon, who has become the target of concentrated fallout from LUNA's early May crash, recently proposed a recovery plan.He initially aimed to create a "hard fork" whereby his teams would split the blockchain network in half.
