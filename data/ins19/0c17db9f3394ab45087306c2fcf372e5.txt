In the aftermath of a Thursday shooting that left five people dead in Raleigh, North Carolina, details emerged about the victims as loved ones and a community mourned.

Among those who were killed were a police officer, an avid marathon runner and a neighborhood social butterfly. One was supposed to get married in two weeks at her dream fall wedding in the mountains. Another was just 16 years old and a junior in high school.

A 15-year-old suspect was taken into custody Thursday night after being accused of shooting people in a residential neighborhood before opening fire again along a walking trail.
