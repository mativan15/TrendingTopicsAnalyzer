You can run, but you can't hide from tech layoffs. That apparently even applies to Microsoft, the world's third most valuable company.On Monday the company reportedly moved to cut less than 1,000 employees spread out across multiple divisions of its business and various regions according to an Axios report. If confirmed, the layoffs make Microsoft the biggest name so far to shed staff in a year long downturn that's seen at least 44,000 tech workers lose their jobs according to Crunchbase data.For now, specific details explaining the reason for the cuts remain sparse.
