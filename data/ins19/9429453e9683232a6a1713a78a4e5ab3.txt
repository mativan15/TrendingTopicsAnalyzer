June 1 (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy on Wednesday dismissed the field for the inaugural LIV Golf Invitational Series as "nothing to jump up and down about" and said players joining the Saudi-funded breakaway circuit need not face severe punishment.There has been speculation that golfers who defect to the LIV Golf Series could face lifetime bans from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour but McIlroy feels such action would be too harsh."I certainly don't think they should drop the hammer," world number eight McIlroy told reporters ahead of the PGA Tour's Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio.
