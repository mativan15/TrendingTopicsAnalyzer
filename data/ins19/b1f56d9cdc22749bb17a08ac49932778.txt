A Melbourne man has been sentenced to five years prison for a series of assaults in one of the city's premier entertainment districts last year, including one that left an elderly grandmother unconscious outside a church where she volunteered.

Amrick Roy, 27, pleaded guilty in the County Court of Victoria on October 14 to the violent assault of Penelope Katsavos, 79, and three earlier assaults during a period in which his defence submitted he was 'fully psychotic', partially as a consequence of his use of synthetic cannabis.
