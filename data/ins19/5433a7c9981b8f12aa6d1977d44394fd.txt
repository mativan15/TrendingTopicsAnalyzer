Injuries are officially taking their toll on the Dolphins. The hardest hit positions are quarterback, cornerback and offensive tackle, but injuries are noteworthy at a few other positions, and that will make the soft part of the Dolphins schedule a bit harder.

The AFC East standings illustrate how things have flipped the last few weeks with Buffalo (4-1) at the top, followed by the New York Jets (4-2) and then the Dolphins (3-3) and Patriots (3-3).

The Dolphins get quarterback Tua Tagovailoa back this week for the 8:20 p.
