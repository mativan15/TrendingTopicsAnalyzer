WASHINGTON — The German government will purchase 60 Boeing Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to equip the armed forces in a deal reportedly worth upwards of $4 billion, according to a Ministry of Defense announcement on Wednesday.

The CH-47F Block 2 'Standard Range' variant aircraft are refuelable during flight, a key requirement for the German armed forces, the statement said. They are slated to replace the Bundeswehr's fleet of aging CH-53, made by Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky.

Lockheed also had put in a bid for the contract, offering its CH-53K King Stallion.
