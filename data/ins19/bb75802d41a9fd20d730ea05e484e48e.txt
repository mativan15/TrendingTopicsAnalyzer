Linda Taylor of south Minneapolis received a notice to vacate her rental home of nearly 20 years at the end of January. Her landlord wanted to sell. Taylor, a 70-year-old retiree who had raised her five children in the Phillips and Powderhorn communities, didn't know where to go. She happened to tell a neighbor of her plight. Word got around the block that Taylor, who was always volunteering in the neighborhood and chatting up passersby from her porch, needed help. Soon neighbors helped her broach a pact with landlord Greg Berendt: If he would just give Taylor until the end of June, they would help her raise enough money to buy her home.
