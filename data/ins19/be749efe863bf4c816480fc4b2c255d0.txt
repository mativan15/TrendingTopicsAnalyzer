Southwestern Electric Power Co., announced Tuesday that they plan to add 999 megawatts of wind and solar energy by the end of 2025.

Mooringsport will be one location in this expansion, and will bring a 200 MW solar facility.

'SWEPCO's analysis of our generation needs showed that the lowest cost, best value option for capacity was adding wind and solar resources,' said Malcolm Smoak, SWEPCO president and Chief Operating Officer. 'These projects will help save money for our customers.'

SWEPCO's need for capacity is driven by the retirement of aging SWEPCO generation units including the retirement of five gas units in 2019 and 2020, the retirement of Dolet Hills in 2021 and the announced 2023 retirement of the Pirkey Power Plant in Hallsville, Texas.
