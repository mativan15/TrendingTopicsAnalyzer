(Reuters) -Arrival SA said on Thursday it would restructure its business to focus on the U.S. market, seeking to capitalise on the Inflation Reduction Act incentives and a larger addressable market as the electric-vehicle startup strives to cut costs.

The British company will continue to manufacture some vans in its factory in Bicester, United Kingdom, but said that scaling operations would require significant investment and hence it would focus on the U.
