Powered by surging growth in leisure travel, hotels in the Charlotte area are projected to end 2022 with higher combined revenue than in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, according to a new national industry study.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association, a Washington-based lobbying and advocacy group, enlisted industry tracking firm and analyst Kalibri Labs to analyze business and leisure travel in the 50 largest U.S. markets. The results were released this week.

According to Kalibri Labs, Charlotte hotels are on pace to generate hotel revenue of $1.
