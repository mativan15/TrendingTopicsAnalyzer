Governor Greg Abbott today announced the launch of the State of Texas' coordinated "One Pill Kills" campaign to combat the growing national fentanyl crisis plaguing Texas and the United States. This announcement comes after Governor Abbott directed state agencies to ramp up efforts to combat the deadly fentanyl crisis last month. Following a roundtable discussion with state and local law enforcement, the Governor was joined by Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw and Beaumont Police Chief James Singletary for a press conference highlighting the severity of the fentanyl crisis and outlined the comprehensive actions taken by the State of Texas to address the unprecedented influx of this deadly drug into communities across the state.
