 Soon, Apple Card users will be able to open a "new high-yield Savings account," Apple says. There's just one hitch: Apple won't say what interest rate it's offering. There's also no specific timeline for when consumers can access these savings accounts. The Verge reports: Apple has been moving into fintech with the Apple Card, which it partners with Goldman Sachs on. As one of its perks, card users get Daily Cash, Apple's special branding on the more mundane cashback rewards, on their purchases.
