The election saw two non-Gandhi faces contest in senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor. The Gandhi family has been at the helm for 24 years and the last organisational elections were in 2000. The new president will replace interim Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who has had the post ever since Rahul Gandhi stepped down after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
While Kharge is considered to be close to the Gandhis and have the backing of many senior leaders, Tharoor has pitched himself as the candidate of change and 'tomorrow'.
