Ditching the triple lock would be "unforgivable", a former pensions minister has warned after Downing Street said the commitment could be abandoned yesterday.

Baroness Ros Altmann said she was "absolutely stunned" following the announcement that pensions could rise in line with earnings instead of inflation next year.

"We have to be careful that we don't just try and short change the elderly two years in a row in the middle of a cost of living crisis, that is unforgivable in my view," she told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme.
