Qatar Airways operates several long-haul flights between Doha and the US, with some journeying a whopping 16 hours.

One of the planes used is a Boeing 777-200LR equipped with luxurious QSuites and a comfortable economy cabin.

While most passengers don't have access to a lie-flat bed, flight attendants have bunks reserved just for them.

Post-pandemic travel is booming and people are more eager than ever to get out of the house and explore the world once again.
