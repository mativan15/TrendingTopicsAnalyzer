There's yet another 'Simpsons' conspiracy theory afoot. 
The FOX television show — which has a long history of allegedly predicting political and social events — might have also predicted the resignation of British Prime Minister Elizabeth Truss on Thursday.
Truss — who has officially became the shortest-serving prime minister — stepped down from Britain's top office after only 44 days, following former PM Boris Johnson's embattled term from 2019 to 2022.
The image that is currently circulating the internet is from a 2005 episode featuring a wrapper wearing a 'Thursday the 20th' golden chain around his neck.
