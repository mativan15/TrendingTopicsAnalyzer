CLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland Guardians manager Terry Francona has agreed to return for an 11th season after leading the majors' youngest team to a division title and the AL Division Series in 2022.

The 63-year-old Francona has not signed a contract, but said Friday he intends to be back next season. He's dealt with health problems the past two years and will have another operation next week.

Chris Antonetti, the team's president of baseball operations, said Francona is welcome to manage the Guardians 'for as long as it makes sense on his end.
