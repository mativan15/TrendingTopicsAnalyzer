Economists and oil market experts sharply criticized Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., for his recent rhetoric blaming "greedy oil companies" for high gasoline prices in California."Gas prices are up while oil companies rake in RECORD profits," Newsom tweeted Monday. "It. Does. Not. Add. Up. We cannot continue to allow greedy oil companies to rip us off at the pump."Newsom has repeated the argument for weeks, adding that he would support a new windfall tax on oil companies to punish "oil company extortion" in a video message posted by his office late last month.
