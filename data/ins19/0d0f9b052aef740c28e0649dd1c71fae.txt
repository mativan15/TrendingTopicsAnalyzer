A Bellevue man was sentenced in federal court on Friday for his role in a kickback scheme involving government health care programs like Medicare and Tricare.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Jae Lee was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $7.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to solicit kickbacks.

Lee, former CEO of the now-defunct Northwest Physicians Laboratory, was part of a two-year plot to direct government-funded drug testing to two other labs. In exchange of the referrals, the labs paid Lee's company.
