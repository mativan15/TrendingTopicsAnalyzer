May 29—CHAMPAIGN — When restaurants in Illinois were forced to close for in-person dining in the early months of the pandemic, local restaurateur Victor Fuentes started a construction company.

"Purely out of necessity," he recalled.

The operator of both family-owned El Toro restaurants and his new construction venture, DECA Holdings, Fuentes is about to receive an honor that's been on hold since June 2020.

On Wednesday, the Parkland College Foundation plans to honor Fuentes with its V. Dale Cozad Entrepreneur of the Year award.
