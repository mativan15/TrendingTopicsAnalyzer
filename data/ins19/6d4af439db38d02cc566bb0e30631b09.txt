Over 9,000 Congress delegates voted on Monday to elect the new president of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) with Mallikarjun Kharge and Shashi Tharoor in the fray and the former being widely seen as the 'front runner' due to the backing of the AICC establishment. The result will be out on Wednesday evening after counting of votes here. After the completion of voting at the polling booths set up at the AICC office and headquarters of the Pradesh Congress Committees, Congress Central Election Authority chairman Madhusudan Mistry announced at a press conference that over "95%" votes were cast.
