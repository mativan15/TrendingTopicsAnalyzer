The UK could be facing a fresh wave of Covid this winter as infection and death rates rates have begun to creep up again, an expert has warned. It comes as deaths in England related to COVID-19 and Wales saw their highest weekly rise since late August in the week ending 7 October 2022. According to data from the Office for National Statistics, 400 people had Covid-related deaths, close to a 40 percent jump from the 287 deaths from the week before. 63.5 percent (254 deaths) had Covid recorded as the underlying cause of death, a slight increase on the previous week, when it was 63.
