A neighbour has backed up Rep Lauren Boebert's denial that the congresswoman fatally shot a pet dog in her hometown of Silt, Colorado.

The bizarre story - the latest in Ms Boebert's controversial rollercoaster career - exploded on social media over the weekend after Yaritza Mendoza, describing herself as the MAGA Republican's 'next door neighbour,' detailed the alleged incident in a Facebook post.

Ms Mendoza claims the congresswoman shot and killed her two-year-old husky, Omega, in August because the dog was attacking her goats.
