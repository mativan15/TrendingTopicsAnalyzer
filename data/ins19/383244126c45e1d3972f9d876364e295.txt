​President Biden acknowledged Wednesday that Americans would be feeling the pain from skyrocketing food and gas prices for some time to come Wednesday as consumer costs at the pump hit another new high. 
'The idea we're going to be able to click a switch, bring down the cost of gasoline is not likely in the near term, nor is it with regard to food​,'​ the president told reporters following a White House event with baby formula manufacturers.
As Biden spoke, the average nationwide price of a gallon of gas stood at $4.
