Currently, anyone over 16 with at least a thousand followers can livestream on TikTok and those over 18 can send and receive tips - one of the ways creators make money on the platform. But TikTok has announced updates, including the age limits, that will go into effect next month. 'To protect our users and creators and support their well-being, we constantly work to evolve the safeguards we put in place,' TikTok says in the blog post.
