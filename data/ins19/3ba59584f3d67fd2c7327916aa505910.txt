A comprehensive and wide-ranging poll of U.S. voters by Harvard University's Center for American Political Studies and Harris Poll has some promising findings for the GOP, which has a 49% approval rating to President Biden 's 42%. But wait, there's more.

'Voters are more attracted by the Republican platform than the Democratic one,' the poll noted.

'Republicans want to close the border to illegal crossings, increase incarceration of criminals, reduce or freeze government spending. Does this appeal to you as a program or not appeal to you?' the poll asked.
