Two of Australia's major banks are cutting back on new lending to more highly indebted borrowers, as financial institutions and regulators prepare for the impact of rising interest rates on mortgage customers.As money markets bet on a series of interest rate rises this year, ANZ Bank this week said it would no longer accept loan applications from borrowers with total debts more than 7.5 times their income. Previously, the bank was prepared to consider applications from customers with debt-to-income (DTI) ratios of up to nine times.
