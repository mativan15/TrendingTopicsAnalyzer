North Carolina state government has spent roughly $2.5 million on Executive Mansion repairs during Gov. Roy Cooper's tenure -- expenses that a state official said were needed for critical safety, security and other upkeep for the over 130-year-old building.

The Department of Administration, which maintains state-owned buildings, confirmed recently to North State Journal the total for expenditures and associated costs on the governor's official residence since 2017.

The Raleigh mansion, which first opened in 1891 and is a state historic site, also functions as office and venue space in addition to providing housing for Cooper's family on the second floor.
