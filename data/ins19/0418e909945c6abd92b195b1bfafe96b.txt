hxdbzxy/iStock via Getty Images Stocks pushed higher again on Tuesday, extending the rebound that marked Monday's trading. Wall Street is recovering from a recent swoon that took the S&P 500 to a new yearly low last week. Among individual stocks, Akouos (AKUS) and AVEO Pharmaceuticals (AVEO) both recorded massive gains following separate deals to be acquired. Looking to the downside, Silvergate Capital (SI) lost almost a quarter of its value following the release of disappointing quarterly results.
