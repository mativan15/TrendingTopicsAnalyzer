Discussions on Wall Street about a stock-market bottom are underway after five brutal months to start 2022. Since January 3, the S&P 500 is down about 12%. But to John Hussman, stocks aren't even close to hitting the floor. That's because valuations remain far too high, historically speaking."Despite the year-to-date decline in the S&P 500, the most reliable valuation measures we monitor remain at levels never observed in market history prior to August 2020," Hussman, the president of the Hussman Investment Trust who called the 2000 and 2008 stock market crashes, said in a recent commentary.
