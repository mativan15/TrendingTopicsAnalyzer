Citing the induction of the indigenously-built Tejas light combat aircraft, light combat helicopters and aircraft carrier INS Vikrant into the Indian armed forces, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Wednesday that decisions to induct ‘Make in India' products were not because of 'political will', but due to the 'courage' shown by the leadership of the armed forces.
'Change is happening very quickly. There was a time in this country when pigeons used to be released. Now we have the power to release cheetahs,' Modi said in his inaugural address at the DefExpo 2022 in Gandhinagar.
