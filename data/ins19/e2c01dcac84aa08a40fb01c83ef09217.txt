Whoop, one of Boston's most prominent direct-to-consumer technology companies, launched a business-to-business sales arm on Thursday.Mark McLaughlin, who joined Whoop last January as chief business officer, said that over the past 15 months, the wearable-fitness tech company has been focused on building that business out, though it's 'always been a part of the company's DNA.' Founder and chief executive Will Ahmed is a former captain of the Harvard squash team, and he long envisioned that groups of people, such as sports teams, would buy Whoop's fitness-tracking band to measure and improve performance.
