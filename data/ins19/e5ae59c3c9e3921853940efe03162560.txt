The Pelicans opened Wednesday night with a 130-108 victory at Brooklyn.

Terry Rozier flirted with a triple-double for the Hornets with 23 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Gordon Hayward had 26 points on 12-of-19 shooting and added seven assists.

The Hornets simply had no answer inside for Valanciunas, who dominated in the paint against Mason Plumlee and Nick Richards. Valanciunas was 13 of 14 from the free-throw line and 8 of 11 from the field.

New Orleans outrebounded Charlotte 53-37.

After trailing by 16, the Hornets cut the lead to two with seven minutes left on Jalen McDaniels' fourth 3-pointer of the night.
