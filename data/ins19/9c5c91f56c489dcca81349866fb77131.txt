Published: 18:02 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 18:05 EDT, 31 May 2022 Humans DNA could be edited to cure genetic conditions such as progeria that causes sufferers to age so fast they die while still teenagers.Scientists at Harvard University say they have made a 'base editor' — or enzymes — that can cut out and replace faulty genes.Bodies will then start to function normally, they said, as cells given the treatment will use the edited DNA.Studies in animals stricken with progeria or sickle cell anemia found the animals were cured after getting the injection.
