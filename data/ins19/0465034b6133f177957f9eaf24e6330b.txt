By Alyssa Adams October 17, 2022 / 2:21 PM / CBS Philadelphia PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- Were you one of the lucky people who scored tickets to the Phillies-Padres NLCS during the ticket release on Monday morning? If not, don't worry. You can still get yourself to Citizens Bank Park for Games 3, 4, and 5 if necessary, but it might cost a pretty penny. The cheapest tickets we found on third-party ticket websites like StubHub, Ticketmaster and VividSeats start at around $300. Those seats are standing room only.
