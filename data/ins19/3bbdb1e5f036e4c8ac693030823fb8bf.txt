Social activist Daya Bai, who has been on a hunger strike in the State capital since October 2 seeking solutions to the problems faced by endosulfan victims, ended her stir on Wednesday. The action council spearheading the struggle said the government had provided more clarity on expert treatment, special medical camps, and day-care centres for the victims. On Wednesday, Health Minister Veena George and Higher Education Minister R. Bindu called on the activist at the General Hospital, where she was admitted three days ago.
