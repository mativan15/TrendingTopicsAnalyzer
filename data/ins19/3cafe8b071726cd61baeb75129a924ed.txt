The Prime Minister is now facing calls to resign from former staunch allies. Lord Frost, former chief Brexit negotiator, announced this morning that Ms Truss should resign "if the Tory party is to have any chance of recovering". He had previously been a staunch ally of Ms Truss, backing her for leader from early on in the race. But that has changed in the past few days, as he warns of a "hostile takeover" from opponents within the Tory party and rages that there is "no mandate" for the current policy shift.
