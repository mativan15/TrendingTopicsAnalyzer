By Michael Dabaie Victoria's Secret & Co. shares were 5.5% higher at $43.47 in afternoon trading Wednesday after the company's adjusted earnings came in ahead of analyst expectations and sales beat the consensus view despite a drop on year. The retailer after the bell Tuesday reported first-quarter net sales of $1.48 billion, a decrease of 4.5% on year but higher than the FactSet consensus forecast of $1.47 billion. The company said the result was at the high end of its guidance for sales in the range of a decrease of 4% to 8%.
