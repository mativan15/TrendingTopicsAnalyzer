Oct. 16—As Keene residents Philip Jones and Jerry Sickels vie for a seat in N.H. House, Cheshire District 3 in the general election Nov. 8, the two are separated by opinions on bringing down energy costs, abortion and school vouchers.

Jones, 67, and Sickels, who did not specify his age in an email to The Sentinel on Saturday, both ran unopposed in their respective races in the N.H. primary on Sept. 13.

District 3 covers Keene's Ward 5, encompassing the northwestern portion of Keene.

On abortion, Sickels, a Republican and vice chairman of the Keene City GOP Committee, supports legislation passed last year that prohibits most abortions in New Hampshire after 24 weeks of pregnancy.
