Radio host Nick Ferrari has put the chairman of Marks and Spencers on the spot over the retailer's growth plans amid store closures.  Archie Norman, who took over as M&S chairman in September 2017, dismissed the closures on LBC as a "great hoo-haa" and argued the outlet's new stores are "performing brilliantly."Mr Norman told the LBC host: "We've got a great new management team. We've changed so many things about the business.We've opened great new stores, we've doubled our share online. We've bought half of Ocardo retail, and then the management team has just heads down seeking to reshape the business for growth, which is what I think we will do.
