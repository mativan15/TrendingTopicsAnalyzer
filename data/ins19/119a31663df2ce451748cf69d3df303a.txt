Mick Schumacher currently has a 'bitter' taste to withstand at Haas, and could end up by the wayside in Formula 1 if he does not improve, warns two-time World Rally champion Walter Röhrl.

Kevin Magnussen returned to the team as a late replacement for Nikita Mazepin at the start of the season, after the Russian was removed from his seat at Haas, and the more experienced Dane has slotted back in seamlessly and out-performed Schumacher this season so far.
