Top Gun: Maverick was ready in 2020. But the pandemic (and Tom Cruise's insistence that the film be released on the big screen, so as to make the most of its sweeping aerial shots) has meant that it's only hitting screens now. For fans, the wait has been decades long. Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He's nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago. Can other sequels released after long gaps offer clues about its chances at the box office? See how film and TV show follow-ups have fared.
