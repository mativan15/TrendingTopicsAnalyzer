With his first foray into workplace design, renowned industrial designer Marc Newson highlights the beauty of simplicity and ergonomic excellence EAST GREENVILLE, Pa., Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Knoll, a recognized leader in modern design, today, introduced the Newson Task chair designed by the trailblazing industrial designer Marc Newson. Newson Task is an ergonomic task chair whose silhouette creates one continuous line. The cantilevered shape is made possible by a brand-new tilt innovation —one that flips the mechanism vertically, so it's concealed cleverly beneath the seat.
