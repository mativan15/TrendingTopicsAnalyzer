This budget-friendly meal plan covers a week's worth of meat-free dinners for four adults, coming in at under £28 in total. All the recipes are flexible too, so you can swap in different ingredients to make the most of leftovers and supermarket deals, as well as appease picky eaters. More budget meal inspirationWe have stuck to a strict ingredient budget of £7 per person for the week, which averages out at just under £1 per portion. We've based most of our costs on the smallest available pack size, meaning even if you don't use a whole jar or packet, the entire cost is still included in the budget.
