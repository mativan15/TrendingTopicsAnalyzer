Soon after the Congress's debacle in the recent Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states, party president Sonia Gandhi asked the chiefs of their party units to resign. Like his counterparts in other states, the UP Congress president, Ajay Kumar Lallu, also tendered his resignation immediately.
However, nearly three months since Lallu's resignation, the UP Pradesh Congress Committee (UPPCC) continues to be without its head, even though the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is the UP in-charge.
