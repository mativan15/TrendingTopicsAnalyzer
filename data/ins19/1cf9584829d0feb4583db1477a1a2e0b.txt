(Patch Media)Hi all. It's me, Carlos Hernandez, your host of the Houston Daily. Here's everything you need to know about what's happening in town... First, today's weather: Sunny; warm in the afternoon. High: 92 Low: 67. 📢 I'm looking for business owners and marketers in Houston who want to build awareness, connect with customers and increase sales. I have a limited number of sponsorships available to introduce our Houston Daily readers to local businesses they need to know about. If that's you, then I invite you to learn more and secure your spot now.
