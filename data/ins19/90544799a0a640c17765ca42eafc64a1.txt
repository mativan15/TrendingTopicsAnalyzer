For the second straight year, no invasive box tree moth caterpillars or adults were detected in Michigan. In a world connected by trade and long-distance travel, plants and insects are sometimes accidentally brought with people, plants and cargo to new locations. Michigan residents are familiar with past examples such as the emerald ash borer and the more recent detection of the spotted lanternfly. Not every non-native species that arrives will become established and create nuisance or economic problems.
