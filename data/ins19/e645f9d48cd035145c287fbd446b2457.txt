Midterm elections are right on the horizon.

It will take only five seats changing hands to give the Republican Party a majority in the House. In the Senate, only a single seat needs to change hands to bring about a Republican majority. This is very likely to happen in both houses. Given the state of the GOP at this time, such a change might not be in the best interests of the United States.

I think the Republican Party has been so transformed by Donald Trump and his acolytes that it is no longer accurate to call it the Republican Party.
