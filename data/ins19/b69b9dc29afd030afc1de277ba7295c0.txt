Everyone warned Frank Catalanotto.
Long Island friends. Hofstra people. Baseball confidants.
'You can't win there,' they told him. Not in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) against those southern schools.
It was then that Catalanotto was convinced this was the job for him. It was his Michael Jordan moment. He took those doubts personally.
'We will win,' was his response. 'This coaching staff will help these guys.'
Even he couldn't have dreamed it would happen so fast, that in his first season he would lead Hofstra to its first-ever NCAA Tournament, that the Pride would win more conference tournament games in one year than it ever had, that he proved you could in fact win at the Long Island school.
