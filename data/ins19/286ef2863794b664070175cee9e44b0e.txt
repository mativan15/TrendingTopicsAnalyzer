But that's exactly what has happened with the Sonos Sub Mini, as audiophiles can get money off the Sonos Beam and Sonos Ray companion a week after it first hit shelves. That rare reduction is all thanks to TopCashback with the cash-saving website currently offering £20 off this sound-boosting device.To get the Sonos discount you simply need to join TopCashback as a new member and then purchase the Sub Mini from a Richer Sounds store.
