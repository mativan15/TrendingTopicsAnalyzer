Like several members of The Crown cast, past and present, Lesley Manville has personal knowledge of the royal family. The Phantom Thread and Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris star met Prince Charles (now King Charles III) when she was appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and in 2015 was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) by Prince William. And while Manville never met Princess Margaret, the royal family member she is playing on seasons 5 and 6 of The Crown, the actress has the best story about almost meeting the Queen's sister.
