All Louise Giles and her husband Stewart Boyce wanted was a modest change to their credit card arrangements with their bank ANZ. What followed was a lengthy, sometimes bizarre, forensic financial examination, and the humiliating 'no' from the bank, which stunned the Wellington couple, who own their own home, have savings and both earn six-figure incomes. The bank has since walked back from that 'no', and apologised, blaming a poorly-trained staff-member, and tougher responsible lending rules introduced by the Government on December 1.
