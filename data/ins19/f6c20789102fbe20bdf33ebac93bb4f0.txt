Salesforce soared 10% on Wednesday after it reported better-than-feared first-quarter earnings, and those results could lend confidence to tech investors and spark a rally in the sector, according to Wedbush.Salesforce reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, beating estimates by $0.04. The cloud operator reported first-quarter revenue of $7.4 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and besting analyst estimates by $30 million.The strong first-quarter results were driven by what Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff called a "whirlwind" of business activity over the past few months.
