Despite police nakas in markets, snatchers are having a free run in Chandigarh. Riding motorcycles, scooters and sometimes also confidently relying on their feet, snatchers have targeted 66 people in the city since January this year compared to 121 in entire 2021. High density of population, along with porous borders, provide easy escape routes to the snatchers, who slip into neighbouring areas and villages, making south and south-west belts of the city – from Sector 31 in the east to Sector 39 in the west – more prone to snatchingincidents.
