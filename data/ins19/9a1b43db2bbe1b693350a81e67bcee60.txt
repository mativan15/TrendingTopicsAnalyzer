Republican Governor Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams debated over issues like voting rights, health care, crime and punishment as they presented their closing arguments to voters in a rematch of their hotly disputed 2018 race for the same position. Kemp tried to link Abrams to US President Joe Biden at every opportunity, same like Herschel Walker (Republican Senate candidate) did in his discussion with Raphael Warnock (Democratic Senator) last week, according to reports.
 Last week, First Lady Jill Biden went to a fundraiser for Abrams and blasted Kemp for his views on abortion, Medical aid expansion, and voting rights.
