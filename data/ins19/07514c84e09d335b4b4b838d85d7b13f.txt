Garena Free Fire Max has gained massive popularity in India. The game is an apt alternate version of the Garena Free Fire game, which the Central government had banned in India. The government had banned Garena Free Fire, along with several other apps, in 2021, citing data security issues. This decision had caused a massive disappointment among Indian fans of the game. However, Garena Free Fire Max is an equally exciting game available on app stores. The developers of Garena Free Fire Max are 111 Dots Studio, and it is a battle royale game.
