It would be understandable if Evan Engram looked at the timing of the Giants' breakthrough and allowed himself to wonder, 'Why now?' 
Why was he drafted on the heels of the Giants' last winning season, forced to endure two failed rebuilds resulting in the worst record in the NFL over a five-year period and not retained just before the winning started? But that's not the way that Engram — who will start at tight end Sunday for the Jaguars against his former team — is wired. 
'I couldn't be more excited for them,' said Engram, who phoned Daniel Jones, Sterling Shepard and Saquon Barkley a couple weeks ago to congratulate them on a fast start.
