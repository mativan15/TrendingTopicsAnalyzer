Kristian Johannsen has a goal to take on the big players in soft drink such as Coca-Cola and less than a year into launching his business he has scored a deal across Australia with 7-Eleven worth $1.5 million.

The 30-year-old saw a trend in the US for 'better for you' soft drinks that are low in sugar and filled with prebiotics and wanted to bring it over to Australia.

But he said the products from the US had drifted away from the classic fizzy drinks such as Solo, Fanta and Coke and he wanted to ensure taste wasn't a barrier to pick up his product.
