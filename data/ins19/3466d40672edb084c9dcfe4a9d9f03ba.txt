The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has been setting new 14-year highs, but strategists expect it to ease from those levels in a matter of weeks, relieving pressure on the stock market. That may be a temporary phenomena, but it could serve to fuel the year-end rally that many investors have been expecting. The 10-year edged up to 4.12% Wednesday for the first time since 2008, while the whole yield curve moved higher. The 2-year Treasury yield, for instance, rose to 4.54% — its highest since 2007.
