Russian State Duma Deputy Defense Committee Chairman Vladimir Shamanov has admitted in an interview that the most glaring mistake of the Russian war in Ukraine was that the Kremlin expected Ukrainians to greet the Russian military with open arms.

Going in to Ukraine in February, expecting to 'be greeted with flowers,' was a big mistake, Shamanov said in an interview with journalist Oksana Kravtsova.

'Those who expected that we [in Ukraine] would be met with flowers, this is one of the main mistakes that we felt very keenly in the first five days,' he said, according to RBC.
