Chalmers said next week's budget would not be about stage three tax cuts.'It's going to be about, really, three things. Responsible cost-of-living relief. Secondly, targeted investments in a stronger, more resilient economy. And thirdly, starting to unwind this legacy of waste and rollouts in the budget, which has given us that trillion dollars of debt in the first place, which is becoming more and more expensive to service,' he said.Treasury officials were asked to prepare a new cost estimate for the stage three tax cuts earlier this month after a week in which the federal government faced repeated questions about the income tax relief prompted by the furious debate over the now-abandoned tax cuts proposed by the British government.
