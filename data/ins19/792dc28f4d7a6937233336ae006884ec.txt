Italy's presumed next prime minister sent a warning to Italian politician and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi after warm comments he made directed toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Italy will never be the weak link of the West with us in government," Giorgia Meloni said in a statement directed toward her potential conservative coalition ally, Silvio Berlusconi, who recently boasted in leaked audio about reconnecting with Putin."I have reconnected with President Putin, a little, a lot," Berlusconi was heard saying in comments recorded and released by the LaPresse News Agency.
