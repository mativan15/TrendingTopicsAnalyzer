A former Wales rugby star helped her team soar to victory in a trailblazing annual tournament to raise money for vulnerable and disadvantaged children.

Beth Hawke, a 35-year-old police officer and former Welsh international, is an avid member and supporter of UK charity Wooden Spoon and played for Wales at their Vets Fest 22 event this weekend.

The tournament, held at Birmingham's Moseley Rugby Football Club, celebrated its second year and featured over 700 players from 16 men's and 10 women's Vets teams across the country.
