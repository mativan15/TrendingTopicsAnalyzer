Bosses at Netflix have added a disclaimer for The Crown stating the show is fiction after Dame Judi Dench called for viewers to be given clarification.
Chiefs at the streaming service have been under increasing pressure to clarify that scenes portraying the royal family in the hit series are merely a ‘dramatisation' inspired by real life events following a backlash from famous faces including Dame Judi, who accused the show of ‘crude sensationalism'.
She backed calls for a disclaimer to be added to the upcoming series five, and now Netflix bosses appear to have relented as a new trailer for series five carries a message stating the show is fiction.
