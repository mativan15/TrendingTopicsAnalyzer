Golden State took Poole 28th overall in the 2019 draft and watched him go from a G League project into a pillar of last year's championship team.

The 23-year-old is coming off easily the best season of his young career. Poole averaged 18.5 points per game last season and made 211 3-pointers, second on the team behind Steph Curry. He led the entire NBA in free-throw percentage at 92.5%.

Poole took his productivity up a notch when the postseason started. He scored at least 27 points in the Warriors' first three first-round games against Denver and ignited for 31 points in a tone-setting second-round win over Memphis.
