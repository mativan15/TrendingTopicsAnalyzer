Argyle Studio was initially designed as a temporary pop-up shop to showcase diverse Pittsburgh artists. After a year of building connections, however, the dynamic Forbes Avenue retail space seems to be here to stay. "The mission is to bridge, build and transform," said Christine Bethea, an award-winning mixed media artist and current president of Women of Visions, a collective of Black female artists in Pittsburgh founded in 1981. In May 2021, she launched Argyle Studio in the heart of Oakland with her daughter, Brigette Bethea, to combat the lack of Black and brown representation in the Pittsburgh arts — an issue the co-founders say is an intergenerational concern.
