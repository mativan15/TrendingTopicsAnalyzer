Price gains flattened and the inventory of homes available for sale continued to rise in May, early signs that the gravity of higher mortgage rates might be finally starting to pull metro Denver's housing market back to earth, according to a monthly update from the Denver Metro Association of Realtors.
There were 3,652 homes and condos available for sale at the end of May in metro Denver, which is 14% more than the number available at the end of April. More noticeable, the inventory was 76% higher than at the end of May in 2021, when the market was starved for supply.
