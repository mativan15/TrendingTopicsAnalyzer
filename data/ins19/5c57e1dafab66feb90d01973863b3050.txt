Asian equities were broadly lower overnight except for Indonesia and Malaysia posting +1% returns. US-listed Chinese stocks (ADRs) were off significantly yesterday on little tangible news. After the US stock market opened, online real estate company KE Holdings (BEKE US) had a 14mm share block trade at a -8% discount to the previous day's close. BEKE's 1-year average volume is almost 14mm shares, so this was a significant sale leading to speculation that an asset manager was forced to sell or have redemptions leading to potential future sales in the China ADR space.
