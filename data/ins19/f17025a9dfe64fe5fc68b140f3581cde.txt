Dr. Jim Dobies founded UrgentVet after noticing a need for after-hours veterinary care in the area.

It was after visiting an urgent care in 2013 that Dr. Jim Dobies had an idea.

Dobies, who has practiced as a veterinarian in Gaston County for more than 20 years, went to an urgent care to receive treatment after contracting hand, foot and mouth disease, a virus common in young children, from his infant.

"And so I got in the car, drove five minutes, popped into the urgent care here and got a shot, went home in less than an hour and started to feel better almost right away," he said.
