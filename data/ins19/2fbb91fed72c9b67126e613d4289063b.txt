The additional £93.6m suffered over the eight month period is equivalent to £385,000 a day.
Nicholas Lyes, head of roads at the RAC, said Mr Khan's decision to expand the zone last autumn left many drivers with a 'very stark choice: either replace their vehicle with a compliant model or face paying the £12.50 daily charge'.
He added: 'Failing to pay the charge wasn't an option either as it would result in a hefty penalty charge notice.'
Addressing pollution in the capital is a key policy objective of the London mayor, but has brought criticism that he is overseeing a war on drivers.
