"What have I done, but what was expected of me?" Queen Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) raves in "House of the Dragon."  "Where is duty? Where is sacrifice? It's trampled under your pretty foot again."
In the seventh episode, she's fighting with her former friend/current stepdaughter Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy), and eventually slices open Rhaenyra's arm with a knife. The ostensible source of Alicent's outrage is that Rhaenyra's son took our her son's eye in an otherwise childish brawl.
