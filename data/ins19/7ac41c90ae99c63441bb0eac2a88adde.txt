Delia Smith has sold more than 21m copies of her cookery books and inspired generations of British home cooks. Her first name was included in the Collins English Dictionary in 2001, defined as 'recipes in the style of the British cookery writer' and with the highlighted phrase 'doing a Delia'. She was appointed a companion of honour to the late Queen for services to cooking in 2017, not long after she featured in Sir Peter Blake's collage of great British icons in his updated Beatles' Sgt Pepper album cover.
