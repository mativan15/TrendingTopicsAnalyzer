Oct. 20—The Somerset Business and Professional Women's (BPW) Club has a long and proud history. Now, part of it will be preserved for the benefit of all Pulaski County.

On Tuesday, the BPW donated a scrapbook from over 80 years ago to the Pulaski County Historical Society.

"Our club has been around for over 90 years now," said BPW President Rikiyah Pryor. "Here in Somerset, we have had a book passed down from president to president, a scrapbook/yearbook for BPW.

"This particular book (that was donated) was made in 1941, and it went from 1941 to 1942," she added.
