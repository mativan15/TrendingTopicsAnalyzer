No American League player has hit more home runs in a season than Aaron Judge.
No player in any league has crushed more homers in win-or-go-home games than the Yankees superstar.
Judge has followed a regular season that was defined by dominance with a postseason in which he has made his hits count, connecting for his second home run of the series in Game 5's 5-1 victory over the Guardians on Tuesday in The Bronx that sent the Yankees to Houston for the ALCS.
In the second inning, Judge stepped up in a game the Yankees already led 3-0 because of Giancarlo Stanton's first-inning homer, and Judge aimed for the same spot as his bash brother.
