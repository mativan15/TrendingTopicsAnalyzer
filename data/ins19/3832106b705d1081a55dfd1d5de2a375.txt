LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's ASOS, the one-time poster child for the shift to online fashion, vowed to overhaul its business model on Wednesday after the economic crunch combined with a string of operational problems to hammer its profits.

With its shares down 80% this year, ASOS said its new chief executive needed to address international operations including in the United States, improve its supply chain, refresh its culture and find a way to re-engage its 20-something customers.
