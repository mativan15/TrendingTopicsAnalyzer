Once and for all, Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez are shutting down feud rumors (and the internet, for that matter) with their latest interaction at the second annual Academy Museum Gala last night.



During the star-studded event, Bieber and Gomez seemingly hung out and posed for several cute photos together captured by Tyrell Hampton. In one snapshot, the pair shared a sweet embrace while smiling, and in another, they tilted their heads together as Selena rested her hand on Hailey's leg.
