Just Stop Oil protesters glued themselves to Victoria Street in Westminster and sprayed soup over the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) offices.

It was the second protest to affect traffic on Monday. Two climbers ascended Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at the Dartford Crossing at around 5am and still remain, forcing police to close the bridge to vehicles.

Metropolitan Police said a dozen protesters blocked Victoria Street and glued themselves onto the road just after 11.
