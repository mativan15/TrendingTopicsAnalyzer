PM Images Inflation came in hotter than expected, but the markets surprisingly rebounded, only to see a significant portion of Thursday's gains washed away as the S&P 500 closed down -1.64% on the week. Over the past 3 weeks, the Dividend Harvesting Portfolio has gone from being down -12.65% (-$1,050.35) in week 83 to down -11.56% (-$971.36) in week 84 and finishing week 85 -11.19% (-$951.11). 2022 hasn't been a great investment environment for capital appreciation as the S&P 500 is -25.30% on the year, but I believe it's been a great environment for building long-term portfolios as many companies are trading at discounts.
