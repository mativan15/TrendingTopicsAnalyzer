No matter where you sit in a business, you'll likely have heard of environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Your peers in finance, legal/compliance, and risk will have heard of it a lot. And we'll all be hearing a lot more about it in the coming years. But ESG can mean a lot of different things, depending on who is saying it and the context in which they're saying it, which leads to confusion. What Is ESG? Essentially, ESG denotes the qualitative and quantitative data that either: describes a business's environmental status, societal characteristics, and corporate governance (thus ‘E' for environment, ‘S' for social and ‘G' for governance) or … … reflects a business's or sector's or investment's exposure to, and management of, environmental-, social-, or governance-related risks.
