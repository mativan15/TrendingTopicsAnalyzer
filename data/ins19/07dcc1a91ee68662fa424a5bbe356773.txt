The daughter of All Blacks coach Ian Foster is among the latest wave of signings made by Wellington Phoenix ahead of their second A-League Women season. Utility Michaela Foster has joined winger Charlotte Lancaster, centre-back Te Reremona Walker and goalkeeper Georgia Candy in signing scholarship deals with the Phoenix, leaving the club with only two spots left to fill in their 20-strong squad. Foster and Candy are new to the Phoenix and the A-League while Walker and Lancster, both recent New Zealand under-20 representatives, are returning players from last season.
