Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Saturday asserted that his is a unique case where 'a criminal or an accused' is pleading for punishment while the constitutional authorities that should have pronounced judgment are silent. 'The prevalent situation is no less than punishment to me. I have been saying that if I committed a crime, how I am allowed to hold a constitutional post,' Soren said while talking to reporters in a freewheeling conversation at his residence on Saturday.
Soren was referring to the threats of his disqualification as an MLA on the basis of the purported Election Commission advisory to Jharkhand Governor Ramesh Bais on August 25 in an office-of-profit case involving a stone-mining lease.
