Shares of social media company Snap (SNAP) plummeted to a new 52-week low Friday on the back of a third-quarter revenue miss, with knock-on effects for internet Club holdings Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL). But despite the market moves, Snap's results should not be seen as a read through to Meta and Alphabet, which are vastly more substantial entities than Snap. Snap, which has seen its stock come down by nearly 84% year-to-date, tumbled roughly 30% Friday, to $7.56 a share. Revenue suffered as a result of weaker digital advertising , the company said.
