Game Recap: Suns 107, Mavericks 105
PHOENIX — Footprint Center, scene of a 2022 Western Conference semifinals stomping, turned into the site of redemption Wednesday night for the Phoenix Suns, which rallied from a 22-point deficit to defeat the Dallas Mavericks, 107-105.
Damion Lee drained a 10-foot fadeaway for the game winner in front of a sellout crowd of 17,071, as Phoenix avenged last season's stunning home loss to the Mavs in Game 7 of the conference semifinals. The comeback victory marked the home team's largest since 2017, and, since the 2021-22 regular season, the Suns are 6-2 in games decided by three points or less.
