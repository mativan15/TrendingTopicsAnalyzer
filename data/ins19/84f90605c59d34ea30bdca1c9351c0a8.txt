A report commissioned by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption has called for pork barrelling to be prohibited and instead grants should be made strictly on merit after assessments against clear criteria.The report, by the University of Sydney constitutional law expert Prof Anne Twomey, says a major overhaul of the way government makes grants is needed to ensure they are awarded on merit and are no longer used for pork barrelling in marginal seats.She argues politicians would be free to advocate for projects in their electorates or to promise broad funding schemes but should not be permitted to promise funding for particular projects during elections.
