By Australian Associated Press Published: 13:35 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 13:35 EDT, 31 May 2022 Australia likely suffered an economic slowdown in the first few months of the year after the robust finish to 2021. The impact of the COVID-19 Omicron variant and the floods along the east coast of Australia are expected to have dampened activity in the March quarter. Wednesday's national accounts for the March quarter are expected to show the economy grew by around 0.7 per cent, a slight improvement on what economists were predicting last week.
