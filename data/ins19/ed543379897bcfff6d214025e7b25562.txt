Ben Waine has started the new season with a bang after Wellington Phoenix turned down a significant six-figure deal for the young star. The 21-year-old striker has scored five goals in as many games across all competitions and looks primed for a breakout season in the A-League Men. Waine's bright start comes after the Phoenix rejected a concrete offer for him from English League One leaders Plymouth Argyle, the former club of ex-All White Rory Fallon and Phoenix defender Scott Wootton. The Phoenix held firm as they valued the academy product higher than Plymouth were prepared to pay.
