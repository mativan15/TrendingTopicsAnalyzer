While Covid was battering the U.S. economy, Gary Goldberg seems to have done OK.

During 2020, the pandemic's first year, the Santa Barbara, California, real estate agent sold more than $27 million worth of luxury homes, slightly down from the $31 million he closed the year before, according to data from Zillow. In 2021, he sold $82 million worth of real estate.

He also applied for and received two loans totaling $95,832 via the federal government's Covid relief Paycheck Protection Program, according to public records.
