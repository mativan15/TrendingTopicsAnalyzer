Lorna Slater was speaking at the Scottish Green Party conference in Dundee.

The Scottish Government will offer 'no support' for coal extraction, Green minister Lorna Slater has announced.

While there are no currently operational coal mines in Scotland, it means no new pits can be opened due to planning regulations.

Ms Slater, the minister for Green Skills, Circular Economy and Biodiversity, made the announcement on the first day of the Scottish Green Party conference in Dundee.

In June, the Scottish Government opened a consultation on the future of coal extraction.
