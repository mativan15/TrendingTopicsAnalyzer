SAO PAULO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China's Goldwind (002202.SZ) is in advanced talks to install a wind turbine factory in Brazil with deliveries expected to start in 2024, an executive said on Wednesday.

The plant, whose location is not yet defined, will serve the Brazilian market, but may also export equipment to other countries in South America, according to Roberto Veiga, general manager of Goldwind in Brazil.

"We will start offering this turbine on the market already in mid-2023," Veiga told journalists in a wind industry event, adding that the first deliveries should start in 2024.
