With less than a week to go until Peninsula residents rush to the polls for one last chance at casting their ballots, the race to replace retiring Congresswoman Jackie Speier has narrowed down to four politicos who have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to sway voters.
California Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Mullin, San Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa, and Burlingame councilmember Emily Beach are the Democratic candidates to succeed Speier, and lone Republican candidate Gus Mattammal is likely to go against one of them in the general election on November 8.
