The Los Angeles Rams beat the 49ers to the punch when they acquired Matthew Stafford last year, a quarterback San Francisco was also interested in. Kyle Shanahan returned the favor this week by trading for a star running back the Rams liked: Christian McCaffrey.
The 49ers are sending a package of picks to the Panthers for McCaffrey, bolstering an already-impressive roster. It was assumed and reported that the Rams were interested in McCaffrey, especially given the situation with Cam Akers, and it turns out they did attempt to trade for the Panthers RB.
