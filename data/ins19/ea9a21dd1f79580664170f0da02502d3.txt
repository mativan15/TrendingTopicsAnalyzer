Desperate employers fighting for staff in Britain's increasingly tight jobs market are being forced to stump up tens of thousands of pounds in sign-on bonuses and other perks.
Over 12,000 advertised vacancies are offering "golden handshake" deals worth up to £20,000, according to research by job search engine Adzuna.
A year ago only 5,000 roles had signing bonuses, suggesting companies are being forced to be inventive in a jobs market where the number of vacancies has outnumbered the total unemployed for the first time.
