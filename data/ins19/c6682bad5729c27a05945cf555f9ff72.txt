martinrlee Western Union (NYSE:WU) introduced on Thursday 2023 earnings guidance that falls far short of Wall Street's consensus as its operations are affected by the sale of its Business Solutions unit, the loss of two key agents in Europe, the suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus, and the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. The company will introduce preliminary guidance for next year for adjusted EPS of $1.55-$1.66, lower than the $1.80 consensus estimate. 2023 adjusted revenue is expected to decline ~2%-4%.
