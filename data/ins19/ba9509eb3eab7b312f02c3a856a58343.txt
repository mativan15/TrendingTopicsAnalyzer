Wolterk/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) shares rose 3% Tuesday as Piper Sandler analyst James Fish raised his rating on the networking infrastructure company due to what he expects will be a "flush" of orders working their way through the industry's supply chain in 2023. Fish lifted his take on Juniper (JNPR) to neutral from underweight, largely because of an analysis of the state of order backlogs in the networking equipment supply chain. Fish said that while supply chains still have a long way to get back to their standard levels, there are some signs of normalizing, which should see orders that have been put off, or delayed, starting to work their way through to end customers.
