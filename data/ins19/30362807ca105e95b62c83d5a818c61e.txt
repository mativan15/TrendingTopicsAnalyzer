DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am fortunate to be the principal of a wonderful school. It is not an exaggeration to say that I receive gifts from children and parents almost daily, partially due to their gratitude that we were in-person during this difficult year.
Spontaneous gifts from children, such as their own personal drawings or sharing of a birthday cupcake, are charming, of course. It is the adult-bought gifts that are the problem.
I love gratitude! But the gifts are misplaced — it is my amazing teachers who deserve these gifts.
