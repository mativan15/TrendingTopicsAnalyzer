MIAMI, Oct. 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Earlier this month, Miami-based digital customer engagement platform Messangi announced it is going to complement its SMS-based A2P messaging with WhatsApp as an alternate channel. The company, which had been focused on SMS as its primary communication channel for customers since 2001, initiated this change to reflect industry-wide changes in user behavior.

"Over the past few years, we've seen WhatsApp establish itself as the dominant communication method in many global regions," said Messangi CEO Santiago Rojas.
