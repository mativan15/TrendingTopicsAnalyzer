Joe Biden has been criticised for making "terribly rude" remarks about Liz Truss's income tax U-turn. And Tory peer Lord Daniel Moylan also urged the US president to 'give me a call' for a lesson on basic economics. Mr Biden was questioned about Ms Truss on Saturday, the day after the Prime Minister fired Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and scrapped parts of the Government's economic package in the wake of financial market turmoil, including a dip in the value of the pound.However his comments nonplussed Lord Moylan, a close ally of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson who served as his chief airport adviser when he was Mayor of London.
