In his address, Lukashenko added: 'Mobilise everyone, it is reported to me that in our secondary school it is forbidden to involve school children to pick up apples, or as we used to do: potatoes, beetroot, flax and so on."I cannot imagine greater savagery… We somehow try to educate our schoolchildren, our children. What will you use? Talking? You can't educate them by talking."We went to the potato harvest in September, students and so on. This unites people brings them together, they understand and what it is.
