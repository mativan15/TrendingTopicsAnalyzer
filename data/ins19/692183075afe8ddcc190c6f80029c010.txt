You just have to look at the valuation, which is so lowly, on the basis of earnings, book value and yield, that it feels like a disaster on the scale of 2007-09 is already priced into the stock. If things don't turn out to be that bad, the shares look cheap. And if things go even vaguely right at any stage, the shares could look like a steal.
