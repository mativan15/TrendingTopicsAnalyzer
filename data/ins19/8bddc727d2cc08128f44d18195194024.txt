Dottie Pepper recalls being paired with Meg Mallon for the final round of the 1991 U.S. Women's Open with what she viewed as an impressive $110,000 US first-place prize on the line.Things have changed, but Lydia Ko says not enough.Mallon would win that tournament and earn the record-breaking payday."It was the first time a winning check was six figures," Pepper said. "That was a big deal."Pepper has a hard time believing that a little more than three decades later, the top female golfers in the world will be competing for a record $10 million purse, including a winner's share of $1.
