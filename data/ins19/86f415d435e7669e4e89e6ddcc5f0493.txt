An e-petition calling for an immediate general election has gathered pace in the wake of Liz Truss' resignation, surpassing 700,000 signatures on Friday.
Listed on the government website this summer, the petition gained little attention until September's disastrous ‘mini-budget' pushed it past the 100,000 mark.
MPs were forced to discuss the issue as a result, holding a 90-minute debate in the Commons on Monday.
The surrounding publicity had launched it from 100,000 to 500,000 in just a few days, making it one of the most popular petitions ever to appear on parliament.
