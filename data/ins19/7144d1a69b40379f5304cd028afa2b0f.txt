In the atmosphere of ugly Islamophobia that the votaries of Hindutva have created, I feel guilty about bringing up hijab once more in this column. I feel obliged to do this for two reasons. The obvious one is the judgment from the Supreme Court last week that was split between one judge asserting that the important thing was for Muslim girls to get an education, whether they did it veiled or not. And his colleague taking the view that if a college has rules about uniforms, then students are obliged to accept these rules or go to another college.
