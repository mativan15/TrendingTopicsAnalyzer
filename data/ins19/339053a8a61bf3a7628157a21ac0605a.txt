Audience members were facing difficult decisions on what to spend their money on, Royal & Derngate theatre chief executive Jo Gordon said

A theatre is facing a "double whammy" of rising costs and cash-strapped customers, its chief executive said.

Jo Gordon, of the Royal & Derngate, in Northampton, said it was having to look at "innovative" ways to make money.

She said its fuel bills and show costs had both risen at time when audiences were also under financial pressure.

"All we can do is create the best experience and price things right," she said.
