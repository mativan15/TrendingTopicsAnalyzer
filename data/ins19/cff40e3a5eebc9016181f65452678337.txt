It's not your imagination – it really is getting easier to find critical semiconductors.
According to Susquehanna, a company that researches markets to inform its complex equity trading strategies, semiconductor lead times were down four days on average last month. "September represents the first real signs of [lead time] capitulation in our data," the analysts wrote in the firm's latest SemiSIGnals report.
Silicon to regulate power, metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), and clock and timing chips saw the largest improvements, with lead times falling by 13–16 days in September.
