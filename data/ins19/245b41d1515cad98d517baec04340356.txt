Former NZ First MP Shane Jone says ACT is showing 'desperation' by raising a claimed conflict of interest issue from when he was a Cabinet minister. ACT Party leader David Seymour wrote to the Auditor-General on Tuesday – days before NZ First was set to hold its annual conferece – over a claimed conflict of interest issue involving Jones and a $9.8 million government loan. Jones was one of four ministers to handle the $9.8m Provincial Growth Fund spend for the refurbishment of a slipway at Nelson port, a joint effort between Ports of Nelson and port services company Aimex, which had donated $5000 to Jones' campaign fund more than a year earlier.
