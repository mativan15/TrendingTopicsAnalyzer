The department of Electrical Communication Engineering (ECE) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has developed a record-breaking true random number generator (TRNG), which can improve data encryption and provide improved security for sensitive digital data such as credit card details, passwords and other personal information.
'Almost everything we do on the internet is encrypted for security. The strength of this encryption depends on the quality of random number generation,' said Nithin Abraham, a PhD student at ECE.
