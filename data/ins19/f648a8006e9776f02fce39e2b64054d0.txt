Updated: 18 Oct 2022, 08:50 PM ISTDomestic equity markets closed higher on Tuesday, led by heavyweight Reliance, banking and IT stocks. S&P BSE Sensex rose 550 points to settle at 58,960 while Nifty50 closed above the 17,450 level.'The short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. A decisive move above 17,450-17,500 levels is likely to bring bulls back into the driver's seat and that could pull Nifty towards the upside target of 18,000 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 17,425,' said Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities.
