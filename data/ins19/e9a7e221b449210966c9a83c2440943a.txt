Another Tory MP has broken cover, demanding Liz Truss resigns for 'undermining the UK's credibility'. Jamie Wallis is the second Tory MP to insist the Prime Minister to go, the first earlier today suggesting 'the game's up'.The Bridgend and Porthcawl MP has written to Ms Truss under the impression 'you no longer hold the confidence of the country or the parliamentary party'.In a letter published on social media, Dr Wallis wrote that the Tory party's endurance is down to 'out willingness to adapt and evolve where it is necessary to serve the interests of the British people' – a 'fundamental aim' which 'should always override all other considerations, especially for those who seek or occupy high office'.
