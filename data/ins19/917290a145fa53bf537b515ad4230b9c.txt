Nikki Finke (credit: Twitter.com/NikkiFinke)Last month, my first book was published and I noted it was the culmination of my efforts to solely focus on covering the January 6 attack. With that project complete and the House select committee hearings coming to an end for now, it is time for me to broaden the focus of this newsletter. From here on out, I will be sharing stories about whatever's on my mind. Things will probably get a little more weird. I think it's going to be a lot of fun. It's also going to be totally free for the time being and I will let you know well in advance if that is going to change.
