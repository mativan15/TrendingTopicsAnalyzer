BATHINDA: Noted Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala might be a heartthrob of youngsters with millions of followers to his songs but he could not match his macho image in the electoral politics. When he had joined the Congress party in the company of then chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and then Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and immediately dashed off to Delhi to meet Rahul Gandhi , he was projected as a youth icon but Moosewala could not take this image to the minds of people as he was opposed even from within the party, who were eyeing the party ticket.
