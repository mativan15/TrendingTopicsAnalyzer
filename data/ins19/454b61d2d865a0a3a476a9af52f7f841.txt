Earlier this year, my 11-year-old son Charlie said he wanted to invest in crypto. Although I work for a superannuation fund, I knew very little about cryptocurrencies and was busy juggling work, life and three kids, so I fobbed him off. But he kept asking, insisting it was a way to get rich, and lots of famous people were doing it.His eyes sparkled with hope. Imagine the riches! It turns out he was receiving his investment advice from online gamers and YouTubers who spruik crypto to their millions of adoring young followers.
