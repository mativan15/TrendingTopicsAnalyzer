OPINION:

The Republic of Molossia is a 1-acre micronation in Nevada not recognized by anyone on Earth. Its currency, however, is sounder than the dollar, pegged to a fixed commodity the way U.S. currency was once fixed to the value of gold, a policy that serves as a built-in barrier to inflation.

Molossia is a 1-acre joke and a tourist destination. Its 'president,' Kevin Baugh, rules as a benevolent dictator over 35 citizens — 32 of his relatives and three dogs. Transactions are conducted in Valora, and bank notes and coins are issued in various denominations.
