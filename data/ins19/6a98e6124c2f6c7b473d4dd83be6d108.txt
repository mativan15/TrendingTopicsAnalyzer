A small business owner is locked in a trademark dispute with the international retail giant Zara.Amber Kotrri launched House of Zana, a sustainable clothing company, in Darlington, Co Durham, in 2019 but soon found herself embroiled in a legal battle with the Spanish fashion brand.Zara claims that Kotrri's boutique, which sells sustainable clothing and locally sourced artisan products, is 'conceptually identical' to its own and 'confusingly similar' for customers.The word zana means fairy in her husband's country of birth, Albania, says Kotrri, and her products are handmade by seamstresses.
