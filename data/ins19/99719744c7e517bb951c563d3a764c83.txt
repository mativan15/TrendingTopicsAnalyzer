For Melissa, cooking for herself is now a luxury. The 23-year-old psychology student prefers to stroll to the cafeteria at her university in Bonn. "You can get lunch there for €2 to €3 ($1.94 to $2.92)." It's not that living frugally is new to Melissa. Even during her school years, the weekly shopping budget was €25. But the increased prices now make that impossible. "I'm already at €35 to €40 a week if I really buy food to cook at home. You really notice it in your wallet." The student receives €750 a month in federal student grants (BAföG) and gets the €219 her parents receive as child benefit.
