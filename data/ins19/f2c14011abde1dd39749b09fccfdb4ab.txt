June 3, 2022, 7:30 PM UTCBy Bridget BowmanFormer President Donald Trump hasn't endorsed a challenger against Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., but the congressman could still be facing a tough primary fight next week in a race that's seen a spike in ad spending and some Democratic meddling. Valadao was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former president after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. Even though Trump hasn't weighed in on the race in the 22nd District, Valadao has drawn two challengers from his right: former Fresno City Councilman Chris Mathys and King County School Board Member Adam Medeiros.
