When 29-year-old Chyan Smith left her medical receptionist job in August 2021, she wasn't sure what she wanted to do with her life. Fast-forward only a few months later, and she'd reinvented herself as a self-employed locksmith, helping customers who've been locked out of their homes and cars through the home service marketplace Jobox.Only 10 to 15% of locksmiths are women, but Smith says it's the creative, hands-on, flexible, service-oriented, and well-paying job she was looking for. She hopes she can inspire other women to explore outside-the-box jobs as they look for a fulfilling career, even if a job might seem "kind of crazy" from afar.
