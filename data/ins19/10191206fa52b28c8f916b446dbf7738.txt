Downtown eatery's terrifying popup bar

Downtown mainstay Panzano is adding some new character for the Halloween season — a popup bar in the connected Kimpton Monaco Hotel Denver called the Redrum Lounge meant to conjure images of 'The Shining' while guests enjoy themed drinks and dishes. The hotel transformed a former onsite spa into the lounge on Thursday and will keep it open through mid-November, operating from 5:30 to 11 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays.

In addition to décor emulating that of the Overlook Hotel and its rooms from Stephen King 's famous Colorado-inspired book, guests can nosh on light bites reminiscent of key moments in the movie, such as elk jerky, charcuterie and fries with house-made ketchup.
