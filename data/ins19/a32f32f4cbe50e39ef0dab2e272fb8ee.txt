Online business forms company LegalZoom Inc. has acquired Revv, an India-based document automation and forms template company.

Glendale, California-based LegalZoom (Nasdaq: LZ) didn't provide financial terms of the deal.

LegalZoom said Revv's proprietary technology will enhance LegalZoom's forms library and legal templates and will be used to develop modern product experiences and services for small businesses.

Bangalore, India-based Revv was founded in 2018 by ex-Freshworks executives Rishi Kulkarni and Sameer Goel.
