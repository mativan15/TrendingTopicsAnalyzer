gorodenkoff Shares of Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE:CRL) have fallen dramatically over the past year, as this one-time growth stock has struggled from operational missteps and higher interest rates, "busting" its growth story. Despite setbacks, the company is operating in a high-growth space with drug investment rising in a fairly secular fashion. At 18-19x earnings, shares are caught in a no man's land, particularly as there is some further downside risk guidance. I view shares as rangebound and would wait until $180 to add a position.
