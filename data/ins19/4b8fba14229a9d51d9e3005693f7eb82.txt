Deutsche Bank ditched Hertha Berlin as a client over the Bundesliga football club's links to financier Lars Windhorst, after a series of scandals forced the German lender to step up its compliance regime. The bank took the decision last year, according to four people familiar with the matter, after the Financial Times reported that Windhorst was under investigation by Berlin prosecutors over potential violations of the country's banking act following a criminal complaint by German financial watchdog BaFin.
