El Paso City Council member Claudia Rodriguez called out the city's Democratic mayor, saying he's been caught in a lie. Leeser denied Rodriguez's allegation that he was pressured by the White House to avoid declaring the migrant influx an emergency, insisting he made the decision himself. "Absolutely not," the Democratic mayor told host Dana Perino. "One of the things we need to learn and really make sure we do is that we take the politics out of this."Video footage from a September city council meeting, however, appears to show otherwise.
