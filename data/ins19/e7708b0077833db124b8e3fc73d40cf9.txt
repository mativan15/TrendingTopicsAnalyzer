I saved over $800 on a 7-day Alaskan cruise by sleeping on a pull-out couch in a 205-square-foot room, and I'd totally do it again

As a 24-year-old just making ends meet, I didn't think I could afford a trip to Alaska. But I couldn't say no to the opportunity of a lifetime.My friends were going on an Alaskan cruise and, as a born-and-raised Floridian, I wanted in. The Alaskan wilderness (or any wilderness that's not overdeveloped beaches and condos) was unknown and desirable territory for me.The 7-day cruise set sail from Seattle, Washington, and went around Alaska (Juneau, Skagway, Glacier Bay National Park, Ketchikan), and across the border to Victoria BC before returning to the Pacific Northwest.
