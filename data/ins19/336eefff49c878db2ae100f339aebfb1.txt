Jun. 3—XENIA — Greene County Public Library has been awarded $500,000 to renovate the Xenia Library's "makerspace" as part of the county's latest round of American Rescue Plan Act grants.

Greene County's Spark Place has been used by everyone from Air Force Research Lab engineers making quick 3-D printed heads for testing pilot helmets, to kids making homemade Christmas presents for their families.
