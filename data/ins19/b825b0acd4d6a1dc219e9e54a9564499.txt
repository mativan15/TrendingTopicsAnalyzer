There are two new additions to the Country Music Hall of Fame, both of whom started their music careers in different genres, Jerry Lee Lewis, who began as a rock performer, and the late Keith Whitley, who initially got his start as a bluegrass performer.Lewis, also known as "The Killer," was not present at the ceremony on Sunday in Nashville, Tennessee, as he was following his doctor's suggestions. However, country music stars Hank Williams Jr. and Kris Kristofferson were there to accept the honor on behalf of the 87-year-old Rock & Roll Hall of Famer.
