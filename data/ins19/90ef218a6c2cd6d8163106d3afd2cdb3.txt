BERLIN — Police raided homes and offices in northern and western Germany on Tuesday as part of an investigation into a case involving five men accused of fraudulently applying for 26 million ($28 million) worth of pandemic-linked aid. The German government drew up a series of aid packages to help businesses withstand the impact of lockdowns and other restrictions at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. The suspects in this investigation — men aged 26 to 62 — are suspected of making at least 363 aid applications under false pretenses "for their own purposes and for companies that commissioned them," according to a police statement.
