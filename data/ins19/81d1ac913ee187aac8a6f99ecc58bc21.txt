All startups must grow, but as markets contract, conserving resources is a higher short-term priority.

Crypto exchange Coinbase is in the headlines this morning after news broke that it is rescinding some candidates' outstanding job offers.

Yesterday, we reported that IRL, a social app, was laying off 25% of its staff a year after raising a $170 million Series A, even though it has enough cash to operate for another two years.

I don't have any insight into IRL or Coinbase's financials, but I can say with certainty that these companies will have a harder time hiring talented employees from now on.
