Contending that corruption was increasing due to rising greed in the society, former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde said the institution of Lokayukta was capable of controlling corruption provided an honest effort was made in the direction. .Mr Hegde, who was in Mysuru on Monday to attend a function, told reporters that corruption was largely a government affair. Even though a private person is at fault only when he or she gives a bribe, the recipient is always a government official. Hence, corruption was largely a government affair, but the Lokayukta was capable of controlling the menace of corruption if honest efforts are made.
