THE ENFORCEMENT Directorate (ED) has summoned Tapas Mondal, a close aide of Trinamool MLA Manik Bhattacharya, in connection with its investigation into the SSC recruitment scam. He has been asked to appear before officials on October 20. Tapas's son Bijesh Mondal said that his father is in Haridwar at present, adding that he would abide by the summons.
On Saturday, ED officers searched the Mondal residence in Barasat in North 24 Parganas yesterday for nearly 11 hours.
The ED, which is probing the money laundering angle in the recruitment scam, arrested Bhattacharya on October 11 for his alleged involvement in the scam related to recruitment of teachers in state-run primary schools.
