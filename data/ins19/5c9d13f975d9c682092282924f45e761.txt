Jean-Luc Ichard/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) issued a guidance revision Thursday for both its top- and bottom-line, citing stronger-than-expected FX headwinds amidst a surging U.S. dollar. The revision comes on the heels of a similar sales outlook adjustment by software peer Salesforce (CRM) earlier this week, which cited a $600 million negative FX impact on its revenues for the current fiscal year. And more can be expected on the way, including technology giants like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (FB), and Google (GOOG/GOOGL), which all generate a meaningful portion of sales overseas.
