Leaders who extend their reach to build beyond their organizations constitute the inaugural class of the Power 100.

Many gathered Oct. 13 at Camp North End for a reception recognizing the people who will drive the Charlotte region's next stage of growth. The Charlotte Business Journal's Inaugural Power 100 includes professionals who span healthcare, manufacturing, finance, technology, government, retailing, nonprofits, commercial real estate and many other sectors.

What binds them together is a commitment to use their influence to shape not only their companies into strong job-generating organizations but to advance the greater good of the region.
