Eoneren San Francisco-based Hims & Hers (NYSE:HIMS) grew by 87% for its last reported quarter with a gross margin of just under 77% as EBITDA profitability came into view. Despite this, the company continues to experience an almost historic collapse of its common shares as the market, under siege by a hawkish Fed, discounts growth to new lows. Don't fight the Fed has gone too far, bears too rapacious, and the pullback now moving into the extreme. Whilst common shares don't necessarily become cheap just because they have fallen from what bears describe as unsustainable all-time highs, Hims is now trading at a price-to-forward sales multiple of 1.
