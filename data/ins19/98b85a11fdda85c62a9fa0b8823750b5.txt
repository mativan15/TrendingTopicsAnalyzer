Shopify 's valuation will likely continue to be hurt by the uncertain economic outlook even if its bottom line isn't showing warning signs, RBC said. "While macro uncertainty and higher risk-free rates are likely to continue to weigh on Shopify's valuation through the end of 2022, we believe Shopify is one of the most compelling long-term growth stories in our coverage universe," analyst Paul Treiber said in a note to clients. He cut Shopify's price target to $55 from $60 despite keeping the stock at an outperform.
