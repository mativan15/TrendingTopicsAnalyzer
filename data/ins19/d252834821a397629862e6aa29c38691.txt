The holiday company Tui is cancelling more than 180 flights from Manchester airport until the end of next month as half-term travel chaos continues unabated.Tui said they were axing six flights a day at the hub from 31 May until 30 June, adding to the chaos facing passengers at airports this week as they battle lengthy queues and cancelled takeoffs.Tui, which had already announced some flight cancellations and delays at the weekend, blamed 'ongoing disruption in our operation at Manchester' for the 'incredibly difficult decision' to cancel 43 flights a week.
