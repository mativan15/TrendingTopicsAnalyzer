A day after The Indian Express reported on the deaths of Indian migrant workers in Qatar while working on projects or in jobs linked to the football World Cup, the Centre and the Telangana government have stepped in to assure help to their next of kin.
Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said Friday that he has asked the Indian Embassy in Doha to help the bereaved families secure compensation from the Qatari employers involved. Mohammed Mahmood Ali, Home Minister of Telangana where several of these families are based, said the state is looking into the report so that a compensation package can be decided, including a government job for a family member if applicable.
