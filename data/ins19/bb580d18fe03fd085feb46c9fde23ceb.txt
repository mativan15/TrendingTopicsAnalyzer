Astronomers have observed a supermassive black hole with a bad case of indigestion, apparently after shredding and eating a star. The black hole, at the center of a galaxy some 665 million light-years from Earth, was caught vomiting or belching stellar bits about three years after it consumed a star that wandered too close. Scientists say because they're not aware of the hole gobbling up any other stars since then, it must have been that October 2018 meal coming back to haunt it. This is the first time researchers have ever witnessed a black hole with a delayed spewing of material after feasting.
