Special Olympian Chris Klein-Geltink knows exactly which truck he wants to be rewarded at the Woodstock Truck Show. 'This one, the number 22,' says Geltink, leaning against the rig. In fact, he's the main reason the event exists. 'It was Chris himself who asked me to do the ride for Special Olympics out of Paris,' says Scott Verbruggen, the founder of the event. 'I went to the show with a few hundred dollars to donate and I saw the support they're getting from other people and I want to do more.' The event began in 2014, but after a break due to the pandemic, they are back, with Verbruggen bringing in close to 70 big rigs, and four country music acts.
