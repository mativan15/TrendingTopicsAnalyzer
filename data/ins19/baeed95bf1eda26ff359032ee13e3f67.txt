By Anthony Harrup MEXICO CITY--Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB has pulled out of the bidding for the Mexican unit of Citigroup Inc., which the U.S. financial giant put up for sale in January. In a filing Friday with the Mexican Stock Exchange, Banorte said it is no longer taking part in the process in which Citigroup is seeking a buyer for the consumer, small business and middle market operations of Banamex. Banorte, Mexico's second-largest bank by loans and third-largest by assets, was seen as a leading candidate to acquire the Citi unit.
