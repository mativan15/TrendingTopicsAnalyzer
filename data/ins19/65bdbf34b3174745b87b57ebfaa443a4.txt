On Tuesday night at the Malden High School Senior Awards, the mayor of Malden, Gary Christenson, announced a new scholarship. Christenson told the members of the graduating class of 2022 that every single one of them that is heading to college is going to get $1-thousand from the city. Malden is using money they received through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which was meant to help cities address the negative impacts of COVID-19.
