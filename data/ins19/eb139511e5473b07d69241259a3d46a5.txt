Pakistan's record-breaking floods this summer have caused more than €40 billion in damages, according to a World Bank estimate relayed by the country today.

That's $10 billion (€10bn) more than an earlier estimate by the Pakistani government.

The cash-strapped South Asian nation was already facing a serious financial crisis before the heavy monsoon rains hit in mid-June.

The rains triggered unprecedented floods that at one point left a third of the country's territory submerged, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move to safer places.
