Nissan Motor Co. NSANY recently notified its dealers in the United States to stop taking new orders for the company's 2023 battery-electric Ariya SUV on the grounds of supply chain issues that have been affecting production at home in Japan.



Nissan believes that it is judicious to scale down orders to the level at which it can realistically deliver this year. Demand for Ariya SUV has been surging in the United States, Europe and Japan. Previously, the Ariya plant had experienced disruptions when production was halted in 2020 due to semiconductor supply issues and the pandemic.
