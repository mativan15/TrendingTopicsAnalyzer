Low-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) share price. It's up 33% over three years, but that is below the market return. Having said that, the 30% increase over the past year is good to see.

Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
