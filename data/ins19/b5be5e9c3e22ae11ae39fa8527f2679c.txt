El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser is denying allegations the White House encouraged him not to declare a state of emergency over the border crisis, as the influx of illegal migrants continues to overwhelm the Texas city. Leeser, a Democrat, joined "America's Newsroom" Wednesday to discuss the report, denying the Biden administration had any involvement in his decision against the declaration. "Absolutely not," Lesser told co-host Dana Perino when asked if the White House pressured him. "One of the things that I'm very thankful to, the White House, the federal government, they've done a really, really good job of working with us and helping us to make sure we get funding to be able to do the job that border cities are required to do.
