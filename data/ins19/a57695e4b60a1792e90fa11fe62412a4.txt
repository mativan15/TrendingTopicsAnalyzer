LONDON (Reuters) - Schools in Scotland, Uganda, Chile, Philippines and the United States triumphed at the inaugural "World's Best School Prizes" on Wednesday for feats including saving mangroves and expanding classrooms in an area hit by war.

The five schools shared $250,000 in prize money for supporting pupils and communities, especially during the pandemic, in the awards organised by global body T4 Education.

Dunoon Grammar School in Scotland won the category of community collaboration for skill-based courses, including in travel and tourism, design and maritime studies, intended to stem a brain-drain.
