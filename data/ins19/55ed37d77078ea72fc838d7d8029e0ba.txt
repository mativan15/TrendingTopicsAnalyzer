(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Marko Kolanovic is trimming risk allocations in the bank's model portfolio as he grows more cautious about economic and market recoveries.Kolanovic, who has been Wall Street's most vocal bull this year, cut the size of his equity overweight and bond underweight allocations, citing increasing risks from central bank policies and geopolitics.'Recent developments on these fronts -- namely, the increasingly hawkish rhetoric from central banks, and escalation of the war in Ukraine -- are likely to delay the economic and market recovery,' Kolanovic, JPMorgan's chief global markets strategist, wrote in a note to clients late on Monday.
