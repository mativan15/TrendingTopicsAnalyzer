Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) is sinking, last seen down 22.6% to trade at $19.68, after the company missed fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimates. And even though profits were in line with Wall Street's expectations, a dismal current-quarter revenue forecast is also weighing on the security. In response, Oppenheimer cut its price target on APPS to $40 from $117.

Covering analysts are still firmly bullish on Digital Turbine stock, with all five calling it a "strong buy." However, should this optimism start to unwind, the security could tumble even lower.
