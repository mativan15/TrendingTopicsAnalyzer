A rebellion on the Conservative benches is already brewing, with MPs vowing to vote down the change in the House of Commons.
Asked on Tuesday whether the pensions triple lock was still in place, Downing Street confirmed the promise was on pause as the new policy was being worked out.
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "We are very aware of how many vulnerable pensioners there are and indeed our priority ahead of this fiscal plan is we continue to protect the most vulnerable in society.
