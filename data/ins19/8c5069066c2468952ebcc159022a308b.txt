A video showed the 35-year-old Lafferty appearing to pose for a photo with a fan who then expressed support for Celtic, the defending Scottish champion which traditionally is supported by people of Catholic faith. Lafferty, who played for Rangers - Celtic´s fierce rival in Glasgow - in two spells, was then heard using an expletive and derogatory term for Catholics and Irish nationalists.
