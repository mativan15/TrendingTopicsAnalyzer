We are actually remarkably close to Black Friday at the moment. Not only are we weeks away from the early deals kicking in, but it's also only a matter of time before we start seeing real Black Friday offers as well, with price promises to boot. Well, Target has gotten the memo, and is already promising to refund the difference if any of its deals get cheaper over Black Friday (so keep an eye on the sales if you do buy anything).

Right now one of my favorite deals over there is on the Apple Watch Series 7 45mm model, which is currently down to just $309.
