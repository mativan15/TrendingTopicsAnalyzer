May 27—RAYNHAM — U.S. Army Veteran Bridget McNutt felt at peace Thursday for the first time since returning home after a 17-year stint in the military.

That peace came when she walked into her new home located at the Warriors Way Veterans Village, a housing community established by the Lumbee Tribe for its veteran members in need.

McNutt, one of those veterans, said that when she retired and came home in 2011 after an injury, she had changed.

"I'm different. I feel like I'm in a foreign country being at home.
