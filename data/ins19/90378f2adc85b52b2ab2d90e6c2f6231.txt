Published October 20, 2022 12:38pm EDT After President Biden announced an additional 15 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) would be released to combat rising gas prices just weeks before the midterm elections, one American oil industry leader is now calling it the "strategic political reserve" that put us in a "very precarious position." "This is a very precarious position we're in today at a time of dramatic geopolitical upheaval," American Petroleum Institute president and CEO Mike Sommers told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo Thursday.
