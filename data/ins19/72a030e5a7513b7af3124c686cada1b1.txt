Elon Musk's Starlink will "keep funding Ukraine" after SpaceX asked the Pentagon for funding to continue the company's operations in the European country. Musk made the announcement in a tweet on Saturday afternoon after sending a letter to the Pentagon in September stating that the company can't continue to keep funding Starlink services to Ukraine.  "The hell with it … even though Starlink is still losing money & other companies are getting billions of taxpayer $, we'll just keep funding Ukraine govt for free," Musk said in the tweet.
