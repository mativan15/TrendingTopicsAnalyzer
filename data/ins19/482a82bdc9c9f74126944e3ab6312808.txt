Hillsborough County leaders gathered Tuesday to promote a new affordable housing project on Busch Boulevard.

Commissioners approved in September up to $16.2 million in federal money from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act to rehabilitate a 96-unit multifamily rental property near the University of South Florida. The complex, called Armature Place Apartments, will be used as affordable housing for 30 years, according to the county.

The complex was built in 1985, according to Hillsborough County property records.
