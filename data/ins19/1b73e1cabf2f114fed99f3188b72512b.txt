BJP on Thursday asked Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann not to make appointment of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor (V-C) a prestige issue, and asked him to accept its ‘illegality'.
'CM Mann is trying to defend the indefensible,' BJP state general secretary Subhash Sharma said, while reacting to the letter written by the CM to Punjab governor after the latter asked him to remove the V-C who dubbed his appointment illegal and against the UGC norms.
The BJP leader said that the PAU board of management (BOM) is no doubt authorised to appoint the V-C, but there is another condition that in case it fails to reach a decision within two months, the matter should be referred to the chancellor, who is the governor.
