: The Haryana government is yet to fix state approved price (SAP) for sugarcane for the year 2022-23 even as crushing operations are set to start from next month. However, officials privy to the information said that the decision to increase the SAP was not taken in the annual meeting of the Sugarcane Control Board held on September 7 as the sugar mills were not in favour of increasing the sugarcane prices, citing that the state was already providing the highest ₹ 362 per quintal for early maturing varieties of sugarcane and ₹355 per quintal for late maturing varieties.
