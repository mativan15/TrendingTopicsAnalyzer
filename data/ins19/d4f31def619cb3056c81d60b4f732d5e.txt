'Now I'm just hanging out in my lounge room all dressed up nowhere to go and I'm just tired of the fight. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how much I can fight to just do the basics like fly, deliver a speech and make money.'Liddell said she had been inundated with messages from other travellers with similar experiences after sharing her ordeal on social media. She encouraged her supporters to complain to Qantas and Jetstar.In a statement, Jetstar said carrying a large lithium battery on a plane required special clearance ahead of the flight's departure.
