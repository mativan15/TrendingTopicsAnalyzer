The next generation of Mercedes-AMG C 63 will, as we've known for a while, not be powered by a snarling V8. Instead it will get a scrappy little 2.0-litre turbocharged inline four. And before you email me a picture of milk and say 'only this and orange juice should come in two litres', consider this. AMG has confirmed to Autocar UK that its new engine will make 350kW... and that's not all. Despite the new engine making nearly as much as the V8 with half the capacity and half the cylinder count, AMG is adding a plug-in hybrid electrical system to boost total output to 500kW, a full 120kW more than the old model.
