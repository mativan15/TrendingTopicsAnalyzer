Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said he expects the electric carmaker's shares to surpass the combined value of Apple (AAPL) and Saudi Aramco.
The EV manufacturer on Wednesday reported its third-quarter results. Tesla exceeded the earnings forecast, but under-performed on revenue -- a first for the company since the third quarter of last year.
"Now I'm of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap. I see a path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined," Musk said on the earnings call Wednesday.
