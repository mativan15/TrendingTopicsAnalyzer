A face-off debate between Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, in their first and only debate, argued over abortion, inflation, the cost of health care, and several other matters. Both candidates squared off Friday night in Savannah for the first time in the Georgia Senate race. Despite this brutally competitive debate, they agreed on one point; US President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election.

Walker would be a first-time political candidate who drew attention during the debate with frequent interruptions.
