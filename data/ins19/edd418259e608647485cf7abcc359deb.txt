By Aimee Picchi May 31, 2022 / 5:36 PM / MoneyWatch Motorists hoping for some relief at the pump should think again. Gas prices nationally could reach $5 a gallon on average by as early as June 17, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst for GasBuddy, which tracks fuel costs across the nation. That's up from the current national average of $4.62 a gallon, already a record high, according to AAA. Americans are paying record-high prices for gasoline as the summer travel season arrives — an issue that's weighing on more consumers as they make their vacation plans than rising COVID-19 rates, according to a new survey from Morning Consult.
