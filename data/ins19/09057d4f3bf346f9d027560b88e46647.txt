jetcityimage AT&T (NYSE:T) has risen for a second day after an earnings report that came in for praise due to solid financials and strong user numbers. The stock is up 2.2%, following on a 7.7% gain on Thursday. Analysts including Citi lauded a more balanced profitability and progress on improving fiber subscribers. Truist has added its applause, upgrading AT&T (T) to Buy. That follows "15 years of underperformance, now that it has demonstrated an ability to focus on core business as opposed to acquisitions of loosely related companies at high market valuations," analyst Greg Miller says.
