A former Virginia Tech football player has been found not guilty of beating a man to death after claiming the Tinder hook-up had lied about being a woman then performed oral sex on him. After a three-day trial in Montgomery County Circuit Court the jury took just three hours before finding Isimemen Etute, 19, not guilty of second-degree murder in the 2021 death of Jerry Smith, 40, of Blacksburg, Virginia. Etute said he believed he was receiving oral sex from a woman named ‘Angie' but it was actually Smith.
