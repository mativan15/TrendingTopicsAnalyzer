Dear Moral Money,
My best friends of 10 years are getting married next spring and the planning is under way. 
The couple had originally intended for the ceremony to take place several years ago but Covid put the kibosh on their plans. They told me that because of the wait, they are now expecting to pay thousands more.
Both bride and groom have jobs, though are having to cut back due to the cost of living crisis. 
As a result, they have come up with a thoroughly modern method to pay for their wedding: they are crowdfunding the ceremony in return for an invite.
