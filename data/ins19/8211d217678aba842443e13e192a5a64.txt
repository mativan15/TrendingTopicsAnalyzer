metamorworks/iStock via Getty Images A Quick Take On ParaZero Technologies Ltd. ParaZero Technologies Ltd. (PRZO) (PRZOW) has filed to raise $15.7 million in an IPO of its units consisting of one ordinary share and two warrants, according to an F-1 registration statement. The firm designs and sells autonomous parachute systems for unmanned aerial systems. A high-priced IPO for a tiny revenue-producing firm in a moderate-growth industry forecast leads me to remain cautious about PRZO. I'm on Hold for the IPO, although the stock may see some early trading volatility from day traders due to its low nominal price.
