A woman with body image issues could not believe her fiance's reaction to her Halloween costume.

She asked Reddit's 'Am I the A******? (AITA)' forum to weigh in. Her self-image didn't become an issue in her four-year relationship — until she started to get some confidence back. When she decided to wear a Renaissance-style costume that she felt beautiful in, he disapproved.

'I have a problem with self image myself and I never dress to show skin. Baggy T-shirts and sweat pants are my go to,' she wrote.
