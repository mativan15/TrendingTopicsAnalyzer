When former AOL and Nielsen exec Lynda Clarizio and former Conde Nast and Gotham Ventures exec Joy Marcus tried to raise money in Silicon Valley for a new venture fund to help turn female-led companies into billion dollar businesses, they hit a wall."We were told by some very prominent male venture capitalists first that there was not enough deal flow," Clarizio said. "And we had a database of 100 companies that we talked to, so we found that shocking."Because there are very few women on the investing committees at big venture funds, capital isn't being allocated to women-run businesses, she said.
