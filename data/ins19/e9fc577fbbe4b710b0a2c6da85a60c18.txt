A Brisbane real estate agency urged landlords to consider raising rents by more than 20%, as Australia grapples with a worsening rental crisis.An email, sent by Ray White West End, asks landlords if their properties are being 'under-rented' before advising them to increase rents by more than double the rate of inflation.It comes before the Queensland government is set to hold a housing summit this week to deal with rising homelessness and rental stress.The email says the agency is finding that 'many landlords are not being provided with the information to make an informed decision' and are being advised to sign long-term leases with rent increase of only $5 to $20 a week.
