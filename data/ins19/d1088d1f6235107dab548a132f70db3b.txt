The race in California's 49th Congressional District is a rematch between Democratic incumbent Rep. Brian Levin and Republican businessman and former San Juan Capistrano Mayor Brian Maryott.

In the coastal district straddling Orange and San Diego counties, the environment, gas prices, tourism and veterans' needs are prominent issues.

Who are the candidates?

Levin worked as an environmental attorney in the clean-energy field before being elected in 2018 to the House, where his priorities have included supporting zero-emission vehicles and banning new drilling off the Southern California coast and moving the spent nuclear fuel rods stored at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station out of the area.
