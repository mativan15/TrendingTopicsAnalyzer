Eco-warriors behind the attack on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers are plotting to infiltrate BBC flagship politics programme Question Time. Just Stop Oil activists threw tomato soup over the £76million masterpiece in London's National Gallery on Friday. The group, which wants the Government to stop all new oil and gas exploration, could try to launch a protest during the filming of the show, it is understood. An activist called Forest unveiled the plan in an invite-only Just Stop Oil group on encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this week.
