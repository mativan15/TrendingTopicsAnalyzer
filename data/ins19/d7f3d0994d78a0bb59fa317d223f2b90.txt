Demand for festive packs of discretionary products such as gourmet foods, premium liquor, and beauty and cosmetic products has exceeded supply in the past week, executives said. "We are seeing unprecedented demand for corporate gifting orders, which has overtaken supplies," said Amit Dutta, chief executive of premium and gourmet packaged foods retailer Le Marche Retail. "Our inventory and supply teams have been doubling down on stocks in the past week."

To prevent stock-outs, executives said they are stepping up supplies across channels and are pushing new launches to feed demand that's beating expectations.
