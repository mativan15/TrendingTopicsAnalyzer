SKC says mulling selling PET film biz SEOUL, June 3 (Yonhap) -- SKC Co., a film and chemical materials company of South Korea's conglomerate SK Group, has said it is considering selling its polyester (PET) film business in what could be an attempt to bolster its drive for battery materials and other eco-friendly sectors. The proposed selling of the PET film business is one of the various options being discussed with Hahn & Company, a Seoul-based private equity fund, though no decision has been made yet on holding a board meeting, SKC said in a regulatory filing Thursday.
