Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) shares dipped on Friday even as the cyber security firm posted a strong first-quarter and guidance, prompting analysts to note that investors may be worried about the "modest" beat in annual recurring revenue. Citi analyst Fatima Boolani pointed out that investors appear "discontent" with the 1% beat in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, despite a tough comparison last year and a still impressive 61% year-over-year rise.
