In the backdrop of Union Home Minister Amit Shah releasing MBBS textbooks in Hindi here, Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath has asked why a similar initiative with an engineering course was shelved in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled State. On Sunday, Mr. Shah released textbooks in Hindi of three subjects for the first-year students of MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) as part of an ambitious project of the Madhya Pradesh government to impart medical education in the Indian language, a first in the country.
