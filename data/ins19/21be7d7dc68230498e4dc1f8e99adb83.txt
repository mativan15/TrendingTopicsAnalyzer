Donning the red-and-white colors of a school more than 1,600 miles south, 200 McDowell Senior High School students walked out of class Thursday in protest of the nation's gun violence epidemic that led to another mass killing at a grade school in Uvalde, Texas.

Some carried signs that read "I don't want to be next," "we need change," and "parents should not be scared to send their children to school." Others held poster boards that simply listed the names of schools where fatal mass shootings have occurred: Columbine, Parkland, Sandy Hook and others.
