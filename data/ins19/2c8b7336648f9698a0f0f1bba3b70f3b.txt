The battle between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics has become so heated, the authorities on either coast have become involved. The sheriffs of both San Francisco and Middlesex County, Mass. Have decided to put their money where their mouths are and made a bet this weekend on the 2022 NBA Finals. San Francisco Sheriff Paul Miyamoto and Middlesex Sheriff Peter Koutoujian - colleagues and friends through Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) - spoke by phone and decided to make a bet for charity.
