A meme of Kanye West and Elon Musk doing Dragon Ball Z's fusion dance is shown.



It seems like Elon wants to fuse his possible future company Twitter with his buddy Kanye's possible future company Parler.

Twitter's potential future owner Elon Musk apparently thought for a moment that it would be a grand idea to fuse the blue bird app with his pal Kanye West's potential new social media platform Parler. So, in typical Musk form, he tweeted out a Dragon Ball Z meme featuring him and West, who is legally known as Ye.
