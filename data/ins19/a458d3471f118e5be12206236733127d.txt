OTTAWA - Conservative Alberta MP Bob Benzen has announced he's retiring.

The representative for Calgary Heritage says in a statement that he plans to leave at the end of the year.

The member of Parliament says he looks forward to returning to private life and that it has been an honour to represent the riding for the past six years.

Benzen, who is 63, says he's confident party leader Pierre Poilievre can win the next election and that now is the right time to 'hand off the baton' as the Tories prepare.
