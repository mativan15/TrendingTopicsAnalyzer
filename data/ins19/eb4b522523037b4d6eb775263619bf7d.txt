Inflation in the UK was 10.1pc in September - Bloomberg/Bloomberg

UK inflation has returned to double digits as the latest data from the ONS shows that consumer prices rose by 10.1pc in the year through September. This is a slight increase from August when it was 9.9pc and just above forecasts of 10pc. On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.5pc in September, which is the same as in August.

This comes as the Government refuses to rule out scrapping the triple lock, which dictates that pensions rise by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.
