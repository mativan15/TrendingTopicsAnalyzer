grinvalds Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock has fallen more than 50% in the last year. The main reasons are the current bad macroeconomic situation and the very high valuation at which Adobe was trading at an all-time high. But thanks to that significant drop, the company's shares have reached the levels at which they traded more than three years ago in June 2019. Therefore, Adobe currently has a PE ratio of 29, the lowest PE for which ADBE has been trading since 2013. Recently, management announced that it would be buying a company called Figma for $20 billion.
