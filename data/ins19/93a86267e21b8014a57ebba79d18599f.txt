The Portugal striker, 37, left Old Trafford before the end of Wednesday's Premier League win over Tottenham.
Ronaldo looked glum on the sidelines despite United's dominance and left the bench and walked down the tunnel in the 89th minute.
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner briefly returned to the dressing room but had left the ground by the time his team-mates returned to celebrate an impressive victory.
