Stocks struggled for direction in back-and-forth trading Wednesday as a two-day rally spurred by a better-than-feared start to earnings season faltered.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.3% after the index gained more than 4% in the past two days, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 30 points, or 0.1%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was off by 0.4%.

Netflix (NFLX) was in the spotlight following a big earnings beat Tuesday afternoon that included 2.41 million new subscribers – a key metric watched by analysts – more than double Wall Street's estimate of 1 million additions.
