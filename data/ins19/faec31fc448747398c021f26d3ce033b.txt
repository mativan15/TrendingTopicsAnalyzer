On a sunny and wind-whipped Memorial Day, for the hundreds of spectators standing on the western shores of the Eel River beneath Fernbridge, some 250 miles north of San Francisco, a truly unusual spectacle is about to unfold.Giant sculptures will be crossing the river.

It is followed by an oversized representation of a lemon and a colossal ode to a can of tuna.
