Rising Son

Football 365 have touched on this before, but I do want to ask why is Tottenham's Son never linked with the big clubs? He is a proven, excellent striker, who has done the business in a top league for seasons now.

Is it the club? Do people just hate dealing with Levy and so it isn't worth the effort?

Do they think he is only good because of Harry Kane (which would be insane)

OR

Is it some form of racism, where they think he couldn't hack it in Spain or Italy (which he demonstrably could considering the bits he's done in the PL)

Personally there is a snobbery that still pervades most levels of football about Asian players.
