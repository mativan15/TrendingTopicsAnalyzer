koto_feja I have covered Athira Pharma (NASDAQ:ATHA) before on June 22, 2022, the day of its press release which had the stock sell off from above $8 to about $2.65. In that article, I took the contrarian view that the market was missing a potential new Alzheimer's drug. A day later, coverage by Seeking Alpha author Derek Lowe was published, which concluded Athira's drug Fosgonimeton was a fail. So we've got a bull and a bear thesis on the same press release here. The press release reported topline data of a randomized Phase 2 trial.
