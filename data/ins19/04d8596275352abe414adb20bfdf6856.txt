Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has joined the chorus of critics of British Prime Minister Liz Truss and the effect that her proposed policies have already had on the state of the country's economy.The 'frantic' prime minister 'deserves the Nobel Prize in economics for the fastest-ever ruining of national finances,' the Russian official joked on social media on Thursday. The remark came as part of a commentary on what Medvedev sees as the poor qualifications of modern European leaders for governance.
