Updated on October 21, 2022 1:07pm EDT The cost of some of the most popular candies has surged amid high inflation, giving shoppers a less-than-sweet surprise at the cash register ahead of All Hallows' Eve.  "With Halloween around the corner, we've identified a significant change in the candy category as it continues to rise in price on a national average," Datasembly CEO Ben Reich told FOX Business. The consumer price index revealed that the candy category jumped 13.1% in September compared with a year ago.
