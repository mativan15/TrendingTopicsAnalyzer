Hi, I work in US in tech and English is my second language. Recently I got a new manager and at the start of every weekly 1:1 he would ask me 'so what's on top of your mind'

I'm personally confused about what to say here. I do have our agenda point listed before meetings. I usually just say something like 'nothing much' or 'I listed what I want to talk about in agenda' and I feel a little awkward l.

I'm curious how everybody else respond to this question. Thanks!
