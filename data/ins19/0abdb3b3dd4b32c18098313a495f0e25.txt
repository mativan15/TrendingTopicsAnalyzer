If Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) thought Fox News would warmly welcome her suggestion to impeach President Joe Biden if Republicans take the House, she may be in for a rude awakening.

'I think that's a rotten idea,' Fox Business Network anchor Stuart Varney flatly stated on Tuesday morning.

'It's bad for the country,' Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade agreed.

Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, recently told the New York Post that GOP lawmakers could take up impeachment proceedings on the president next year following investigations into the Biden family's business dealings.
