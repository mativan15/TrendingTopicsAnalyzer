The Philadelphia 76ers will take on their first test against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics will tip off their 2022-2023 campaign with a matchup at TD Garden.

To say the Sixers are facing a tough test at the beginning of the year would be an understatement. Following their primetime matchup against the Celtics, the Sixers will head home and take on the Milwaukee Bucks for their first game of the year at the Wells Fargo Center.

Considering the Sixers will face the Eastern Conference's second and third seeds from last season, the first two games are viewed as a test for outsiders looking in.
