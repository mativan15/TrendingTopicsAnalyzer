Donald Trump filed appellate papers on Wednesday that are his latest effort to stymie a 3-year inquiry into his business by New York Attorney General Letitia James.The papers, filed in US District Court in Albany, came in quick response to a decision by a judge of that court, Brenda K. Sannes, who on Friday dismissed Trump's effort out of hand.Trump says in his new filing that he will ask the US Court of Appeals, the next federal court up, to reverse Sannes' decision, which tossed his lawsuit after James defended her probe by asserting she has found "substantial" evidence of financial wrongdoing.
