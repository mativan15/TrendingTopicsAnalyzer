Former President Donald Trump claims clemency requests that were seized by the FBI from his Florida estate are his personal property and should be returned to him.

Trump and the Justice Department asked a court-appointed special master to resolve their dispute over a half dozen documents related to requests for reduced sentences or pardons, with the government claiming they're presidential records.
