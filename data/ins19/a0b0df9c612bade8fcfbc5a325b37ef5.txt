Amid the continued debates over the imposition of Hindi across the country, the Union Government on Thursday announced a month-long programme to 'strengthen' and 'rekindle' the cultural and civilisational bond between Tamil Nadu and Varanasi. Named the ‘Kashi-Tamil Sangamam', the programme would be held from November 16 to December 16 this year.
