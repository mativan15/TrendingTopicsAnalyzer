After the year he has endured, there is an almost youthful zeal to the way Jonny May talks and the way he is approaching his games again for Gloucester. Last weekend, he made his first start for his club since January in the derby victory over Bristol Bears at Kingsholm. There were no tries on this occasion, but his celebration of a piece of defensive excellence in the closing stages — bringing down Piers O'Conor before clamping himself over the ball to win a crucial penalty, roaring his delight and punching the air — was reminiscent of the manner in which he has celebrated many of his 35 tries for England.
