Jalen Hurts takes huge, necessary step with win over Cowboys originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

It did not go well last time Jalen Hurts faced the Cowboys.

At all.

It was Week 3 last year at AT&T Stadium, and Anthony Brown picked off Hurts' third pass of the game and then Trevon Diggs picked off his third pass of the second half and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown.

By the time the game was over, the Eagles had lost 41-21, and the Cowboys were off and running to the NFC East title.
