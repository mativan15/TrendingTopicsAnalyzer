The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 435 points today as Salesforce (CRM 7.00%) continued its impressive two-day run after reporting better-than-expected earnings earlier this week. Aerospace giant Boeing (BA 7.54%) also helped drive the Dow higher, as it closes in on what could be a lucrative new contract.
On the macroeconomic front, new employment data offered a conflicting view of the economy. Unemployment claims remained near historic lows, with jobless claims falling 11,000 for the week ending May 28 and totaling only 200,000.
