The Miami Dolphins have officially lost three games in a row after being defeated by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, 24-16, at Hard Rock Stadium.

The biggest headline in this game will likely be the injuries that Miami suffered. At different points in the contest, Mike McDaniel's team had Skylar Thompson, Keion Crossen, Nik Needham, Emmanuel Ogbah, Trey Flowers and Jaylen Waddle go down with injuries. Ogbah and Waddle returned to action.

However, injuries weren't what cost them the game.

Miami's undisciplined play was the difference.
