DUBAI – A fire at Iran's Evin prison on Oct. 15 that killed eight people has ramped up pressure on clerical rulers who are already struggling to contain nationwide protests ignited by the death of Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in police custody.

The prison, a sprawling complex located at the foot of the mountains overlooking Tehran, holds many political prisoners and detainees facing security charges, including dual nationals whose detentions continue to sour Iran's relations with western powers.

Evin prison has long been criticised by Western rights groups and was blacklisted by the U.
