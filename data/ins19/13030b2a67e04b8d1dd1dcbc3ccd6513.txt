E-commerce fashion-apparel retailer Revolve Group (RVLV -0.75%) caters to women, but it's a business that all investors should get to know. The company went public in June 2019 at $18 per share but finished its first day of trading at $34. Now, more than three years later, the shares are lower than they were on day one of trading despite robust growth from the company.
To be sure, Revolve is going through a challenging time right now. But there is a case to be made for buying the stock today.
