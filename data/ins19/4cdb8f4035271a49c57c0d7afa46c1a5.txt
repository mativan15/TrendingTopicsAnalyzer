The liquefied natural gas (LNG) market could be hit with a potentially historic shortage this winter as the world rushes to secure the super-chilled fuel, Bloomberg reported this week, citing experts.According to the sources, the EU's plan to cut imports of piped Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year and replace it with LNG from the US and Africa is sharply intensifying competition for the power-plant and heating fuel.In a normal year, LNG importers stock up on supplies for the peak winter season over the summer.
