There is much to say about the groundbreaking technology that underpins today's generative AI, but one key innovation is worth mentioning: diffusion models. Inspired by thermodynamic concepts, diffusion models have piqued the public interest, quickly displacing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as the go-to method for AI-based image generation.  These models learn by corrupting their training data with incrementally added noise and then determining how to reverse this noising process in order to recover the original image.
