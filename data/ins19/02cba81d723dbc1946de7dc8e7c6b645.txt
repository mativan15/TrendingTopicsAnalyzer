The DGCA has imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on IndiGo for denying a specially abled child to board at Ranchi airport. The regulator stated that the airline was found deficient in dealing with the situation. After the boy was prohibited from boarding the airline's Ranchi-Hyderabad flight, his parents -- who were with him -- also decided to not enter the plane. After the incident came to light, Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had said that no human being should have to go through this and he himself is investigating the incident.
