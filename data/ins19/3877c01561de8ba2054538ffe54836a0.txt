Protesters hanging above Wellington's Mount Victoria tunnel, who have so-far failed to block the busy road, plan to dangle further down into traffic. A statement from the group Restore Passenger Rail claimed they climbed above the Mount Victoria Tunnel at the Hataitai end and unfurled a banner. Police had blocked the road in both directions, the statement claimed. They later confirmed this was incorrect. Group spokesman James Cockle said there was an expectation from the protesters that police would block the road if they were hanging above it as they now were.
