Charmaine Candler began her journey to restaurateur while she was tending bar at Aces Bar and Grill in Country Club Hills and would regularly bring in home-cooked food for her customers.

Four years ago, she officially opened Charmz Kitchen inside Aces and started serving her Southern cuisine and signature egg rolls dubbed Charmz Rolls. Candler also became known for her Philly steaks, Philly chicken, buffalo chicken and jerk chicken.

'The catering and walk-in traffic was overwhelming,' she said, partly because of the space limitations of Aces' kitchen.
