Ellen DeGeneres has confirmed her return to our screens with a new series, five months after her talk show came to an end.
The 64-year-old is set to premiere a docu-style program as she takes on a series of hobbies, in a bid to keep herself occupied following the final episode of the Ellen DeGeneres Show.
In a new teaser clip, she announced to viewers: ‘Lately I've been taking some time just for myself, away from the cameras.
‘I've been having such a great time. I thought I would share some of what I've been doing with you.
