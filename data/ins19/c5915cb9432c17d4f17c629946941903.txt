BREZOVICA, Kosovo (Reuters) - Kosovo police have seized dozens of holiday villas in an alpine national park where some owners are suspected of paying local officials heavy bribes to secure building permits, officials said on Thursday.

It is the biggest police operation since Prime Minister Albin Kurti came to power last year promising to fight crime and corruption, often cited as the main obstacles to foreign investment in Kosovo.

High trees have been cut back to make way for the two- and three-storey villas in the Sharr national park, with huge windows overlooking the valley as the first snow begins to fall.
