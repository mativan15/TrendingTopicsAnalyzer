Liz Truss was 'wrong' to accept Suella Braverman's resignation, one of the Prime Minister's allies has said.
Sir John Redwood, the former cabinet minister, said the former home secretary had the 'legal expertise' as a previous attorney general and QC and the 'determination' to bring immigration under control.
His comments signal a potential backlash from the right of the Conservative Party over the departure of Ms Braverman, who helped unite the right behind Ms Truss after she dropped out of the Tory leadership race.
