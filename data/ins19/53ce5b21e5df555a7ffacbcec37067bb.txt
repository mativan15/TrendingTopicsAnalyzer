The Supreme Court on October 17, 2022 dismissed Kerala government's petition challenging the Centre's decision to hand over the operations of Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to the Adani group.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India U.U. Lalit reasoned that the bid offered by the Adani Enterprises Limited for every domestic passenger was Rs. 168, that is, 20% above the Rs. 135 offer given by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation.
The court also noted that the private entity had already taken over "operation, management and development" of the airport from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) since October 2021.
