She said she was given professional advice to start taking her state pension in April 2021 and claim backdated sums from June 2020 to pay off her remaining mortgage. In May 2021 Ms Storey received the £8,881 lump sum for the unclaimed pension but in March this year she received the income tax bill for the previous tax year, 2020-21.
She said: 'I was horrified to receive a letter from HMRC in March stating that I owed £1,600. What I find very difficult to accept is that I'm expected to pay income tax on income that I didn't receive, or have any benefit from, in the tax year previous to the one when I actually received the payment.
