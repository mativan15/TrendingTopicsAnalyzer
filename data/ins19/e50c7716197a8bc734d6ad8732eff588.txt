Chipotle has proposed a new restaurant near Universal Orlando Resort.

Why this matters: New restaurants bring more employment opportunities to the region, including hospitality jobs, as well as temporary construction jobs for new buildings or interior buildout, ,and create business opportunities for local suppliers. They also help landlords lease up shopping centers and provide an amenity for existing residents and workers in the area, helping make developing areas more desirable.

The Newport Beach, California-based, fast-casual Mexican chain (NYSE: CMG) has submitted plans for a 2,325-square-foot building with a drive-thru at 9930 Universal Blvd.
