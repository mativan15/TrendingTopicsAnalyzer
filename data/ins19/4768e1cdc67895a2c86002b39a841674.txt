New Delhi: The rebound seen in the crypto market fizzled out on Thursday as crypto tokens were trading sharply lower. The momentum and sentiments remained negative, leaving no room for upside in the prices. Investors turned risk-averse as rising inflation and looming inflationary worries lingered. All major tokens were trading sharply lower. Solana plunged about 13 per cent, whereas Avalanche posted a 10 per cent cut. Shiba Inu and Polkadot dropped 7 per cent each. Bitcoin and others were 6 per cent down.
