In his first period as home secretary in 1915, under HH Asquith's administration, Sir John served 230 days before resigning in January 1916 in protest against the conscription of single men during the First World War.
Sir John later served as home secretary under Stanley Baldwin's Third Government from June 1935 to May 1937.
