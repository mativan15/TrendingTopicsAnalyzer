The FBI's oldest rookie will stay on the case for a while longer. ABC has picked up a full season of its first-year show The Rookie: Feds, starring Niecy Nash-Betts as Simone Clark, the aforementioned new FBI agent. The network has given an old-school, back nine order to the drama, bringing its total for the season to 22 episodes. A spinoff of The Rookie, now in its fifth season, Feds was introduced in an episode of the former show last season before earning a spot on ABC's fall slate. The show has performed modestly on air so far, averaging a little under 2 million viewers the night it airs.
