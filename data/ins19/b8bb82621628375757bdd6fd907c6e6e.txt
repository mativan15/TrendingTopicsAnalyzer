HOLLYWOOD, Fla., June 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After assisting with evacuations from Ukraine, Kingsman, the Miami-based non-profit wing of USPA Nationwide Security, has refocused its efforts on locating and rescuing missing women and children in the United States. "We have seen success with our efforts in Ukraine, but we understand that there are still too many missing women and children right here in our own communities," stated Dan Manning, CEO of USPA Nationwide Security. Manning, who took over for USPA founder Michael Evans, has continued with Evans' charitable giving initiatives, donating over $35,000 of his company's profits over the last few months.
