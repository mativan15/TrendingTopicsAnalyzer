The city gave the two companies tasked with running the Big Apple's heliports — primarily used by high rollers and well-off tourists — at least $1.4 million in breaks on rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic, The Post has learned. 
The broad outlines of the sweet arrangement between the Economic Development Corporation and one of the operators, Saker Aviation, were quietly disclosed in a recent company filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. 
'Why would we spend so much money for rich people to fly to the Hamptons, when we have so many low-income people in New York who need help,' said Judith Goldiner, a top lawyer at Legal Aid, which represents many of the Big Apple's poorest in housing court and in the homeless shelter system.
