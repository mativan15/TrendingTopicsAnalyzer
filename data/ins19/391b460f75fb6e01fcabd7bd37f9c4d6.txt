My husband and I learned that we had accumulated a sufficiently large nest egg and will not outlive our money. We had always intended to recognize our nieces and nephews in our wills with a modest gift ($10,000 or less). However, we hopefully have many years left ahead of us. Most of our nieces and nephews are just starting college or starting families.  It seems like it would be much more useful for them to receive a gift now. It would give us a great deal of joy to see them use this gift for a wonderful vacation, or paying for extras while in school.
