TORONTO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Canada's second largest pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec sees opportunities in global fixed income assets after a recent sell-off, and expects global markets to stabilize in the first half of 2023, a top executive said.

"Fixed income assets are definitely more attractive than they were couple of months ago," Caisse's Executive Vice President Vincent Delisle said in an interview on Wednesday.

Caisse, which oversees about C$391.6 billion ($285 billion) in assets, says it sees opportunities in private credit, where where non-banking institutions provide loans to companies.
