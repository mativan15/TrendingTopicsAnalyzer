House Democrats' campaign arm rolled out its first round of television ad buys Friday as the party braces for a grueling attempt to retain its majority — or minimize losses — in the lower chamber.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's (DCCC) independent expenditure arm, in numbers shared first with The Hill, announced it has reserved $21.4 million for broadcast TV ad buys. The reservation is higher than the $18 million it rolled out in its initial reservation in 2020 and shows a party largely playing defense to shore up vulnerable incumbents.
