The US Supreme Court has blocked a controversial Texas law that critics say would have allowed hateful speech to run rampant online. In a significant victory for social media companies, the court agreed on Tuesday to an emergency request from tech industry groups to temporarily block the law from taking effect.Known as HB20, the law prevents social media platforms with at least 50 million monthly active users — such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter — from removing content based on users' views.
