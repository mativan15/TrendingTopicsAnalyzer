Luxury car maker Rolls-Royce has unveiled its first electric car. The new car in Rolls-Royce's stable is called Spectre, and it's every bit true to the legacy of the company in terms of opulence and grandeur. During the launch, Rolls-Royce termed Spectre the ultra-luxury Electric Super Coupé. The car comes in a three-door configuration. The car maker regarded the erstwhile Phantom Coupé as the 'spiritual predecessor' of the Spectre. The interior of the Spectre, as one expects from a Rolls-Royce, is super luxurious, and on the outside, the EV maintains charm and stately elegance.
