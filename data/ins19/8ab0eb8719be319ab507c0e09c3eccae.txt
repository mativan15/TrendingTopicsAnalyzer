One of the main risk factors for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions is age; the older someone is the more likely they are to develop high blood pressure. However, this doesn't mean children can't develop the condition. The main reason why a child might have hypertension is down to poor diet. Foods high in sugar and fat can increase the risk of children developing the condition.Doctor Emilia Gomez Pardo said: 'We are what we eat, but we eat what we buy.'Doctor Pardo says a poor diet in childhood, and other unhealthy lifestyle habits, can be seen when children enter early adulthood in their early 20s, when cardiovascular issues first start to be detected.
