Robert Chavez, 49, was convicted May 24 of the 2009 double homicide of Max Griego, Jr. and Mary Hudson Gutierrez.

Chavez was sentenced June 2 to two consecutive life sentences for the deaths which prosecutors argued he ordered as a leader of the ‘AZ Boys,' an organization connected to drug trafficking and other crimes.

These sentences are to run consecutive with previous sentences, including a 26-year sentence for drug trafficking and a life plus 21 year sentence for the murder of Richard Valdez.
