Oct. 15—Opportunities are all around as multiple new industries look to settle in the Queen City.

Community Development Director Craig Hitt on Tuesday said several new businesses are working to establish themselves in the Meridian area, including a new athletic facility.

"We have an indoor athletic facility that will be opening probably by the first of November," he said. "The owners are telling us they're in their final stages."

The new facility, Hitt said, would be geared toward baseball and softball players with pitching machines, batting cages and more.
