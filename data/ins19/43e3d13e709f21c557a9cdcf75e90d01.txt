Our discouraging reintroduction to the Los Angeles Lakers, who missed the play-in tournament last season and looked no better in Tuesday's opener, may well mean the highlight of their 2022-23 campaign is LeBron James' pursuit of the career scoring record Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set in 1984 and lifted to 38,387 points.

James currently trails Abdul-Jabbar's NBA record by 1,294 points. The 37-year-old eclipsed that number last season on March 3, so Lakers fans must hope their favorite team gives them better reasons to watch in the meantime.
