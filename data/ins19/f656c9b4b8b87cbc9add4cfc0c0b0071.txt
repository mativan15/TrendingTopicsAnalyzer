Deliveroo's stock market slide continued after JP Morgan issued a bearish broker note. Marcus Diebel, an analyst at the US bank, said that although the food delivery group had a healthy balance sheet and a net cash position of £1.1 billion, its name 'scans unfavourably' given its lack of profitability.'Provided that Deliveroo will only likely turn profitable in 2024, we see limited scope for outperformance in the short term,' Diebel said, as he cut the bank's 'overweight' recommendation on the shares to 'neutral' and halved its price target to 94p.
