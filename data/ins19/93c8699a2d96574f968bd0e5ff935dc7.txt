Pittsburgh hasn't scored more than 20 points all year and has a starting quarterback, Kenny Pickett, who was in concussion protocol this week. The Dolphins start Tua Tagovailoa for the first time since concussion problems and faces the 28th-ranked defense with a beat-up secondary. Enough said? This starts five games the Dolphins will be favored in — and can go a long way in their playoff chase.
