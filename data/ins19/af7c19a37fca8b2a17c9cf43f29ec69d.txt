As investigators dig deeper into the law enforcement response to the school shooting in Texas, US, a host of disturbing questions remain about what police officers knew as the deadly attack was unfolding. Did any of them know children were trapped in a classroom with the gunman? Was that potentially critical information relayed to the incident commander on the scene? And did officers challenge the commander's decision not to promptly storm the classroom? Authorities have not released audio of the 911 calls or radio communications but have confirmed dispatchers received panicked 911 calls from students trapped in the locked classroom with the gunman while officers waited in a hallway outside.
