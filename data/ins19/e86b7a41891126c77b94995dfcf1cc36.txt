JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Some local businesses in parts of Jacksonville's most under-valued communities are getting some much-needed help - thanks to a grant secured by city council president Sam Newby.

Businesses that were awarded the grant are splitting a million-dollar grant. Councilman Newby said he wanted to make sure the money went to the neighborhoods that need it the most.

Newby and LISC Jacksonville partnered Wednesday to present $1 million to small businesses in the city's most under-resourced communities.
