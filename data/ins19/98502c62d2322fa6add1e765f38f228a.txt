The 700 club Darryl Sutter just joined isn't quite as exclusive as the one Albert Pujols now belongs to, but it's not a bad bunch to belong to. Sutter, the Flames' head coach, won his 700th NHL game Thursday when the Flames defeated the Avalanche 5-3 in their season opener at the Saddledome. That elevated Sutter, a two-time Stanley Cup winner, to a group of 11 NHL hockey coaches who have won at least 700 games. The list is topped by Scotty Bowman, the only NHL coach with over 1,000 wins, at 1,244.
