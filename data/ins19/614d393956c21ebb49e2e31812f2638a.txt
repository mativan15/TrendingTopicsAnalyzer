ROME, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Giorgia Meloni, set to become Italy's next prime minister, met President Sergio Mattarella on Friday to discuss the formation of a new government against the backdrop of tumult within her right-wing coalition.

Meloni, head of the nationalist Brothers of Italy party, entered the president's palace alongside her main allies -- Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, and Silvio Berlusconi, founder of the conservative Forza Italia party.
