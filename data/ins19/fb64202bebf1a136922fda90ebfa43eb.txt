While other suburban casinos are moving to new locations, Elgin's Grand Victoria Casino is not only staying put but unveiling a new $4 million renovation that adds a Caesars Sportsbook and a World Series of Poker Room to its downtown operation.

'We're very excited to move forward with this. We hope to continue to refine and enhance customers' experience,' said Rolando Guerrero, Grand Victoria's senior vice president and general manager.

Caesars Entertainment purchased the Grand Victoria in 2020 and is 'focused on the guest experience, and we're trying to attract new business and new players,' Guerrero said.
