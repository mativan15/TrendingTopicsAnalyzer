Cathie Wood, the founder and chief investment officer of asset management firm Ark Invest, never expected to be at the center of the spotlight like she has been in the past two years.

'[Our firm] did have a social strategy, but I was hoping to make the young people—analysts, portfolio managers, advisors—famous, not myself,' she told the Observer at an event in New York City Oct. 17.

Wood, 66, has worked in the investment industry for more than four decades, holding key executive roles at various hedge funds.
