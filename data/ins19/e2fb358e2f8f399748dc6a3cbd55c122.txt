Fears have been raised that Marlborough's roads will not be able to handle the expected increase in heavy traffic moving through the region once the new InterIslander ferries begin sailing across Cook Strait in 2025. The warning came as a National Party Transport caucus group visited Picton and Blenheim on Thursday to take stock of the Waitohi Picton Ferry Precinct Redevelopment Project that is due to begin later this year. National's transport spokesperson Simeon Brown, who also sits on the Transport and Infrastructure Select Committee, said there had been little consideration from Waka Kotahi/NZTA regarding the flow-on effect the extra freight and cars might have on Marlborough's roads outside Picton.
