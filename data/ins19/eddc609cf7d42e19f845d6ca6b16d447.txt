Published: 22:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 22:45 EDT, 17 October 2022 George Kambosos Jr is being urged to rethink future opponents after another ill-fated match-up with US "tornado" Devin Haney sent the former world champion back to the drawing board. Sunday's second unanimous points defeat to Haney further blemished Kambosos's previously impeccable record following a 20-0 start to his professional career. The Sydney lightweight is planning a well-earned six-month break after a gruelling schedule of five prize fights in three years and several lengthy stints away from his wife and young family.
