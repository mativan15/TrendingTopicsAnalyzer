Drybala plans to spend more than three years running from London to Athens, from Cairo to Kuwait City, from Indonesia through South East Asia to Hong Kong, then from Los Angeles to New York. The keynote speaker and meditation coach is paying for his attempt with his savings and sponsorships, and is making the run to raise money for UNICEF's Ukraine Crisis Appeal.
