F3: Fun and Frustration is more of a franchise than a sequel to F2: Fun and Frustration. Anil Ravipudi, who has written and directed the film, embarks on another fun ride with the characters from the first film, some of their character traits intact, in a different story. This is an unapologetic leave-your-brains-at-home-and-go-have-a-laugh film. There are generous references to contemporary Telugu cinema and the fourth wall is broken time and again. Some of the events are inane and the tone is uneven; the film oscillates between being utterly boring and hilarious.
