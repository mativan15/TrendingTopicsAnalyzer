Democrats told themselves the trillions in new spending they were passing under President Joe Biden would prove a huge winner come Election Day 2022. Oops.
The New York Times reports Dems in tough races 'have spent little time . . . touting the centerpiece provisions of their party's $1.9 trillion economic rescue package.' They're not talking much about their later megaspending packages, either.
Why? Well, that 'rescue package' proved to be an inflation bomb (as some top Dem economists warned at the time) whose aftershocks are still punishing average Americans with crushing price hikes on food, gas and rent.
