A Queensland man's quest to become the oldest person to paraglide from the top of Mount Everest has ended in near tragedy.Accompanied by QUT filmmaker Joe Carter, Ken Hutt, 62, set off in April and spent weeks at Base Camp preparing to make the long journey to the pinnacle.However, the glide was not to be — Mr Hutt developed a life-threatening chest infection at camp two, about 6,400 meters up the world's highest mountain.Mr Carter said Mr Hutt had to turn back."Without the ability to breathe properly in an environment where every gram of oxygen inhaled can mean the difference between surviving and death, he had no choice but to descend," Mr Carter said.
