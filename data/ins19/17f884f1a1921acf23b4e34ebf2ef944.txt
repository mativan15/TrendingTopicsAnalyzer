West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday targeted her guns on the BJP-led Central government for allegedly depriving former Indian cricket skipper Sourav Ganguly by not nominating him for the ICC chairman's post, terming it an act of "shameless political vendetta".Ms. Banerjee, who said she would have spoken out on the issue even if master cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar or Mohammad Azharuddin were similarly deprived, alleged that Ganguly was robbed of the chance to fight the election to "secure someone else's interests".
