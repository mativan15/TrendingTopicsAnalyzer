At a video game arcade, a big win might mean logging a high score on the Donkey Kong or Galaga machine with your initials.But Maryanne and Brad Eyers are celebrating a different type of victory: after years of trying, they finally have the right to sell alcoholic drinks at their arcade business in New Westminster, B.C."Our business is slower than it was pre-COVID," Maryanne said. "This will be a bigger draw for people to come in to play games, have a drink and have some fun."She said obtaining the liquor licence for the Capital City Classic Arcade was the final level in their five year-plus battle against what they say are outdated rules governing arcades, including where they can operate.
