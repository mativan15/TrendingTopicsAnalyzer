By Kate Bennett, CNNCNN — First lady Dr. Jill Biden appears on the cover of the June/July cover of Harper's Bazaar magazine, the first time in the magazine's 155-year history a first lady has appeared on the cover, according to a release from the magazine.
In the feature story, which was written earlier this spring, Biden discusses her role as first lady to a country in crisis.
"Even as a Senate spouse, I was working, going to grad school, doing campaign events, raising kids," says Biden in the interview.
