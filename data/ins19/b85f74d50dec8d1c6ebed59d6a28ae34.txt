Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Friday dismantled former President Donald Trump's 14-page response to a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the deadly U.S. Capitol riot.Raskin, a member of the committee, told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that Trump was already 'playing his silly games' with his reply.'I mean, that letter, including the use of the royal ‘we,' which was pretty jarring, is just an outrageous distraction from the reality to the extent that there's anything substance or substantive there,' he continued.
