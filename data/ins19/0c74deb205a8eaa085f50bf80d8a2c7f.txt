A new report from independent news outlet Meduza shows that Russia's top officials are not giving up on declaring victory in Ukraine and rather hoping to ramp operations up in order to obtain a military win as early as the fall."According to Meduza sources, despite the fact that the results of the Russian army are clearly not in line with Moscow's original plans, the Kremlin is again discussing a possible assault on Kyiv—and even hoping for a full-scale victory in the war," the Russian- and English-language news website wrote on Friday.
