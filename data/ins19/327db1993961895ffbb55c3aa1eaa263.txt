The long summer days of regular-season baseball being our only midweek option are over for a while.

October is one of the best sports months, and it's because of days like Wednesday. Whatever your favorite sport, you probably have it on your TV today.

We'll start the betting breakdown with baseball, since there are two playoff games.

First, the Philadelphia Phillies are trying to take a sudden 2-0 lead over the San Diego Padres in the NLCS. The Padres are a small -120 favorite at BetMGM. Then in the ALCS we get the New York Yankees, fresh off their ALDS win on Tuesday, for Game 1 against the Houston Astros.
