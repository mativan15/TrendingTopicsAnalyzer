Cryptocurrency firms, many of which lined the main street in Davos this week, were told they will need to clean up their act before gaining complete acceptance from the World Economic Forum's old guard. "The future of crypto, I'm sorry to say, looks regulated to me," said Nela Richardson, senior vice president and chief economist for human resources software provider ADP. Blockchain and crypto firms blitzed Davos with parties, briefings and panels on the sidelines of the main conference, with the hope of gaining credibility and inking deals with companies ranging from Tyson Foods Inc to Salesforce.
