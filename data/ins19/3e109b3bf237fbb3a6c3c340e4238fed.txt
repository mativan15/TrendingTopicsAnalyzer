The United States condemns the violence in Chad involving clashes between security forces and demonstrators protesting the extension of Chad's original 18-month transition period, which expires today. We are deeply concerned by reports of casualties and urge all parties to deescalate the situation and exercise restraint. We call for those responsible for the violence to be held accountable. We also condemn the attack that occurred outside the main gate of the U.S. Embassy in which assailants in civilian clothes and private vehicles cleared police checkpoints and killed four individuals.
