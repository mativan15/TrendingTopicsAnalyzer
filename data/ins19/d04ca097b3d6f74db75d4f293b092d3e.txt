COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Friday announced plans to spend 'a significant amount of money' on efforts to ensure every school building in the state is properly protected against an attack.The Republican governor said he's asked the state schools superintendent for an assessment of which schools need such infrastructure additions within the next few days. DeWine did not name a figure but said, 'This is not going to be cheap.'He also did not detail the types of security measures he's talking about, which based on measures some schools already have in place, might range from metal detectors to classroom barricade devices.
