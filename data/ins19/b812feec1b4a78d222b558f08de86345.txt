May 27, 2022 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Although many people only think of motorhomes when it comes to RV rentals, a new survey by the RV Rental Association (RVRA) found 81 percent of RV rental dealers also rent RV trailers. Of the rental dealers surveyed, 59 percent said more than one-fifth of their business last year was from customers who already owned an adequate tow vehicle.



'Because pickup trucks and SUVs capable of towing many RV trailers are some of the most popular vehicles in North America, it's no surprise that towable RVs are popular with renters,' said Scott Krenek of Krenek RV in Coloma, MI, chairman of the RV Rental Association (RVRA).
