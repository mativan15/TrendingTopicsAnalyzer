By Associated Press Published: 13:45 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 13:45 EDT, 19 October 2022 CLEVELAND (AP) - Browns Pro Bowl right guard Wyatt Teller is expected to miss Sunday's game in Baltimore with a left calf strain, an injury that could slow the NFL's leading rushing attack as Cleveland tries to snap a three-game losing streak. Teller got hurt in the first quarter of last week's 38-15 loss to New England. During the open locker room period Wednesday, Teller was in a walking boot and said he would sit out this week.
