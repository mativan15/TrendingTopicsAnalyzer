WASHINGTON — The Department of Justice asked a federal judge Monday to sentence former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to six months in prison and a fine of $200,000 for contempt of Congress.

In a 24-page sentencing memorandum filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, prosecutors called Bannon's refusal to comply with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee a "sustained, bad-faith contempt of Congress."

The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol repeatedly sought documents and testimony from Bannon but he "flouted the Committee's authority and ignored the subpoena's demands," prosecutors said.
