2:29 PM ETCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The noise in the far end of the Carolina Panthers' locker room kept getting louder on Thursday.And louder.And louder.Almost deafening loud.Players weren't in a heated discussion about why they were 1-5 and the losers of 12 of the past 13 games to fall to 32nd in ESPN's NFL Power Rankings. They weren't arguing over whether owner David Tepper was right or wrong to fire coach Matt Rhule, a man most of them respected tremendously, the week before.They weren't even discussing the possibility of Carolina trading Christian McCaffrey in a move that would throw them into a complete rebuild mode -- a deal that actually happened around midnight when the star running back was sent to the San Francisco 49ers for a bunch of draft picks.
