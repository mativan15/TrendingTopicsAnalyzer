Emmy and Golden Globe winner Damian Lewis ('A Spy Among Friends,' 'Billions') will star in BAFTA-winning 'Heartstopper' director Euros Lyn's supernatural black comedy film 'The Radleys.' 'The Radleys' is based on Matt Haig's popular novel which follows the Radleys, a seemingly ordinary family who hold a dark secret – they are vampires. They are abstainers, vampires who choose not to drink blood despite their natural cravings, but the truth is revealed one day. The film is based on a script developed by British Comedy Award winner Jo Brand ('Getting on') and is written by Talitha Stevenson ('Late in Summer').
