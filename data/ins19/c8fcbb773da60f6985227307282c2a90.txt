By Associated Press Published: 10:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 | Updated: 10:04 EDT, 18 October 2022 LONDON (AP) - Facebook parent Meta said Tuesday that it will sell off Giphy after running out of options to thwart a ruling by U.K. regulators, who again found that the deal to buy the GIF-sharing platform would limit competition and innovation. Britain´s competition watchdog had ordered Meta last year to reverse the deal - a year after it was announced - but the company appealed to a tribunal, which rejected most of its arguments.
