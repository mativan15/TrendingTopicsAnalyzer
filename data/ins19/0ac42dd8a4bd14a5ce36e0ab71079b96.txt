The Canadian Historical Review offers an analysis of the ideas, people, and events that have molded Canadian society and institutions into their present state. Canada's past is examined from a vast and multicultural perspective to provide a thorough assessment of all influences.

As a source for penetrating, authoritative scholarship, giving the sort of in-depth background necessary for understanding the course of daily events both for Canadians themselves and for those with an interest in the nation s affairs the CHR is without rival.
