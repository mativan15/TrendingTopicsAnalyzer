UVALDE, Texas — Under a beating Texan sun, Guadalupe Salazar marveled at the family and friends all around her cooking chicken and burgers on a flaming grill, pouring cups of homemade lemonade and soaping down pickups as part of a pop-up 'car wash and plate sale' near the heart of town.All she could think of were the 21 families who had each lost a loved one in the mass shooting Tuesday at the local elementary school here in Uvalde, and the 21 white envelopes she planned to stuff with cash from the event's proceeds to help them cover funeral costs or other immediate needs.
