Both companies have seen their share price fall, but that doesn't mean Apple or Amazon wouldn't be interested at the right number.

The pandemic created perfect growth conditions for a variety of companies. Some simply added a lot of customers that would have eventually found their product anyway. That's what happened with the Disney+ streaming service for example. People being stuck at home led to meteoric growth, but Walt Disney probably would have eventually captured those customers.

That's not true for every product or fad created by covid restrictions.
