Matt Eberflus promised that Chicago Bears coaches would evaluate every player — as well as their own performances — during the team's mini-bye weekend.

The Bears have 10 days between games leading up to Monday night's road game against the New England Patriots. The Bears have a late bye in Week 14 this season, so the extra time this week makes for a good opportunity to assess what's working through six games, what's not and what's next.

The Tribune also is making those assessments, starting with the defense.
