COLLEGE PARK — This season is far from Brenda Frese's first rodeo.

The longtime Maryland women's basketball coach has nearly seen it all as she enters her 21st season at the helm. But the 2022-23 season may actually be uncharted territory for Frese and the Terrapins. Now in the age of an unfettered transfer portal and NIL deals in the NCAA, Maryland enters a new campaign with more questions than answers.

The No. 17-ranked Terrapins have only one returning starter (Diamond Miller) and just four players who were on last year's roster.
