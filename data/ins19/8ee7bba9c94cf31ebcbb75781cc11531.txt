Two beaten-down internet stocks could be in for an extended struggle with the digital advertising market in flux, according to Piper Sandler. Analyst Thomas Champion downgraded Snap and Pinterest to neutral from overweight, saying that advertising-dependent stocks are not great rebound candidates for investors. "After a strong two-year stretch, digital ad spend looks to be normalizing. Group multiples have declined and are ~40% off recent highs, but history suggests multiples may not re-rate until after ad spend growth bottoms," Champion wrote.
