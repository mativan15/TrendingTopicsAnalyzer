The Seattle Mariners waited 21 years to host a postseason game, so they sure made up for lost time.But the instant classic did not fare in their favor as the Houston Astros advanced to their sixth straight American League Championship Series with their 1-0, 18-inning win, sweeping the Mariners in the best-of-five series.There were just seven baserunners from the 10th to the 17th innings, but in the 18th, Jeremy Pena had had enough. He finally turned the scoreboard on with a leadoff homer, and that was all that was necessary.
