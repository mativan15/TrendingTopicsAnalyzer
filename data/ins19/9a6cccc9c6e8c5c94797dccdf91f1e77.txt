After working in municipal politics for 40 years, councillor John Filion announced in June he would not run in the 2022 election. This leaves the ward of Willowdale open for a new candidate to be elected on Monday. There are four people hoping to replace Filion. Whoever is elected on Oct. 24 will have to deal with the growing levels of homelessness in the and cost of living the ward, which has been a point of contention among residents. Lily Cheng is running again after losing to Filion in the 2018 election.
