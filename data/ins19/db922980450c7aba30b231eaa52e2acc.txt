abalcazar/E+ via Getty Images Investment summary The market's compressed Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) on the chart in FY22 with the most obvious catalyst being the company's decision to acquire Sound United, maker of high performance audio products, in Q1 FY22. This analysis doesn't go into the particulars of the transaction [this has already been extensively covered] but we do dive into the company's numbers and understand what it means for both the company and investors looking ahead. With the selloff, valuations have compressed substantially and we can now buy MASI at multiples not seen since FY15 at least.
