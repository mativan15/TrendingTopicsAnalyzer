NEW DELHI: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is likely to approve the first batch of applications by domestic companies seeking funds for localised research and development (R&D) activities by January next year, a top official said."We have started receiving applications. So maybe in a month's time, we'll start processing them. So, I would say by January, the first batch of applications would be approved," secretary, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) K Rajaraman told ETTelecom.Funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), the new scheme would encourage localised R&D activities in order to create Indian Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) for telecom products and solutions.
