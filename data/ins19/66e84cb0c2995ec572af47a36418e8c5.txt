While growth and tech stocks faced incredible selling pressure to start 2022, even steady, dividend-paying businesses haven't completely avoided the market's ire. Dividend payer FedEx (FDX 1.30%) and Dividend King Lowe's (LOW 2.30%) have both seen their stock prices fall significantly this year.
The price drops hurt, but these two companies have decades-long megatrends working in their favor, they deliver impressive cash returns to shareholders over time, and their freshly lower stock prices offer the potential for outperforming returns to long-term shareholders.
