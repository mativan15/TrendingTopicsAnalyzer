Air passenger traffic volume is expected to recover to the pre-pandemic level, implying a robust 75 per cent year-on-year growth this fiscal, a report said on Monday. The pick-up in traffic volume is expected to be led by domestic traffic as slots and routes on the international front are still opening up, domestic credit rating agency Crisil said in its report. It also said that the airport operators are expected to see their traffic volume recover to the pre-pandemic (fiscal 2020) level this fiscal, spurring a recovery in revenue, supported by an increase in tariffs.
