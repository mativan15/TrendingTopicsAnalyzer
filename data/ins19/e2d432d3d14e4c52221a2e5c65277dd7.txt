According to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports, Kawhi Leonard may be starting the season by coming off the bench to manage his minutes.

The report is a very interesting one for multiple reasons. One, Kawhi Leonard started games during the preseason and said he was feeling great. Two, the LA Clippers are generally very tight-lipped about their starting lineup situations. The team does not like revealing starting lineups earlier than needed because they want to keep their competitive advantage.
