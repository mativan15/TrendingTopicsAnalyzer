All Whites rising star Matthew Garbett made his competitive debut for Italian club Torino in their 4-0 win over second-tier side Cittadella in the second round of the Coppa Italia on Wednesday (NZT). Garbett replaced Croatian international Nikola Vlasic with nine minutes left in the knockout game, at which point the Serie A side had already scored all four of their goals. The 20-year-old has been included in the match-day squad for every Torino game so far this season, after playing for the club's under-19 team the season prior following his transfer from Falkenbergs in Sweden.
