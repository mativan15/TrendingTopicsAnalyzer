The head of one of Australia's largest unions has warned up to 800,000 manufacturing jobs are at risk unless Labor intervenes to bring down gas prices.Australian Workers' Union national secretary Daniel Walton has written to Anthony Albanese and federal Labor MPs with an 'urgent' five-step plan to curb the cost of gas.The AWU says manufacturers are being forced to pay as much as $800 per gigajoule because gas companies are passing on vastly inflated wholesale prices.The spot price has been driven up by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russian gas exports, failures in electricity markets, and cold weather.
