The alternative lender will use the added firepower to deploy capital to Irish growth companies and private equity deals in the UK.Pat Walsh, co-founder and executive director of DunPort, said the EIF backing was 'a huge endorsement' for the specialist debt provider, which has already advanced €90 million from the Oak fund.
