Richard Madeley was forced to hit back at claims that he's got a ‘personal prejudice' against Liz Truss, as he argued that she's ‘clearly completely lost control'.
Along with co-star Susanna Reid, the Good Morning Britain host interviewed Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope on the ITV show.
Sir Christopher claimed that the Prime Minister has shown she's in control, through such decisions as firing Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.
