The U.K. government has introduced new measures that would regulate crypto ads and ban unauthorized crypto providers from offering services.

Amendments introduced by Financial Services and City Minister Andrew Griffith to his own bill on Friday have been welcomed by an industry that has called for proposals to extend beyond stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to relatively stable assets like the U.S. dollar.

The measures amend existing laws to "clarify that the powers relating to financial promotion and regulated activities can be relied on to regulate crypto assets and activities relating to crypto assets," said an explanatory note put forth by Griffith and published Friday, as an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill.
