SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - A standoff between a powerful gang federation and Haiti's government is testing how much power both sides wield and threatens to further derail a paralyzed country where millions of people are struggling to find fuel and water. A former police officer who leads a gang alliance known as "G9 and Family" has proposed his own plan for Haiti's future -- even seeking seats in the Cabinet -- while demanding that the administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry grant amnesty and void arrest warrants against the group's members, a demand that so far has gone unanswered.
