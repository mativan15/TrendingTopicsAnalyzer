Taking the occasional loss comes part and parcel with investing on the stock market. Anyone who held Sify Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:SIFY) over the last year knows what a loser feels like. The share price has slid 55% in that time. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 14% in the last three years. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 23% in thirty days. But this could be related to poor market conditions -- stocks are down 10% in the same time.
