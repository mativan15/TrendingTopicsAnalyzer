Joy Behar, one of the hosts of ABC talk showThe View, has challenged Dame Judi Dench's claim that the new series of Netflix's royal family drama The Crown should come with a disclaimer regarding its historical accuracy.'This dame disagrees with Dame Judi Dench, because they tell you at the top that it is not a documentary, and if you have a brain, you can figure out that the writers have used history,' Behar said during an episode on Thursday 20 October.'If it's documented history, then we can believe it,' added Behar, 'but we're not going to believe a conversation that's going on in the bedroom of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.
