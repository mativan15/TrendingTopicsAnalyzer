In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term US Foods Holding Corp. (NYSE:USFD) shareholders, since the share price is down 33% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 26%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 30% in a year.
