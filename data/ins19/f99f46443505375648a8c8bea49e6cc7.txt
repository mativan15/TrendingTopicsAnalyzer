Oct. 21—A Braselton man who described himself as a psychic healer bilked a couple of more than $70,000 and made threats about the victims' family to get them to pay up, police said.

Jackson William Ramirez-Reyes, 40, was charged with six counts of theft by deception and two counts of terroristic threats and acts.

Gainesville Police Lt. Kevin Holbrook said Ramirez-Reyes was preying on the Latino community, advertising his services on Hispanic radio stations. Police believe there may be more victims, and anyone with information on cases involving Ramirez-Reyes is asked to contact law enforcement.
