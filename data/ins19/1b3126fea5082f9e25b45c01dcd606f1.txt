Explaining its position on moonlighting, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recently said the practice is against the company's ‘core values and culture.' Now, a top TCS official has said action against moonlighting can ruin an individual's career, and, therefore, employers should show empathy while addressing the issue.'The consequences of taking action will be that the person's career will be ruined. Background check for a future job will fail for him. We have to show some empathy,' said N Ganapathy Subramaniam, the Mumbai-headquartered firm's Chief Operating Officer (COO).
