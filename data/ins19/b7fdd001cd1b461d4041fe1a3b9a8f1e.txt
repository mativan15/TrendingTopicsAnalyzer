STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
 The historian Jon Meacham has known a few presidents. He wrote a biography of George H.W. Bush and sometimes writes speeches for Joe Biden. Meacham says many presidents see Abraham Lincoln as a role model.
JON MEACHAM: Lincoln was a politician, but he was a politician who, ultimately, was driven by conscience. This is my entire argument. If he had solely been a cynical political creature, he would have made radically different decisions at critical points.
INSKEEP: Meacham's book, "And There Was Light," tells of the anti-slavery politician whose election as president in 1860 triggered the Civil War.
