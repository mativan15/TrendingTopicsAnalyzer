The right approach to tackle energy poverty is 'providing cash payments', Minister for Environment Eamon Ryan has insisted in a Dáil row with Sinn Féin's Pearse Doherty over the energy crisis.Mr Doherty said the Taoiseach had promised two weeks ago that nobody would be disconnected this winter including pay-as-you-go customers.During sharp exchanges at leaders' questions, the Sinn Fein finance spokesman said that in the first half of the year, 700 households were disconnected from electricity and 300 from gas.
