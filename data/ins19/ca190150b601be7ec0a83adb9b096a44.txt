Brad Pitt was so ‘embarrassed' by a spot on his bum while stripping off for his role in Thelma & Louise, co-star Geena David has claimed.
The Ocean's Eleven actor starred as JD in the hugely popular 1991 film, marking one of his first roles on the big screen.
However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for the 58-year-old, as he had to strip off for a sex scene with a ‘pimple' on his bum.
In an extract from Geena's new autobiography, Dying of Politeness, she recalled their steamy moment, and revealed that a make-up artist covered it up after every single take.
