Instacart, the food delivery company, is pulling its plans to go public in 2022, in the latest sign of turmoil in the public markets, three people with knowledge of the situation said.

The company had been one of the few tech companies seeking to go public this year, as investors all but shut their doors to putting their cash in initial public offerings of unprofitable entities. Wall Street, spooked by rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and fears of a recession, has preferred putting its cash in safer bets.
