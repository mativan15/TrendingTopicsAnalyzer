Spring cleaning is cool, but you know what else rocks? The fall hunker-down. We're talking about the moment when we smash that order button on (another) faux-chinchilla fur blanket from West Elm, light-up the Feu De Bois candle, and start incorporating über cozy fabrics and furniture into our apartment that lets everyone know how hot, well-read, and bisexual/great at Animal Crossing we are.

According to TikTok, this season's hottest piece of queer-coded furniture is a green velvet sofa. A video asking 'if you identify as bisexual, do you own a green velvet couch?' was posted by @keepitspooky, and stitched by actor Shay Mitchell of Pretty Little Liars fame—green velvet sofa in view—and in turn stitched by Emily Ratajkowski, who sat upon her own (bisexual??) mint green velvet couch.
