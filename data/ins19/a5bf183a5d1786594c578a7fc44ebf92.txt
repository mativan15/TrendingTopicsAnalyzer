State-owned plans to invest ₹26,000 crore in its renewables portfolio by 2030, a senior company executive said on Monday. "We will be investing ₹6,000 crore in the renewable segment in three years, and another ₹20,000 crore by 2030, which is contingent upon certain technical aspects on the hydrogen front that the company is working out," said Manoj Jain, chairman and managing director, Gail.

The company has undertaken liquid hydrogen capacity addition and the progress done on the prototype will influence its overall investments, a call on which will be taken after 18 months.
