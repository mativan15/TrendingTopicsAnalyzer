'The police need to enforce actual laws and fight actual crimes. Freedom of speech must be protected and a proportionate approach must be taken.
'The public need to have confidence in their police forces. This sort of thing undermines it. Senior police officers who allow this to happen can expect to have to explain to me why they're spending vital resources on politically correct campaigns.'
Her comments follow a letter to the police chiefs in all 43 forces in England and Wales telling them they needed to stop wasting time on 'symbolic gestures' such as taking the knee and initiatives on diversity and inclusion and instead focus on 'common sense policing'.
