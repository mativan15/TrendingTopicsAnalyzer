Chalmers said the revelations were 'very troubling' and the government would get to the bottom of the issue.'If these numbers are true, it's absolutely atrocious. Every dollar rorted – whether it's Medicare or the NDIS [the National Disability Insurance Scheme] – is a dollar thieved from people who need and deserve good health care,' he said at a press conference in Canberra on Monday morning.'My view is if you're stealing from Medicare or the NDIS, you're a grub.'The Australian Medical Association said the vast majority of doctors did the right thing and the organisation had worked with the government to ensure Medicare requirements were clearer for doctors.
