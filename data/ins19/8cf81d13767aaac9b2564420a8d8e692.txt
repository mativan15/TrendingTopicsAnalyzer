 With Halloween only two weeks away, a home in Okanagan Falls has set up its annual creepy display featuring close to 100 items.
Oct. 31 has been a special day for Yvonne Lyver since she was a kid and it's inspired her to create her own spooky collection with this year's theme being skeletons and zombies. One of Lyver's favourite parts of her display is the reaction from her neighbours.
