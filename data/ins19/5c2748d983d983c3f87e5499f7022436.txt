A sharp rise in the number of Airbnb listings in coastal areas of England and Wales has prompted fears that some seaside areas will become 'theme parks for the wealthy'.The number of 'entire places' for rent in coastal spots in England and Wales increased by 56% between 2019 and 2022, compared with 15% in non-coastal areas, according to analysis.The rise means coastal areas now have three times the rate of Airbnb listings per dwelling than in non-coastal areas, up from twice the rate pre-pandemic.
