You won't see it in any campaign ads, but Republicans plan to cause some financial friction if they win one or both houses of Congress in the November 8 midterm elections.The GOP campaign plan is to ding President Biden and his fellow Democrats for high inflation, while exploiting voter concerns over crime and illegal immigration. It might work. Data site fivethirtyeight gives Republicans good odds of winning the House and lesser odds of winning the Senate.
