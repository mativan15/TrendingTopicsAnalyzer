About four years ago, I received a surprising email—not surprising because of what it said, but because of the way it looked. The text was set in Courier, that font you see in movies when hackers write code on a black screen. The email became sort of a running joke at the office, and I couldn't take this person seriously when they emailed again.That's judgmental, I know, but it turns out I'm not alone. A new study suggests that fonts can indeed change the way we feel about a certain message. The study was run by Monotype, the world's biggest type foundry, which partnered with applied neuroscience company Neurons.
