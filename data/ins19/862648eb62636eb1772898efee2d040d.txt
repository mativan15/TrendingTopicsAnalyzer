The Philippine government is considering buying Russian oil, despite likely opposition from Western countries. The Philippines relies heavily on imported fuel, but prices have surged due to the conflict in Ukraine and the depreciation of the peso. President Ferdinand Marcos Junior said on October 5 that his country is open to purchasing Russian oil to alleviate the economic pressure. The Russian embassy in Manila welcomed the remark. Philippine officials plan to negotiate with Russia on the sidelines of November's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Thailand.
