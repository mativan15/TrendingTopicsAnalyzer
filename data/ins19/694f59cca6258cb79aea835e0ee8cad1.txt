Rongtong Fund Management, which was once part of Xiao Jianhua's Tomorrow Group, has unveiled a management reshuffle, marking its official exit from the missing Chinese magnate's embattled financial empire.

Zhang Wei was named Rongtong's chairman on Friday, taking over from Gao Feng who resigned citing personal reasons after seven years in the position, according to a statement issued by the asset management firm.

Zhang is also the chairman of New Times Securities, which owns Rongtung, and was previously in charge of financial management at central government-owned China Chengtong Holdings Group.
