Harry's House is on the market — literally!
 
Harry Styles' former Los Angeles mansion has just hit the market for $7.955 million.
 
The Grammy winner, 28, purchased the contemporary home in 2016, according to the New York Post. He listed it for sale in 2017 for $8.5 million, but had to cut the price several times before finally finding a buyer, Architectural Digest reports. Property records show Styles sold the home in July 2019 for just $6 million.
 
Located just above the Sunset Strip in Hollywood Hills West, the gated, 4,000-square-foot property boasts four bedrooms and six bathrooms.
