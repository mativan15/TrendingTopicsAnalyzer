Bernard Arnault, the world's second-richest man, has sacrificed the comfort of his ultra-luxury jet and switched to rented aircraft to escape the tracking of his flights on social media.The multibillionaire founder of the LVMH luxury goods empire said he had sold his company's Bombardier Global 7500, the biggest and longest-range business aircraft built, because his movements were being broadcast on Twitter accounts aimed at shaming him over its carbon emissions.'With all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,' Arnault, 73, told Radio Classique, a station owned by his group.
