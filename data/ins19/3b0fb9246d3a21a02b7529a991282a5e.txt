Snapchat parent Snap kicked off earnings season for social media and tech companies today on a sour note with solid user numbers but lower than expected revenue and a dim outlook for the fourth-quarter where sales are expected to be flat. That forecast spooked the Street with Snap down over 25% in late trading.

	Snap is seen as a bellwether for digital advertising ahead of numbers coming next week from Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Twitter and others. Those stocks also lost some ground after-hours but nothing comparable.
