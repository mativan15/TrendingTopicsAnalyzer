I've googled incessantly but my (undiagnosed) ADHD brain now has 20+ tabs open related to this topic and its subsequent rabbit hole. Can anyone recommend some things for me? I'm concerned about wasting my money on brands that aren't well-made or reputable, but it just feels really difficult to sort out.Right now I am in possession of the following, and take them when I remember (obviously not the most effective method, I know):-Magnesium + Ashwaganda by New Chapter-Fermented Vitamin B complex by New Chapter-Fermented Vitamin D by New Chapter-Fermented Zinc complex by New Chapter-Micellized Vitamin A drops by Klaire Labs-xomegas by LOVE Wellness-good girl probiotics by LOVE Wellness-DHEA + Pregnenolone by Truevantage-Alpha Lipoic Acid by Sundown-Marine Collagen with Hyaluronic acid by Neocell-Lion's Mane by Om-Reishi by Om-Turkey Tail by OmI also have a multivitamin by LOVE wellness that I take on the days I find myself rushing out the door without remembering to take anything else.
