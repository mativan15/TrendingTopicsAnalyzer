Antioch Veterans Memorial Park once seemed almost a pipe dream, but with the recent backing of the City Council, three city parcels to develop and a tentative design, work on raising money for the park is now underway.
Veterans and other volunteers presented their ideas to the City Council last week and the resounding response was a positive one, with city staff directed to consider the plans, return back with their findings and a formal agreement.
Delta Veterans Group founder J.R. Wilson told the council he and other volunteers want to bring the community together to work on the park project, which is planned for three city-owned parcels along L Street between Fourth and Seventh streets in north Antioch.
