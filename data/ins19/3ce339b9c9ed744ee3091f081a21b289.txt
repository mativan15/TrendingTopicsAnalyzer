St. Louis entrepreneur Sofi Seck jokes that she probably had too much confidence that she'd walk away from the ABC TV show 'Shark Tank' with an investment deal in place.

'Only because I watch the show and I'm a fan of the show and (the investors) really respect numbers and my business has really solid numbers,' Seck said. "I just assumed I would go in there and I would dazzle them and tell them about the numbers and they would just be in.'
