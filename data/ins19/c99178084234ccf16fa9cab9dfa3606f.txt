New York Democratic candidate for Congress Matt Castelli claimed he moved into his election district from D.C. for employment, but it appears the job was running for Congress.Matt Castelli, the Democrat who will face off against Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., this November, has been the target of a number of accusations about his past since he embarked on his bid for Congress, but the latest question of his candidacy has to do with his work, or lack thereof.Castelli, a former CIA officer, reportedly made the move to New York's 21st Congressional District — a sprawling rural and suburban region hours outside New York City — from Washington, DC, in August 2021, a month before he announced his campaign for Congress.
