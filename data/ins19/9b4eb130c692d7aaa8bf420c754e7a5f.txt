After having a difficult experience with acting, Taylor Sheridan decided he needed a change. He began writing screenplays in 2013 and his hard work soon paid off as Yellowstone became Paramount Network's first scripted series and flagship show, spawning spinoffs and now awards recognition.
The Season 4 premiere of Yellowstone, titled 'Half the Money,' is the latest installment of It Starts On the Page, Deadline's annual series that highlights the scripts that serve as the creative backbones of the buzzy shows that will define the now-underway TV awards season.
