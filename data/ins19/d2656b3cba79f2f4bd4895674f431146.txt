The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday filed a chargesheet against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and others in a corruption case.
Deshmukh and his two staffers, Kundan Shinde and Sanjeev Palande, were arrested in April by the CBI. Dismissed police officer Sachin Waze was also arrested in the case. Waze sought a pardon in the case and was granted the relief by the court on Wednesday. He is no longer named an accused in the case and will testify as a prosecution witness for the CBI against the other accused.
