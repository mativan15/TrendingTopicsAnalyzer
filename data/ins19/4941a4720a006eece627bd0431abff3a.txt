Union Home Minister Amit Shah, while addressing the security personnel at the National Police Memorial, said "those who threw stones at the security personnel in Jammu & Kashmir have now become panches and sarpanches". "Youth earlier involved in throwing stones are now involved in various developmental projects introduced by the government". He highlighted that most of the 'hotspots' of the country are almost free from anti-national activities now and the situation in major security theatres has improved over the last eight years of the Narendra Modi government.
