MF3d NOTE: For investors new to this stock and the condition of heart failure ('HF'), I encourage you to listen to the Key Opinion Leader ('KOL') webcast from September 29, 2020. While the physicians that joined President and CEO John Tucker in the webcast— Dr. Nihar Desai (Yale School of Medicine) and Dr. Dan Bensimhon (Cone Health)— are paid consultants of SCPH, it does not invalidate the points they make, nor the validity of the investment opportunity. The slides from the December 3, 2020 Evercore ISI Virtual HealthCONx Conference presentation (download here) are also helpful in understanding the investment thesis (unfortunately, the webcast for this event is not currently active).
