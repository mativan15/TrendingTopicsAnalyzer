Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down as the chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company Meta after 14 years, a major shake-up in which chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will lose one of his closest lieutenants. Sandberg, one of the company's most high-profile executives, will leave the business 'in the fall' after a transition period, while remaining on Meta's board, she said. In a post on her Facebook page on Wednesday, Sandberg did not outline her reasons for quitting the company, which she helped grow from a start-up with no revenue into a digital advertising behemoth.
