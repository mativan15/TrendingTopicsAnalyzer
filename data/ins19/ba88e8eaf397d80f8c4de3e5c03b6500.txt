Xi Jinping has visited Australia five times in his lifetime, far more frequently than any of his predecessors.And he is the only leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ever to have visited all the states and territories.During his last trip, then-prime minister Tony Abbott gave Xi a special gift — a photograph of his father, Xi Zhongxun, with former NSW premier Neville Wran in 1979.Xi's father once said he had "seen and learned many things" during his trip.But 43 years later, Beijing's attitudes to Canberra are a far cry from what they were.
