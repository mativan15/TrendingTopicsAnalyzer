Jun. 5—CORRALES — Rudy Perea and his family have cultivated fruit trees along the Rio Grande for generations.

His peaches, apples and cherries are a staple at local farmers markets.

But now the irrigation ditch that serves the Perea property is bone-dry, and it's only June.

"I drilled a well, but it's not enough," he said. "I'm trying to save these trees. It's going to wipe us out."

Corrales farmers face a summer with little to no irrigation water, thanks to a broken siphon, a temporary pump system and extreme, prolonged drought.
