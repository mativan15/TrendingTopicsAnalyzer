Safety Damontae Kazee has started the clock on his return from injured reserve.

The Steelers announced that Kazee practiced with the team on Thursday. That opens a three-week window for him to be moved to the active roster and Kazee will not be able to return this season if it closes without his activation.

Kazee injured his wrist during a preseason game and went on injured reserve ahead of Week One.
