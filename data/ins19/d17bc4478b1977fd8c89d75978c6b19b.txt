 Nvidia's RTX 4090 graphics card could be on sale as soon as August, if the latest speculation on the next-gen Lovelace GPUs is correct, with the RTX 4080 and 4070 following on across the next two months.VideoCardz (opens in new tab) brings word from two separate sources on specific months for the release timeframes of Lovelace products, after we heard about the likely staggered launch order in another rumor earlier today.This new info matches that earlier theorizing in terms of the order, but insists that the RTX 4090 will hit shelves in August as mentioned, and that the RTX 4080 will arrive in September, with the RTX 4070 appearing in October.
