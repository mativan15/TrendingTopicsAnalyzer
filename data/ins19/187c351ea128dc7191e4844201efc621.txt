Dear Pay Dirt, I've had a chronic illness for years that has caused me to jump around from temporary job to temporary job. I can only work about 20 hours a week. But because of this, I've gained a very unique set of skills that it seems might enable me to be a consultant. Last month, I started networking and found a few small jobs. After talking with a friend who does similar work, I had hoped to be able to fully support myself in the next two-three years with just part-time projects.
