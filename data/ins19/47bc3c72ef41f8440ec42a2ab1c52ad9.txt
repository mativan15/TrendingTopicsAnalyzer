N.O.R.E., co-host of "Drink Champs," is expressing regret over allowing Kanye West to make controversial comments during the podcast. The rapper called "The Breakfast Club" radio show Tuesday to address what happened with West on the Revolt.TV show. "I just want to be honest, I support freedom of speech," N.O.R.E said. "I support anybody not being censored. But I do not support anybody being hurt. I did not realize that the George Floyd statements [made by West] on my show were so hurtful." During his appearance, West made antisemitic comments and suggested George Floyd was killed by a fentanyl overdose, despite a medical examiner's testimony that fentanyl was not the direct cause of Floyd's death, only a contributing factor when he died after being knelt on by a police officer.
