Protestors from the climate group Just Stop Oil have sprayed soup over the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and blocked traffic on Victoria Road in Westminster. As part of their latest stunt, the activists glued themselves to the business department and issued an invitation to the Home Secretary for talks. The incident occurred just after 11:30 am when 12 activists walked onto Victoria Road outside of the BEIS building, according to a statement from the climate group.
