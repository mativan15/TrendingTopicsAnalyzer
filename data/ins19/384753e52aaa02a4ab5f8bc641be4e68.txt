LONDON: BP will buy US-based renewable natural gas (RNG) producer Archaea Energy Inc for about $4.1 billion, the companies said on Monday, as the British energy major seeks to expand its alternative fuels business.The deal will be the largest ever RNG acquisition, topping Chevron Corp's $3.15 billion buyout of biodiesel maker Renewable Energy Group Inc earlier this year.It will also be the largest acquisition BP has made since Chief Executive Bernard Looney took office in early 2020 with a pledge to slash BP's greenhouse gas emissions and oil and gas production while growing its renewables business.
