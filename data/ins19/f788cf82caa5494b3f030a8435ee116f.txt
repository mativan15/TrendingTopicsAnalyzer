Regulator reviews travel platform Yanolja's takeover deal SEOUL, June 2 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's antitrust regulator said Thursday it has started to review the proposed deal by Yanolja Co., a leading travel platform operator, to buy e-commerce firm Interpark Corp. In October last year, Yanolja announced a deal to buy a 70 percent stake in Interpark's e-commerce business, including travel services, performing arts and online shopping, for 294 billion won (US$235.8 million). The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said it plans to see if the combination between the two firms could hurt competition in the online travel platform market.
