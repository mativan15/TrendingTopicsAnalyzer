Nicholas Smith Investment Thesis Although Deere (NYSE:DE) prices have dropped significantly from their highs, the stock still has downside risk. Deere is a strong player in the agricultural and construction equipment market, but the macroeconomic agenda looks like a strong headwind for the company. The markets are very sensitive to the state of the economy, so even the company's leadership and high pricing power have limited potential. We recommend refraining from investing in Deere at current prices and waiting for a more attractive entry point.
