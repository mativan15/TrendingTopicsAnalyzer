Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin on Saturday launched four presumably wealthy adventurers and two sponsored contest winners, including a Mexican-born YouTube personality, on a supersonic dash to the edge of space, chalking up the company's fifth sub-orbital tourist flight in less than a year.

Perched atop a powerful hydrogen-fueled single-stage booster, the New Shepard blasted off from Bezos' sprawling west Texas ranch and launch site at 9:25 a.m. EDT, kicking off a 10-minute up-and-down thrill ride, briefly carrying the passengers out of the discernible atmosphere.
