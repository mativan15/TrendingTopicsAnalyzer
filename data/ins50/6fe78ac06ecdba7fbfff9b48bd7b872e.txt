Shares of Big Lots Inc. sank Friday, after the discount home essentials retailer reported a surprise fiscal first-quarter loss and a big same-store sales miss, as higher gas prices hurt customer spending. The company BIG, -8.84% warned that it will 'again lose money' in the current quarter as the challenges that led to the disappointing results were expected to continue, but it is taking 'aggressive action' to improve results for the second half of the fiscal year. After a 'solid start' in February and March, Chief Executive Bruce Thorn said sales trends 'materially slowed' in April, which resulted in a need to increase markdowns.
