When Lawrence Academy lost four-star quarterback Ryan Puglisi (a recent Georgia commit) to Avon Old Farms last December, Landolfi and his son were on the Groton campus 48 hours later.Lawrence coach Jason Swepson — who played alongside Chris Landolfi in the Shriners' Classic All-Star game when they were seniors at Hanover and Seekonk — offered Mike a spot on his roster, and two more Hanover players followed. Now Mike is thriving in the Independent School League (ISL) with his best friends, Sam Healey and Matt Pierotti, starting at left and right guard.
