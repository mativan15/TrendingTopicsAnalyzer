Imprisoned journalists were freed and previously banned media were allowed to operate under reforms championed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed when he took office in 2018.Among them were diaspora-based satellite TV stations ESAT and Oromo Media Network (OMN).But by late 2020, amid inter-ethnic conflicts and fighting in the northern Tigray region, newly-recovered media freedoms were "hanging by a thread", Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said. RSF said there had been no significant improvements to harsh media laws, which had been supplemented by a "vaguely-worded" law on hate speech and disinformation.
