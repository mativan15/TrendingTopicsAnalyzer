OPINION: Septimius Security was inspired by the Roman emperor Lucius Septimius Severus who was born in Leptis Magna of the Roman province of Africa, a city in what is now Libya. An Irish-registered Africa-focused security company that provides a wide range of assistance in Africa, from private jets to armored vehicles as well as fully qualified and trained staff, Septimius Security has enjoyed tremendous growth since its establishment in 2020. 'In just 2 years, we have grown from having 3 employees to 133 staff on our books' said Abdullah Duibi, the Irish-Libyan CEO.
