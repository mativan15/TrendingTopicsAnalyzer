Tabb High has reached the state tournament often in the 25 years since Scott Kuhnle guided the Tigers to a championship in his first year as coach. This year's team might be poised to make a state tournament run matching his ‘97 champs and 2005 finalists.

The Tigers flexed their muscles with a 5-1 win over Lafayette in the Class 3 Region A championship game on Friday at Bailey Field. After dominating the first half, the Tigers (17-1) responded to a second-half goal by the Rams (12-5) with a three-goal blitz that ensured a repeat region title.
