Even as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh claimed that 'progressive reforms in the defence industry in the past eight years' have created a 'conducive environment for growth… and ease of doing business' at the Defence Expo 2022 in Gandhinagar on Thursday, an American government representative said that 'both India and America are probably gold medallists in bureaucratic delays'.
The US government representative also cited India and US' capitalist markets as an advantage to the two countries' partnership.
