I hate that everyone in Mumbai seems to have a picture with Mr Amitabh Bachchan which they flex on social media, and I don't.As a fresh publicist in Bollywood, I had recently suffered mental trauma due to a bizarre meltdown by a fashionista star kid because I had asked her if she would do a (normal) TV interview. 'You want me to THINK? Why should I think? Its YOUR job to think. YOU think ..and you TELL me, I cannot be thinking'So imagine my mental stress when the next assignment was from a film Producer client who, initially wanted me to handle Mr Bachchan's event in Delhi, but later asked me to 'create a controversy'.
