Portia Woodman (Ngāpuhi) has played her way to the pinnacle of world rugby. The Black Ferns star tells Andrew Voerman why heading home to Northland during the Rugby World Cup means everything. Rugby has taken Portia Woodman around the world and now it's taking her back home. Northland normally misses out when New Zealand hosts World Cups. It's the big cities that usually get the big teams and the big games when the rest of the planet looks this way. But for the next two weeks, the Black Ferns' Rugby World Cup campaign takes them to Whangārei, just an hour's drive from Kaikohe, where star winger Woodman spent the first six years of her life.
