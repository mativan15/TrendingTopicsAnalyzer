GoFundMe shut down a fake fundraiser claiming to help Amber Heard pay the damages she owes Johnny Depp following the former couple's defamation trial.
After their six-week trial, a Virginia jury decided that Heard would have to pay Depp $10.35 million in damages after finding that the "Aquaman" actress defamed him in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed about surviving domestic abuse. Heard was also awarded $2 million in damages as she partially won her countersuit over comments made by Depp's former lawyer, who called her abuse allegations a hoax.
