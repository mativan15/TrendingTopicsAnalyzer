Nothing is hiking the price of its debut Ear 1 earbuds from $99 to $149, the company's CEO Carl Pei has announced. Citing 'an increase in costs,' Pei said that the new price will come into effect on October 26th. No price changes were announced for Nothing's more recently-announced Phone 1 smartphone.In a followup tweet, Pei justified the price increase by noting the amount of development effort that's gone into the earbuds since their original release last year. 'When we started developing it, we only had 3 engineers,' the CEO said.
