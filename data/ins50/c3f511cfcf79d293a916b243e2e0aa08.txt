October 18 marks the 100th anniversary of the BBC, with centenary celebrations occurring across all its radio, TV, and online channels.
The world's oldest national broadcaster, the BBC was officially founded on this date 100 years ago when it began airing radio messages to the public.
It was originally named ‘BBC Ltd.' after a single licence was issued by England's General Post Office to hundreds of independent broadcasters. 
The licence was issued to a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, who would join a single consortium: the BBC.
