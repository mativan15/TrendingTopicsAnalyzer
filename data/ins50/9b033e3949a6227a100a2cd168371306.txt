David Quinn walked into Madison Square Garden on Thursday night for the first time since the Rangers dismissed him from his first NHL head-coaching gig nearly a year and a half ago.
It wasn't appreciation or cheers that greeted him by fans of the team he helped mold, it was surprising boos.
As the new bench boss of the Sharks, Quinn now finds himself in a similar position as he was in May 2018, when the Rangers first hired the former Boston University coach just a few months after sending out 'The Letter' that announced their rebuilding plans.
