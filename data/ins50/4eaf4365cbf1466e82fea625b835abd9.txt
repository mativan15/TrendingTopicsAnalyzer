Russia said on May 30 it may use an arrangement similar to that used for payments for its gas supplies to pay its dollar-denominated foreign debts.The Vedomosti business daily quoted Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as saying that Russia will offer the holders of its Eurobond obligations to accept a payment system bypassing Western financial infrastructure.Russia previously has offered the customers receiving its natural gas to establish an account in dollars or euros at Russia's third-largest bank, Gazprombank, then a second account in rubles.
