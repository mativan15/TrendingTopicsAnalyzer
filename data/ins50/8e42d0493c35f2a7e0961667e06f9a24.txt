RETRO smartphones left and forgotten at the back of your cupboard could be worth thousands on resale sites.
According to experts, an original iPhone is today worth £542.55 on eBay, while the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X nets you £1,776.01.

Even the extremely popular Nokia 3310 - which sold 126 million units worldwide - can fetch between £10 and £55.
It follows the sale this week of an unopened first-generation iPhone for $39,000 (£34,700) – more than 50 times its original price.
It's highly unlikely your old gadgets will fetch that much, but research from Protect Your Bubble suggests you could still make a profit.
