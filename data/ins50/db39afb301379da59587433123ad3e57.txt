Cam Akers has been one of the worst fantasy picks this season. Through six games, Akers has scored a total of 22.9 points in PPR (point per reception) formats. He's scored fewer points than Craig Reynolds, Kyle Juszczyk, Tyler Allgeier and Kenyan Drake, ranking 62nd among all running backs.
Darrell Henderson Jr. hasn't been much better, but it's not as if he's lit the world on fire, either. He has just 51.8 points in six weeks, making him RB34 in fantasy this season. Henderson's stock is on the rise with Akers likely to be traded by the Rams, but it's hard to feel confident about him as a starter in fantasy.
