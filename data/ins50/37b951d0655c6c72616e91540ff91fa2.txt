'We are facing multiple crises today and the need for shared, multi-level governance to find adequate responses to these challenges is more critical than ever', stressed the President of the Congress, Leendert Verbeek, at the opening of the 4th Parliamentary Forum of Regions in Rabat, Morocco, on 19 October 2022. 'The Congress has been promoting governance where each level is strong with its own competences, resources and decision-making autonomy, and where all levels work together to address common challenges, on both sides of the Mediterranean,' Mr Verbeek underlined, adding that the Congress was providing its support to strengthening local and regional self-government and promoting citizen participation at local and regional level in the Kingdom of Morocco, which was the first country to be granted the status of Partner for Local Democracy with the Congress in 2019.
