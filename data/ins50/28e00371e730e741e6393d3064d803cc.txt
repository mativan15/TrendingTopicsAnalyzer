Days after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) submitted a closure report in connection with the death of Paresh Mesta,18, reiterating it as an 'accident', his father Kamalakar Mesta on Thursday approached Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai demanding a reinvestigation. Mesta's body was recovered from a pond 'under mysterious circumstances' in Honnavar in Karnataka's Uttara Kannada district on December 6, 2017, soon after which communal riots broke out in the area. During the meeting, Mesta's father told the chief minister that his son's death was 'unnatural'.
