By Xavier Fontdegloria U.S. industrial production increased in September driven by a pickup in manufacturing output, particularly in the key auto sector, as supply-chain bottlenecks continued to ease. Industrial production--which includes factory, mining and utility output--rose 0.4% in September compared with the previous month, rebounding from a 0.1% contraction in August, according to data from the Federal Reserve released Tuesday. The increase tops the 0.1% gain expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.
