New 2022 TV models are now available, but plenty of 2021 TVs are still out there.
2022 TVs might be newer, but they're also more expensive and have similar features to the 2021 models. You'll save money right now by grabbing a 2021 unit. Or wait until the fall when 2022 TVs will be on sale.

If you're looking to save money on a new TV, opting for last year's model or waiting until prices come down on 2022 models is the best way to get all the features you want without breaking the bank. That's because TVs are a mature technology, which means that groundbreaking features aren't added every year.
