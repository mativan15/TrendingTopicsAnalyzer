Published: 01:10 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 01:10 EDT, 31 May 2022 Australian banks face a potent threat from global "super apps", a leading fintech investor has warned. From gaming and virtual accessories to getting a home loan or credit card, onboarding into a new job, getting paid, investing, or paying with Bitcoin, there's potentially an app to cover everything. Co-founder of Reinventure Group Simon Cant said on Tuesday the biggest threat to Australian banks will be the arrival of "super apps", not a splintering of the customer base to small neobanks that operate solely online.
