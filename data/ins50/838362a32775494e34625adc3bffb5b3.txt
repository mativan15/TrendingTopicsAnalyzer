Many of us have seen how scammers try to impersonate the government or a business to convince unsuspecting people to hand over their money.

Now the Better Business Bureau (BBB) is warning about a growing trend of con-artists pretending to be from your bank while using multiple layers of contact to try and make it seem legitimate.

The BBB said the scammer will send a text message that looks like a fraud alert from your bank.

If you reply that you don't approve the supposed transaction, the scammer now knows they have an active phone number for you.
