It's exhausting enough watching football these days, so relentless is the schedule, so spare a thought for the soft tissues of those who actually play it. There's a full Premier League midweek programme, starting with two games tonight: Brighton v Nottingham Forest (7.30pm kick off), which we'll be covering in full, and Crystal Palace v Wolves (8.15pm). We'll be furnishing you with goal updates from that game, although this works on the slightly dangerous assumption that a goal will be scored.
