Celebrity attorney and Donald Trump antagonist Michael Avenatti had a swift rise, but his fall is going to last a lot longer.
On Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Jesse Furman sentenced Avenatti to four years in prison for stealing from his former client Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who received a six-figure hush-money payment from Trump during the 2016 campaign to hide their alleged affair. Earlier this year, Avenatti was convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft for stealing $300,000 of a book advance from Daniels, faking her signature to send nearly half of the payments for her 2018 memoir to his bank account.
