By Chris Wack Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. shares fell 10% to $2.83 on Thursday after the company said it regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq. Tonix closed Wednesday's session up 29% after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent for TNX-801 smallpox and monkeypox vaccine and recombinant pox virus platform technology. Tonix said it received a letter from Nasdaq saying that because its shares had a closing bid price at or above $1 a share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the company's stock had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1 a share for continued listing.
