There are few times during the course of the calendar when a G League affiliate becomes an NBA priority. The Miami Heat are in the midst of such a moment.

Having sorted out their own regular-season roster in the immediate wake of Wednesday night's preseason finale, the Heat since have gotten the house in order for the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

The latest moves had the Heat adding 2021 camp prospect DJ Stewart and international-experience guard Jon Elmore, turning around and waiving the two, and then moving their G League rights to the Skyforce.
