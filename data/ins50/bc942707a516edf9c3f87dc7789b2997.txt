In less than two years, Pac-12 media rights negotiations will take place. The exact timing of these talks is unknown, but other conferences such as the Big Ten are first in line. The Pac-12 will come later. Obviously, commissioner George Kliavkoff has to hit the ball out of the park in these negotiations. It's one of the central tasks of his tenure, and it's clear he is already doing his homework, maneuvering to put the Pac-12 in the best possible position when he gets to the negotiating table.
When Kliavkoff discusses the next package of Pac-12 football rights, he will have to give networks reasons to buy into Pac-12 football.
