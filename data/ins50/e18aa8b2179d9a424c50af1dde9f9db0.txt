GB Group's investors can't seem to get a break these days. Shares in the software company have more than halved in the past 12 months and are down nearly 15 per cent since GTCR, an American private equity group, said it would not proceed with a takeover bid last month — and there appears to be little hope that selling pressure will ease after investors' reaction to the company's latest, half-year trading update.The shares tumbled another 81p, or 18.8 per cent, to five-year low of 349¾p after it said it expected to report first-half revenues of £133.
