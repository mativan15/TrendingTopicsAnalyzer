Space weather is a term used to describe the conditions found in the region of space surrounding the Earth and beyond that can affect our planet in a number of ways.The sun is the main source of space weather, which can manifest itself in a variety of different phenomena, including solar flares, coronal mass ejections and geomagnetic storms, among many others.While the Earth's magnetic field, or magnetosphere, largely protects us from charged particles emitted by the sun, space weather phenomena can sometimes have an impact on our planet, interfering with life and technological infrastructure, both in space and on the ground.
