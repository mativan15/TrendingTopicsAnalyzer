NEW BEDFORD — Mayor Jon Mitchell has announced that $3.3 million in funding is being made available to support local businesses and entrepreneurs, according to a press release.

Earlier this year, the city launched a Small Business Assistance Program to distribute portions of federal funding that New Bedford received under the American Rescue Plan Act. On May 13, Mayor Mitchell and local arts leaders celebrated funding for local artists and arts groups, awarded through the small business program.
