TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to the central bank's policy ceiling on Monday and superlong yields hit seven-year highs, amid political turmoil in Britain and increased bets for aggressive U.S. rate hikes.

The 10-year JGB yield edged up half a basis point to 0.25%, reaching the top end of the trading band under the Bank of Japan's yield curve control policy for the first time since Sept. 27.

The 20-year yield added 4.5 basis points to reach 1.
