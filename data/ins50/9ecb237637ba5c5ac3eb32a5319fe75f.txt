Raleigh and Durham rank as some of the top technology hubs in the country. Now, another city in eastern North Carolina is getting its moment in the spotlight.

Greenville ranks as the No. 73 best hub for tech in the country, according to a new report from the NC Tech Association, which notes that the city's ranking was impressive considering how relatively small the metro area is.

"Interestingly, several of the smaller metros in the state that fall outside of the top 105 metros in terms of population performed well," the report says.
