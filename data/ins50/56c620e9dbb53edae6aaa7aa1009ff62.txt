Published: 07:49 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 07:50 EDT, 17 October 2022 Russia has pounded Ukraine again with 'kamikaze' suicide drones, causing chaos in Kyiv as buildings erupted into fireballs and panicked citizens fled for safety or even tried to shoot them down.The Iran-supplied Shahed-136 weapons rained down on the capital in successive waves of 28 drones, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Five smashed into the capital itself while 13 or more were shot down in the wider Kyiv region, all of them as they flew in from the south, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yurii Ihnat.
