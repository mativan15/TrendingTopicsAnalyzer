Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.

Snap — Shares of the Snapchat parent company cratered 30% after missing revenue estimates and sharing its slowest sales growth since going public as advertising spending slows. The results from Snap hit other ad-reliant stocks, sending shares of Pinterest and Meta Platforms down about 7.7% and 2.6%, respectively.

Twitter — The social media stock sank more than 4% Friday amid a slew of media reports surrounding Twitter and Elon Musk. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the Tesla CEO told some potential investors that he would slash nearly three-quarters of Twitter's workforce in his deal to buy the company.
