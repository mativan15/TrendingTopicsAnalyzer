I was delighted to read that the best new building is one planned to 'last another four centuries' (Cosy nooks in a thicket of books: time-straddling library is Britain's best new building, 13 October). The longevity of buildings in the UK is rarely discussed, but historically only about 20,000 homes a year are demolished out of a total stock of 27m. At this rate, the average home will have to stand for another 1,350 years – longer than the oldest Oxford or Cambridge college. Dr Brenda BoardmanEmeritus fellow, Oxford University Emma Brockes seems to have missed the most interesting part of James Corden's meltdown (James Corden finds himself in celebrity jail, but is the joke on us for caring?, 19 October), namely that anyone would bother to go to a restaurant when all they want is an omelette and salad.
