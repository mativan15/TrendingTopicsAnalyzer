piranka/E+ via Getty Images A Quick Take On Zymergen Zymergen (NASDAQ:ZY) went public in April 2021, raising around $500 million in an upsized offering that priced at $31.00 per share. The firm is developing advanced materials and other technologies that help manufacturers design and create better products. While the firm has made strides in its restructuring efforts, ZY will likely need to raise additional capital at a higher cost of capital, whether diluting shareholders through an equity raise or adding debt.
