Probate needs a fresh start

Many people have probably noticed the Labonte signs across the District 26 Probate Court which includes Pomfret, Putnam, Ashford, Woodstock, Brooklyn, Eastford, and Thompson and wondered about that election because it's not ideological.

In the case of Probate Court, when we are faced with the dispiriting challenge of dealing with the death of a loved one, citizens find themselves subject to the services of the Judge of Probate Court.

We need a competent, compassionate, experienced probate attorney who has hands-on experience helping people through this challenging process and treating people with dignity and respect, including those in the legal profession with whom Gabbi has excellent professional relationships.
