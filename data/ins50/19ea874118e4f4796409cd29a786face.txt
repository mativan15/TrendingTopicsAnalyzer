Each of the draft prospects who have been streaming through the Knicks' Tarrytown facility the last few weeks for workouts came in with a different perspective.
Texas point guard Andrew Jones came in thinking he's lucky to be alive.
After battling leukemia, Jones' inspirational story took him to Tarrytown on Thursday for his first-ever NBA workout, battling against draft prospects with less of a winding journey.
He saw Derrick Rose in the locker room and greeted his old Texas teammate, Jericho Sims, who was drafted by the Knicks last year.
