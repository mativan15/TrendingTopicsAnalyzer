Former England captain Michael Vaughan on Thursday was brutally trolled by the Bharat Army, the official fan group of the Indian cricket team, after the bowlers had an eventful day at the Lord's in the Test series opener of England versus New Zealand. The Bharat Army recalled Vaughan's old comment on the Ahmedabad Test between India and England in giving a savage response. It was supposed to be Ben Stokes' day or England's day as the team kicked off to a new beginning of a Test era under the star all-rounder and their new coach Brendon McCullum.
