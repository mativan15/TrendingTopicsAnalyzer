President Biden on Thursday made a trip to Pittsburgh to visit the Fern Hollow Bridge, which collapsed earlier this year as officials work to reopen the crossing before the end of the year.

It caps off a bevy of presidential bridge visits over the last year. It was Biden's second stop at this particular span. His first visit came shortly after the bridge collapsed in January, when he was scheduled to make a speech elsewhere in the city. Just a few months prior, Biden visited another dilapidated bridge, this one in New Hampshire, one day after he signed his bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on Nov.
