The Outlaws BBC1★★★★☆Top GearBBC1★★★☆☆I blew hot and cold on the first series of The Outlaws, by which I mean I thought it was 'hot' when Stephen Merchant was given free rein to indulge the sort of brilliantly sick and sad humour we got in The Office, and 'less hot' when it got into the drug-dealing gangster stuff that broke the spell of 'funny' and was less interesting. I'm very bored generally with drugs/gangsters as a plot device in TV drama.Stephen Merchant in The OutlawsBBC/SAM TAYLORThe good news is that the second series came firing on all cylinders and teeming with quality awkwardness and filth.
