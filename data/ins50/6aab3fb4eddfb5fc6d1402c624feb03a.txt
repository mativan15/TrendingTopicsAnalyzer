(NASDAQ:MASI) activist investor has filed a lawsuit in Delaware after the medical monitoring company added some new bylaws that the activist alleges is trying to thwart its efforts. Politan Capital, which reported an 8.8% stake in Masimo (MASI) in August, filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware. The suit came in response to bylaws that that Masimo adopted on Sept. 9, a week after the company met with Politan. The MASI board also adopted a poison pill at the time.
