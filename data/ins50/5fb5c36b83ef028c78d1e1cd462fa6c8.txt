BMW is making another massive investment in South Carolina, this time to pave the way for the production of electric vehicles.

The company said today it plans to invest $1.7 billion in U.S. manufacturing of electric vehicles. BMW will spend $1 billion to prepare for EV production at its existing manufacturing facility near Greer and Spartanburg. Another $700 million will be spent to build a high-voltage battery assembly facility in Woodruff. The investment will aid BMW's goal of producing six fully electric vehicle models in the U.
