AgenciesTractors more than 10 years are being stopped. BKU is fighting against such harassments. Tikait added.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has alleged that the government "wants to get him killed" and that the attacks on him in Karnataka and Delhi are proof enough. He was addressing the farmers and union members at "Kisan Panchayat" in Meerut's Kanker Khera on Friday. Terming the recent black paint attack on him in Karnataka a "well-planned" conspiracy, he alleged that there was also a plot to kill him when he visited General Bipin Rawat's residence in Delhi to pay homage to him after he passed away in a helicopter accident last December.
