Published: 11:21 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 11:27 EDT, 17 October 2022 South Carolina legal scion Alex Murdaugh has accused someone else of murdering his wife and son - his cousin and the hitman he hired to kill him. Murdaugh is in custody on multiple charges including double homicide. Police say he shot his wife Maggie dead in June 2021, and also killed his 22-year-old son Paul. Murdaugh's legal and financial troubles were mounting; he was snowed under by debt thanks to a crippling pain killer addiction, and had turned to stealing from his own law firm to try to keep up.
