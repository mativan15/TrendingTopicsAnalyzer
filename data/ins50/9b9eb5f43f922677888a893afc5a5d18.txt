Kua whai pānga kē tētahi koromatua rangatahi Māori i Te Tai Tokerau ki ngā tamariki, nā whai anō, e whakaaweawe ana i a rātou kia whāia te pae tawhiti kia tata. Having a young Māori mayor in the Far North is already making an impact on tamariki, inspiring them to consider running for the district's top job. Read this story in English here. I tauākitia a Moko Tepania, 32, hei koromatua i te pō Paraire, ā, kua kōwhiria kētia tētahi kaikaunihera Māori anō hei taituarā mōna, ko Kelly Stratford. Moko Tepania, 32, was announced as mayor late on Friday and has already chosen another Māori councillor, Kelly Stratford, as deputy.
