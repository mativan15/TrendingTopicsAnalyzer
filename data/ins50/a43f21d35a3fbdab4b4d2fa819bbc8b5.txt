Crispin Blunt said he does not think the Prime Minister can survive the current crisis and 'it's now a question as to how the succession is managed'.It comes as senior Conservative MP Alicia Kearns said it is 'very difficult' to say whether Liz Truss should continue as Prime Minister, and another senior Tory MP likened the Government to 'libertarian jihadists'.Mr Blunt, who is the Conservative MP for Reigate and was a justice minister in the early years of David Cameron's premiership, backed Jeremy Hunt in the summer Tory leadership contest.
