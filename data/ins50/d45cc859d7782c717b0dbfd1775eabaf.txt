The woman arrested in South Korea in connection to two children found in suitcases could fight extradition on mental health grounds, one expert says. New Zealand sent its formal request to South Korea on Tuesday to extradite the 42-year-old woman back to Aotearoa after she was arrested in the coastal city of Ulsan in September for the murder of two children, a boy and a girl. The woman is currently being held in Seoul and is receiving consular assistance from the New Zealand embassy in the South Korean capital, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) confirmed.
