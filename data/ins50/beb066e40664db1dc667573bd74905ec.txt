The team, nicknamed 'Magnificent Seven', rode from John O'Groats to Land's End on a seven-seater bike and completed the challenge in just five days and 21 hours. Two core teams of riders set off on Sunday May 22 and cycled in shifts throughout the day and night on the 200kg (441lb) seven-seater bike, finishing the challenge on May 28.
