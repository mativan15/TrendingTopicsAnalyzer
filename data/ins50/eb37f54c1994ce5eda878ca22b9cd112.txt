A jury on Wednesday ruled that Amber Heard defamed Johnny Depp in all three of the actor's claims. They awarded him $10 million in damages and $5 million in punitive damages.
Judge Penny Azcarate informed the court that state law limits punitive damages to $350,000, meaning Depp was awarded a total of $10.35 million.
The jurors also said Depp defamed Heard in just one of her three claims, awarding her $2 million in damages and no money in punitive damages.
Subtracting Heard's award from Depp's total, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' star leaves the case with $8.
