Under the agreement, Lilly will begin a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of Akouos for $12.50/ share in cash, plus one CVR of up to $3.00/share for an aggregate of up to $610M. The company noted that there can be no assurance that any payments will be made with respect to the CVR. Akouos' lead product candidate is AK-OTOF for which the company received clearance from the FDA in September to start a phase 1/2 trial to treat pediatric patients with otoferlin gene (OTOF)-mediated hearing loss.
