Gov. Ron DeSantis' war chest is almost bottomless.

And it's padded with donations from officials he appointed to positions throughout the state.

While it's common for governors to stack commissions, boards and task forces with their supporters, DeSantis has done so at a significantly higher rate than his predecessor, according to an analysis of campaign contributions and political appointments.

Since assuming office in 2019, DeSantis has accepted roughly $3.3 million in campaign donations from about 250 people he selected for leadership roles — a 75% increase in the number of donors appointed compared to former Gov.
