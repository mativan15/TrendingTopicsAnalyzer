For Mykyta Hlushchenko, an international student by day and food delivery driver by night, every cent matters.That's why soaring gas prices have him considering a change to how he works — going back to make deliveries by bicycle instead of in his car."I'm losing, for every 100 kilometres, around five … bucks," at current gas prices, he said.Hlushchenko, who works for Uber Eats, is among those in the "gig economy," such as ride-hailing drivers and food delivery workers, who now have to grapple with rapidly climbing prices that make doing their work more expensive.
