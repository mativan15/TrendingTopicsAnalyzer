The parent of Hawaiian Airlines is joining forces with Amazon (AMZN 2.20%) Prime Air cargo operations, and investors are excited about the opportunity. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings (HA 12.71%) traded up as much as 14% on Friday after the agreement was announced.
So what
Over the past few years, Amazon has been slowly building a formidable cargo air operation by partnering with, and often investing in, airline operators who are willing to fly planes under its branding. Hawaiian joined the team on Friday, announcing a deal to operate and maintain an initial fleet of 10 Airbus A330 freighters beginning in the fall of 2023.
