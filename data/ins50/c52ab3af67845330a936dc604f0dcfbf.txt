The four candidates running to be mayor participated in a 'meet the candidates' event last Wednesday. Candidates fielded nearly a dozen questions including finances, amenities, infrastructure, budget, taxes, economic development, housing, tourism, agriculture and public transit. While not asked a specific question about it, one topic came up on a few occasions during the questions: town administration. In 2021, the town let three high-ranking members of administration go, including then CAO John Miceli for personal reasons.
