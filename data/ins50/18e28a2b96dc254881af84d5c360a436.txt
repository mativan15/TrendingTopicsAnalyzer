'I am not a statistician or a forecaster, but there is just a gut feel that crude cannot stay at these levels for too long or the whole world will go into recession. Hopefully, at some point, crude will come down. So, with that caveat, if crude comes down of course we will literally start flying,' says Ronojoy Dutta, CEO & Wholetime Director, IndiGo. 
There was an extraordinary impact of Omicron in the last quarter. So can I say that whatever numbers we are discussing, those numbers are not that relevant because there has also been a big uptick in crude prices along with Omicron.
