The one area where you should probably tread warily is the domestic. It will be all too easy to upset the apple-cart at home. If this is your intention, fine. Otherwise, consider the consequences of your actions very carefully. In love you stand in danger of misunderstanding others' perfectly innocent messages, so be alert to subtle signals.
