Thousands cheered for Umran Malik when he uprooted a stump or two in the recently concluded IPL season. But growing up, when a young Umran would break glass windows, he had one fan supporting him. His mother.
'I loved fast bowling from the beginning,' says the 22-year-old at the Indian Express Idea Exchange.
'When I was young, I would play with a plastic ball at home and would get scolded for breaking glass windows. But even then, my mother would not stop me from playing and would say, ‘khel, tod' (Play, break).
