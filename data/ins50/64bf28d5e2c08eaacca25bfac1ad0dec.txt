The White House has said Russia is likely to default on its foreign bonds in a sign of the country's "pariah" status, with the Kremlin facing a major $100 million test on Friday.Russia has two bond coupon payments due in dollars and euros Friday, but the fate of that money is highly uncertain after the US Treasury this week closed a key loophole that allowed cash to get around sanctions and into investors' accounts.The Russian government has so far kept up payments on its foreign-currency bonds despite a widespread belief that it would default under the weight of sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine.
