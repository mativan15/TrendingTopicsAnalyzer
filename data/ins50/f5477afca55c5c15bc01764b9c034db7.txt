Rapper Desiigner got into a commotional scene with the Los Angeles Police Department when he was pulled over at a gas station yesterday.

The 25-year-old was allegedly pulled over 'for driving without a license and his tinted windows.'

When the camera begins recording, the 'Panda' rapper can be heard yelling at one of the officers.

'Put your pepper spray back in your bag, I'm not a threat! Back the f-ck up!' he shouts. 'Back up! I don't have anything in my pocket, back the f-ck up!'

'You f-cking racist b-tch!' he continues to shout.
