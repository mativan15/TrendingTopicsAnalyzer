A Paris education district is using a 'speed dating' interview system to fill more than 1,000 teaching jobs with unqualified applicants from outside the profession, to the anger of unions and parents.Faced with a critical shortage of staff, the southwestern school district — France's biggest — has this week been holding 30-minute interviews with 2,000 candidates to recruit 1,300 for after the summer holidays.The candidates must hold at least a three-year degree, but no teaching experience or training is required for the primary and secondary professeurs.
