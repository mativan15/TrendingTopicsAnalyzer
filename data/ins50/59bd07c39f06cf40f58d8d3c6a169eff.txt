ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE
JUNE 2, 2022
Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale further invasion of Ukraine on February 24, leading to civilian casualties and widespread reports of war crimes and other atrocities perpetrated by Russia's forces in Ukraine. The world has seen the extraordinary bravery of the people of Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutality. The United States will continue to work with our partners and allies to impose severe costs on the Government of the Russian Federation for its aggression against Ukraine and utter disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
