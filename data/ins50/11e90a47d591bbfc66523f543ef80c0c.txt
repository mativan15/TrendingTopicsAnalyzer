David Gelles has been reporting on American CEOs for years at The New York Times. But there's one CEO who stands heads and shoulders among his peers. He's been retired for more than two decades, but his impact is still felt. Revered by some and reviled by others, his name is Jack Welch and he served as the CEO for General Electric (GE) from 1981 to 2001. In Gelles' new book, The Man Who Broke Capitalism: How Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America—and How to Undo His Legacy, he chronicles how Welch's laser focus on maximizing shareholder value by any means necessary - including layoffs, outsourcing, offshoring, acquisitions, and buybacks - became the new playbook in American business.
