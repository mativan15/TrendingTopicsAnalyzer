It's starting to feel like we're piling on Dennis Allen, but the New Orleans Saints head coach isn't doing himself any favors with more perplexing decisions and off-putting quotes in his press conferences. On Friday, Allen told local media that he's sent players home for the weekend after a Thursday night loss to the Arizona Cardinals, opting to give them time to heal up and recharge before returning to a normal workweek on Monday.

Is that really the right call after a 2-5 start to the season, in which the Saints have lost multiple games to self-inflicted wounds? Missed tackles, penalties, turnovers, dropped passes, and gaffes in run defense discipline have defined the first few months of Allen's tenure.
