Our friends over at College Football News have provided their updated bowl projections after Week 7, and it appears the Ohio State Buckeyes' position has stayed the same. This makes sense considering Ohio State has been extremely impressive so far this season and was already near the top of all the fun.

It was another insane week in the Big Ten despite some of the teams being on a bye, but we saw the Michigan Wolverines flex their muscles against the Penn State Nittany Lions, and the Wisconsin Badgers take an L against the Michigan State Spartans.
