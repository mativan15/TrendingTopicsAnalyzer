Bridgeville-based RDC Inc. is ready to add some new flex industrial buildings to the Parkway West corridor.

On Monday, the company broke ground on a two-building, 120,000-square-foot expansion of the Alpine Point Business Park, a flex industrial park along Interstate 79 near the interchange with Interstate 579.

The plan calls for starting with a 40,000-square-foot flex building to be built speculatively, seeking companies in need of space for manufacturing, research and development, and light assembly.
