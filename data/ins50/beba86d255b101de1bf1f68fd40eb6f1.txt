Editor's note: This is one in a series of stories looking at contested races in the Aurora area in the Nov. 8 general election.

The election in District 22 for a spot on the Kane County Board is between incumbent Democrat Vern Tepe and Republican Jeffrey Meyer.

The general election is set for Nov. 8.

Tepe, 81, of Elgin, is seeking his second term on the board and said that issues in the district include inflation, taxes and mental health.

'In my mind inflation hits the floor first and when you begin to look at what is happening to the food banks and homeless shelters they're turning people away in Elgin and to me, that's disturbing,' he said.
