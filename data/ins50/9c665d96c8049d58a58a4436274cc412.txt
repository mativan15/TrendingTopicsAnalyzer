White teachers should teach ethnic minority children to sing the national anthem even if it makes them 'uncomfortable', the Government's social mobility tsar has said.
Katharine Birbalsingh, the chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said that schoolchildren should learn the song or risk being taught they don't "belong" in their own country.
The headmistress and co-founder of Michaela Community School in Wembley, London, criticised the "pernicious" identity politics shaping school culture and criticised the drive to "decolonise" the curriculum.
