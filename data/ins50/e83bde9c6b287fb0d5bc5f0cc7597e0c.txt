Camila Cabello tried using a dating app once — and didn't last very long.

In a new interview set to air on Tuesday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show, the "Bam Bam" singer-songwriter opened up about taking the common, modern route in an attempt to find her next romance before receiving a message that led her to delete the service.

"I was on a dating app for like 24 hours then I left," Cabello, 25, told host Drew Barrymore before explaining her reasoning.
