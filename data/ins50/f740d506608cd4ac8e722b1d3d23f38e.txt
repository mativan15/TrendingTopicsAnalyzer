Oct. 16—It was fitting that Michigan honored its 1997 Big Ten and national championship football team Saturday.

Those Wolverines traveled to Beaver Stadium and pummeled Penn State from start to finish in a 34-8 victory that really wasn't that close.

Behind running back Chris Howard, cornerback Charles Woodson and others, Michigan outgained the Nittany Lions by a more than 2-to-1 margin in one of the two worst home losses for Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno.

Twenty-five years later, the Wolverines once again dominated Penn State in a matchup of two unbeaten teams ranked in the top 10 and rolled to a 41-17 rout Saturday at Michigan Stadium.
