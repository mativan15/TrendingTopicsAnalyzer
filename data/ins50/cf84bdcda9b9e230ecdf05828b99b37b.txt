Tuesday night marked a significant step in the fight for more benefits for persons with disabilities in Canada, as the second reading of Bill C-22 passed with unanimous support in parliament.
In New Brunswick, the Coalition for Persons with Disabilities held a virtual rally aimed at fast-tracking that bill and seeking to get the attention of MPs.During the rally that lasted well over an hour, many persons with disabilities and advocates shared their concerns with the current model, speaking on how critical adding those funds would be.
