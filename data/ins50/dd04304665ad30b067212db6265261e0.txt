OTTAWA - In a scathing indictment of the Canadian Armed Forces' resistance to change, retired Supreme Court justice Louise Arbour says it is long past time for the military to scrap traditions and structures that perpetuate a sexualized culture.The call from one of Canada's most respected jurists follows a year-long review ordered by the Liberal government, and leaves Canada's military at a crossroads after decades of scandals, criticism and broken promises.'The long-established way of doing business in the CAF is anchored in operational imperatives that are often nothing more than assumptions,' Arbour writes in the introduction to her highly anticipated report, released Monday.
