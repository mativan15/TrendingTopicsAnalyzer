Straight out of Star Wars Celebration, we just got our first look at Andor, the Disney+ series following the earlier adventures of the rebel spy who first—and last—appeared in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. We're going to break down the trailer shot by shot to see what we can learn about Andor's involvement in the formation of the Rebel Alliance under threat of the Empire's might. The release date for Andor on Disney Plus is August 31, 2022. It will have a two-episode premiere just like the Star Wars: Obi-Wan Kenobi series.
