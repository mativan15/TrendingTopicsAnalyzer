The Government should immediately introduce pay transparency legislation and raise the minimum wage to the same level as the living wage, the Green Party says. The call comes after a Te Kāhui Tika Tangata Human Rights Commission inquiry into the Pacific pay gap found that Pasifika women are the lowest income earners in New Zealand. The report showed the annual income for Pasifika women is, on average, 25% less than that of their Pākehā male colleagues. Green MP Jan Logie said the Government should ensure the Fair Pay Agreements Bill is passed as soon as possible to close the gender and ethnic pay gap in Aotearoa.
