A Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) confirmed on Friday that it would be withdrawing spending from New Hampshire's Senate race even as recent polling shows a tight contest.

A spokesperson for the Senate Leadership Fund confirmed to The Hill that it would be slashing $5.6 million from the state beginning on Oct. 25.

'As the cycle comes to a close, we are shifting resources to where they can be most effective to achieve our ultimate goal: winning the majority,' Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said in a statement.
