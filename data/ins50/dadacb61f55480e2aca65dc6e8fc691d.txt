NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Monday ordered the immediate suspension of IAS officer Jitendra Narain over charges of sexually assaulting a woman at his Port Blair residence during his last posting as chief secretary of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The action against the 1990 batch officer belonging to the AGMUT cadre comes a day after the home ministry received a report from the Andaman and Nicobar Police regarding the alleged sexual assault in which another senior government officer is also the co-accused.
