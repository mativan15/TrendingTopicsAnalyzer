Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt ripped up what was left of Prime Minister Liz Truss's controversial economic program, scrapping tax cuts and removing support for household energy bills to restore order to the public finances. The package of £32 billion of savings fell short of the £70 billion that economists say the government needs to find to rebuild its credibility among investors after soaring inflation and sputtering growth gutted tax revenue.  Together with earlier U-turns, the decisions reverse almost all of the £45 billion in tax cuts and giveaways Truss announced in early September, raising questions about whether she can survive in office.
