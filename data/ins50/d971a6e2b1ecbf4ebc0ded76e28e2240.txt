When President Joe Biden last November signed the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – commonly known as the bipartisan infrastructure bill – he and other proponents noted it would be the largest investment in infrastructure in a generation.

But they also promised it would be something else: a historic effort to tackle climate change. Although it didn't devote hundreds of billions of dollars directly to the climate fight as the Inflation Reduction Act did this year, the administration said infrastructure bill would still help transition the nation to cleaner sources of energy while electrifying the transportation sector and preparing roads and bridges for a changing world.
