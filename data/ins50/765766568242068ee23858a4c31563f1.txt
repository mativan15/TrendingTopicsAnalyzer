Round Room Live, an eOne company led by co-Presidents Stephen Shaw and Jonathan Linden, has been called by Billboard 'the new leader in the family show entertainment space.' The company specializes in transforming new and iconic intellectual properties into live events, staging experiences ranging from family shows featuring beloved characters to events and exhibitions focused on leading cultural figures and touchstones. Round Room Live was one of the first family show producers to build a live show around a series created on YouTube for pre-school audiences—most stick with licensing television and motion picture content.
