The Los Angeles Lakers have experienced one of their first significant injuries of the new season.
Forward Troy Brown Jr. missed the entire preseason with a back ailment, and he is said to be 'a few weeks away' from being able to take the court for game action.
Meanwhile, Dennis Schroder returned to the Lakers last month as a free agent, and he missed the first several preseason games because he was stuck overseas due to a visa issue.
He finally debuted on Wednesday when they took on the Minnesota Timberwolves, but he played just nine minutes.
