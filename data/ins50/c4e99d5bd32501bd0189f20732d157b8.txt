Twitter is facing a new lawsuit involving its alleged 'surreptitious and undisclosed' use of people's data, following revelations about the social media company's actions identified by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. The Justice Department and FTC ordered Twitter to pay $150 million in civil penalties last month over alleged data privacy violations occurring between 2013 and 2019, which involved the collection of phone numbers and emails for security purposes that the agencies said were also used for companies to send targeted ads.
