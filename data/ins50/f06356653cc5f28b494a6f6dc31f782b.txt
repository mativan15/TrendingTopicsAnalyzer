Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian spoke with the media on Thursday and made an interesting comment about wide receiver Agiye Hall's future with the program.
Sarkisian expressed that it'd be in the best interest of Hall and the team if they could preserve his redshirt this season. Throughout the 2022 season, Hall has only appeared in three games and recorded one reception for seven yards.

Many expected Hall to make an immediate impact with the Longhorns this season after losing wide receiver Isaiah Neyor to an ACL tear prior to the season opener.
