Two vehicles remotely operated by a human driver 15 miles away in the North Side of Pittsburgh are now undergoing testing on roadways and in parking lots at Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). It marks the latest partnership between the airport's xBridge innovation program and a local startup company.

By partnering with xBridge, Pittsburgh-based Mapless AI Inc. is hoping to further validate its tech, which claims to have the ability to convert most vehicles into ones that can be operated remotely following the installation of its propriety lightweight rack that includes cameras and other sensors to enable remote control of the vehicle.
