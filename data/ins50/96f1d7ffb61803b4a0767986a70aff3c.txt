The District's Democratic mayoral candidates are promoting plans to create more affordable housing, critical of gentrification projects that have sparked new construction throughout the city but also pushed some residents from their longtime neighborhoods. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who is seeking a third term, faces primary challenges from former attorney James Butler and D.C. Council members Trayon White (Ward 8) and Robert White (at-large), who are not related. The Democratic primary is set for June 21.
