Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched 11 high-tech, low-cost electric charging stations in different parts of the national capital, taking yet another step in the direction of a concerted shift towards electric vehicles (EVs). There are 73 charging points and 12 swapping stations at these 11 charging stations. During the event at the Indraprastha Metro parking area, one of the locations, the CM announced that the stations will offer EV charging at a low cost — barely 7 paise/km for two wheelers, 8 paise/km for three wheelers and 33 paise/km for four wheelers.
