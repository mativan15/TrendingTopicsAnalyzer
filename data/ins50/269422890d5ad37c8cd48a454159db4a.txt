Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has said he had recently reconnected with longtime friend Russian President Vladimir Putin, exchanging gifts of wine, vodka and 'sweet' letters over his recent birthday, according to a leaked recording.
The LaPresse news agency on Tuesday published audio of what it said was a secretly taped speech by Berlusconi, who turned 86 last month, to legislators of his Forza Italia party that is set to join Italy's new government as part of a right-wing coalition led by Giorgia Meloni.
