FIFA president Gianni Infantino said creating a centralised clearing house will bring "transparency and accountability" as the sport's governing body looks to crack down on the multi-billion dollar global transfer market.
Infantino, speaking after Saturday's FIFA Council meeting in Auckland, said the new Paris-based entity would focus on ensuring smaller clubs receive the compensation owed for developing players before tackling the broader market.
"This will change the lives of these small clubs because it's big, big money, and it's due, and we're very proud to do this," said Infantino.
