It says that it expects out-of-pocket costs to remain at zero for the insured.The move comes as the nation moves away from government-controlled distribution of the jabs to rolling them out through the traditional US healthcare system.This means that, similar to a flu shot, Americans will be able to get the shot from their primary-care provider, though there may still be some out-of-pocket costs.
