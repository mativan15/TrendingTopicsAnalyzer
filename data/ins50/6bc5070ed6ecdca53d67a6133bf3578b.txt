DALLAS — For Texas, the road to a possible berth in the Big 12 championship game runs through Oklahoma State and Kansas State and Kansas.

The operative word in that sentence is 'road.'

As encouraging as things look now for No. 20 Texas (5-2, 3-1 Big 12) with a healthy Quinn Ewers and Bijan Robinson delivering 100-yard rushing games on command, there's still something to prove.

In true road games under Steve Sarkisian, Texas is 1-5 including a blown 14-point lead at Lubbock this season in an overtime loss to Texas Tech.
