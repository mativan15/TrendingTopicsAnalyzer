Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says Darwin Nunez's fitness will need to be assessed ahead of Saturday's lunchtime clash against Nottingham Forest.
The Uruguayan striker, who moved to Anfield in the summer for a fee that could reach £85million, was picked to start in Wednesday's 1-0 win over West Ham and scored the only goal of the game to secure all three points.
However, after the game Klopp said his club-record signing had ‘felt a bit of the muscle in the first half' and withdrew him after 57 minutes as a precaution.
