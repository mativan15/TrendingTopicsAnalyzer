We booked a house for the weekend through Airbnb for an upcoming trip to the Austrian Grand Prix in Spielberg. The map shown on Airbnb's website indicated the house was located about 40 minutes from the circuit, which was perfect as we could quickly drive to the track for each day of the grand prix weekend. But when we asked for the address after booking, it turns out the house is more than 100 miles west of where it is supposed to be and now almost all the other accommodation is booked up.Obviously driving so far to the track each day isn't an option, and anything that is still available nearby costs way more money than we can afford.
