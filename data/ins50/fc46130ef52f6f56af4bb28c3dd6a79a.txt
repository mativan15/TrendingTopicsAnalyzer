A Los Angeles woman was stabbed in the head by a homeless man with a pair of garden shears in an unprovoked North Hollywood attack earlier this month, according to police.Shocking surveillance video taken across the street from the broad daylight Oct. 10 attack shows two figures walking on the far sidewalk toward each other. As a cement truck passes by, the man, identified by police as Jonathan Cole, 30, appears to lash out and strike the woman, who staggers away as the truck rumbles on. They move their separate ways, and she appears unsteady as she makes her way toward a nearby business.
