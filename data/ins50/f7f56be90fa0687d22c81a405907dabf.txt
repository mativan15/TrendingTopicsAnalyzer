A majority of workers at the huge Amazon fulfillment center in Schodack voted against joining a union, according to results tallied Tuesday, rejecting organizers' efforts to become only the second such facility in the nation.

The results were 406 against and 206 in favor of the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which started counting the ballots at 10 a.m. Tuesday at its regional office in Buffalo following several days of voting.

A total of 643 votes were cast among the 949 eligible voters at the 1 million-square-foot warehouse at 1835 Route 9.
