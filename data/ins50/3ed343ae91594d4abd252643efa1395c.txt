W﻿e asked for your post-match reaction after Sunday's game at Elland Road.H﻿ere are some of your thoughts:L﻿eeds fans:M﻿artin: I was at the match. Leeds first-half were clueless in attack with Rodrigo playing. Second half with Bamford they were superb but just couldn't score.R﻿yan: Despite losing, I saw plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Leeds close to completely dominated the second half, against the league leaders no less, but a lack of confidence in front of goal was our downfall. Reinforcements are without a doubt required in the winter, specifically up front!C﻿hris: Best performance all season, I thought Leeds played better than they did against Chelsea as Arsenal are at present a much better side.
