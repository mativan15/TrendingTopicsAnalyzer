(RTTNews) - The Indonesia stock market has tracked higher in two straight sessions, gathering almost 20 points or 0.3 percent along the way. The Jakarta Composite Index now rests just above the 6,830-point plateau and it's expected to open higher again on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets is upbeat on bargain hunting and renewed optimism over earnings. The European and U.S. markets were firmly higher and the Asian bourses are expected to open in similar fashion. The JCI finished barely higher on Tuesday following gains from the cement companies and mixed performances from the financials and resource stocks.
