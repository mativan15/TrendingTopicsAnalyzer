CNN —

Special counsel John Durham's latest trial ended Tuesday with not guilty verdicts on all charges against Igor Danchenko, the primary source for the Trump-Russia dossier.

It's yet another major setback for Durham, the Trump-era holdover who has spent the past three years looking for misconduct related to the Russia investigation.

A lot was riding on the outcome, especially for Durham, who personally handled the bulk of the case, including closing arguments.

The Danchenko case resurrected many of the most notorious dramas from the 2016 election, including the infamous 'Steele dossier,' which claimed Donald Trump's campaign was colluding with Russia.
