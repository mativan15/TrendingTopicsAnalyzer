Dolphins quarterbacks absorbed eight sacks and 29 hits in the last two weeks. And in last week's 24-16 loss against Minnesota there are very few snapshots of the Dolphins using six-man pass protections.

The question, considering quarterback Tua Tagovailoa returns from concussion protocol to start Sunday night's game against Pittsburgh, is whether the Dolphins must beef up their pass protection to keep Tagovailoa upright.

It seems absolutely essential that the Dolphins do something aside from saying they just need to improve on their five-man pass protection fundamentals, which has been their refrain.
