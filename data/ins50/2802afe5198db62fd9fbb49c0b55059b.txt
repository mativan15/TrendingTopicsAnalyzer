The 11 men convicted in the Bilkis Bano case were granted early release on the grounds of 'good behaviour' the Gujarat government said to the SC on Monday. The Union Home Ministry approved their release within two weeks of a request from the Gujarat government. The convicts were released on August 15 which set off a huge controversy. The convicts were first sentenced to a life term in jail. They were greeted with garlands and sweets outside the prison.
