(Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Last year an Instagram representative contacted Justina Sharp, a 24-year-old with 93,000 followers, and asked for a meeting to discuss ways she could expand her audience. Sharp thought it was strange to hear from an actual human there, but knew better than to say no. The conversation felt, she says, like the 'Facebook gods' coming down from on high to Instagramsplain. The employee 'talked at me for exactly half an hour, because that's how corporate and precise they are,' she recalls.
