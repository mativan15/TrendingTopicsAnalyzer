Vanguard founder Jack Bogle helped spearhead the low-cost index fund, putting average returns within reach of every investor. But you can make better returns by buying undervalued shares. To wit, Summit State Bank (NASDAQ:SSBI) shares are up 50% in three years, besting the market return. More recently the stock has gained 5.2% in a year, which isn't too bad.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
