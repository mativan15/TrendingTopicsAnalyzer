FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Jamie Dixon might have the most stable roster in the nation, which is quite a transformation for a TCU program that went through a couple of overhauls before landing its highest-ever preseason ranking this fall.The 14th-ranked Horned Frogs, with preseason Big 12 player of the year Mike Miles Jr., return all five starters and five other scholarship players. They had consecutive wins over top-10 teams late last season to solidify a spot in the NCAA Tournament, then missed getting to the Sweet 16 after an overtime loss to Arizona.
