Cryptocurrency adoption slowed considerably since the onset of the bear market this year but still remains above levels seen before 2021, according to a new study by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.

Based on Chainalysis' global index score, crypto adoption slowed in the first two quarters of 2022 compared to the highs of the second and fourth quarters of 2021. Adoption remained higher, however, than the pre-bull market levels up to and including Q1 of 2021.

Chainalysis' 2022 Geography of Cryptocurrency report also found that 18 of the 20 countries where crypto adoption was at its highest were low to middle-income countries, where crypocurrency is used for sending remittances and protecting savings against high inflation.
