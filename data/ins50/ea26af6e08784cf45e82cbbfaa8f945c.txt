Oct. 16—Erin Armstrong, a lab clinician tech at Mosaic Cancer Care, has seen firsthand how cancer can impact the lives of her patients. Over the last few months, though, she faced cancer head-on with a diagnosis of her own.

In June of this year, after neglecting herself and prioritizing the needs of her family, she had a feeling something was wrong.

"It started with one day I got in the shower, and I happened to look down and my nipple was inverted," Armstrong said.

She then carried the issue to work with her, in passing asking for advice from fellow coworkers in the cancer center.
