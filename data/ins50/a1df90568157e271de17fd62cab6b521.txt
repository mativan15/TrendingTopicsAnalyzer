Although Analogue has been making retro console clones for 11 years now, its portable Pocket garnered the company thousands of new fans now desperate to get their hands on its older hardware which is often hard to come by. But an announcement made by the company over the weekend should have 16-bit gaming enthusiasts screaming at Analogue to just shut up and take their money.Analogue actually made three separate announcements yesterday in a blog post shared to its website. The first is that 95% of all Pocket pre-orders—those who found themselves patiently waiting in Group B and C—will begin shipping out this month and throughout the rest of the year before 2022 comes to a close, with a 'small amount of remaining orders' going out the door in 2023 as soon as stock allows.
