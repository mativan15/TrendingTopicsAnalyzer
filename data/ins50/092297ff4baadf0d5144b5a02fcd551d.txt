Athleisure company Athleta and kitchenware maker Zwilling will be among the businesses coming to the Somerville shopping area.

A host of new retailers are set to open in Somerville's Assembly Row in the next year, the site said Wednesday, according to the Boston Business Journal.

The mixed-use site will soon be home to outposts of athleisure store Athleta, designer bag retailer Coach, German kitchenware maker Zwilling J.A. Henckels, and stationery store Paper Source.

Athleta and Zwilling will be the first to open, and are expected next month, according to Boston Business Journal.
