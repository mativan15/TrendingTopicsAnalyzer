Republican Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker acknowledged in a new interview that he sent a $700 check to a woman who alleges the money was provided to reimburse her for an abortion, though Walker denies the check was for that purpose.

In an interview with NBC News that aired Monday morning, Walker was presented with a copy of the check, along with a receipt from the medical center in Georgia where the woman had the procedure. 'It doesn't matter whether it's my signature or not,' Walker said, before examining the document with reading glasses on and concluding, 'Yes, that's my check.
