Speculation is growing about the direction that new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will take the nation's finances, amid reports that he could seek to delay plans for a 1p cut in income tax.The new Chancellor, who spoke to broadcasters on Saturday in his first full day in office, declined to be drawn into specifics of what may or may not be announced in the fiscal plan on October 31.Warning of 'difficult decisions' to come, Mr Hunt signalled that the country could be facing some tax rises and spending cuts across government departments.
