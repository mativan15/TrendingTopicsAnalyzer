The crypto market has had a fairly low-key October. While the price of Bitcoin dipped briefly below $19,000, it continues to hold around that support level. Some investors believe that the market has bottomed out and that the only way to move is up.
 
The reduced volatility has some investors thinking that now is the time to enter the market. We examine five cryptocurrencies that have shown price movements and activity over the past week: Huobi Token (HT), Arweave (AR), KuCoin Token (KCS), Hedera (HBAR), and Maker (MKR).
