Two years after the Washington Capitals' screaming eagle logo returned as part of the NHL's first 'Reverse Retro' collection of alternate jerseys, the franchise's throwback look is back in black. The design, which was officially unveiled Thursday along with the rest of the league's Reverse Retro reboot, was a poorly kept secret, with leaked renderings circulating earlier this year. Capitals players wore black pants, gloves and socks at practice Tuesday, and goalie Darcy Kuemper showed off new black and copper pads, along with a new mask adorned with the team's former screaming eagle logo.
