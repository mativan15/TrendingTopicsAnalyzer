The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a ruling blocking a Texas law aimed at preventing big social media services from 'censoring' users or content based on viewpoint.
The court ruled 5-4 to block the law, which is pending a challenge before a federal appeals about whether it is constitutional. The court did not provide a reason for why it upheld a lower court's injunction preventing the Texas law from taking effect pending appeal.
The Supreme Court was ruling on an emergency application filed by two tech industry groups, representing companies including Meta, Google, TikTok and Twitter, which had claimed that the Texas law 'would compel platforms to disseminate all sorts of objectionable viewpoints,' including 'neo-Nazi or KKK screeds denying or supporting the Holocaust.
