WWE superstar Bobby Lashley took the fight to Brock Lesnar as Raw got off to a chaotic start on Monday night.
The All Mighty was already mid-flow as the show came on the air, calling out the Beast Incarnate and wanting a measure of revenge after losing the United States Title last week.
The former champ was seething after what went down on the October 10 episode, as he made his way to the ring to face Seth Freakin' Rollins only for Lesnar to go on the attack.
As a result of the pre-match beat down, it didn't take much for the Visionary to get the win over Lashley, and this week he wanted to make Brock pay.
