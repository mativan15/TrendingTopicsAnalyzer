A damning report into years of maternity failings at an NHS trust has found that dozens of babies died or were left brain damaged by poor care.
Dr Bill Kirkup, chairman of the inquiry into East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, said his panel had heard ‘harrowing' accounts from families receiving ‘suboptimal' care.
His findings showed mothers were ignored by staff and shut out from their own care.
‘An overriding theme, raised us with time and time again, is the failure of the trust's staff to take notice of women when they raised concerns, when they questioned their care, and when they challenged the decisions that were made about their care,' the report said.
