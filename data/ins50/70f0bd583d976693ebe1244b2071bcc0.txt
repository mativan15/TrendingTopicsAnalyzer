ANIPeople's Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti.Is the Centre too fragile to withstand a peaceful protest by mainstream political parties in Kashmir, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti asked on Sunday. Her remarks came after reports that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will address a rally against the Centre in the national capital over killings in Kashmir. Mufti said it is ironic that the political parties from the valley are not allowed to stage protests against the killings of minority community members, while parties in other states are.
