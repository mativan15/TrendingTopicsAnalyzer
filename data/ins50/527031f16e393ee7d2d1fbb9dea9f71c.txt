Google on Friday said that the Competition Commission of India's decision to impose a monetary penalty of Rs 1,337.76 crore on it was a "major setback" for consumers and businesses in the country. "Android has created more choice for everyone, and supports thousands of successful businesses in India and around the world," a Google spokesperson said on Friday, as quoted by Reuters.

The global tech giant said it will review the CCI's decision to evaluate next steps.
