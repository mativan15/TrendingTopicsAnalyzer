Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson played through a hamstring injury in Monday night's overtime loss to the Chargers and he's headed for tests on Tuesday to find out what impact it will have on his availability.

Tom Pelissero of NFL Media reports that Wilson will have an MRI on the hamstring on Tuesday. Wilson said after the game that the injury 'got me pretty good in the fourth quarter,' but he remained in the game through its conclusion.
