SACRAMENTO — The California Association of Realtors is apologizing for its role in pushing policies that drove racial segregation in the state, decades after the group put its money behind a proposition that overturned the state's first fair housing law.
During a press conference Friday, leaders of multiple real estate organizations spoke about their next steps, following the association's apology last week. The realtors' group is now backing a bill that would overturn a law that makes it harder for the state to build affordable housing.
