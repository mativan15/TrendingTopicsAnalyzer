Bo Hines, a Republican congressional hopeful in North Carolina, recently revealed that the majority of his campaign money appears to have come from his own trust fund.As a young candidate without much political experience, Hines is self-funding the majority of his campaign. According to the Federal Election Commission, he's loaned just over $775,000 of his own money to the campaign, or about 58% of his entire campaign war chest.But in a personal financial disclosure first noted by Axios' Lachlan Markay, Hines lists having no job, no bank account, no other earned income or compensation, and zero loans or liabilities.
