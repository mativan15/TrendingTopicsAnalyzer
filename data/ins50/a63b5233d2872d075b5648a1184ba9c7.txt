The Astros, after a wild clubhouse celebration following the Game 3 marathon clincher, spent the night in Seattle and flew back to Houston on Sunday evening. Some are dubbing the AL Championship Series as the 'Houston Invitational,' considering it's the sixth consecutive year the Astros have played for a pennant -- only the Braves (eight in a row from 1991-99) have more consecutive LCS appearances.
The Astros are awaiting the winner of the Yankees-Guardians series, to be decided in Game 5 on Monday night, with the winner coming to Minute Maid Park for Game 1 of the ALCS on Wednesday night.
