Vladimir Putin will not use nuclear weapons in the conflict in Ukraine, Russia's ambassador to the UK has claimed.

Andrei Kelin told the BBC that there were "very strict" rules on their use, with nuclear missiles only allowed to be deployed "when the existence of the state is endangered". "It has nothing to do with the current operation," he said.
