India's financial inclusion in the hinterland and the credit flow to the rural economy are improving along with a rise in household sector's financial savings, setting a stage for an accelerated growth of non-urban centres. The net financial savings of the household sector grew more than 3 percentage points to 11.5 percent with insurance and pension funds leading the gains, RBI annual report shows.
