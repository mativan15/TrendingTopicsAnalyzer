India says it has successfully test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, in the Indian Ocean. The Indian government announced on Friday the missile had been launched from the INS Arihant in the Bay of Bengal. The INS Arihant is India's first domestically built nuclear-powered submarine and went into full operation in 2018. Government officials did not provide details about the launch, such as exact location, type of missile and number of test-firings. Multiple Indian media outlets report this is the first time the government has officially announced an SLBM test by the submarine.
