Workspace Property Trust is in discussions about bringing a physical rehabilitation hospital to its Horsham business park as a continuation of its effort to develop a portion of the site as a health and wellness campus.

The site for the rehab hospital would be a vacant 62,000-square-foot building, last occupied in 2016 by Philidor, a specialty mail order pharmacy company, at 400 Lakeside Drive.

Officials at Florida-based Workspace Property Trust, which owns office parks in Horsham and Malvern, did not return calls seeking comment and it could not be determined who would operate the hospital.
