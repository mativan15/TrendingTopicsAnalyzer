Liz Truss has done many about-turns – on regional pay boards; corporation tax not rising; income tax being cut from 2023; the top rate being abolished. But far and away her biggest was announced immediately upon her becoming Prime Minister. Having stood on a platform of 'no handouts' in response to the energy crisis, relying instead on a mix of benefits rises, short-term tax cuts and allowing market forces such as wage rises to do their job, as soon as she became Prime Minister she abandoned that stance and instead announced an absolutely massive energy price package.
