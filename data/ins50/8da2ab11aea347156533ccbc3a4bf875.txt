I recently read your article in The Irish Times in relation to the Fair Deal scheme. My husband and I moved into his mother's home in October 2017 and rented out our home, which is still rented today. In March 2019, his mother gifted her house to him, gift tax was paid and he is now the sole owner of the property with his mother retaining a right of residence.The three of us still reside there together. I'm wondering, if his mother needed to go to a nursing home, what implications it would have in terms of the Fair Deal scheme?Ms D.
