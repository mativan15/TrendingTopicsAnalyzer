CM Punk shockingly, and tearfully, announced he was injured and needed surgery on AEW Rampage. Just days after winning the AEW Championship, Punk will have to undergo surgery for a leg injury prior to his first title defense. 'The get-back will be better than the setback,' proclaimed an emotional Punk, whose timetable for a return is currently unknown. CM Punk was previously set to face Hiroshi Tanahashi at the Forbidden Door pay-per-view later this month, but clearly those plans are off the table.
