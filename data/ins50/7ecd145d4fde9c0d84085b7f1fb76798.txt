(Bloomberg) -- The Communist Party's new list of Central Committee members saw a number of officials from local governments being promoted or added to the party's leadership, underlining the importance their experience could play in future policymaking, economists said. Some financial regulator-turned local government officials, like Yin Yong, a deputy party chief of Beijing, and Liu Guiping, a vice mayor of Tianjin, were promoted to be full or alternate members of the committee on Saturday. Both Yin and Liu used to be deputy governors of the PBOC.
