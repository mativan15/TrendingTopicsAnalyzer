How long is a TV episode? There used to be an answer to that question. As we shall see, there used to be a weirdly particular answer to that question. That may no longer be the case.The Bear is the best new series to land on streaming services this autumn. Telling the story of a top-flight chef who inherits what we would call a greasy spoon from his brother, the galloping Disney+ drama is edited in the sort of controlled frenzy you expect from the best action cinema. Set in Chicago, it has a singular sense of place.
