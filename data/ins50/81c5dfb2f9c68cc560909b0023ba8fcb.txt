Just a short drive from lakes and beaches in the New South Wales Great Lakes region lies a lush pocket of farming land. A 60-hectare property covered in 20-year-old native tea tree plants is among the farms in the area.For Allan and Jane Hutcherson, purchasing this property fulfilled a long-held dream. "We have a contract manufacturing business … and one of the things we always wanted to do was to create our own brand," Mr Hutcherson said.For almost three decades, the couple has been making soap for big companies in their factory in Sydney's Northern Beaches.
