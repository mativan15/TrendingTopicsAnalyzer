Justin Sullivan/Getty Images NewsHovnanian ((NYSE:HOV)(HOVNP)(OTCPK:HOVVD)) is clearly under the radar. It has only a $320 million market cap. No Wall Street analysts follow the stock. Only 3 analysts bothered to participate on its recent earnings conference call. Hovnanian is also under serious suspicion. The company just reiterated its EPS forecast for '22 of about $30. Yet the stock, at $56, is selling at only a 2 multiple of that estimate. Yes, a P/E of 2. Even for a homebuilder that is plain sad.
