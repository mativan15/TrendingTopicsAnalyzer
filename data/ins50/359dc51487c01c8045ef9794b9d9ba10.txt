Wikipedia has been forced to ask users to be more specific when searching for the UKgovernment's political crises.

The online encyclopedia added a disambiguation page for the phrase ‘2022 United Kingdom government crisis' on Wednesday, to distinguish between the scandal that forced out former prime minister Boris Johnson and the one that has now resulted in the resignation of Liz Truss.

Liz Truss became the shortest serving prime minister in history after announcing her resignation having clocked up just 44 full days in the role – a long way behind the next shortest premiership, that of Tory statesman George Canning, who spent 118 full days as PM in 1827 before dying in office from ill health.
