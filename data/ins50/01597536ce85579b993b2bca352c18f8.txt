Budget TV makers in 2022 are making things tougher than ever for premium brands to maintain mini-LED-backlit QLED TV market share. The reason for this basically comes down to price: companies like TCL and Hisense are selling 65-inch mini-LED-backlit models at under $1,000 / £880 / AU$1,600, while similar sets from Sony and Samsung can cost twice as much as that, if not more.Some of these premium mini-LED 4K sets rank high on our list of the best 4K TVs such as Samsung's flagship QN95B Neo QLED. But that same list also features the Hisense 65U8H, a new offering from the budget brand and its first model to use a mini-LED backlight.
