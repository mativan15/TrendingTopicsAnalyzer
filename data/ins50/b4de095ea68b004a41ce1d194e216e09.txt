May 27—Hundreds of pieces of handcrafted art and chalk drawings will be displayed during the 18th annual Righetti High School Art Show and Chalk Festival Wednesday and Thursday.

On both days, from 5 to 7 p.m., the public is invited to the show inside the gym, and to tour the chalk art on the ground. On Wednesday morning, student teams will be creating colorful chalk painting near the school's administration building.

"Our students are curating their best show for friends, family and community, and I am overjoyed with the quality of art completed this year," said Elesa Carlson, Righetti teacher and drama director.
