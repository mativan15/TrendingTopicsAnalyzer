 If you've been holding out for a new model of the iPad Pro then your wait might almost be over, as it looks likely that the iPad Pro 2022 line will be announced sometime today (October 18).That's according to Mark Gurman (opens in new tab), who has an excellent track record for Apple information, and while he's the only source specifically pointing to today, others suggest the launch should be imminent too.Multiple leakers have said that the iPad Pro 2022 will land in October, for example, and Gurman has also noted (opens in new tab) that most iPad Pro configurations are now out of stock at many Apple stores across the US; with shipping estimates slipping into November for some models online.
