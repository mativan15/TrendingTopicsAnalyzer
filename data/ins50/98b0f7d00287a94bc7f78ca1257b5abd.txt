At 4-2, the Jets are off to their best six-game start since 2015.

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Breece Hall, Quinnen Williams and the young New York Jets are making a convincing statement to the rest of the NFL.

They aren't the same old Jets who haven't reached the playoffs since the 2010 season, the league's longest active drought.

Hall ran for 116 yards, including a 34-yard touchdown, and Williams had two of New York's four sacks against Aaron Rodgers as the Jets won their third straight, 27-10 over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.
