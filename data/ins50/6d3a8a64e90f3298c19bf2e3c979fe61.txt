If you couldn't make it to San Francisco to attend TechCrunch Disrupt in person, the next is the next best thing. With it, you can access all the sessions that went down on the Disrupt stage, the TechCrunch+ stage along with select presentations from both the Discovery stage and breakout sessions — today, October 21 only!
You'll find all that content available as video on demand in the event app, which you can watch on your mobile or in-browser. Plus, you'll even find speed networking sessions in the app so you can connect with folks both near and far who align with your business goals.
