It's fair to ask why anyone would feel good about the stock market these days as investors grapple with inflation at 40-year highs, rising interest rates, a slowing economy, a cooling housing market, and a few international crises to boot. But Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research for Nationwide Funds, which manages $74 billion in assets, says that there's good reason for hope in the midst of all of that. His optimism stems from the fact that Wall Street always tends to overreact to good and bad news, and today the pessimism about the US economy is, to Hackett, nearly unanimous.
