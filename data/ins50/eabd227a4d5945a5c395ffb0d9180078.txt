Kum & Go is proposing to take the place of a car repair shop on 28th Street and Englewood Avenue SE. The company originally proposed replacing a Grand Rapids Big Boy restaurant but then pulled the proposal. The Grand Rapids Planning Commission is approving a special land use permit that would allow for the demolition of Extreme Car Audio to create the new business. The gas station would include six fuel pumps as well as a 24-hour convenience store that would stock food, basic groceries, beer and wine and coffee.
