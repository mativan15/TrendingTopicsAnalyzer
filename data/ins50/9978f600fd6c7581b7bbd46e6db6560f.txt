A Moscow court on Tuesday said it had fined Amazon four million rubles (US$65,000) for failing to remove banned content relating to drug use and suicide, the first such penalty in Russia for the U.S. tech giant.
Russia has fined other foreign tech firms for not removing content, part of what critics say is a campaign by the Kremlin to restrict the influence of western technology companies, especially since Moscow sent its armed forces into Ukraine.The Tagansky District Court said it had fined Amazon four million rubles in two separate cases, although its statement did not specify what these were.
