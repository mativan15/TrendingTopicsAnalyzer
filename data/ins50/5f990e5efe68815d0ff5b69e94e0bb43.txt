There's a decent chance you don't have a good handle on how much your subscriptions are really costing you.Consumers' offhand guess of how much they spend monthly on subscriptions averaged $86, according to a survey commissioned by market research firm C+R Research. Yet when asked about subscriptions in specific categories, the actual amount was $219 on average — $133 more than estimated."It's a slippery slope with subscriptions because it just happens automatically and you're not actively making that purchase every month," said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.
