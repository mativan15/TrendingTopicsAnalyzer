Amid a record-breaking heat wave, Texans need to be ready for even higher electric bills going into summer.

'Prices are higher and I expect that they will be much higher,' said Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy.

Over the past year in Texas, the average rate increased by 70%, from 10.6 cents to 18.4 cents per kilowatt hour.

'Those are outrageous prices historically for Texas,' Lewin said. 'We haven't seen prices like this in more than a decade at least.'

So if you're renewing your energy contract, you will likely see an significant increase in your rate.
