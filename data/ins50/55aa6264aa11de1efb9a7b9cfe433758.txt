A quick internet search will get you the carbon footprint of just about anything, whether it's a car, a flight or even a whole country.

But it's really hard to figure out the carbon emissions produced by logging.

In fact, the closest number the federal government publishes is actually below zero.

That's because, according to Ottawa, the forestry industry sucks more carbon out of the atmosphere than it emits.

This didn't sit right with the analysts at Nature Canada and the Natural Resources Defense Council, who decided that you can't address a problem you can't measure and set out to put a realistic number on logging industry emissions.
