Niall Horan's mother has leaped to her son' defence after complaints he was drinking alcohol on screen.
The former Direction star visited his hometown for new show Niall Horan's Homecoming: The Road to Mullingar with Lewis Capaldi – which is sponsored by Guinness – and Sunday's episode featured a scene where he apparently drank a pint at the local.
Some viewers have criticised the idea that the 20-year-old singer could have been enjoying a drink, and suggested he was setting a bad example to his younger fans.
