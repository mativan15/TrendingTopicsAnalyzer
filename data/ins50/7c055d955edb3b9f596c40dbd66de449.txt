For the second time in a week, Georgia senate candidate Herschel Walker flashed a badge and boasted about working with law enforcement, this time during an NBC News interview that aired Monday morning.

'This badge is from um... this badge. I have badges from all over the... all over Georgia, even from Chatham County,' the Republican contender replied in the NBC interview when asked who gave him the bronze star he carries in a black wallet.

The 60-year-old former NFL player flashed what appeared to be the same badge during a debate with Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock last Friday.
