New Zealand farmers took to the streets across the country in their tractors on Thursday to denounce Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's scheme to tax 'agricultural emissions,' including cow farts and burps. They argued that not only would the added costs put them out of business, they would increase - not reduce - greenhouse gas emissions.Farmers' advocacy group Groundswell New Zealand organized the protests in over 50 towns and cities, some filling the streets with dozens of tractors. 'Several hundred to a few thousand people' were predicted to join in, though media reports claimed turnout was underwhelming.
