The Tennessee Titans sit atop the AFC South after five games and their Week 6 bye and control their own destiny in terms of possibly winning the division for a third straight season.
Tennessee will have a golden opportunity to really put some space between themselves and the second-place Indianapolis Colts in Week 7, as the Titans look to sweep the Colts after beating them in Week 4 in Indy, 24-17.
