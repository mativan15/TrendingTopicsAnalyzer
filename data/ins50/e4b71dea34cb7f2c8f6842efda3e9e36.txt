The president of the Congress's Kerala unit, K Sudhakaran, has sparked a controversy by saying that political leaders from northern Kerala are 'honest, straightforward and courageous' in comparison to their counterparts from south Kerala. After receiving severe flak from the CPI(M), Sudhakaran withdrew the comment and tendered an apology.
In an interview to The New Indian Express published on Sunday, the MP from north Kerala's Kannur was asked if politicians from south Kerala were different from Malabar (North Kerala).
