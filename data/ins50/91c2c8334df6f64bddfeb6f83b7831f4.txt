Bullish sentiment, expectations that stock prices will rise over the next six months, rebounded by 12.2% to 32.0%. This is the highest level of optimism recorded since March 24, 2022 (32.8%). Even with the big increase, bullish sentiment remains below its historical average of 38.0% for the 28th consecutive week.
