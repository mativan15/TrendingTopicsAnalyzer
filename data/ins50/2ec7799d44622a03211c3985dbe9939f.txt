In recent weeks, we've worked on high-grading our portfolio to navigate this uncertain market: trim some losers — or exit a position entirely — and put that money to work in better companies that are on sale. Danaher (DHR) is the kind of stock that fits the high-grading bill. Remember: We want to own shares of companies that do things and make stuff for a profit and can return excess cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. It means focusing on companies with pricing power as their stock prices go lower.
