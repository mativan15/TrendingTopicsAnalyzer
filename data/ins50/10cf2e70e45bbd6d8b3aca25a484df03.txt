Published: 01:56 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 01:56 EDT, 16 October 2022 Steven Gerrard has fired back at his Aston Villa critics as he battles to reach his first anniversary in charge.The Villa boss launched a passionate defence of his 11-month reign in the wake of growing discontent from fans who fear the club of treading water under the former England skipper.Gerrard's side are unbeaten in four games and remain in the Carabao Cup. But they have just two Premier League wins this season, and came in for flak after a lacklustre display in the hugely disappointing 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest on the back of a frustrating stalemate against 10-man Leeds.
