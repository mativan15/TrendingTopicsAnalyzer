Never mind the empty former Barneys building, the long-vacant Times Square corner of 701 Broadway at West 47th Street and all those other dark storefronts. Manhattan's pandemic-battered retail leasing market has at last turned a corner, according to a cheery new third-quarter report from CBRE.  
The 'turning point' included such improved metrics as an average asking-rent uptick (2.2%) over the previous quarter, a significant barometer of landlord confidence and the first such rise since the fourth quarter of 2016; and a 5% decline in the number of direct-lease ground-floor availabilities in 16 prime corridors tracked by CBRE.
