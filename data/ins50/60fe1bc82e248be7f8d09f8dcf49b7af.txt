Kolkata: Trinamool Congress MLA Saokat Molla on Friday failed to appear before the CBI in connection with an investigation into a coal mining scam, an officer of the agency said. The Canning Purba legislator claimed that he had a few prior engagements because of which he could not appear before the agency sleuths for questioning. "Molla has mailed to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday night expressing his inability to appear before the agency's sleuths on Friday and sought at least 15 days time for being available for questioning," the officer told PTI.
