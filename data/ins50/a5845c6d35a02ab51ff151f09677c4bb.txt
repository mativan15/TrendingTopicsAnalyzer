Luke Chan Summary I recommend a BUY rating on First Watch (NASDAQ:FWRG). It has a brand that is well loved by its customer base and rides on the trend of increasing demand for daypart meals. Management has committed to continue growing with more than 2 thousand locations identified. The current valuation is cheap, in my opinion, which could generate a long-term 17% IRR for investors. Company overview FWRG has brought excellent and freshly made food to the tables of various people living in the United States since 1983.
