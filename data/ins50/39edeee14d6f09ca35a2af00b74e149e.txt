My previous update for Kuaishou was written on September 14, 2021, where I touched on the company's new foreign market penetration and the significant fluctuations in its share price between June and September 2021. This latest article reviews Kuaishou's most recent quarterly financial performance. I come to the conclusion that the company's Q1 2022 performance is mixed, and I have decided to maintain my Hold rating for Kuaishou.
