It's a Saturday morning in mid-October, and the countdown to Election Day is on. Audrey Henson and Lindsay Cross aren't wasting any time.

The two candidates vying to represent Florida House District 60, which includes downtown St. Petersburg and portions of Pinellas Park, gather with their teams before setting out to knock on doors.

Cross, 44, who is the Democratic nominee, checks in with volunteers at St. Petersburg's Woodlawn Park.

Henson, 32 and the Republican nominee, joins her team outside a Pinellas Park donut shop.
