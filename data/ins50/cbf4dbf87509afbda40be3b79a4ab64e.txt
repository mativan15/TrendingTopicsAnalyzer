CHENNAI: The housing and urban development department has directed the owners of 216 flats of LIC Jeevan Bhima Nagar apartment complex in Anna Nagar, to whom Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) issued lock, seal and demolition notices last year, to restore the CMDA-sanctioned plan. The violation of building norms at the complex became known after a litigation by LIC in 2011. While approval was for a group development comprising 944 dwelling units spread over 59 blocks in 1994, deviations proliferated in 28 blocks, with constuctions added illegally.
