Frank Ladson Jr. officially became a nominee for the national Comeback Player of the Year Award this week and the wide receiver built his case Saturday with his best performance yet as a Miami Hurricane.

Ladson caught five passes for 58 yards and a touchdown in Miami's 20-14 win against the Virginia Tech Hokies, and his touchdown in the opening three minutes set the tone for the Hurricanes in Blacksburg, Virginia.

'Frank played a good game,' quarterback Tyler Van Dyke said.
