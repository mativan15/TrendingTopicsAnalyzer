Southland state Sen. Emil Jones III is raking in campaign cash while he awaits trial on federal charges of accepting bribes and lying to authorities about his role in a red-light camera corruption scandal.

Jones, a Chicago Democrat, has resisted calls from Gov. J.B. Pritzker and others to resign the state Senate seat he has held since 2009. He is running unopposed in the Nov. 8 election and has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges.

Generous donors seem eager to stuff more cash into the state lawmaker's pockets despite widespread publicity about the criminal charges.
