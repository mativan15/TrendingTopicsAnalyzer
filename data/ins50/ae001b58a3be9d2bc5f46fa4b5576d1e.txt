Struggling families on free school meals say help available over half term is a 'drop in the ocean' as inflation hits a 40 year high. Many low-income families will receive vouchers during the October break, but parents and unions say at £15 per child it just isn't enough to match soaring food prices. And due to a postcode lottery, others will either get less help or none at all. 'Frankly, £3 a day for a hot meal is not going to stretch very far, particularly in light of rising food prices,' James Bowen from the NAHT education union said.
