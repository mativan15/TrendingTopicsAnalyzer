Franklin
County has been awarded over 400 thousand dollars from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to improve health care facilities in rural towns. The
funding is being made available through the American Rescue Plan Act. $258,500
will be used by Weems Memorial Hospital to purchase radiology equipment to
include a digital mammography and an echo ultrasound machine. The
money will also allow the hospital to move and install an existing computed
tomography scan machine from a mobile unit to a permanent location within the
hospital building.
