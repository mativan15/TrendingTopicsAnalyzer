The Indian telecom operator Reliance Jio has awarded the Finnish company Nokia a multi-year contract to develop one of the biggest 5G networks ever on Monday. According to the agreement, Nokia will deliver equipment from its AirScale portfolio, including base stations, high-capacity 5G Massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output) antennas, Remote Radio Heads (RRH) to support varied frequency bands, and self-organizing network software.

Reliance Jio intends to establish a 5G independent network that will interwork with its 4G network.
