sanfel/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Walmart (NYSE:WMT) announced plans to build four new high-tech fulfillment centers, one of which will be located in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, one in Joliet, Illinois and one in McCordsville, Indiana. All the facilities are scheduled to open during summer 2022 to 2024. The fulfillment center will implement state-of-the-art automation technology for customers and members with access to next- or two-day shipping on more items than ever before. "Through our automated storage system and patent-pending five step process, we'll not only provide increased comfort for associates but also double the storage capacity and double the number of customer orders we're able to fulfill in a day," SVP, Automation, and innovation David Guggina commented.
