Snoop Dogg won't be bringing his doggy style to Australia later this year as planned. 
The hip-hop legend was booked for an arena tour Down Under this October and November, though all dates are postponed 'due to unforeseen circumstances, family obligations and filming commitments,' reads a statement issued Monday (May 30) by TEG MJR.
The concerts company is said to be working closely with Snoop's team on new dates, 'which is looking likely' to be February 2023.
'While we understand the disappointment with these shows moving back to 2023,' the statement continues, 'we also respect Snoop's decision and can't wait to have the God Father of Rap finally back on Australian shores.
