SoundMagic E11C review

Founded in 2005, a relative flash in the pan compared to many audio companies, SoundMagic has risen from obscurity to boasting multiple-Award winners, most notably with its budget in-ear headphone range.

And the SoundMagic E11C headphones are another pair that has gained a multitude of plaudits. They actually launched in 2018, but we're happy to report they're still pretty magic by in-ear standards at this kind of money.

Clearly not scared of spicing up a winning recipe, the SoundMagic E11C earbuds have an updated driver, which promises improvements to the sound, and a new, silver-plated copper cable.
