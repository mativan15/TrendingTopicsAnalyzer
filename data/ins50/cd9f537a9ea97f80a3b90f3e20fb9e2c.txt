A "beta test" of the application for student loan relief went live on Friday evening, launching the Biden administration's sweeping program to cancel student debt for tens of millions of Americans. The Department of Education's test application is a long-awaited first step of the policy announced in late August, allowing people with federal student loans to apply for up to $20,000 of debt relief, depending on what kind of financial aid they received and how much money they make. During the beta testing period, according to a department spokesperson, borrowers will be able to submit applications for the student debt relief program and won't need to reapply if they submit their application during the beta test.
