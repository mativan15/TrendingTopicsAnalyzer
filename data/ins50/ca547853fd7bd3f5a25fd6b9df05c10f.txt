Jesse Marsch said he is currently experiencing his toughest spell in football and called on Leeds fans to stick by him and the team.There were boos from supporters at the end of each half in Thursday's defeat by Leicester, with some chanting Marcelo Bielsa's name.W﻿hen asked about this, Marsch said: "I think it does impact the players. If it's fair or not it doesn't really matter, they can express their opinion however they want."The only one I really heard that was bad was for Marcelo Bielsa and I'm OK with that, I'm OK with the fact that Marcelo is a club legend.
