Snoring may seem like an innocent side effect of standard fatigue, but it may also indicate long-term health issues such as sleep apnea and heart abnormalities. Unfortunately, we can't consciously stop ourselves from snoring, and the racket could affect partners, roommates and anyone else sleeping around us.
Devices like the Fitbit can help monitor your snoring, but if you're looking for practical intervention, an anti-snoring sleep mask like the Hupnos could help. It's on sale for $95 and uses a gentle buzz to keep your nighttime breathing under control.
