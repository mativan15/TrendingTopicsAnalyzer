The Washington Wizards are hosting their first pre-draft workout on Wednesday, and two former Terrapins are on the list of invites.  Guards Eric Ayala and Darryl Morsell are two of the six players who will be at the workout Wednesday. The other players are Richmond's Grant Golden, George Mason's D'Shawn Schwartz, Florida's Anthony Duruji and Utah State's Brandon Horvath.  All six players have local ties. None of them are likely on the team's radar at No. 10 overall, but they could be when the Wizards are up in the second round with the 54th pick.
