Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has topped the list of the most highly compensated CEOs on the Fortune 500 in 2021. After Musk, the 10 most highly compensated Fortune 500 CEOs of 2021 are all tech and biotech CEOs, including the heads of Apple (Tim Cook), Netflix (Reed Hastings), and Microsoft (Satya Nadella).

In 2021, Musk "realised" compensation worth almost $23.5 billion, from exercising some Tesla stock options awarded in a 2018 multiyear "moonshot" grant. That was - by far - the biggest CEO payday in 2021, according to Fortune.
