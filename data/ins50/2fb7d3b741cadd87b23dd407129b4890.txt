The inflation relief payments range from $200-$1,050 and taxpayers who qualify will either get that money through direct deposits or the debit cards depending on how they filed their taxes in 2020. According to KTLA 5, the first group of people who are receiving the relief payments will be getting the money between October 7th and October 25th.
