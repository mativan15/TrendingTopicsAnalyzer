An attempt to make a right-wing superhero movie has ended in disaster, with $1 million missing in China and a participant facing a federal indictment.'I wouldn't count on us getting the money back,' Theodore Beale, a far-right blogger known as 'Vox Day,' admitted to his fans and investors in a video last week.This isn't how Beale's followers thought their investments would go in 2019, when they started contributing to fund a film based on a Confederacy-themed superhero comic book character created by Beale.
