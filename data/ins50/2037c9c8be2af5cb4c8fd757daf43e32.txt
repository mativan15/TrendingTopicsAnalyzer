Funding for a school Shakespeare competition will continue, after Creative New Zealand initially decided to can it. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the Ministry of Education would step in to pick up the bill. Creative NZ was accused of 'cancelling' the Bard after declining the $31,000 funding proposal for the Shakespeare Globe Centre of New Zealand, which has run Shakespeare competitions for over 30 years. The issue prompted international headlines after a Creative NZ assessor claimed Shakespeare was 'locked within a canon of imperialism' and his work was not relevant to 'the contemporary art context of Aotearoa'.
