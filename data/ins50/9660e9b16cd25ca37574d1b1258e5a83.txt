In June, a popular TikToker bought a billboard in Utah to show his love for the rock band Weezer. Months later, another billboard popped up with a response.

Weezer, an American band formed in the 1990s out of Los Angeles, is known for its songs such as 'Say It Ain't So' and 'Buddy Holly.' The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards and won one, according to IMDB.

Cory Winn, a TikToker with 2.1 million followers, teamed with his business partners at his co-founded clothing company, Lucca International, to show support for the rock band, according to The Salt Lake Tribune.
