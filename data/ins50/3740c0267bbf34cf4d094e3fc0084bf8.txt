Matt LaFleur had been a perfect 10-0 coming off a regular season loss. That streak is over. The Packers were 24-2 at Lambeau Field under LaFleur. They're now 24-3. LaFleur's Green Bay Packers are a mess. And Sunday was further proof.
The Packers dropped their second straight game, falling to the New York Jets, 27-10, at Lambeau Field. Green Bay is now 3-3 and trails first place Minnesota (5-1) by two games in the NFC North.
