Rajasthan Chief Minister and senior supervisor of Congress party for Gujarat Assembly elections, Ashok Gehlot, on Tuesday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his frequent visits to Gujarat and alleged that work in Delhi is suffering due to more focus on his home state.
He also took a dig at the PM saying that a camp office of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) should be set up in Gujarat so that the works go on smoothly.
Addressing a press conference at the Gujarat Congress headquarters, Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan, Gehlot said, 'The manner in which the Prime Minister is coming frequently… The very next day after winning Uttar Pradesh elections, he came to Gujarat and has been coming continuously.
