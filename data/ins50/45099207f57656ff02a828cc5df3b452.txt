Oct. 15—The walking path around the H. Odell Weeks Activities Center was more crowded than usual Saturday morning.

Around 300 people walked around the one-mile path twice beginning shortly after 10 a.m. as part of the Aiken Walk to End Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia — the Alzheimer's Association says the disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases — and around 6.5 million Americans over 65 (one in nine) have the disease.

There is currently no cure but one treatment, Aduhelm, has been shown that removing amyloid is reasonably likely to reduce the cognitive and functional declines of people in early stages of the disease.
