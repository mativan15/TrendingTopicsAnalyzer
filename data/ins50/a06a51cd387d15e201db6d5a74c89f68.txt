The fight to raise awareness of human rights abuses in Iran is gaining momentum in Orange County, as a local demonstration united under the rallying cry, 'Women, Life, Freedom' drew protesters Friday to Costa Mesa City Hall.

A crowd of more than 50 people assembled along Fair Drive Friday evening, as individuals waved red, white and green flags and held posters urging for a 'Free Iran.'

The events follow the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iranian authorities. Amini had been detained three days earlier by the nation's 'morality police' for the alleged improper wearing of a hijab, or head covering, as required by law.
