Chief of Defence Staff, General Anil Chauhan, on October 20, attended the Def-Expo 2022. While addressing the event, he talked about India's self-reliance in the defence sector. He said, 'No country can aspire to emerge stronger without achieving self-reliance in defence, research and development, and manufacturing. The ongoing war in Ukraine, heightened tensions around the Taiwan straits, and growing instability post-withdrawal of the US in the Af-Pak region has highlighted the fragile nature of regional and global security.
