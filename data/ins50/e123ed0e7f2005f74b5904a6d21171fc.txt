A shared working space in the heart of New Plymouth is opening a second branch – in Auckland. Johnson Corner provides open-plan desks and two private boardrooms for members in premises on the corner of Devon St West and Brougham St. Owners Adnan and Elle Belushi opened the doors in 2018 and have been looking at expanding to the country's largest city ever since. On Wednesday, after 18 months of preparation, they will open the doors of their South Auckland office in the Highbrook Business Park in East Tāmaki, and are hoping to take Taranaki businesses with them.
