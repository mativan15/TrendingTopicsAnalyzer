Supermarket giant Woolworths has announced a major change to its fruit and vegetables section that promises to bring customers an enhanced shopping experience.

The retailer has teamed up with Sydney-based company Tiliter to introduce Artificially Intelligent Scales in its stores across Australia.

The new, more accessible scales, which are currently being tested in a handful of stores nationwide, will eventually replace all analogue scales in Woolworths stores across the country sometime within the next year, Woolworths Media Relations Specialist Nathan Farebrother told Yahoo News.
