Just over three weeks ago, then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled his tax-cutting mini-budget to MPs which caused economic turmoil in the UK.Following a dramatic U-turn on a promise to abolish the 45% higher rate of income tax after backlash from the government's own Conservative MPs earlier this month, Mr Kwarteng has now been sacked - and many of the other pledges in the mini-budget have been torn up.
On Friday, the government scrapped its decision to axe the rise in corporation tax to 25% next year.
