The sum of $400,000,000 was taken from the Public Works fund and turned over to the Federal Relief Administration with the expectation that four million unemployed men and women would be put to work at once.A few days after announcement of the new plan, the governors, mayors, and relief administrators of all the states met at Washington to hear the glad tidings.
