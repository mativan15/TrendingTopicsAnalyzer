Crime analysts in Victoria say one or more thieves are targeting spas and hair salons in the city, with at least nine such break-ins reported in the past two months. Police are warning spa and salon operators that laptop computers, cash, cameras, stereo equipment and Dyson hair tools have been sought in the crimes. Investigators say more than $10,000 in losses have been reported since Aug. 31, when a break-in damaged the front door of a salon in the 700-block of Bay Street. Eight break-ins and thefts have been reported at similar businesses in downtown Victoria since, police said in a statement Friday.
