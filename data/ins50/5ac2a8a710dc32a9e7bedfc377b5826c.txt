Southeast Asia and Latin America are strong growth regions for Mastercard after its withdrawal from Russia in March and India's 2021 ban on it from issuing new cards, the company's co-president for international markets said."Southeast Asia is exciting [due to] the right demographics, the adoption of technology and digitisation, and governments' focus on financial inclusion," Ling Hai told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that countries in the region would also benefit as supply chains shift away from China.
