It's increasingly looking like the New Orleans Saints will be on the hunt for a quarterback again in 2023. Jameis Winston has played too much mistake-prone football and missed too much time with injuries to be a viable long-term solution, and Andy Dalton isn't long for New Orleans either as he approaches his 35th birthday. Taysom Hill's days as a full-time quarterback are behind him. It'll be hard for the Saints to get their guy without a first round pick next year, but it's not impossible.
Yahoo! Sports columnist Charles McDonald shared his take on the 2023 draft class, with an interesting pick for the Saints: Tennessee Volunteers quarterback Hendon Hooker.
