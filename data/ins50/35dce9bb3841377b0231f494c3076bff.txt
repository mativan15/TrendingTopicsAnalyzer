Despite all that has happened in the past two years following his drubbing at the polls, Donald Trump remains the frontrunner in the presidential sweepstakes of 2024 with the Republican Party firmly in his control. In the mid-term elections scheduled in November, most of the Republican candidates running for the Upper and Lower Houses of Congress are vocal Trump supporters. The few Republican politicians who dared to oppose him are now in the political wilderness.Liz Cheney and the handful of Republican congressional and Senate members who voted for the impeachment motion brought by the Democrats against Trump for 'incitement of insurrection' have either retired from politics or were defeated in the primaries held this year.
