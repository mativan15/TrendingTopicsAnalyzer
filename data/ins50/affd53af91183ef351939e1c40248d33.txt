Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has admitted she failed to recognize last year just how big a problem inflation would become, when she dismissed it as a small and manageable risk.The former Federal Reserve chair on Tuesday discussed the challenge facing the US central bank right now, as it tries to tame inflation running at 40-year highs. "I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take," she said, when shown clips of her downplaying inflation risks on CNN's "The Situation Room".
