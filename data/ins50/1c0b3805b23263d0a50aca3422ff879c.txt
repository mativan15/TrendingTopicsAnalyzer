You never want to label a free agent signing a bust after only six games, but Los Angeles Chargers cornerback J.C. Jackson isn't giving fans many reasons for hope.

The Chargers signed Jackson, a Pro Bowler last year with the New England Patriots, to a five-year, $82.5 million deal last offseason. So far, the move has not gone as planned, and the situation hit its nadir during "Monday Night Football."

Jackson was benched midway through a win over the Denver Broncos after allowing a 39-yard touchdown on a busted coverage and getting beat on 47-yard catch, not to mention a defensive pass interference penalty on his first series.
