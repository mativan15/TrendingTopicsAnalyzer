DETROIT —

Phillip Danault scored 1:12 into overtime for his second goal of the game, and the Kings handed the Detroit Red Wings their first loss with a 5-4 victory on Monday night.

Danault's winning shot in front hit a defender's skate and bounced into the net.

Anze Kopitar had a goal and an assist, giving him 47 points in 42 games against Detroit. That's the second-most among active players, trailing only Chicago star Patrick Kane at 56 points.

Adrian Kempe supplied his fourth goal and assisted on Kopitar's goal.
