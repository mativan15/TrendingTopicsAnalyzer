This may sound odd, but I was reminded while reading Ben Bernanke's recent book on Fed history that we've actually been through "quantitative tightening," or QT, before, from 2017 through 2019. With everything else going on at the time--Trump's trade wars and tariffs, the Fed's pivot from rate hikes to rate cuts, the longest government shutdown in history--the Fed's balance sheet was hardly a big talking point.   This, of course, was what Fed officials wanted; that the process of shrinking the balance sheet by letting securities mature and passively run off each month would be "as exciting as watching paint dry," as Fed member Patrick Harker said at the time.
