THE decade between 1861 and 1871 had for the South every quality of classic tragedy — the passion, superhuman effort, and exaltation, followed by disillusionment, defeat, and a final chaos that seemed the irretrievable destruction of a civilization. This period forms the background of Gone with the Wind, the very title of which, taken from Clarence Mangan's dirge, expresses what many Southerners thought and many still think was the passing of something beautiful and good. By limiting her story to that decade and to a small territory in northern Georgia, Miss Mitchell is able to make use of the excitements, suspense, and horror of the war, culminating in Sherman's march, as it affected a group of families of Atlanta and the surrounding country, and of the ensuing oppression and degradation of the same people during the Reconstruction.
