When James Bendon started developing a video game about farming in Australia, complete with giant wombats and fire-breathing Tasmanian devils, he never dreamt it would be so successful."It's sold over 250,000 copies [since July], which is above and beyond my expectation, I still can't believe it," Mr Bendon said."I always enjoyed farming games and I wanted to make one that felt like the little bush town I grew up in ... and, yeah, the response has been amazing."Not bad for a game that hasn't been officially released and is only available via early access — a funding model that allows consumers to pay and play a game while it's being developed.
