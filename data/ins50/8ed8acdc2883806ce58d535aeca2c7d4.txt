JustCall is targeted at companies who speak directly with customers, so its main focus is voice calling with a more recent emphasis on messaging, too. Its lack of video conferencing tools renders it pretty poor for internal communication purposes, as there are much better platforms for collaborating. The entire experience is slick and easy to use, and it's clear that the company has the future in mind when designing its tools. While plenty of other companies can offer similar propositions, not as many can pull it off with such a clean design.
