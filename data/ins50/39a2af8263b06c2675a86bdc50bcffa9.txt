Get On My Level, Canada's biggest gaming event for the popular game series Super Smash Bros., has returned in 2022 as an in-person tournament. The mega gaming event had its previous editions in 2020 and 2021, but they were held online due to the Covid-19 scare. As the tournament is going for an in-person version this year, excitement and anticipation will surely go on a high trajectory. The tournament, Get On My Level 2022, will comprise both the categories - singles and doubles - and will be organised at Toronto's Sheraton Centre Hotel.
