Over 89,000 commuters have travelled in Delhi's electric buses since they were flagged off by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, an official statement said on Friday. The chief Minister had flagged off 150 e-buses on May 24. The Delhi government had announced free travel for everyone in the e-buses from May 24 to 26 to promote clean mobility. A total of 89,801 passengers rode on e-buses, out of which 51.73 per cent were men. The bus staff accounted for 7.31 per cent of the figure. On May 25, the next day after the flag off, Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot travelled in an electric bus and interacted with the passengers travelling in the bus about this new initiative, the statement said.
