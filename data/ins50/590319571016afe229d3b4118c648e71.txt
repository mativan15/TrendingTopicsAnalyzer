Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date.
