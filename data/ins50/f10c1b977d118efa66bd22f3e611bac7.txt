Terming the investigation conducted by the city police as shoddy, the High Court of Karnataka has ordered further probe into a complaint by a woman that her husband had sexually abused her by forcing her into unnatural sex and circulating her obscene pictures to her father and some friends. The court found that the charge sheet filed by the Viveknagar police in 2019 was silent on serious allegations of forced unnatural sex and circulation of obscene pictures as the police had invoked only the Section 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused-husband.
