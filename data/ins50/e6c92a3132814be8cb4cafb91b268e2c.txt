As of Friday morning, the Lions still do not have a kicker on the active 53-man roster. There are two kickers on the practice squad, Michael Badgley and Sam Ficken.
Neither has appeared for the Lions. Badgley was active as a game-day elevation in Week 5 but never got a chance to kick an extra point or field goal, and punter Jack Fox handled Detroit's one kickoff. Badgley's lack of activity was directly related to a lack of confidence in the kicking game by head coach Dan Campbell.
