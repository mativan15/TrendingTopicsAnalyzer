By Max Colchester LONDON--New U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will make a statement later Monday on new public spending and tax policies as he looks to reassure markets spooked by Prime Minister Liz Truss's previous tax cutting plan. The statement is expected to see more details of which taxes will rise and where spending cuts will be made to try and put the U.K.'s finances on a stronger footing. It will likely see further U-turns on measures announced by former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng just last month, which saw government borrowing costs to move sharply higher.
