The Russian navy on Saturday conducted another test of a prospective hypersonic missile -- a demonstration of the military's long-range strike capability amid the fighting in Ukraine. The Defence Ministry said the Admiral Gorshkov frigate of the Northern Fleet in the White Sea launched the Zircon cruise missile in the Barents Sea, successfully hitting a practice target in the White Sea about 1,000 kilometres away.The launch was the latest in a series of tests of Zircon, which is set to enter service later this year.
