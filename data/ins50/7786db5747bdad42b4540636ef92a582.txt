Anti-Israel fervorI find it rather odd that of all the countries in the world, the budding law scholars and faculty of the City University of New York School of Law seem to always be focused on 'alleged' civil-rights violations perpetrated by Israel ('CUNY Law Has an Anti-Israel Problem,' Mark Edelman, May 31).While Israel is certainly not above criticism, why is it always the focus of such rancor, at least at CUNY Law School? Are there not issues involving war, genocide, slavery, oppression of minorities and women, etc.
