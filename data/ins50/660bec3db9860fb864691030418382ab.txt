TAMPA -- Tampa's Mayor makes Juneteenth a holiday for city workers. Mayor Jane Castor signed an executive order Friday, designating the holiday honoring the end of slavery. City Councilman Orlando Gudes launched the request to make Juneteenth a paid holiday. It was a response to community leaders including Pastor Philetha Tucker Jackson. There was no real opposition to extending the federal holiday passed in 2021 to the city level. It was all a question of making the money work. Speakers thanked the city's financial staff for balancing out dollars and cents.
