The markets welcomed the appointment of US activist investor Nelson Peltz to the board of Unilever on Tuesday as analysts speculated it could bring a shake-up at the consumer giant.

The maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise among others, said that Mr Peltz would join the board after the firm he runs took a stake worth tens of millions.

He was credited with bringing a strong hand to Procter & Gamble, the US consumer goods giant where he was chairman until last year.
