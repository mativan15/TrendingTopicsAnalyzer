As if the news surrounding British politics couldn't get any more outlandish this week, Jeremy Vine has only gone and eaten the famous lettuce that outlasted Liz Truss as Prime Minister.
That's a sentence that just a week ago we never thought we'd ever hear ourselves saying.
For context – in case you've somehow missed the tale of this legendary vegetable – several days ago, the Daily Star set up a live cam of a lettuce to see whether or not it could last longer than Ms Truss in No 10 Downing Street.
