The goal of air taxis is simple: fly above vehicle traffic to the office, dinner, or airport.

The Wisk Gen6 has a top speed of 138 mph and a range of 90 miles.

The WiFi-enabled air taxi has mobile device charging docks and cup holders.

The race is on to see which air taxi will be the first to market and Boeing's Wisk hopes to cross the finish line first ahead of Uber, Airbus, Honda, and a host of other competitors.
