Picture a US business school in the 1950s.You might imagine imposing brick buildings with men, mostly white, mostly affluent, flowing through the hallways.

But there you'd be wrong.Women did attend business schools well before these institutions became official co-ed spaces, just not in the way you might expect.Four years ago, Allison Louise Elias, a gender historian and assistant professor at University of Virginia Darden School of Business learned that women were welcomed into business schools as the wives of businessmen enrolled in then-new executive business programs—short, intensive courses for men aspiring to leadership positions.
