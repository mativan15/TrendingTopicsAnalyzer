But Mayweather Promotions, established by the American boxing legend, have allegedly contacted the Brit and ordered him to stay away from one of their most valuable commodities. 'I got a letter from Mayweather Promotions telling me to stop talking about him because he is under contract to Mayweather Promotions,' Hearn told Thaboxingvoice's YouTube channel.'If he is, so be it, how long he is for I don't know. But we would never interfere with a fighter under contract.' However, Hearn is a big fan of the 27-year-old and has not ruled out making a move for him in the future.
