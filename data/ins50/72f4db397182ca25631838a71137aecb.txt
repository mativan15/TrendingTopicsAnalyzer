A Hughson resident and business owner faces charges of embezzlement and grand theft for allegedly stealing nearly $200,000 from several nonprofit foundations in Oakdale.

In a news release, the city's Police Department said Lana Casey, who served as a board member and signer for the nonprofits, was arrested Wednesday.

In June, the OPD's Investigations Unit was alerted to the thefts by several board members who discovered that money was missing from their foundations' accounts.

Police investigators issued a search warrant for Casey's bank accounts and discovered that dozens of checks from the organizations were deposited to her account, the news release says.
