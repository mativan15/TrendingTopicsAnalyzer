By Denny Jacob PWP Forward Acquisition Corp. I on Monday said it has filed a preliminary proxy statement to seek shareholder approval to redeem all its outstanding public shares and liquidate before the end of the year, ahead of its automatic termination date. The blank check company said it determined that it is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders to liquidate the company early as it doesn't believe it will complete an initial business combination by March 12, 2023, citing factors such as the overall decline in the special-purpose acquisition company market.
