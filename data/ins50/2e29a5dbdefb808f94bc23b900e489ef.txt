The largest floating solar park outside of Asia has 73 000 solar panels, 13 transformers and 338 inverters. It was built last year on an 18-hectare artificial lake close to Zwolle in the Netherlands. It's part of the high-tech eco-revolution sitting in the heart of nature.This floating solar park produces 6 percent of Zwolle's energy needs. The project to create it was led by BayWa r.e, a European provider of solar energy. The German company operates worldwide and looks for renewable energy solutions that can make use of otherwise untapped resources, just like the artificial lake in the Netherlands.
