Oct. 15—BLUEFIELD — With the manufacturing workforce aging and skilled workers becoming more difficult to find in that and other industries, an initiative is under way to fill that gap as well as make sure this area has a labor force ready.

Jim Spencer, the City of Bluefieid's director of economic and community development as well as director of the Bluefield Economic Development Authority (BEDA), told City Board members Tuesday the labor force shortage has worsened in recent years.

"Fast food restaurants are offering signup bonuses," he said, and advanced manufacturing job openings are increasing.
