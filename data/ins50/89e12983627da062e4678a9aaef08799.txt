The Nova Scotia government says it has identified 37 sites from its provincial land inventory that could be used to build housing, including affordable housing, for thousands of residents. In a news release Tuesday, the province says five of the 37 sites -- in Windsor, Springhill and Liverpool -- are ready for proposals. The province says work is still being done on 31 of the sites to ensure they are suitable for housing. Once the work is approved, the lands will be made available for proposals. "I made a commitment to Nova Scotians to identify provincial land to create more housing stock and these sites represent a potential future home for thousands of people," said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister John Lohr.
