Uber has launched its global advertising unit with the goal of creating a $1bn business within the next two years by displaying promotions within its apps, on top of cars and on the back of seats.The division, led by former Amazon advertising executive Mark Grether, was formed earlier this year to build on its current ad business, which mostly consists of ads within its Uber Eats app, as well as car-top billboards in a few markets.Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has said the company was targeting $1bn in gross ad bookings by 2024, on an annualised basis.
