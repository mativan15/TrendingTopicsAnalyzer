Universal Parks & Resorts' latest patent appears to be a way for guests to express themselves better in a world where the Covid-19 pandemic has hidden faces behind masks.

Why this matters: Theme park technology can provide the region opportunities for partnerships, manufacturing and advancements. Improvements at theme parks also raise the experience for tourists and can result in return visitation to Orlando.

The patent, dubbed Interactive Wearable Devices and Facial Coverings, describes wearable technology such as face masks that can have displays for users to share personal requests to others.
