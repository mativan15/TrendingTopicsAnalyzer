The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned National Conference president Farooq Abdullah in connection with its probe in a money laundering case, people familiar with the development said. Abdullah reached the ED office at Rajbagh in Srinagar around 11 am amid tight security. Before going inside the office, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister linked his questioning with the forthcoming assembly elections in the Union territory. 'This will go on till elections are held in Jammu and Kashmir… we will be harassed like this,' Abdullah told reporters.
