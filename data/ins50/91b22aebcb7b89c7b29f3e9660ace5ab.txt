Ricky Gervais appears to have given his two cents in regards to the newest drama surrounding James Corden.
The Gavin and Stacey star was in the spotlight this week for a less-than-desirable reason, as he was banned from a New York restaurant for allegedly being ‘nasty' to waiting staff.
James reportedly apologised to the owner after news of his behaviour went viral, and he has since been unbanned – but social media doesn't forget easily, and the actor has been the subject of countless jibes over the past few days, including from Ryanair.
