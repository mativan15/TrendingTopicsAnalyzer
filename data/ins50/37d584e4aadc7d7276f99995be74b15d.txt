Former Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said 'Cut me a cheque and I'll be out of here,' in the week before his high-profile resignation at the height of the so-called "Freedom Convoy," councillor Diane Deans told the public inquiry examining the use of the Emergencies Act on Wednesday. Deans, who was ousted from her role as chair of the Ottawa Police Services Board, also revealed she has a recording of her speaking with Mayor Jim Watson during that time. The recording was only submitted to the Public Order Emergency Commission Wednesday and there will have to be a ruling before it's played in public.
