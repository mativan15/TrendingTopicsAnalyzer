Week 7 in the NFL features several teams looking to continue their recent success as underdogs.

As a surprise to most, the New York Giants are 4-0, making the team an outright underdog this season.

And for the first time all season, San Francisco might not be the pick to win against the Chiefs, but with the surprising pickup of Christian McCaffrey, things could soon change for the 49ers.

The biggest underdog to win outright this season came last week when the Pittsburgh Steelers upset Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
