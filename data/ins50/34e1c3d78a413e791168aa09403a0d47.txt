The lettuce has won.

A 68-cent head of iceberg lettuce outlasted British Prime Minister Liz Truss's tenure in the top post after the leader's economic plan plunged the U.K. into chaos.

British tabloid The Daily Star late last week began a livestream of the lettuce and a picture of Truss on a table, to determine who would wither first: the produce or Truss's time as prime minister.

Truss announced her resignation on Thursday, and the lettuce claimed victory over the conservative politician, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in U.
