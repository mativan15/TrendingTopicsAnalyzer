Oct. 15—BISMARCK — The race for North Dakota's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives has shaken out to be between an incumbent Republican representative and an independent political newcomer.

Incumbent Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong and independent candidate Cara Mund are competing for the single, at-large seat in the House. Armstrong, from Dickinson, North Dakota, is running for his third term in office. Mund, a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, launched her campaign to become North Dakota's first female representative in August.
