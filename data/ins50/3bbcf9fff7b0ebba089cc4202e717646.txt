It was 'unethical' for Sinn Féin to accept more than €3m from an English donor, an Oireachtas Committee examining electoral reform has been told.The Committee on Housing met on Wednesday morning to discuss new electoral reform laws. Labour TD Ged Nash urged the Government to examine new rules that would address the difference in allowable donations between Ireland and Northern Ireland.Last summer it was reported that Sinn Féin had accepted more than €3m from the estate of Billy Hampton.The former mechanic, who was not married and had no children, left some money to friends and acquaintances, but the main beneficiary of the will was the Sinn Féin.
