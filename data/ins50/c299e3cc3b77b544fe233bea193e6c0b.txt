The state Department of Transportation will demolish a Westshore hotel in preparation for its eventual expansion of Interstate 275.

The operators of DoubleTree Hotel on West Cypress Street notified the state and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor that it will close on or around Dec. 19. The closure will affect 74 employees, according to the notice filed with the state.

Florida Department of Transportation has owned the 165-key hotel since 2015, and its location is in the path of I-275's new Westshore Interchange.
