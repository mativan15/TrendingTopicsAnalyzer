MONTROSE, Pa. — As he campaigns for governor across Pennsylvania, Democrat Josh Shapiro tells voters how his Jewish faith drives his values. He also tells them about his Republican rival Doug Mastriano, who paid a consulting fee to a far-right social media website where a mass shooter went on antisemitic rants.

And in an interview, Shapiro said that when he heard Mastriano accuse him of having 'disdain for people like us' because Shapiro and his children have attended a 'privileged, exclusive, elite' Jewish academy in the Philadelphia suburbs, the Democratic candidate immediately thought of all the students and teachers whose lives he felt his opponent had put 'at risk' by singling out their school.
