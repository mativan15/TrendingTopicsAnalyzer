May 31—ASHLAND — Federal prosecutors have dismissed the case against an Ashland dentist accused of conspiring with his wife to defraud the IRS, while his spouse has pleaded guilty to various tax fraud charges.

William and Kathy Thorner were indicted last year by federal authorities on charges of failure to pay Social Security taxes, filing false returns and defrauding the IRS between 2014 and 2017.

Kathy Thorner pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of failure to pay taxes and one count of submitting a false tax return.
