CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Since joining the University of Virginia Police Department as its first diversity, equity and inclusion officer in 2019, Courtney Hawkins has made it her mission to bring police training into the modern age.

All department members are enrolled in three new courses that train participants in hate crime identification, LGBTQ+ awareness and effective communication styles.

UVa is one of only two university police departments in the country with a designated diversity position.
