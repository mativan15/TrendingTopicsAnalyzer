U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen refuted reports that she sought to reduce the amount of spending in President Biden's COVID-19 spending package, despite a book claiming she thought "too much government money was flowing into the economy." Yellen responded Saturday to excerpts of a biography that stated she wanted a smaller package than the nearly $2 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP), which Biden signed into law in March 2021, pushing the government's total pandemic relief to nearly $6 trillion.
