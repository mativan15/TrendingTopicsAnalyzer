Jun. 5—The lights dim, and the orchestra begins playing popping, plinking music with a hint of oom-pah about it. Down one of the theater aisles strides actor Jelani Remy, wearing a shiny faux-leather red bustier beneath a bolero jacket, along with a top hat and black pants. He begins singing, with an insinuating purr, "Wilkommen/And bienvenue/Welcome."

It's a bit of a meta moment. We are watching the opening number of the musical "Cabaret," yes, but we are also back in the Goodspeed Opera House for the first complete season of fully staged shows after COVID halted indoor productions.
