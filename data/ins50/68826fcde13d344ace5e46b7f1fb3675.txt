Market forces rained on the parade of Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRTX) shareholders today, when the analysts downgraded their forecasts for this year. Revenue estimates were cut sharply as the analysts signalled a weaker outlook - perhaps a sign that investors should temper their expectations as well.

After the downgrade, the consensus from Mirati Therapeutics' 13 analysts is for revenues of US$8.2m in 2022, which would reflect a painful 89% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance.
