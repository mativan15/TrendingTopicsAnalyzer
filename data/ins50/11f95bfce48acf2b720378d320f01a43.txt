I turn 60 in a few weeks, I am fully retired, and I am in receipt of a good pension. I also have about $150,000 in another fund which I have not converted to a pension. I do not currently need to access this money, but when I do, it will likely be for house renovations and travel. What are the relevant advantages of leaving the money sitting in the fund (invested equally between cash and Australian shares) as opposed to converting it to a pension immediately?If you leave the money in accumulation mode where it is now, it will be subject to a 15 per cent per annum tax on its earnings, but there would be no requirement to draw any money from it.
