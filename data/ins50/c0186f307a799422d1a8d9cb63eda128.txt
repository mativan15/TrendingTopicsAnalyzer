SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers have acquired star running back Christian McCaffrey from the Carolina Panthers, according to two people familiar with the situation.

The people spoke to the Associated Press on Thursday night on condition of anonymity because the trade has not been made official.

ESPN first reported the trade that brings McCaffrey back to the Bay Area — he starred in college at Stanford — in a deal for draft picks.

The Panthers will receive picks in the second, third and fourth rounds of the 2023 draft, as well as a fifth-rounder in 2024, according to one of the people who spoke to the AP.
