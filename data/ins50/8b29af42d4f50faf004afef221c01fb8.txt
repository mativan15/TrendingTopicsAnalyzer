Washington Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov was suspended one game by the NHL's Department of Player Safety for high-sticking Vancouver's Kyle Burroughs, the league announced Tuesday afternoon. Kuznetsov whacked Burroughs up high with his stick behind the Canucks net at 16:44 of the second period Monday in the Capitals' 6-4 win at Capital One Arena. Kuznetsov received a minor penalty for high-sticking on the play before giving Burroughs an extra shove while he was on the ground.
