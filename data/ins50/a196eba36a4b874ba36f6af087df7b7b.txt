PISCES (Feb 20-Mar 20)
It seems an auspicious day, but you should avoid travelling today. Some may get rid of health issues they have been facing lately. Daily Astrological Prediction says, wife or mother may cook something nice for you and it may make you happy. Your stable financial condition may allow you to fulfil your wishes and buy things you actually want to make your life better.



You may be busy with meeting new people or clients and make them understand about your new project or business idea.
