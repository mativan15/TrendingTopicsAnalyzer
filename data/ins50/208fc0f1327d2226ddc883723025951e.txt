Florida's Gulf Coast has been in rough shape for oysters. Decades of decline in oyster reefs — 85% globally, over the last two centuries — coupled with the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico left the once-rich oyster beds sparse.

"We didn't see the materials in the bay system that oysters needed to settle on to grow a reef," Anne Birch, Florida's marine program manager for the environmental nonprofit the Nature Conservancy, told CBS News.

The BP oil spill in 2010, when gallons of crude oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days, exacerbated the decline, she said.
