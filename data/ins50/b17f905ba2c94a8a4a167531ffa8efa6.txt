Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, can lead to severe bone loss during the acute and post-recovery phases of the disease, according to a study conducted in hamsters. The findings, recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications, provide insights into the possible long-term complications of COVID-19. In addition to lung infection, complications of different organ systems in the long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection, or "long COVID," have been increasingly recognised in patients with disease, the researchers said.
