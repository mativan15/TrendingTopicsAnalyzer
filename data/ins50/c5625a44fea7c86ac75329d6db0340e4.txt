So far in 2022, two massive role-playing games have dominated the top rankings on PC games storefront Steam: 'Elden Ring' and 'Lost Ark.' Both involve a ton of work, the kind of role-playing games where players must sink in dozens and dozens of hours to make significant progress. They also both cater to players who seek detailed, immersive role-playing experiences. To face endgame bosses, players plan out their builds and carefully gear up.
