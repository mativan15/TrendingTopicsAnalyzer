Snap (SNAP) may have to cut even more employees than it previously thought given the sharper-than-expected slowdown in business in the third quarter, one longtime tech analyst warned.

"Yes, I mean they do [have to cut expenses more]," Jefferies Analyst Brent Thill said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). "They just restructured the company. They obviously are in the process of still reducing the workforce by 20%. They may have to go deeper."

Snap stock crashed more than 24% on Friday morning after the social media platform reported that third-quarter sales decelerated for the fifth-straight quarter.
