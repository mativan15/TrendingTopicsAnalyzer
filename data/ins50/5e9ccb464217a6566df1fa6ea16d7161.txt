Liz Truss has handed a prime seat at her Cabinet table to renowned strategist Grant Shapps after the departure of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary.It may be a calculated move by the embattled Prime Minister to get a Tory big beast on her side – and one who is seen as a sharp-elbowed plotter who could otherwise help bring about her removal from No10.After a short-lived Tory leadership bid of his own, Mr Shapps became a major backer of Ms Truss's rival Rishi Sunak in the contest over the summer.The former transport secretary is said to record Tory colleagues' doubts about Ms Truss in a running spreadsheet, wielded on a pricey foldable smartphone.
