When Francesca Murray's friend Natasha cancelled her 2020 wedding due to COVID-19, Murray and some other would-be guests made the trip to be with Natasha anyway. The crew celebrated with drinks at one pal's house, leaving Murray feeling groggy the next day. So, the 45-year-old stylist and mom of two from Dublin, Ireland, took a painkiller and went back to bed, according to the Independent. But when her symptoms progressed into slurred speech, Natasha, a nurse, called the emergency number. Murray was airlifted to Cork University Hospital (CUH).
