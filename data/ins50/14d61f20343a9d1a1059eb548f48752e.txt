The Jockey Club's qualification process for previously raced horses is in need of a 'systematic review' after the 'risk-averse' decision to say no to subsequent The Everest winner Giga Kick, chief executive Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges believes. Trainer David Hayes was left furious after watching Giga Kick win the world's richest turf race on Saturday, confirming he was told by the Jockey Club the galloper's four-length debut win at Sale in Victoria was not enough to qualify him for Hong Kong. Giga Kick is now undefeated from five starts and boasts more than A$7 million (HKD$34 million) in prize money.
