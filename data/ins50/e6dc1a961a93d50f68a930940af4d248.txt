If you've been in the stock market for a while, you've likely heard that it is better to be a long-term investor. But what does it actually mean to invest for the long term?
Every person has a unique perspective, but for me, it means investing with the goal of holding a stock for at least five years. If you're buying something today, your time horizon for the investment should be until at least early 2027.
One stock with great potential is Spotify (SPOT 0.19%), the global music and audio streaming platform.
