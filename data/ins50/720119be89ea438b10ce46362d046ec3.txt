assalve/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis Trulieve Cannabis Corp. (OTCQX:TCNNF) reported decent FQ1'22 earnings on 12 May 2022. Nonetheless, given the macro pessimism and bearish market conditions, its stock went on a mostly sideways action instead of meaningfully recovering. In addition, given the sluggish federal legalization, many cannabis stocks had also declined after the massive rally in early 2021. Given the upcoming midterm elections in November 2022, any cannabis investor should neither be betting their hopes on expedient legalization nor a quick rally in FY2022.
