Medical students in B.C. are rethinking their career paths as they near graduation amid a critical shortage of long-term care physicians in the province. Nearly one million British Columbians don't have a family doctor.Although the University of British Columbia has the largest family practice program in the country, with about 170 spots that are consistently filled by future physicians, that isn't translating into more family practitioners in B.C. Some medical students say they are concerned about having to run a business on top of caring for patients, and say the financial viability of the fee-for-service model doesn't make sense.
