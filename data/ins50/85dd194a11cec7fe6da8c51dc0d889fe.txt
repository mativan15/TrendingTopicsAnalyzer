Many countries across the world are getting ready to witness the last solar eclipse of the year on October 25, a day after Diwali. This will be a partial solar eclipse and will be visible from most parts of India. A solar eclipse is a phenomenon in which the moon passes between the sun and the earth. The solar eclipse will begin at 11 am and end at 7 pm on Tuesday. This celestial event is unique in itself, as such a phenomenon will next be seen on March 20, 2034.

Aside from science, eclipses have enormous cultural ramifications for Indians, with many ceremonies and beliefs linked with them.
