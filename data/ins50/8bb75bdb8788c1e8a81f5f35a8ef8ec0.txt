Amid a controversy over discovery of a temple-like structure in a mosque in Malali in Mangaluru continues, a seer has claimed that land of the mosque belongs to his mutt. Rudramuni Swami, the seer of Jangama Math, said there was a shrine belonging to their mutt and it should be returned. 'It has come to light in Tambula Prashne that there was Shivashakti shrine and Guru Mutt at Malali. There are records to prove that the Guru Mutt, which was on the mosque land, was a branch of Gurpur Mutt,' the seer told reporters on Friday.
