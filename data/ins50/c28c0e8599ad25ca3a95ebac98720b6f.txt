May 28—MIAMI COUNTY — Leaders often describe the Interstate 75 interchange(s) as an introduction to their community.

In Miami County, the state of interchanges ranges from a nearly 20-year public/private partnership for care of the interchange at Ohio 41 in Troy to a decades-old public project at the U.S. 36 interchange at Piqua to ongoing discussion in Tipp City for the best approach to the interchange at Ohio 571.

This is the 19th season for Operation Cloverleaf, a group of local businesses providing landscape management at the 18-acre cloverleaf at Ohio 41 and the interstate.
