There are 18.4 million Canadians who use the social media app Instagram, accounting for almost half of Canada's population. While the app is a great way for individuals and small businesses to share photos, videos and connect with followers, it's increasingly being targeted by hackers. 'The hackers got into my account and they changed my email, and they changed my password so I couldn't get back in," said Siva Swaminathan of Toronto, a chef who uses Instagram for her small business providing healthy recipes.
