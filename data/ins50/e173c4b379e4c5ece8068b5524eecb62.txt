Weeks before the next four-year budget is presented to Edmonton city council, councillors are already stuck with a difficult choice.
They are facing the question of whether to increase property taxes or delay a successful neighbourhood renewal program to pay for hundreds of millions of dollars of necessary infrastructure fixes.According to city administration, there is a growing number of infrastructure items in fair condition. That would include certain city facilities, bridges and transit.If those are not improved in the next decade, the number of projects in poor or very poor condition could go from 9.
