Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra said Tuesday that Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia should undergo a lie detector test after the latter alleged that he was asked, on the side, to quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during his questioning by the CBI on Monday. Sisodia was summoned by the CBI in connection with its probe into the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy.
'I challenge Manish Sisodia to face a narco or a lie detector test to find out the truth or take back his allegations against the CBI and apologise by the evening,' Mishra said.
