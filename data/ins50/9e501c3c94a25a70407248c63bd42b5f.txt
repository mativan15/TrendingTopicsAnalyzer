Australia's financial services and markets regulator suspended Sydney-based asset manager Holon Investments from offering or distributing three crypto funds to retail investors for 21 days, according to a press release.

The decision was taken by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) due to non-compliant target market determinations (TMD) by Holon Investments.

TMD is a document which describes the target customer for an investment product. ASIC said it is concerned that Holon has not appropriately considered the features and risks of the Funds in determining their target markets.
