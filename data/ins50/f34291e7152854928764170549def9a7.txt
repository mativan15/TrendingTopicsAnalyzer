Two key U.S. regulators are reportedly investigating the bankrupt crypto-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).

According to anonymous sources reported by Bloomberg, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are now looking into whether the fund 'violated rules by misleading investors about the strength of its balance sheet and not registering with the agencies.'

The Singapore-based fund, which began actively trading cryptocurrencies in 2017, was one of the world's largest crypto funds before filing Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings on July 1, claiming that it owed $3.
