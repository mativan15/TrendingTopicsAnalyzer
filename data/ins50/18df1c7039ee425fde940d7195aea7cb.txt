A decision to end native logging in Western Australia is "bitterly disappointing" for the Dawson family, who are facing what could be the end of their business after 40 years in forestry. Bernie Dawson says he has tried to "insulate" his dad from the stress his family has experienced since the WA government last year announced a ban on native logging from 2024."[My brother] Daryl and I have had to sit down and have a real man-to-man discussion with our families," Mr Dawson said."What are we going to do? What will there be for us come 2024?"The Dawson family's Donnybrook business is one of multiple WA companies facing the end of an era when the last jarrah and marri logs are felled commercially in 2023.
