The FDIC is taking a closer look at crypto, specifically stablecoins, according to its acting chairman.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), alongside other Federal banking agencies, is expected to issue industry-wide guidelines for financial institutions dealing in crypto, said the FDIC's Martin Gruenberg.

The FDIC is a consumer protection agency that insures users' deposits and oversees financial institutions for safety to protect investors in the event of bank failures.

At a Brookings Institution event on Thursday, Gruenberg said that the FDIC has been investigating the risks of cryptocurrencies since April 2022.
