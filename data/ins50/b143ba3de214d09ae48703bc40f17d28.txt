Welcome to Metro.co.uk‘s The Big Questions, where we ask, well, the big questions (and the smaller ones too) and this week, we're diving deep with Richard Blackwood.
The actor, presenter, comic, singer – what can't he do? – has been a staple of British pop culture since the 90s, when he helmed shows including Singled Out, The Richard Blackwood Show and Top Of The Pops.
Rising through the ranks of stand-up before releasing an album, he's now a beloved fixture on our screens in the world of soaps.
From Walford to Chester, Richard, 50, stars as Felix Westwood in Hollyoaks, where he was recently part of a powerful storyline, alongside his character's son DeMarcus (played by Tomi Ade) around knife crime.
