A day after three army personnel were injured in a blast in Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian, one Jawan succumbed to his injuries on Friday. According to an official statement issued by Defence PRO, the martyred soldier Naik Praveen belonged to Tehri Garhwal of Uttarakhand and is known to be survived by his wife and a six-year-old son, and his mortal remains were taken to his native village after a wreath-laying ceremony held in J-K's Udhampur today.

On Thursday, three Indian Army personnel were injured in a blast, following which Praveen succumbed to his injuries at 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar.
