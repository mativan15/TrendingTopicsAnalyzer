IANSDelhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.A day after he was grilled by the CBI in a corruption case, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia took the campaign battle of the Aam Aadmi Party to the traditional citadel of the BJP, Gujarat. Sisodia, who has been aggressively marketing the education model of Delhi as an election plank in Gujarat, told the media that if voted to power, the AAP would build "magnificent" government schools that would be better than the private ones in every four kilometres in the state's top cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Gandhinagar and Junagadh.
