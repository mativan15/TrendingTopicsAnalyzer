(Bloomberg) -- UK bonds rallied Thursday, erasing earlier losses, as traders pared interest-rate bets and assessed whether Prime Minister Liz Truss can cling onto power. The yield on 10-year securities fell 9 basis points after climbing as much as 14 basis points earlier in the session, to outperform German peers. The reversal came after Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said it's not clear that UK rates need to rise as much as investors expect. Easing rate hike bets helped offset the impact of ongoing chaos in Westminster, where Truss is meeting the official in charge of leadership votes.
