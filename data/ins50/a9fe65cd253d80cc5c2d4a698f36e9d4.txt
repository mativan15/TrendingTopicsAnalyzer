SINCE 2009 The Economist has collaborated with YouGov, an online pollster, to conduct a regular political poll. Each week, YouGov asks 1,500 adult citizens how they feel about a range of issues—from presidential job-approval, to relevant news events, to important government policy proposals and the state of the economy. We have collected the results of each survey to present a series of interactive data visualisations that explores what America has thought about politics and policy for every week over the past decade.
