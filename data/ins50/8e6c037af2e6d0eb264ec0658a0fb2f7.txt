The Philadelphia 76ers went out and got tougher in the offseason when they brought in PJ Tucker at the outset of free agency. With the Sixers being ousted by Tucker and the Miami Heat in Round 2 of the 2022 playoffs, they knew they needed to make some additions to the roster.
The Sixers made Tucker their main priority as he has experience playing next to James Harden and he brings the toughness and two-way ability that the team needs to succeed. He has a championship under his belt in 2021 with the Milwaukee Bucks and he was one win away from the finals again in 2022 with the Heat.
