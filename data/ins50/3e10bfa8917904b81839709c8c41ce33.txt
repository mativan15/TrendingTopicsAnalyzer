Published: 20:14 EDT, 4 June 2022 | Updated: 20:14 EDT, 4 June 2022 A fresh bid to secure David Beckham a knighthood has failed, The Mail on Sunday understands.The former England captain is thought to have been formally nominated and included in the official recommendations for the honour. But despite clearing tax hurdles that are believed to have stymied previous attempts to become a 'Sir', he was again unsuccessful.Sources last night suggested his decision to sign a controversial £10 million deal to be the face of this year's World Cup in Qatar may have hampered his chances.
