Taiwan 's legislature has paved the way for corruption charges against a former president to be dropped, passing an amendment to a bill amid scuffles among lawmakers on Monday (May 30). Lawmakers from the ruling, independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party pushed through the final reading of the amendment to the accounting act which technically allows authorities to dismiss charges against Chen Shui-bian over his use of special state funds when was president from 2000 to 2008.
