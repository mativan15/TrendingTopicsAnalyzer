Serbia, which has been trying to tread a delicate balancing act between East and West since Moscow invaded Ukraine, said Sunday it has secured a new long-term contract with Russia to ensure that it has sufficient gas supplies next winter. As energy prices soar across the globe, the exact terms of the deal -- which will ensure Serbia has "a safe winter when it comes to gas supply" -- will be announced in the coming days, said President Aleksandar Vucic.

 Vucic insisted the contract would give the Balkan country "by far the best terms in Europe".
