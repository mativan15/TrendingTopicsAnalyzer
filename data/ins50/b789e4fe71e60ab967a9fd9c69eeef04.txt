NASCAR suspended Bubba Wallace for this weekend's race at Miami-Homestead on Tuesday after he spun reigning champion Kyle Larson at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and then confronted him afterward.

NASCAR classified Wallace's infraction as behavioral, which under the rule book could cover Wallace deliberately spinning Larson, his contact with a series official and his shoving match with Larson.

Still, the suspension for Sunday's race in South Florida is a rare step for the stock car series: Wallace is the first Cup Series driver to be suspended for an on-track incident since Matt Kenseth was parked for two races in 2015 for an incident at Martinsville.
