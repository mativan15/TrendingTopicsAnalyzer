The first step I would suggest would be to spend a bit of time digging out any paperwork and getting up-to-date valuations of Ms Stuart's pensions. It is worth using the Government's pension tracing service to find any old, forgotten policies. 
This should give Ms Stuart an initial idea of how much money she will have to play with in retirement. An income of £20,000 to £25,000 per year in retirement sounds tricky, especially when we look at her plans for retirement and the level of income she is used to.
