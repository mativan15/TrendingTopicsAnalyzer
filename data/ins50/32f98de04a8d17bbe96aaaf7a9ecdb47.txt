A recent headline in T he New York Times declared: 'Voters see democracy in peril, but saving it isn't a priority.' The story related to a recent poll of American voters ahead of the midterm elections, in which 71% said they thought democracy was at risk in the US, but only 7% believed this was the most important problem facing the country.

As an Israeli, my fear is not only that my fellow citizens are similarly unconcerned about the threat to democracy, but I suspect far fewer than 71% realize that it is at far greater risk here than in the US.
