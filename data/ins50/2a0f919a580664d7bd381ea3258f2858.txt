Zain Manji's first reaction when he heard about the ArriveCAN app's $54 million price tag was sticker shock.

'It was it was shocking to see the total amount dedicated for that project,' Manji, the co-founder of digital product studio Lazer Technologies said.

But his astonishment gave way to empathy as his company cloned the app to see if they could do it faster and cheaper than the federal government. They managed to replicate it over a single weekend.

Despite their speedy duplication, Manji said he still has empathy for the complexity of the task and all the processes that were underway behind the scenes to ensure the application was safe and secure for a country as large as Canada.
