The daughter of ex-England striker Michael Owen has big plans and takes inspiration from Kylie's reality show family the Kardashians. Gemma, who competes in international dressage, is on the Spanish isle of Majorca, where ITV 's dating show kicks off tomorrow. She already has an eye on the future and says: 'I would love to carry on with my business which I have just set up. It's called OG Beachwear.
