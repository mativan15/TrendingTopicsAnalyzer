The culmination of a week's worth of work lands us right here, right now. Stone Cold Locks of the Week, predictions with convictions and some #'s to back it up. Rolling right now too… 27-15-1 on the season. Let's get some more W's. Giants (+3) @ Jax- I haven't been able to put my finger on it all week. I do not understand how the Jags are favored in this spot, this team doesn't know how to win. Conversly, the Giants seem to find a new way every week. Are they getting lucky? Maybe. But I also think that at some point you have to buy in a little, they're 5-1, that's really hard to pull off in the NFL by accident.
