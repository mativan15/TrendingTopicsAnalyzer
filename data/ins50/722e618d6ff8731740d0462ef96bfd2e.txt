The Denver Broncos have five former players accounting for $15,015,690 against their salary cap this season.
That's 'dead money' that still counts against the cap even though the players are no longer on the team. One of the ways that can happen is through prorated signing bonuses.
For example, if a player signs a three-year contract with a $3 million signing bonus, the bonus will be prorated into $1 million cap hits each season. If the player is cut after one year, though, the remaining prorated $1 million cap hits would still count in the following two years.
