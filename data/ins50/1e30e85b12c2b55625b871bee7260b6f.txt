By renaming the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) as the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao aims to take on the BJP and emerge as a national force. This is an ambitious step. It could even be a misadventure, for Mr. Rao has not yet struck a chord with the people of the rest of the country, has disassociated himself from the brand name that catapulted him to power, and seems to lack a national vision. Further, his position even on home ground is shaky, as the TRS recently lost a few bypolls to the BJP.
