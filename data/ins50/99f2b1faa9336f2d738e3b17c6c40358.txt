Kanye West has long bragged that he has the attention of 'the youth,' but his audience will be older after his move to Parler

Kanye West agreed to buy social platform Parler after he was locked out of Twitter and Instagram.

Compared to Twitter, West's reach would be reduced on Parler, and his audience would change.

Parler's users lean older, and West has a fraction of the followers on Parler that he does on Twitter.

Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, is moving on to another social platform after recently getting locked out of Twitter and Instagram — and the size and makeup of his online audience is set to transform as a result.
