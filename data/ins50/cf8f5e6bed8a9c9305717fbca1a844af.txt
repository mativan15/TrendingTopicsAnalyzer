Oct. 21—A $200,000 federal grant recently received by the Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney's Office will be used to fight street gang activity, which accounts for much of the crime in the area, law enforcement officials say.

The grant comes from the 2021 State Homeland Security Program, and is presented through the state's Emergency Management Agency, Brunswick DA Keith Higgins said.

The money will be used to gain access to an investigative case file system known as Formlytics, used by government agencies to prosecute street gangs and other groups responsible for violent crimes against communities, he said.
