Three people in Nelson's homeless community are on the waiting list for accommodation, Housing First says. In a Stuff article on Wednesday, community advocates were critical of government agencies in their dealings with the men who were temporarily housed in a ‘pop up homeless shelter' at the Unite Church. They'd been bunking down at the facility for six weeks following the atmospheric rain event in August. In a statement provided to the Nelson Mail, Housing First team leader Jaap Noteboom said Housing First was able to connect with seven of the people who had been staying at the church.
