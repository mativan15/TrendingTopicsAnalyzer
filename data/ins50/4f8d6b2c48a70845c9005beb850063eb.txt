The Republican National Committee sued Google, claiming it can't communicate with party members to raise money because the internet giant is routing its email messages to spam folders.

The committee accuses the Alphabet Inc. unit of political discrimination, saying its messages sent through Gmail reach supporter inboxes most of the time -- except at the end of the month, when nearly all of its emails end up in spam folders where users are unlikely to read them.
