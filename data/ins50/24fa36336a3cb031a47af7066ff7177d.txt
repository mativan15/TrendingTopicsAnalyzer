An Iranian climber competed without a hijab because it fell off by accident, a post on her Instagram account says – prompting fears that authorities forced her to offer the explanation. 
Elnaz Rekabi, 33, was hailed a hero when she competed uncovered at the Asian Games in Seoul amid protests back home over strict dress code rules.
Following Sunday's competition she went missing, with friends unable to contact her, before resurfacing with the social media post.
‘I apologise about what I did to make you worry,' the post said.
