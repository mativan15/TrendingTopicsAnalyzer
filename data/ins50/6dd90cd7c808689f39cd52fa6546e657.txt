While there were a lot of scholarships handed out Wednesday night at the Holbrook Class of 2022 awards ceremony, there was one very special scholarship in honor of one of their former classmates who was supposed to be graduating high school with them.

'I should have my child graduate with everyone else, but no,' said Bernadette Jean Baptiste, who has been wiping away tears for the last five years, ever since she lost her son Daron to cancer.

He was just 13 years old and had been battling the disease since he was six.
