The BBC is preparing secret scripts which could be broadcast if the bleakest forecasts come true and energy shortages cause blackouts this winter, it has been reported.
They would reassure the public in the scenario where a ‘major loss of power' knocks out mobile phone networks, internet access and online banking, and traffic lights, according to The Guardian.
It is also claimed they will advise people to use car radios or battery-powered receivers to listen to emergency broadcasts on FM and long-wave frequencies usually reserved for Radio 2 and Radio 4.
