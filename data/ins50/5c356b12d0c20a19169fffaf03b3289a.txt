A company owned by a lawyer who helped block the Government's Rwanda deportation flight was given taxpayers' money to train immigration advisers, The Telegraph can disclose.

More than £100,000 was awarded to HJT Training – a firm run by two barristers at the chambers which grounded a flight to the African country in June.

A Home Office source said Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary, had instructed civil servants to undertake an 'urgent review' of the contract, amid claims from Tory MPs the quango responsible for overseeing immigration advice could have been hijacked by activism.
