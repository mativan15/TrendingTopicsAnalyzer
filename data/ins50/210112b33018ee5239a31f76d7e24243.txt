jetcityimage Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) stock advanced 2.6% in Monday premarket trading after its Q3 earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, as strong growth in net interest revenue and record retail inflows offset a slump in asset management fees and trading revenue. In terms of trading volume, clients remained engaged even as "the Federal Reserve assumed an increasingly hawkish stance, tightening monetary policy at the fastest rate in four decades, as it wrestled with elevated inflation and lingering effects from the global pandemic," said Co-Chairman and CEO Walt Bettinger.
