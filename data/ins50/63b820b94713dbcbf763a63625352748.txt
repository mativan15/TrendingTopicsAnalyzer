Even the closest observers would have a tough time distinguishing between Apple's iPad updates year over year, and that's the case with the new 11-inch iPad Pro 2022, which is identical to several previous models. While there have been some minor tweaks over time to the iPad Air, the fifth-generation iPad Air tablet is also identical to its predecessor. While some may chide Apple for its adherence to visual tradition, most users give a thumbs up to a familiar design that works well.
When it comes to the iPad's underlying hardware and software, that's where Apple readily tosses out the old and rings in the new.
