The UK's economic outlook has been downgraded from 'stable' to 'negative' by the rating agency Moody's because of political instability and high inflation.Moody's said the change in outlook was driven by 'heightened unpredictability in policymaking amid weaker growth prospects and high inflation' and 'risks to the UK's debt affordability from likely higher borrowing and risk of a sustained weakening in policy credibility'.Rating agencies rate a country on the strength of its economy and provide governments with a score based on the likelihood that they will be able to pay back debt.
