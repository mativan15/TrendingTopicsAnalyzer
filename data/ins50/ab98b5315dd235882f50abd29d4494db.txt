Tottenham moved to within one point of Premier League leaders Arsenal as Harry Kane and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg secured a 2-0 win over Everton.

Having been frustrated for much of Saturday's match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Spurs went ahead when Kane converted a 59th-minute penalty he won after Jordan Pickford's blunder.

Everton had missed the game's best chances prior to that, Amadou Onana and Demarai Gray profligate in the first half.

And any hope for Frank Lampard was extinguished when Hojbjerg's deflected strike settled the contest late on.
