The Boston Celtics made the trek north of the border to play the Toronto Raptors in a neutral site exhibition game at Bell Centre Arena to close out their slate of four 2022-23 preseason games and their participation in the league's NBA Canada Games program for the season.

The Celtics and Raptors both played the game as if it were a regular season contest, keeping their starters in late into the game's final frame to the chagrin of some as wet spots in the floor made for a few scary falls. A controversial tech late in the third saw Jayson Tatum ejected from the game.
