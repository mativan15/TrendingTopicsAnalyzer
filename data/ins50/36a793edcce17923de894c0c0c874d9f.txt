I was born and raised by a single mother in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. She taught me to be a good human, and though we didn't have much, I'm proud of where I came from. That's also where my journey as an entrepreneur began - I always looked for ways to support financially as I grew. I remember going from trash can to trash can, collecting plastic bottles to recycle for change because buying a bowl or two of noodles was something tangible I could do to help. I learned a lot from those experiences, and they helped shape the rest of my life.
