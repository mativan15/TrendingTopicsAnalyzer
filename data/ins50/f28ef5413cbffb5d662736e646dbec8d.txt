Jun. 5—Melinda Starnes is a candidate in the Republican primary race in Aiken County Council's District 1.

Her opponent is Ron Felder.

Voters go to the polls June 14.

Incumbent Kathy Rawls told the Aiken Standard earlier this year that she wouldn't seek reelection.

Starnes, who is retired and lives in the Salley area, has a background in human resources and health care.

"I also have been active in my community for several years as a volunteer in different capacities, as a supporter of the needs of the students in our schools (donating needed personal items) or visiting with and assisting senior citizens in our area," Starnes wrote in an email sent to the Aiken Standard.
