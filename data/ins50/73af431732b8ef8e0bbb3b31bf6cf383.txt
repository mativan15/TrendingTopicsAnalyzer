British Prime Minister Liz Truss quit on Thursday (early Friday, NZT) – bowing to the inevitable after a tumultuous term in which her policies triggered turmoil in financial markets and a rebellion in her party that obliterated her authority. Making a hastily scheduled statement outside her 10 Downing Street office, Truss acknowledged that 'I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party'. She is the third Conservative prime minister to resign since 2019 and leaves a divided party seeking a leader who can unify its warring factions.
