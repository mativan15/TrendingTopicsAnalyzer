Louis Vuitton founder Bernard Arnault announced on Monday he sold his private jet after people started tracking it on Twitter. ‘No one can see where I go' he said. According to Business Insider, the billionaire said he'd started renting private aircraft for his trips instead. The decision is to avoid being tracked by climate activists. These activists say that private jets are 10 times more carbon- intensive than airliners on average.

In September, Arnault was ranked by Forbes to be the world's second-richest person with a fortune of $153.
