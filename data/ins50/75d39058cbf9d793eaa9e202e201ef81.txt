Published: 03:00 EDT, 15 October 2022 | Updated: 05:56 EDT, 15 October 2022 New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has denied he has ambitions to become Prime Minister as he trashed Kwasi Kwarteng's record on his first day in the job, admitting the government 'made mistakes' and was 'flying blind' with its economic plan.Mr Hunt was appointed by Liz Truss yesterday afternoon after she sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor following weeks of economic turmoil after he unveiled his mini-budget in September. The former Foreign Secretary ran to be leader of the Conservative Party twice, in 2019 and earlier this year,  but has now said his leadership ambitions have been 'clinically excised'.
