The NFL decided not to add fines after a pair of controversial roughing the passer calls from Week 5.

According to Tom Pelissero of NFL Network, Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Grady Jarrett was not fined after his sack against Tampa Bay Buccaneers star Tom Brady. Kansas City Chiefs' Chris Jones also avoided a fine from his hit on Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, per Pelissero.

This comes as Brady was fined $11,139 for kicking Jarrett after the play in question.

Both roughing calls caught the attention of fans because of their lack of hard contact as well as the importance in the respective games.
