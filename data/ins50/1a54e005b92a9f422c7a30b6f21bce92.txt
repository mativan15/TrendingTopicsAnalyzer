Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Aroa Biosurgery Limited (ASX:ARX) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future.
