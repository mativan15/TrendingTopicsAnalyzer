I am 58 years old and my spouse is 62. He will begin collecting Social Security in September of this year.  He will collect $1,900 per month. I am a registered nurse making $85,000 a year and I want to work as long as I possibly can. We have approximately $300,000 in retirement savings and $50,000 in cash. We are debt free. We own a home in Philadelphia that might be worth $200,000 give or take. I save 10% of my salary every year through a 401(k). However, I have a nagging feeling that we are way behind where we should be and worry constantly that we will be destitute in retirement.
