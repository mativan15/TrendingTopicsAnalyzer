A rare Islamic gold coin, said to be the first of its kind to be auctioned, could be sold for more than £1 million when it goes under the hammer later this month.The 6th century gold dinar dates from when the Umayyad Caliphate ruled from the year 660 to 750.Coins from the period are common but the Arabic phrase inscribed on the dinar is said to be rare.'Ma'din Amir al-Mu'minin', meaning Commander of the Faithful, is associated with the formal title of the ruler of the Muslim community.It was in use for around three years, according to the Classical Numismatic Group (CNG), which is organising the auction.
