When the BBC threatens to kill off a much-loved station, it rarely wields the knife efficiently. BBC Radio 6 Music was threatened then reprieved after an outcry by music lovers. BBC3 was shoved online then brought back when the bureaucrats realised belatedly that axing their one youth channel wasn't smart. And now BBC4 is for the chop, to save money. It will be a slow, lingering decline, as it lies on its deathbed for three years until the life support is finally turned off and it becomes a streaming service, online only.
