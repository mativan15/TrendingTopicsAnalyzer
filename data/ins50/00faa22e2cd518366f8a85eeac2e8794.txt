For years, Snap, the maker of the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat, steadily grew its advertising business. That changed last year after Apple enacted privacy changes that made it harder for apps to target advertising to their users.

Since then, Snap's business has continued to slow.

On Thursday, the company reported that its revenue for the third quarter rose 6 percent to $1.13 billion from a year earlier. It was Snap's slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth. Net loss was $359 million, far wider than the $72 million loss from a year earlier, as spending increased more than 25 percent.
