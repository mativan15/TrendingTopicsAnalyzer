At a luncheon for Republican women in Mesa County, Colorado, last week, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., warned that educators 'are putting litter boxes in schools for people who identify as cats.'

To a person not steeped in the culture war battles over gender identity that have engulfed school districts nationwide, it's the kind of claim that would sound bizarre and confusing — and, from high-profile GOP members, authoritative.

The week before, on Sept. 29, Minnesota GOP gubernatorial nominee Scott Jensen asked during a campaign stop, 'Why do we have litter boxes in some of the school districts so kids can pee in them, because they identify as a furry?'

And during a legislative hearing last month in Tennessee, two Republican state lawmakers discussed the 'growing crisis' of public schools providing litter boxes for children who identify as cats, and claimed it's happening across the state.
