The spin-off of the hit Starz franchise stars Patina Miller and MeKai Curtis

After a successful first season, Power Book III: Raising Kanan has a season 2 premiere date and Starz has released a new teaser in anticipation of the show's return.

The character of Raquel ‘Raq' Thomas says in the teaser, 'Family. Us. I know we got our differences. But at the end of the day, blood. And that's more important than any static that's between us.'

The satellite network actually ordered the second season a week before the first even premiered last summer, signaling its confidence in the show.
