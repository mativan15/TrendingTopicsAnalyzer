Michael Vi/iStock Editorial via Getty Images MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) shares surged more than 8% on Thursday after the database software company posted first-quarter results that handily beat estimates and analysts praised its future, despite the conservative guidance. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin noted that MongoDB (MDB) "cemented its stature as one of the marquee all-weather growth stocks" following the report, highlighting strong growth in its Atlas database, which saw 80% growth for the fourth straight quarter.
