The voice actor behind the titular character in the video game "Bayonetta" is calling on fans to boycott the franchise's third installment, claiming the flat rate she was offered to reprise her role was not a "decent, dignified living wage."

'I decided to do it to stand up in solidarity with people all over the world who do not get paid properly for their talents," Hellena Taylor, who voiced Bayonetta in the English language version of the franchise's games released in 2009 and 2014, said in a series of videos posted to her Twitter account over the weekend.
