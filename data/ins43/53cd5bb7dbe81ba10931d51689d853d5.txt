DES MOINES, Iowa — Jerry Kelly took advantage of a final round drop in standings by Steven Alker to win the Principal Charity Classic on Sunday, staying composed through an inclement weather delay and a playoff.

The last time the PCC went to a playoff was 2019, and Kevin Sutherland was the champion that year.

He finished with a birdie in the single playoff hole, while Kirk Triplett hit par, to claim the winner's prize of $277,500. Both Kelly and Triplett finished at 18 under.

'It's just a good old-fashioned afternoon,' Kelly said after accepting the championship trophy at the Wakonda Club.
