Ugandan authorities have imposed Covid-like restrictions to try and control an Ebola outbreak. 
People who live in the central districts of Mubende and Kassanda cannot travel out of those areas. 
All entertainment venues, including bars and places of worship, have been closed. 
Burials must now be supervised by health officials and a night-time curfew has been imposed.
The restrictions will last at least 21 days.
Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni stressed the measures were ‘temporary'.
Ebola has infected 58 people in the East African country since September 20, when authorities declared an outbreak.
