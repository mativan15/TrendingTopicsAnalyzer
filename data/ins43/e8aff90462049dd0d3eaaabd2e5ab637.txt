(Bloomberg) -- Colony Capital LLC's former private equity head testified that founder Tom Barrack's ties to Middle East sovereign wealth funds were so well-known internally that a firm spreadsheet of potential investors identified those with 'Barrack Magic.'Justin Chang took the stand Tuesday as a government witness in Barrack's trial on charges that he acted as an unregistered agent for the United Arab Emirates in trying to influence the campaign and administration of his longtime friend, Donald Trump.
