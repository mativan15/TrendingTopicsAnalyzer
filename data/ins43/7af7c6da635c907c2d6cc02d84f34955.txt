BENGALURU: Coming down heavily on the Karnataka government for failing to check environmental pollution by ensuring effective solid waste and sewage management systems, the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) ordered it to pay Rs 2,900 crore as compensation.The NGT principal bench in New Delhi has been, for eight years, supervising compliance with earlier directions issued by the Supreme Court regarding the handling of solid waste and sewage management. In its order on Thursday, the tribunal noted that the steps taken by the Karnataka government in handling solid and liquid waste have been "inadequate", which caused heavy damage to the environment and public health.
