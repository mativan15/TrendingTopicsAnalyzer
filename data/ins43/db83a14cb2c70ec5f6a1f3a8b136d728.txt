The Wrap After deliberating for all of an hour Thursday, a Manhattan jury ruled in favor of actor Kevin Spacey in a 40 million lawsuit filed by 'Rent' actor Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of sexually assaulting him as a teenager.The jury dismissed the sole remaining charge – battery – after a brisk nine days of testimony. A judge had dismissed the claim of assault prior to the trial, then dismissed Rapp's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress after his attorneys rested their case.
