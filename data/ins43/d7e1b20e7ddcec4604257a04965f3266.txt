The BCCI and PCB are seemingly at loggerheads after the former's secretary Jay Shah – who is also the president of the Asian Cricket Council – said that India won't travel to Pakistan for the men's Asia Cup next year. Shah also added that the tournament will instead be taking place at a neutral venue. On Wednesday, the Pakistan Cricket Board issued a rather strongly-worded statement on the issue, hinting at a withdrawal from the 2023 ODI World Cup – scheduled to take place in India.Shah had said that the government decides on whether to provide permission of touring a country – in this case, Pakistan – and that India will not travel there.
