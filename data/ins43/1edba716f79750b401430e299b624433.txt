INNOVATIONA group of universities, hospitals, and life science companies is ramping up its efforts to persuade federal officials to locate a new federal health research agency in Massachusetts. The Coalition for Health Advances & Research in Massachusetts released a letter on Thursday with some 80 signatories stating that the state has the 'density of resources' necessary for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, aka ARPA-H. That list of signatures — a mix of Massachusetts university leaders, biotech executives, trade groups, and hospital administrators — has been shared with the new ARPA-H director, Renee Wegrzyn, and President Biden's Health and Human Services secretary, Xavier Becerra.
