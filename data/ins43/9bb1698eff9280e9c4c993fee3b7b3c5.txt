A $20 million endowment has been granted to help diversify the senior levels of the hospitality industry.

Howard University, a notable Historically Black College and University (HBCU), was presented with an endowment from The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation (The Marriott Foundation) to create the Marriott-Sorenson Center for Hospitality Leadership in the School of Business.

The center was established in honor of Marriott International's beloved president and CEO, Arne Sorenson, who died in 2021 from pancreatic cancer.
