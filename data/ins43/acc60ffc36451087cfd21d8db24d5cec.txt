The New Brunswick government is spending $14 million to partially rebate 2022 property tax bills on apartment buildings and commercial properties that were hit with assessment increases above 10 per cent this year.The decision reverses an earlier government position to provide relief only in the form of tax rate cuts this year and comes after weeks of intense pressure from landlords and other business property owners.In some cases, when combined with municipal and provincial tax rate cuts already granted to business properties, it promises to reduce property tax bills on some current buildings to below what they paid last year.
