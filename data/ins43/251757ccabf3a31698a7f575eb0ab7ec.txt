Released in 2021, this documentary is simple in its premise, yet inspiring, heartbreaking and fascinating in its storytelling. Filmmaker Heddy Honingmann tells the stories, through their own voices, of a handful of centenarians from around the globe, capturing their thoughts about life, loss, love and what has been driving their will to get out of bed every day for more than a century. 'Every day I eat something that [gives me] pleasure,' says one Holocaust survivor with a simple, yet effective rule to living we could all learn from.
