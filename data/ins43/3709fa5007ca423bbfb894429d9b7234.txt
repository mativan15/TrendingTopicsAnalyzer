AgenciesThe plot of Black Adam revolves around the anti-hero, a powerful metahuman in the DC universe. The anti-hero, Black Adam, delivers justice according to his twisted vision, and criminals face execution. The American Society of Justice is always looking for ways to stop Black Adam. With a weird plot, it is natural that the film would have ample scenes of violence. The producers, however, saw the commercial limitations of the certain R-rating that the film would have received. The decision, therefore, was to limit the aggression and violence in the film but keep it at a level matching the characters' demands.
