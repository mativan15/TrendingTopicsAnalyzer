TAIPEI, Taiwan —

In coming days, Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to further cement his standing as the Communist Party's most powerful leader in decades. But last week, a flicker of dissent appeared in China's capital.

Two banners had been hung on an overpass Thursday amid a column of smoke in Beijing's northern Haidian district. One called for students and workers to strike and oust Xi, labeling him a traitor to his country.

The other condemned life in China during his 10 years as the party's general secretary.
