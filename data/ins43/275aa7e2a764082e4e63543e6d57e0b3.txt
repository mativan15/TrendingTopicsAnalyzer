Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Championship playoff final between Huddersfield and Nottingham Forest at Wembley. We're contractually obliged to call this 'the richest game in football', and what a thoroughly miserable viewpoint that is. This game is about money, of course it is, but it's also about glory, euphoria and the creation of eternal memories. By tonight, one of these teams will be a top-flight side – Forest for the first time since 1999, Huddersfield for only the second time since 1972.
