An audience member at Question Time was spotted mouthing a hard-to-miss swear word over the prospect of Boris Johnson returning as Prime Minister, three months after his resignation.
On last night's BBC One show, Fiona Bruce was joined in the studio by a panel including Graham Stuart MP, Jess Phillips MP and Mr Johnson's sister, columnist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.
At one point during the programme, one person in the audience expressed his view on who he thinks should succeed Liz Truss after she officially stepped down as PM yesterday following a tenure of just 44 days in office.
