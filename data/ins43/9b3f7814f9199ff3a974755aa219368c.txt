A 23-year-old man has been arrested by Charkop police in Kandivali (west) for allegedly cheating a few people of Rs 1.55 crore with the promise of hefty returns on investments in cryptocurrency. The victims approached the Charkop police station after he failed to keep his promise.
An FIR was registered on May 24 against Jagdish Ladi by Charkop police on a complaint from Atish Patil (24), a gym trainer.
While Patil invested Rs 1.65 lakh, a few others approached the police claiming that the total amount was Rs 1.
