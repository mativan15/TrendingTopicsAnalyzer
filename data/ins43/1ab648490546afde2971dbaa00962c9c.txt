Meghan Markle's co-star on Deal or No Deal has said she had a different experience to the Duchess of Sussex on the game show.
The 41-year-old modelled on the NBC game show from 2006 to 2007, while Patricia Kara appeared on screen from 2005 to 2009, where they held up briefcases.
The Suits actor recently reflected on her experience on her podcast Archetypes with Paris Hilton, saying that while she was ‘grateful' for the opportunity she felt she was ‘treated like a bimbo.'
Eventually quitting Deal or No Deal, Meghan explained: ‘I was so much more than what was being objectified on the stage.
