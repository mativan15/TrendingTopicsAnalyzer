Boris Johnson appeared to receive Kyiv's backing last night as he continues to sound out support in the House of Commons for a potential leadership bid. Mr Johnson, who resigned as Prime Minister last month, was considered a leading ally to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky throughout his time in Downing Street.The Uxbridge & South Ruislip MP was thanked by Mr Zelensky in July for his "substantial political support, strong sanctions against Russia and financial assistance" to Ukraine.However, last night's social media post could help boost Mr Johnson's chances of succeeding Liz Truss as he hopes to become the first Prime Minister since Harold Wilson to serve for non-consecutive terms.
