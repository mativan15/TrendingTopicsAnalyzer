You might say that David Cronenberg and Martin Sheen saw the future. In 1983, the director of cult-horror hits like Scanners and the star of Badlands and Apocalypse Now teamed up for The Dead Zone, an acclaimed adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling chiller. Both the book and the movie follow Johnny Smith (played onscreen by Christopher Walken), a schoolteacher who awakens from a car accident-induced coma with the power — or is that curse? — of clairvoyance. As Johnny comes to terms with these abilities, he watches the rise of Sheen's outsider presidential candidate, Greg Stillson, whose promise to make America great again masks the reality of a darker tomorrow should he ascend to the Oval Office.
