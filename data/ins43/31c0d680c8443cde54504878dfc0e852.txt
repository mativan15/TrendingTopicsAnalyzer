Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi will stay true to his vision as he looks to get the Seagulls back on the goal trail as they prepare to face Manchester City.Since scoring three times to draw at Liverpool in his first match in charge after taking over from Graham Potter, De Zerbi's side have failed to find the net in three games.Despite drawing blanks, the Seagulls have registered 54 attempts at goal during their mini drought, which continued with a 0-0 draw at home against strugglers Nottingham Forest.
