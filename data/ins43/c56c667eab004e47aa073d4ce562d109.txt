By Ian Walker Lexington Gold Ltd. said Monday that it has raised 500,000 pounds ($559,150) via a share placing, and that it will use the money towards some projects and for working capital needs. The mining company has placed 10.5 million new common shares at 4.75 pence each, an 8.7% discount to Friday's closing price of 5.20 pence. The company said the placing triggers an automatic conversion of the GBP335,000 loan set out on April 26. "We are looking forward to exciting times ahead for Lexington, including the upcoming release of the maiden JORC Resource for the company's Jones-Keystone project which is expected in early November 2022," Chief Executive Bernard Olivier said.
