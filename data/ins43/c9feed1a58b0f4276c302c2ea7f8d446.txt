Building on the anticipation behind Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Marvel Studios has partnered with Target for a new ad spot. The short serves to highlight the important place of young black women in the fields of science and technology.

In the one-minute clip, Dominique Thorne, playing Riri Williams/Ironheart, is seen working on her armor suit. Caught up in trying to figure out a feasible resource for her creation, Williams gains inspiration from a young girl who also is exploring the construction of a renewable energy source.
