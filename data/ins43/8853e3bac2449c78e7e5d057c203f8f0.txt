People who need hearing aids can now get them over-the-counter at major retailers and pharmacies.

In August, the Food and Drug Administration established a category of hearing aids that don't require a medical exam.

Around 30 million Americans have hearing loss, and the FDA estimates people can save $3,000 per pair of hearing aids.

People with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss will now be able to buy over-the-counter hearing aids at major retailers like Walmart and Best Buy, and pharmacies including CVS and Walgreens.
