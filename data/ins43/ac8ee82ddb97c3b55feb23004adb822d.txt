In a news release Tuesday, LA Golf said it will provide its LPGA partners with "full healthcare including mental health days and paid maternity leave, as well as performance-based bonuses." The company also said it will handle travel logistics for some tournament weeks to allow players to focus on their game and not the details of travel.
