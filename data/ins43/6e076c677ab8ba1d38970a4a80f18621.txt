 PayPal is launching a new rewards program to help people find deals on the internet and save money with the company's Honey acquisition at its core.Honey is a browser extension that scours the internet looking for deals, promo codes, or coupons for online retailers (and a popular YouTube channel sponsor). PayPal bought the developer behind Honey (opens in new tab) back in early 2020, but didn't really do much with it until today. Now with the aptly named PayPal Rewards (opens in new tab), aspects of Honey will serve as the foundation for the new program.
