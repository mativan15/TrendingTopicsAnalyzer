HERE'S HOW MUCH THE NAVY CHARGED HOLLYWOOD PER HOUR FOR THE JET RIDES IN THE MOVIE Scotty's Top Gun Maverick Review Well last night after 3 years Stef and I finally got to see the new Top Gun Maverick movie. IT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT YOU GUYS!!!! It's funny, all day yesterday all I could think was, 'new top gun tonight,' over and over I heard my little voice inside my head. At least I think only I'm hearing that, you don't hear anything do you? Cool, then we should be good. On a scale of 1-10, and keep in mind this is coming from someone who knows the original movie like the back of his hand.
