Kevin Spacey has been found not liable for damages after he was accused of sexual assault.
Anthony Rapp accused the House of Cards actor of assaulting him at a party in 1986, when he was 14 years old, claiming he was the victim of an ‘unwanted sexual advance'.
He filed legal action in September, 2020, and sought around $40million in damages.
Spacey, 63, fiercely denied all allegations against him, and stood trial in New York this month over the claims.
Earlier today, the jury were sent to deliberate and returned shortly after to deliver their verdict.
