Meredith Heil/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Weis Markets, Inc. (NYSE:WMK) is an under-the-radar, family-controlled, well-run regional chain of food stores that I first recommended to subscribers in March 2018. Today, it remains part of the Expanded Portfolio in the Quality + Value Strategies Marketplace service. WMK has outperformed the S&P 500 by 5,060 basis points or 50.60 percentage points during this holding period. To be sure, Weis sits in the crowded food retailer industry, which awakens my bias toward wider economic moats.
