Ravens offensive coordinator Greg Roman has been harshly criticized the past three years and he'll likely face more this season because his unit needs a lot of work.
It's only June, so there's still ample time for the Ravens to add personnel, but the passing game is clearly lacking. They might have one of the worst groups of wide receivers in the AFC. It also doesn't help that star quarterback Lamar Jackson has been a no-show for the first two weeks of voluntary offseason training activities.
It's not like Jackson's arm will make a big difference, but his running ability gives this offense an added dimension and strengthens the passing game.
