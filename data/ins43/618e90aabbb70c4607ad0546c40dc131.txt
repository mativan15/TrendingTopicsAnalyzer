FinkAvenue/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Ebix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBIX) delivered a lot of optimism in its last quarterly report as many of its business models report double digit revenue growth. In my view, if demand for the prepaid cards continues, and more partners team up with EBIX, revenue growth will likely trend north. I do believe that the company will need to negotiate with debt holders, so the stock may not be for everybody. Investors may have to wait for a long time to see the stock price going up to its fair value.
