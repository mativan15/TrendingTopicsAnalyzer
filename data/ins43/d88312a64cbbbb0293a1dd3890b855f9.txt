A top banker and professor at the London School of Economics has claimed global investors now view the UK's economy as being more like that of Italy or Greece as opposed to the US or Germany. Sir Charlie Bean also said it is "disingenuous" of the Government to blame the economic upheaval on a "global phenomenon".He claimed this shift was due to the current state of "political and economic instability" in the country, reported The Times.Sir Charlie appeared on the Sophy Ridge show on Sky News to say there is a "global element" to the UK's higher interest rates and "three quarters or two thirds maybe is the world".
