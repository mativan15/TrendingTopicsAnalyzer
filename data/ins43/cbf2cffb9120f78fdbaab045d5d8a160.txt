The slide in stocks this year partially reflects expectations the US will drop into a recession , but shares of American Express, Capital One and those of other credit card companies could weather a potential downturn in the consumer-driven economy, according to Bank of America. "We think that the pure-play card issuers – American Express, Capital One, Discover Financial Services, Synchrony Financial [and] Bread Financial (BFH) – could offer attractive upside as investor attention refocuses on their cheap valuations and healthy balance sheets," BofA analyst Mihir Bhatia wrote in a note published this week.
