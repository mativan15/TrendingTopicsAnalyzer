Japanese gaming tycoon Kazuo Okada has said he was detained upon returning to the Philippines, over coercion cases related to his takeover of a Manila casino in May, but was immediately released after posting bail Monday.
In a separate statement Tuesday, Universal Entertainment said its founder was arrested at Manila airport after he landed from Japan. Okada and his group are facing arrest for alleged coercion when his men physically took over the Okada Manila resort on May 31, after the Philippine Supreme Court reinstated him as chairman of the casino's operator.
