Winnipeg voters could elect a second Indigenous mayor — Kevin Klein who identifies as Métis and Robert-Falcon Ouellette who identifies as Métis and Cree — are both running in the 11-person mayoral race. Kevin Klein is a member of Painted Feather Woodland Métis, a group out of Bancroft, Ont., that is not recognized by the Métis Nation of Ontario or the Manitoba Métis Federation. Klein, currently a city councillor who says he identified as Métis before entering politics, said he's not wearing his membership to this group "as a badge" and he has not received any benefits from being a member of the Painted Feather Woodland Métis.
