STEWART BEACHis the executive editor of THIS WEEKand the author of many books and articles.Whenever I go abroad I carry personal financing in two forms: a wallet of traveler's checks and a letter of credit from my bank. The traveler's checks are in small denominations for casual needs or transit across a country's borders. The letter of credit provides major sums, but these must be negotiated during banking hours.Incidentally, the only place I have ever been charged for cashing an American Express check was in Savannah, Georgia.
