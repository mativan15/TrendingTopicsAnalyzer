Hedge fund manager Dan Niles believes U.S stocks are in a bear market and could still see further volatility ahead — despite some brief rallies. Here's how he's trading the bear market. U.S. stocks have endured a torrid sell-off this year amid a troubling macro backdrop and an increasingly negative corporate outlook. Trading in U.S. stocks has remained volatile this week, even as the S & P 500 rallied last Friday to snap a seven-week losing streak. U.S stocks rose Thursday as the three major indexes each snapped two-day losing streaks.
