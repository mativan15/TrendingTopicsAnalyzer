(RTTNews) - Hong Kong's consumer price inflation accelerated in September to reach its highest level in seven-and-a-half years, data released by the Census and Statistics Department showed on Friday. Consumer prices climbed 4.4 percent year-over-year in September, well above the 1.9 percent steady rate of increase in August. Further, this was the strongest inflation rate since March 2015, when prices had risen 4.5 percent. The larger increase in September was mainly due to the low base of comparison resulting from the waiver of public housing rentals as part of pandemic relief measures by the Hong Kong Housing Authority in September 2021, the agency said.
