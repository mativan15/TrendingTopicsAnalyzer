SAN DIEGO — Austin and Aaron Nola are each other's biggest fans. Unless their teams are playing each other.

Austin was a typical big brother, never letting his little brother win at anything they played. Aaron tagged along to all of Austin's football, basketball and baseball games.

The Nola brothers face off for the third time in their big league careers on Wednesday. Aaron is set to pitch for the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL Championship Series. One of the batters the 29-year-old right-handed ace will face is his 32-year-old brother, San Diego Padres catcher Austin Nola.
