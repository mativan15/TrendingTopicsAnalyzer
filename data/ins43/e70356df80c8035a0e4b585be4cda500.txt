Jeremy Hunt has said he will scrap most of the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget, in the latest government U-turn designed to boost confidence in financial markets.Days after replacing Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor, Hunt said he would cancel all of the remaining measures in the ill-fated tax and spending plan that had not yet been legislated for.
