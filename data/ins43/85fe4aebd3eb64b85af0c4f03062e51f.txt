The first two games of the New York Yankees' American League Division Series may be a small sample size, but the Aaron Judge experience has been a tad different since the end of his record-setting 62-homer regular season.

Judge opened 0-for-8 against the Cleveland Guardians with a walk and seven strikeouts, including whiffs in his first four plate appearances in Friday's Game 2, a 4-2, 10-inning loss at Yankee Stadium.
