Evgenii Mitroshin Due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices in the second quarter of 2022, Chord Energy (NASDAQ:CHRD) revenues have been higher than in 1Q 2022. However, as a result of the winter storm, the company's production in the Williston Basin decreased significantly in April 2022. In the past few months, CHRD's production has been increasing and according to the high oil and natural gas prices in the third quarter, I expect the company's 3Q 2022 financial results to be better than in 2Q 2022.
