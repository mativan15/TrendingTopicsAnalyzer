Published: 03:25 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 03:26 EDT, 3 June 2022 Ministers must fix or scrap the UK's troubled Ajax armoured vehicle programme this year as it is compromising national security, MPs warned today.The Ajax programme was intended to provide a state-of-the-art reconnaissance vehicle for the Army.However, despite running for 12 years and costing £3.2billion, it has so far failed to deliver a single deployable vehicle.Originally intended to enter service in 2017, the Ajax has been repeatedly delayed due to what the Commons public accounts committee described as 'a litany of failures'.
