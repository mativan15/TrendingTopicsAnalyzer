Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India's biggest company by market value, reported an almost flat profit in the September quarter, as the windfall tax and lower petrochemicals margins more than offset gains from the upstream, retail and digital businesses. The company also announced the demerger of its financial services business. The oil-to-retail-to-telecom conglomerate reported a ₹15,512 crore net profit in the quarter, almost unchanged from ₹15,479 a year earlier and down 20% from ₹19,443 crore in the June quarter.
