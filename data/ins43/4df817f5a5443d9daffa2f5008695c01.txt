James Corden has been spotted publicly for the first time since he was banned from a New York restaurant for alleged ‘nasty' behaviour.
The 44-year-old looked sombre behind dark sunglasses, dressed in a black blazer and T-shirt, completing the look with sunglasses and a black cap. 
He was unsmiling behind his steering wheel as he set out in his car after claiming he had done ‘nothing wrong' at the restaurant.
The Late Late Show host – who has said he expects to talk about the controversy on Monday's episode of his programme in the US – was banned from a New York restaurant this week for allegedly being ‘nasty' to waiting staff.
