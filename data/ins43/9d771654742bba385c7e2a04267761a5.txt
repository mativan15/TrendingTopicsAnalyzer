A woman killed by gunfire outside a Spanaway gas station last week was identified Tuesday by the Pierce County medical examiner.

According to a news release, 39-year-old Angelina Lee died of a gunshot wound to the chest. A GoFundMe page created by the victim's daughter lists the victim's name as Angelina Palmer.

In a video posted on Twitter, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Darren Moss described Palmer as an innocent bystander. Moss said Palmer was leaving the gas station's convenience store when she was hit by a bullet fired from one car toward another outside.
