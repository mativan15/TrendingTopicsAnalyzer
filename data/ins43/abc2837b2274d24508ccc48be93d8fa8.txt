British Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her shock resignation Thursday (early Friday, NZT) after six turbulent weeks in office, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, and raising new questions about her country's role as a beacon of stability in the West. There is broad consensus that this is one of the most chaotic days in British politics in modern history. Britons were shocked with the speed of the new government's unravelling. It marked a humbling, humiliating moment for a party that has been in power for 12 years.
