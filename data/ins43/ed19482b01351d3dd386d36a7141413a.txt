In a 5-4 vote, the justices granted an emergency request from big tech companies to block a lower court order that would have let the law go into effect. It's a victory for the tech industry, which has been under attack from Republican-led states. Conservatives feel their viewpoints are being squashed. The case is still making its way through challenges in lower courts, so it will likely end up before the Supreme Court again in the future.
