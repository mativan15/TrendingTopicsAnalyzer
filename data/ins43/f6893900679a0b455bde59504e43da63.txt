High street fashion favourite Zara is looking to take on the likes of Depop with the launch of its own pre-owned clothing platform.

The platform, which is available as an app, allows customers to buy and sell pre-owned clothes bought from a Zara outlet, with Zara providing customer services.

Unlike Depop though, Zara will provide customers with all the product information on each item of clothing so they don't have to rely on individual sellers' descriptions.

It's the latest example of so-called 'fast fashion' retailers seeking to bolster their green credentials amid increasing scrutiny of their environmental footprint.
