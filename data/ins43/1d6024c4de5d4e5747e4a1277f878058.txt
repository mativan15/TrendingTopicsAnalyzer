A New York Times report called American voters "remarkably apathetic" after the paper's latest poll showed that danger to democracy is not the biggest concern going into the midterm elections.In its latest midterm election report, titled, "Voters See Democracy in Peril, but Saving It Isn't a Priority," the outlet noted the findings of the latest New York Times/Siena College poll. The poll found that a good chunk of independent voters and even some Democrats were willing to vote for 2020 election deniers who they thought would be better for the economy.
