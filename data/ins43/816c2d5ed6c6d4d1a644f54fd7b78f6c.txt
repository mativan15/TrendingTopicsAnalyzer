The LSU offense forgot to show up last week against Tennessee, but it made up for it this week as they had a field day against the Florida Gators.
Jayden Daniels looked incredible. He was poised in the pocket and he looked as if he could make any throw he wanted to. Kayshon Boutte had his best game of the year as he had over 100 yards receiving. Josh Williams was running like his name was Forrest Gump.

The only drawbacks I can think of are that the special teams continue to be the worst part of this football team, and the LSU defense had a few moments where it was torched by Anthony Richardson.
