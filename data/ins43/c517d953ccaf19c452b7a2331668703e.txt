There is a recurring image in Once Upon a Time in Londongrad (Sky Documentaries/Now): a shot taken in 2014 in central London, outside an old block of serenely expensive flats nestling between the Swedish and Swiss embassies. A section of the beautiful iron railings separating the property from the pavement is missing, replaced by a garish mass of carelessly applied police incident tape.The railings have been removed because the British property speculator Scot Young has recently fallen from his fourth-floor window and impaled himself.
