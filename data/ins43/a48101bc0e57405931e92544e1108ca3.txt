Kevin O'Connell has no opponent to prepare for this week, but that doesn't mean the Vikings' first-year coach will be free from watching film or grinding through X's and O's. Only, in this case, O'Connell's focus will be solely on his 5-1 team that has won its past four games by a closer-than-he-would-like average of 5.5 points.
The bye week presents an opportunity for a self-scout in which O'Connell and his coaching staff will dissect everything that has gone right and wrong in the first six weeks.
