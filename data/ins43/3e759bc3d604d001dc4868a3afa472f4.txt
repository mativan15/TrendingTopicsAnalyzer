The Milwaukee Public Museum has raised about $120 million for its new museum project since publicly launching the $240 million capital campaign in July.

Museum president and CEO Ellen Censky shared the museum reached the halfway point in the capital campaign during the Milwaukee Business Journal's Business of Growing Milwaukee event held Tuesday morning at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center.

When the museum announced the capital campaign and shared renderings of its new facility, it had already dedicated $110 million to the project, which included $40 million in funding from the state, $45 million from Milwaukee County and $25 million in private donations from 72 donors.
