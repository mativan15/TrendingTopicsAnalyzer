As global airlines go through a post-pandemic recovery phase, the growth in uptake of premium cabins has been witnessed by carriers across the board. Notably, however, a good part of this growth has come from non-corporate travellers. Singapore Airlines (SIA), which is also reporting this growth, has adjusted its fare products to tap into this new segment of travellers, while also adding more flights to offer a higher number of business class seats on some routes, Lee Lik Hsin, the airline's executive vice president-commercial, told reporters.
