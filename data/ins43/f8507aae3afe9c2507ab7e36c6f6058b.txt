Between Amazon's big Prime Early Access Sale and Target's two-day Deal Days event, it's been a big month for sales.But the discounts aren't slowing down any time soon — Target has already kicked off its Black Friday event and Macy's is currently offering some of its "lowest prices of the season," so you can score deals on everything from tech to home essentials. Though with temperatures dropping, we've been on the lookout for some good fall fashion sales to ring in the season. So we were especially happy to see Old Navy join the mix this weekend and with the launch of its massive 'Giftober' sale.
