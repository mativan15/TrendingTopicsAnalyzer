Have a good long weekend. I've been married for 10 years. In 2018 I received an inheritance in the form of a house I was raised in. My wife decides to give me an ultimatum about the inheritance. She insists that her name is on the deed. She has become so spiteful. Doing and saying things I would have never expected. She's gone as far as saying that she's going to sleep with other men now.
