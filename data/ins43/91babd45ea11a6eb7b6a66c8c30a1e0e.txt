Officials on Friday said they have received consent letters of more than 70% of farmers - the minimum required by law for government to proceed for land acquisition for the second phase of Noida International Airport. Around 1,365 hectare of land is to be acquired for the second phase of the greenfield project from six villages - Ranhera, Kureb, Dayanatpur, Karauli Bangar, Mundrah and Birampur - the officials said. The first phase of the greenfield airport, billed to be India's largest upon completion and costing an estimated Rs 29,560 crore, is under development in the Jewar area of Gautam Buddh Nagar in western Uttar Pradesh, some 75 km off Delhi.
