Drew Angerer/Getty Images News Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has fallen more than 17% year-to-date (YTD). And this is after a much-needed 8% rise last week. The rise may be because some optimism is creeping back into the market, or it may be short-lived. The market will likely continue to be tumultuous. I would not be surprised to see Apple stock retest its recent lows shortly, and many Seeking Alpha contributors are bearish. Even Michael Burry (of The Big Short) has hedged with Apple put options. But this is likely a short-term play.
