A reader is frustrated that Nintendo games will never have state-of-the-art graphics and thinks a partnership with Google could be the answer.
In my long experience of playing video games I would say that it's very obvious that Nintendo is the best developer there's ever been and ever likely will be, considering how much experience they've built up over the decades. You might not like their stuff but no one can deny their quality and the level of their success.
There is a problem with Nintendo though (well, actually there's several but let's keep things focused) and that's that since the GameCube era they've always gone for low-powered hardware and gimmicks over high-powered, cutting edge graphics.
