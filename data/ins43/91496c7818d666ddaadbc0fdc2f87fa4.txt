It was supposed to be Pepper's big entrance. Amy Fiala had been tending to the 2-year-old black Lab as they waited for the wedding to start. Now it was time for the handoff. The bridesmaid, in her forest green gown, would escort Pepper to the altar to stand with the rest of the wedding party while her owners said 'I do.'Fiala knew just how this was supposed to go. Pepper would prance down the aisle. 'Awwwwww,' everyone would coo. They always do. Then Pepper started sniffing the ground. Sniff. Sniff.
