ATLANTA (AP) — Libertarian Chase Oliver isn't going to win Georgia's pivotal U.S. Senate race. But the 37-year-old Atlanta businessman could help determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate over the final two years of President Joe Biden's term.
Oliver is the third name on the ballot in the marquee matchup between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. 
In most states, that make would Oliver an afterthought. But Georgia law requires an outright majority to win statewide office.
