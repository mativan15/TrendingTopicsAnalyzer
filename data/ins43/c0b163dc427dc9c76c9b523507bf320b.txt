jetcityimage/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Simple businesses often turn out to be the best kind, and judging by the wealth it has created since spinning out of PepsiCo (PEP) back in the late 1990s, that's a sentiment that definitely applies to Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM) stock. Yum is the owner and franchisor of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, which between them generate somewhere in the region of $58B in annual system sales. Easy to scale and producing copious amounts of excess cash, it's a business model that definitely has its plus points for investors, evidenced by the circa 15% annualized shareholder returns generated since IPO.
