The NFL trading deadline is quickly approaching (Tues, Nov. 1) and the rumors are starting to fly.

That being stated, will the New York Giants be buyers after their surprising 5-1 start, or will they stick to their rebuilding plan under first year general manager Joe Schoen?

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler sees the Giants as perhaps being in both of those positions and has a trade in mind that they should make. Even though the Giants are thin at wide receiver, Fowler thinks they could still be open to trading one of them.
