Published: 14:18 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 14:19 EDT, 19 October 2022 Grant Shapps made a shock return to the Cabinet tonight little more than two weeks after he spearheaded a rebellion against the Prime Minister's tax-cutting agenda.In a sign of the peril Liz Truss now finds her premiership, she has turned to Mr Shapps to become her new Home Secretary following Suella Braverman's bombshell resignation.The 54-year-old's appointment to Ms Truss's Government comes just over a fortnight after he savaged the PM's now aborted bid to abolish the 45p tax rate.
