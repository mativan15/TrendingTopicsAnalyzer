CLEVELAND — The Yankees lost when Aaron Judge homered. They lost when a Judge homer had seemingly eased the whole team's mounting tension and defibrillated the offense.
They lost when they were about to put themselves one more win away from yet another ALCS showdown against the Astros.
The Judge homer felt like a lucky charm. But the Guardians' offense is relentless in a jab, jab, jab kind of way. And the Yankees' spate of relief injuries finally manifested when Clarke Schmidt — not someone inside Aaron Boone's ever-shrinking circle of bullpen trust — had the ball in his hand and perhaps the Yankees' season on the line.
