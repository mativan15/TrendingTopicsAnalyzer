Published: 07:44 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 08:38 EDT, 3 June 2022 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Dubai police said Friday they arrested and planned to extradite a British man wanted in Denmark over a $1.7 billion tax scheme, one of the country's largest-ever fraud cases. The arrest of hedge fund trader Sanjay Shah came after Danish officials signed an agreement in March allowing for extradition between the United Arab Emirates and Denmark. Shah has maintained his innocence in interviews with journalists while living in Dubai over the last few years on the city-state's manmade Palm Jumeirah archipelago, but never appeared in Denmark to answer the accusations.
