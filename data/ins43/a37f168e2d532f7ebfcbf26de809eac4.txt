The first Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary under Singapore's presidency, being held in Paris on October 20-21, will be closely followed amid Pakistan's intense efforts to exit the 'grey list', its limited efforts to curb terrorism infrastructure notwithstanding. India will present its case on existence of terrorism infrastructure in Pakistan as well as threats of cross-border terrorism from such infrastructure, said people aware of the matter. In its statement after the plenary in June, the FATF had said, "At its June 2022 plenary, the FATF made the initial determination that Pakistan has substantially completed its two action plans, covering 34 items, and warrants an on-site visit to verify that the implementation of Pakistan's AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism) reforms has begun and is being sustained, and that the necessary political commitment remains in place to sustain implementation and improvement in the future.
