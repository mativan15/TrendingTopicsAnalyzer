The White House announced Friday evening officials in the administration met with Iranian activists amid the women's protest against mandatory wearing of the hijab.

Assistant to the President and Director of the Gender Policy Council Jennifer Klein, with other National Security Council officials, met with the activists to hear what more the administration can do to help the women in Iran who have been protesting since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.

'The group discussed the pivotal role of Iranian women in mobilizing a diverse coalition of Iranians protesting against the brutality of the government, and discussed the diplomatic and economic tools the United States is pursuing to support Iranian protestors and hold the Iranian government accountable,' the White House readout of the meeting said.
