Telecom Italia (TIM) and Italian state investor CDP have signed a preliminary agreement to combine the phone group's fixed network assets with those of state-owned broadband rival Open Fiber, they said late on Sunday.The long-awaited move aims to pave the way for the creation of a unified ultra-fast broadband network across Italy, as CEO Pietro Labriola works on a turnaround plan for TIM focused on a full-blown split of its landline grid from service operations.TIM said the preliminary agreement had been signed also by infrastructure funds Macquarie and KKR, which hold minority stakes, respectively, in Open Fiber and in TIM's last-mile network unit FiberCop.
