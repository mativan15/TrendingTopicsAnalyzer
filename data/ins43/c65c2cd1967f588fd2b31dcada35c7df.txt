Gary O'Neil maintains he has received no approaches about any other jobs as he remains fully focused on his caretaker role at Bournemouth.Since taking over from Scott Parker, who was sacked just four Premier League games into the season on the back of a 9-0 thrashing at Liverpool, former midfielder O'Neil has steadied the ship with a six-game unbeaten run.Despite the upturn in form, there remains uncertainty over his long-term future at the Vitality Stadium amid a background of an expected takeover by American businessman Bill Foley.
