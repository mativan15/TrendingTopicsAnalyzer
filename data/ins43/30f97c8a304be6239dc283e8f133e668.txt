We're just hours away from Game 2's opening pitch of the Yankees-Astros ALCS.
The Astros enter Thursday's contest with a 1-0 series lead and the home-field advantage. As Justin Verlander picked up the win in Game 1, Framber Valdez will be tasked with following suit on Thursday and helping Houston make good on its -150 odds.
At Tipico Sportsbook, a whopping 85 percent of tickets betting on the spread are for the Astros to cover (-1.5). Yet, 63 percent of bets on the sides have the Yankees Moneyline (+120).
