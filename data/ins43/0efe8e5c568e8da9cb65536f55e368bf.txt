HOUSTON -- The Yankees announced their 26-man roster ahead of Wednesday's opening game of the American League Championship Series against the Astros at Minute Maid Park, including the addition of rookie infielder Oswald Peraza.
Right-handers Frankie Montas and Greg Weissert were also added to the active roster, with New York opting to carry 13 pitchers and 13 position players. Montas will be used in a relief role. A Trade Deadline pickup who has historically pitched well against the Astros, Montas last appeared in a big league game on Sept.
