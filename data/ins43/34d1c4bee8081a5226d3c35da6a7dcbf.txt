BANGUI (Reuters) - The head of Central African Republic's top court, which has stymied a push to enable President Faustin-Archange Touadera to keep running for office, has defied a government order to retire.

The Constitutional Court last month annulled a commission for proposed reforms that would let Touadera, 65, stand for a third presidential poll in line with a trend in some parts of Africa that opponents see as creeping autocracy.

The already twice-elected Touadera's government earlier this month issued a decree telling 28 higher education officials born between 1946 and 1955 to retire from Dec.
