Phase 1 Study (with 58 healthy volunteers) of STI-1558 was completed in Australia with 300 mg, 600 mg, 1,200 mg and 2,000 mg doses in the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the study and 300 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg BID (twice a day) daily for 7.5 days in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the study. The pharmacokinetics (PK) were dose proportional in the SAD study. In the MAD study, the 600 mg BID dose cohort achieved trough concentrations (Ctrough) significantly above the EC90 value for viral inhibition by STI-1558 and no accumulation was seen in the subjects, supporting a 600 mg twice daily dose for 5 days as the recommended dose for standalone treatment without ritonavir as booster.
