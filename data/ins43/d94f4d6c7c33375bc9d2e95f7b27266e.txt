The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (Insacog), the group of government institutions involved in genome sequencing of the coronavirus, held a meeting on Friday to review its strategy as some parts of the country see an uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases again. Fears have emerged that an outbreak is again starting as states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra are witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases. The Centre on Friday indicated the possibility of a "localised spread of infection" in these states as they are reporting a higher contribution to India's total cases.
