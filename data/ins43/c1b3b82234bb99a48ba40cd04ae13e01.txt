May 30—From 1988 to 2002, the Everly Brothers — Don and Phil — drew thousands of fans from as far away as Europe to their annual Everly Brothers Homecoming Music Festival in Central.

And John Prine, who performed at many of those festivals, made Muhlenberg County famous with his 1971 recording of "Paradise" — "Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County/Down by the Green River where Paradise lay."

Now, Central City and Muhlenberg County are reaching back to those days to honor all three and hopefully draw fans from across the United States and Europe.
