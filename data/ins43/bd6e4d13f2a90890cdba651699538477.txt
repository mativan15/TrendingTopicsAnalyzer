Jeep has finally launched its first all-electric car at the Paris Motor Show, although the news wasn't exactly a secret beforehand. It's called the Avenger, and Jeep reckons it will be the company's bestselling model by the end of 2024. The Jeep Wrangler 4xe had already managed to become the bestselling plug-in hybrid in America, but of course that still has an internal combustion engine. The Jeep Avenger, in contrast, will be marketed in most countries as electric-only, although Spain and Italy will still be getting a fossil fuel-powered version.
