The 75th Cannes Film Festival wrapped up on Saturday evening with many European films winning awards. Palme d'OrThe Palme d'Or went to film director Ruben Östlund for 'Triangle of Sadness', which joins the closed circle of double winners after receiving his first award in 2017 for 'The Square'.We find in the film the same acid and uncompromising humour about the world of the powerful. Take a luxury boat, a Russian multi-billionaire, a Marxist American captain, and a couple of money-obsessed influencers, and you get a yacht that looks like the Titanic.
