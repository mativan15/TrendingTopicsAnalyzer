Events moved at pace in Westminster on Friday as Kwasi Kwarteng was sacked as chancellor in a shock move while Jeremy Hunt was made his replacement and Liz Truss announced another U-turn in her mini-Budget.While his appointment was welcomed by some Tory MPs as 'an experienced pair of hands', some questioned why Mr Kwarteng was the one who had to go when he was pursuing policies Ms Truss advocated for in her leadership campaign.At a hastily arranged news conference in Downing Street, Ms Truss dismissed calls for her resignation, saying she is 'absolutely determined to see through what I have promised'.
