gchapel It's been a rough 18-month stretch for the Silver Miners Index (SIL), and especially First Majestic (NYSE:AG), which has seen a 70% drawdown from its 2021 highs. The magnitude of this drawdown should not surprise investors, given that the stock never belonged above $15.00 in the first place, let alone above $20.00 during its one-day spike. Normally, a pullback of this magnitude would leave the valuation near distressed levels, but First Majestic continues to trade at a significant premium to net asset value, making it un-investable at current levels.
