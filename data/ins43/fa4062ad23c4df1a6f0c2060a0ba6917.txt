[Photo/CHINA DAILY] Japanese actor Yasufumi Minowa, 39, has been stranded at home in Beijing because the movie and TV industry has been seriously affected by the recent wave of COVID-19 cases. "It seems like this year's situation is more severe than in previous years. A lot of shoots have been suspended or delayed," he said. Though some Japanese actors returned home because of the epidemic, Minowa was one of several who stayed in China.
