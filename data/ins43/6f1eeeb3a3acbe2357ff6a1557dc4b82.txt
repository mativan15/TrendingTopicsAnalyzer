COSTA MESA, Calif. (PRWEB) June 01, 2022 If someone is in a position where they cannot make their regular mortgage payments, a Loan Modification is a great way to save their right to homeownership and improve their financial situation. While forbearance may be a short-term solution, a loan modification will permanently modify their existing terms. For example, a lower interest rate, extended repayment period, and lower monthly payments may be the perfect solution for their financial situation. The goal of a Loan Modification is to lower the amount of money a homeowner owes to their Lender while preventing Foreclosure.
