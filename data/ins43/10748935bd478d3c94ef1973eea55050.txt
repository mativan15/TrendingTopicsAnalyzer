 Sony has finally unveiled the cost of the DualSense Edge, and its high price point is honestly a little shocking.The DualSense Edge wireless controller for PS5 will run you a hefty $199.99 / £209.99 (Australian pricing to be announced). For your money, you're getting swappable modules like thumbstick caps and back paddles, textured grips, a white-on-black aesthetic, and miscellany including a carry case and a lockable USB-C connector housing.That's a fair bit more than the cost of a standard DualSense controller, which retails for $69.
