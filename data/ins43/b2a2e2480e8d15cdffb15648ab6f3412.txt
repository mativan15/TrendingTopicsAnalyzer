If you don't already have a My Best Buy account, you should. It's free to sign up, and right now, could score you some serious savings. Today only, Best Buy is offering members exclusive discounts on select TVs, Beats headphones, exercise equipment and more. And those with a paid Totaltech subscription will have a chance to get their hands an on elusive next-gen Xbox Series X at an exclusive sale event that kicks off at 9:00 a.m. PT (12:00 p.m. ET) and ends at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) -- though I doubt it'll stay in stock for that long.
