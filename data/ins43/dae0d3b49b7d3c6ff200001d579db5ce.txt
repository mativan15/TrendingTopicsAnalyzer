The Ohio State University has been known as an NFL factory for quite some time. The Buckeyes produce some of the top talent year in and year out. As a matter of fact, since the year 2000, Ohio State has had more players taken in the NFL draft than any other team with 157 players drafted. At No. 2 is Alabama with 144.
The NFL is all about big money and part of that cash flow is jersey sales. The NFLPA released its rankings of the top 50 jerseys sold in 2021-2022 and as you might expect, former Buckeyes are littered throughout the list.
