May 28—Only have a minute? Listen instead

A horror on the magnitude of what took place at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde on May 24 is felt around the world.

That includes Brownsville, where Gaspar Hernandez, owner of the Golden Corral franchise here, has a personnel connection to the school and the 19 children and two teachers gunned down by a troubled teenager with an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle.

Hernandez's sister, Mercedes Salas, teaches 4th grade math and science at Robb Elementary. Her classroom was opposite the classrooms where the gunman erased those lives in the span of an hour.
