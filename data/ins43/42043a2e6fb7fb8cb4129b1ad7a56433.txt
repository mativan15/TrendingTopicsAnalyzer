Lions running back D'Andre Swift came through the bye week in better shape than before the break, but the talented starting RB is still officially questionable for Sunday's game in Dallas.
RB coach and assistant head coach Duce Staley was asked several questions about No. 32 in Honolulu blue.

'Good. Last couple of days been out there working, been looking pretty good,' Staley said of Swift.
The talented but oft-injured Swift has missed the last three games with both a shoulder injury and a sprained ankle, a wound Swift said he suffered in the first half of the Week 1 loss to the Eagles.
