OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sparred in the House of Commons on Tuesday over concerns of a looming recession and how the federal government should be tackling inflation, with Trudeau accusing Poilievre of 'blocking' the Liberals' bill to implement housing and dental benefits. Tuesday's Question Period saw a back-and-forth between Trudeau and Poilievre, with the Conservative leader accusing Trudeau of 'bragging about' the $500 top-up for low-income renters as part of the proposed affordability legislation, while adding 'these days, you can't even rent a dog house in the backyard for that kind of money.
