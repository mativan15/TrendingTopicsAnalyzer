Tech workers paid in equity are watching their wealth slide alongside their employers' share prices this year, but the news may not be as bad as it seems. The Nasdaq Composite is down 23% for the year and is well entrenched in a bear market. Higher interest rates tend to hit tech companies especially hard, as they damage the value of their future cash flows . Few names have been spared from the downturn: Established stalwarts such as Alphabet are down about 23% in 2022, while pandemic-era darlings Robinhood and Peloton have cratered more than 43% and 60%, respectively.
