By Chris Wack Salarius Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares were down 25%, to $3.73, after the company said that it is voluntarily pausing new patient enrollment into a sarcoma-drug trial due to a patient death. The stock hit its 52-week low of $3.56 earlier in the session, and is down 69% year to date. The biopharmaceutical company said the pause of its Phase 1/2 trial of seclidemstat as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcomas was as per protocol design and due to a metastatic FET-rearranged sarcoma patient death that was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction.
