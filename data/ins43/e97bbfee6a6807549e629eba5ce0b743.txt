The 39th CHEO Telethon is underway on CTV Ottawa, a chance for residents of Ottawa, eastern Ontario and western Quebec to support care for children and youth in our community. The telethon comes at a busy time for CHEO following two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. "This is our third pandemic telethon, and so the demand has added up. The demand for deferred care, COVID is still here, other respiratory issues – we've had the busiest May ever," CHEO President and CEO Alex Munter said at the start of the CHEO Telethon.
