Quarter-miler HM Priya was undoubtedly the favourite to take home gold at the U 20 Federation Cup in Nadiad, Gujarat on Friday until a certain 17-year-old outshone her by just .01seconds. Meerut's Rupal clocked a solid 52.48s under the scorching Gujarat sun. Rupal had already achieved the U 20 World Championships qualification mark of 55.20s in the heats itself where she clocked 53.91s.
Rupal was naturally overjoyed at Friday's victory over the much-fancied Priya, who topped the India charts last year.
