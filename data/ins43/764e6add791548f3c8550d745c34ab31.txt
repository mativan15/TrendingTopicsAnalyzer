Amazon will build its third metro area delivery center in the Anoka County suburb of Centerville and the facility could be up and running as early as next year. The Centerville City Council at its May 25 meeting revealed and approved plans for the 140,000-square-foot warehouse that until then had been referred to by city leaders only as "Project Banjo." Scott Seroka, a spokesman for the Seattle-based e-commerce giant, confirmed the development and said company data led it to Centerville. "We build where our customers are from and order from," Seroka said.
