Jeannette Vickman cherished her 11 years working as a mental health therapist for Melrose Center, where she helped people of all ages recover from eating disorders.

But Vickman began to burn out during the shift to remote tele-health sessions during the pandemic. She longed to reconnect with people face-to-face.
