London's Community Kitchen, which helps to feed an extraordinary 14,000 people a week, began, in 2014, with a simple observation: Mumtaz 'Taz' Khan noticed his seven-year-old son had started asking for double the amount of food in his packed school lunch every day. When Khan asked why, his son said he was taking the extra food for his pal who couldn't afford to bring lunch of his own and was always hungry. Khan, a chef who had briefly worked under Marco Pierre White in the late 1990s, was shocked to hear that story.
