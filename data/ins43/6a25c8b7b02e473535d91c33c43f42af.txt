(Bloomberg) -- Silvergate Capital Corp. shares slumped as much as 15% after the cryptocurrency-focused bank's third-quarter results missed consensus estimates. The bank reported earnings-per-share of $1.28 for the quarter, lower than the average analyst estimate of $1.41, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total cryptocurrency market valuation dropped by about $2 trillion in the last year as investors have, at least temporarily, lost interest in cryptocurrencies and other risky growth assets.
