May 27—ACME — Owners of a horse show venue in Acme Township should be set to clear a major zoning jump as they gallop into the 2022 season.

Traverse City Horse Shows and township officials separately announced a resolution to a dispute over Flintfields Horse Park's special land use permit. Morrissey Management Group, which owns the business and venue, will meet most of the conditions of a permit township trustees amended in April.

Those include completing changes to the site's stormwater management system and getting the necessary approvals, building emergency roads with signs and building numbers and getting the required permits from Grand Traverse County and Grand Traverse Metro Fire for a two-story tent, according to a release from the township.
