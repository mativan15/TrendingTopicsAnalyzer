PITTSBURGH —

Tristan Jarry stopped 39 shots, Jeff Petry and Jan Rutta scored their first goals of the season and the Pittsburgh Penguins drilled the Kings 6-1 on Thursday night.

Petry and Rutta, brought in by the Penguins during the offseason to give their blue line a little more heft, scored on long shots from the point. Rickard Rakell and Jake Guentzel found the net from in close as the Penguins made Mike Sullivan the first coach to reach 300 victories with the club.

Jeff Carter also scored against his old team and Ryan Poehling added his first career goal in the third period as Pittsburgh improved to 3-0-1.
