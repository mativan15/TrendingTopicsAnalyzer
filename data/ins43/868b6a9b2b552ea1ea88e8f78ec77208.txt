'Electoral authorities made it easy to vote in 2018 because of the pandemic (through mail-in ballots) and if we could make it easy to vote then, why don't you do it universally instead of creating a narrative that was not true?' King said.LoadingThe civil rights leader and his wife Arndrea Waters King were speaking at an event on Tuesday (US time) in suburban Atlanta with community group GALEO, whose aim is to mobilise members of Georgia's Latino community to be more engaged in elections.Unlike Australia, it is not compulsory to vote in the US, resulting in millions of people either not registering, or simply not showing up on election day.
