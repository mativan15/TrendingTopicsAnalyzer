LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - A handful of attempts to privately trade depositary receipts in VTB and Gazprom show how some Western investors are still seeking ways to buy and sell stock in Russian companies rendered near untouchable due to sanctions.Europe, the United States and Canada blocked certain banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system in March in a raft of sanctions on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine, leaving investors scrambling to cut their exposure to Russia.In retaliation, Moscow banned Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners and barred foreign investors from selling Russian assets.
