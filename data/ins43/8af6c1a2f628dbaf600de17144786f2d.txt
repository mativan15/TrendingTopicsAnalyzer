The recent gruesome murder of famous Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala has brought Goldy Brar, a Canada-based gangster, into the focus of discussion. The Canada-based thug claimed responsibility for Moosewala's murder on a social media post. Now, it has been feared that another prominent Punjabi singer Mankirt Aulakh is suspected to be on the hitlist of Goldy Brar. According to sources, Mankirt Aulakh received threats from the Davinder Bambiha gang in April. After that, Aulakh had asked to increase his security cover.
