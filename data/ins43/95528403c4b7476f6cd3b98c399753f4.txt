Slash Film Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) is dead for real. At least, the mad scientist who just keeps coming back seems to be really, fully dead by the end of "Stranger Things" season 4, when Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) escapes his clutches yet again. The often-villainous "Papa" might be gone, but that doesn't mean the actor who plays him isn't still invested in the future of Netflix's biggest series. Modine, it turns out, has a theory about Eleven's powers that actually makes a lot of sense.
