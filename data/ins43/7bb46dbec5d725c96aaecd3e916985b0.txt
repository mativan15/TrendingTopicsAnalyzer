Variety - Film News Tom Felton revealed in his just-released memoir, 'Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard,' that a young Daniel Radcliffe used a photo of Cameron Diaz to help him know where to look while filming the broomstick flying sequences in 'Harry Potter' (via Insider). It appears Radcliffe has long been outspoken about his Diaz crush, telling Us Weekly in 2014 that she was his 'first celebrity crush.' The actor said on the 'Capital Breakfast' radio show earlier this year that Diaz remains 'very high on the list' of his celebrity crushes.
