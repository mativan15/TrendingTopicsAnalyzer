The King has officially reached billionaire status. 
LeBron James, 37, has a net worth of $1 billion, according to Forbes — making him the first active NBA player to make the billionaires list. James has reportedly earned more than $1.2 billion in pretax earnings.
The Lakers star — whose business ventures and investments include Lobos tequila, Uninterrupted and Spring Hill Entertainment — earned $121.2 million last year alone, when he was named by Forbes as the second-highest-earning athlete in the world.
