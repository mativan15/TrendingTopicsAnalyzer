Bernard Havard still remembers the exact day he took over direction of the Walnut Street Theatre: Nov. 15, 1982. The theater was dark, had no programming and was struggling in its operation as a rental facility. Havard soon convinced the board to form the Walnut Street Theatre Company, a nonprofit regional producing theater.

Now, as he begins his 40th season at the National Historic Landmark as its president and producing artistic director, Havard is battling decreased attendance and revenue in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
