By CBS Baltimore Staff October 21, 2022 / 3:44 PM / CBS Baltimore BALTIMORE -- Standout Ravens running back J.K. Dobbins will be sidelined for several weeks to recover from a knee surgery set for next week, reports Adam Schefter, an NFL insider for ESPN. Dobbins was held out of the second half in the team's 24-20 loss to the New York Giants last week after complications with his knee, the team said. "His knee tightened up. It just didn't respond, probably to the turf maybe, I don't know," Head Coach John Harbaugh said.
