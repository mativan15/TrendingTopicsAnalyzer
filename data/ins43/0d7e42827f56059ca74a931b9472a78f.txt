TORONTO - Live Nation has confirmed that American musician Beck will no longer be opening for the North American leg of Arcade Fire's 'We' tour, which begins at the end of October.

A media spokesperson for the entertainment company did not provide a reason for Beck's cancellation, and says the opener will instead be Haitian band Boukman Eksperyans.

Canadian musician Leslie Feist announced in early September that she was leaving Arcade Fire's tour after sexual misconduct allegations were made against lead singer Win Butler.
