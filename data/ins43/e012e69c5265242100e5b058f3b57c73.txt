A tenant who stabbed his landlords to death in a "brutal" knife attack has been jailed for at least 33 years for their double murder.

Daniel Briceno Garcia, 46, attacked Sonia Butron Calvi, 66, and Edgar Aguilera Daza, 60, at the home they shared with five others in Stockwell, south London, on 1 April 2020, during the first national COVID lockdown.

Police found the couple lying in a 'bloodbath' at the property, the Old Bailey was told.
