By Dean Seal Albemarle Corp. has been awarded a nearly $150 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department to build a lithium-concentrator facility in North Carolina. The specialty chemicals maker said Wednesday that the grant is part of a series of projects funded by the White House's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that aims to expand domestic manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. The new commercial-scale lithium facility would be constructed at Albemarle's location in Kings Mountain, a small city located about 30 miles west of the company's headquarters in Charlotte, N.
