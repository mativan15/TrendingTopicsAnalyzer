A parking ticket from a car park in Cornwall (Image: Cornwall Live)Newquay is said to be Cornwall's most-visited town, popular with tourists from across the country. Many visitors to Newquay, tourists and locals alike, drive in and face the task of finding a place to park in the town. Some of the town's car parks, particularly beach ones, have developed something of a reputation over the years with CornwallLive reporting stories of people being caught out by parking fines and expensive tickets. In fact, at one privately owned car park, eight hours costs £35 - the most expensive seaside parking in the country, Cornwall Live reports.
