The Philadelphia Phillies attendance at Citizens Bank Park during the 2022 regular season fell 15.5% from 2019 to 2.27 million attendees, according to research from Philadelphia Business Journal sister publication Sports Business Journal.

The ballclub ranked 16th among 30 Major League Baseball clubs. The Phillies averaged 28,459 fans between its 81 home games in the regular season. Citizens Bank Park has a capacity of 43,000.

The decrease from 2019 — the last season not affected by the pandemic — comes as the Phillies surged to end an 11-year playoff drought.
