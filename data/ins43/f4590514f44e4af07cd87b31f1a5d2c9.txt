The state pension age was traditionally 60 for women and 65 for men, but this was changed for the purpose of alignment for both the sexes. The state pension age was 65 for both men and women, but this rose to 66 - its current level - with further increases expected.However, there is some opposition to the idea of increases to the state pension age which have now been laid out in a petition posted to the Parliament website. The petition, entitled "Do not increase state pension age above 66", states: 'The state pension age is set to increase from 66 to 68 over the coming years, and there are concerns this could be further increased in the future.
