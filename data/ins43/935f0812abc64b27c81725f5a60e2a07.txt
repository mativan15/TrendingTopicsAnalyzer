By Chris Hoffman October 19, 2022 / 6:38 PM / CBS Pittsburgh PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Gas prices are creeping back up again and hitting our wallets. According to AAA, the Pittsburgh area average is about $3.93. President Joe Biden is hoping to change all of that. The president is selling 15 million barrels of crude oil from the nation's emergency supply and will begin refilling the reserve. Ideally, it will lower the price of gas or at least stabilize it."They are high. But what are you going to do? You've got to live," John Gray of the North Side said.
