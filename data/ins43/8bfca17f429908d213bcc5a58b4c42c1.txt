Antonio Conte's Spurs travel to Manchester on Wednesday night to face Erik ten Hag's Red Devils.
Tottenham have won seven of their first 10 league games to climb to third in the Premier League, level on points with defending champions Manchester City and four behind north London rivals Arsenal.
While Spurs have not been the most fluent team in the English top-flight this season, they are one of only four teams to lose just once alongside Arsenal, Man City and Newcastle United.
