Derek Selwood says he couldn't be more excited to start a new job. It's at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel, in the laundry room -- the very job he's been gunning for. 'I'm very ready to start working," he said. "I've worked quite hard for the past few weeks to get myself ready, get prepared for the interview." Selwood just graduated from a program called Ready, Willing, and Able – offered through Montreal-based organization Giant Steps – which helps neuro-divergent people participate in the workforce.
