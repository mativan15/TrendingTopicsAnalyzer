An index that tracks the prices of Rolex watches fell 5% in May after a booming year of increases.

Watch sellers were asking for overly "optimistic" prices in February, WatchCharts founder Charles Tian said.

Even with the decline, luxury watches have still performed better than stocks or crypto in 2022.

The resale market for luxury wristwatches was on fire earlier this year, but it appears to have had a dose of cold water in recent months.

A price index that tracks 30 models with high trade activity fell by 9.
