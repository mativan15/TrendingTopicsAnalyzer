But it's more than that.  Driving through flood waters can cost you big money.  Experts are saying if there are severe flooding conditions Friday into Saturday, stay home!   Mark Jenkins, with AAA, said they always discourage people from driving into puddles and flooded streets as you never know what could be under the water that'll cause damage.
