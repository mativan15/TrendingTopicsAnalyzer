Advocates say the reversal is part of a pattern from the government to evade scrutiny of the Terrorist Screening Database, a secret, FBI-maintained list of known or suspected terrorists subject to heightened security screening at borders, and of the smaller No Fly List of those barred from US airspace.Hundreds of thousands of people have been placed on the lists since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
