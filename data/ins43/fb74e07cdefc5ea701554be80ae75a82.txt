Oct. 21—Richard Sasnett is expanding the PuroClean franchise to the Aiken and North Augusta areas.

PuroClean is an emergency restoration company that a property owner, residential or commercial entity can call when they experience loss — be it flood damage, water damage, fire damage or mold. The company will also clean damaged furniture, and does work for individuals and for insurance companies.

Sasnett's background is in health care, but he decided to switch fields to spend more time with his family two years ago when he and his wife found out they were expecting twins.
