The Lethbridge Astronomy Society, along with multiple local partners, have come together to create a new, to-scale model of the solar system. It's only the second one of its kind in Canada. According to the organization, it's nearly impossible to truly understand the size and magnitude of our solar system, which is why they decided to shrink it down. "It's one of the largest models like this in the world, but the nice thing about it is its still small enough that you can see the whole thing in a day pretty easily," said society president Tom Anderson.
