To this day, the murderer has not been caught. The victims were two 15-year-old girls, Maila Björklund and Anja Mäki, and their 18-year-old boyfriends, Nils Gustafsson and Seppo Boisman. They had travelled for a camping trip to the shore of Lake Bodom, 13 miles from Helsinki and had gone to sleep at 10.
