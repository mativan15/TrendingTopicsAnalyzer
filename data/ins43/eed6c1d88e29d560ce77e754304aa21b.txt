The Blues, who opened with a 5-2 victory against visiting Columbus on Saturday by scoring three unanswered goals in the third period, will return to the ice Wednesday night in Seattle, opening a three-game trip that includes stops in Edmonton and Winnipeg. "It's an exciting time of year," said defenseman Colton Parayko, who is set to play in his 500th game for the Blues.
