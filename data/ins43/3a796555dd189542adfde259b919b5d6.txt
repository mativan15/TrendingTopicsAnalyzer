OSPREY, FL — Delaney Lockwood was devastated when she first learned that Hurricane Ian destroyed the Venice Theatre's main stage, the powerful winds tearing its roof clear off.The theater was an important space for the 13-year-old Osprey girl, as it had become a creative outlet for her in recent years. 'When my friend sent me the picture during the storm, my heart sank and I started to cry,' she told Patch.She quickly switched gears, though, and began thinking about how she might be able to play a role — even a small one — in rebuilding the venue.
