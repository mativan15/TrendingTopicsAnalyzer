LOS ANGELES (AP) — A pair of five-star recruits are sure to turn heads at UCLA this season. In an era when freshmen burn brightest, however, it's two seniors who could prove invaluable to the eighth-ranked Bruins' NCAA title hopes.

Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Tyger Campbell are back for their fourth seasons in Westwood, a couple of battle-tested veterans who arrived at the same time as coach Mick Cronin to rebuild a program that owns a record 11 national championships.

The COVID-19 pandemic canceled the NCAA Tournament in 2020, when the Bruins were riding a hot streak in March.
