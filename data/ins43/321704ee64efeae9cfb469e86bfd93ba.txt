Another Tesla Inc. earnings call, and another fanciful Elon Musk prediction that likely encouraged yet another open file at the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The chief executive of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +0.84% told investors Wednesday that he believes the valuation of the electric-car maker will exceed the combined market capitalization of the two most valuable companies in the world: Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.08% and Saudi Arabian Oil Co. 2222, +0.42%. 'I am of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap,' Musk said.
