A Taiwanese singer whose sudden rise to fame two decades ago and then abrupt disappearance from public life has experienced a resurgence in popularity in China this week after she appeared on a mainland TV reality show. Cyndi Wang Xinling is participating as a contestant in season three of the popular girl group reality show Sisters Who Make Waves season three produced by television network Hunan TV. The 39-year-old singer and actress from Taiwan was a household name in China in the early 2000s and was known as the 'sweetheart Goddess' for her sweet-looking appearance and vibrant dancing style, usually while wearing a school uniform.
