On the economy, the current government is the most left-wing one Britain has seen since the mid-1970s if not before. If that seems an odd claim to you, let's remember who these governments were.
After the Sterling Crisis of 1976 the IMF was called in and it was IMF rules that determined how the economy was run for the next three years. The IMF required money supply growth targets, privatisation (British Petroleum was first, in 1976/77), and cuts to the deficit and public spending (even NHS spending was cut).
