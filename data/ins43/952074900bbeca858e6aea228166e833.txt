Garry Swney​ has been dairy farming for 50 years and says the Government's new farm emissions' proposal will cost him $150,000. He was one of 100 vehicles that converged in a smaller protest in Invercargill, while the rest of Groundswell NZ supporters were encouraged to join the 'We're not going to take it' protest in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Swney said he'd been in contact with his accountant regarding the cost of the proposed tax and had been told that for an 'average size' dairy farm of about 360 cattle, it could cost about $80,000 per year.
