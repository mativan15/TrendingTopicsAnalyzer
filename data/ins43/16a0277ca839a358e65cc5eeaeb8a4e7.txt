A recent study by Levari et al. from Harvard University and the University of Virginia questions the assumptions that the best performers (e.g., most successful authors, singers, chess players, business people) give the best advice.
The research, published in the May issue of Psychological Science, is summarized below. Investigating the Value of Advice From the Best Performers
