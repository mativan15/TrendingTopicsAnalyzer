BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia launched a sharp counterattack on the Congress leadership a day after the opposition party accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "cowardly conspiracy" against its president Sonia Gandhi and her MP son Rahul Gandhi following the Enforcement Directorate's summons to them for questioning in the National Herald case.
