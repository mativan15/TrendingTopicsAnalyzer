If you're curious about how Alabama will respond from the heartbreaking loss at Tennessee, history tells us the Crimson Tide should be just fine. Since Nick Saban went 7-6 in Year 1 at Alabama, he has never lost back-to-back regular-season games.

Saban has faced Mississippi State four times after defeats at Alabama.
