A Florida judge on Saturday gave initial approval to a settlement of more than $1 billion US to families who lost loved ones in the collapse last year of a Florida beachfront condominium building in which 98 people, including four Canadians, died.The quick settlement following the unprecedented collapse of the 12-storey Champlain Towers South building in the early morning hours of June 24, 2021, means that potentially years of court battles will be avoided.Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman, who is overseeing the lawsuits filed after the collapse, said during a hearing held remotely that it was the best possible outcome given the loss of life and property in the disaster.
