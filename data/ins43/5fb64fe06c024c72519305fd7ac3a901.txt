Jack Reynor said that he bonded with Chloe Grace Moretz on 'The Peripheral' before the co-stars filmed their Prime Video sci-fi series.
'It was still pretty heavy COVID times, with a lot of restrictions in place. So, we read through the script a lot on FaceTime with each other, and that would lead to us having hours of conversations about our lives,' Reynor, 30, said about Moretz. 
'We became close through doing that. By the time we arrived on set, we felt like we knew each other well … Everybody was surprised to see the shorthand we had … when we got there.
