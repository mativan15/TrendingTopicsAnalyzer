By Chris Wack Centessa Pharmaceuticals PLC shares were down 20% at $3.60 after the company said it is discontinuing development of lixivaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, including two Phase 3 studies. The stock fell to its 52-week low of $3.50 earlier in the session. The company said the decision is based on a thorough reassessment of the commercial potential of lixivaptan as a potential best-in-class therapy for patients with ADPKD, and the incremental development challenges and associated costs, following a recent observation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevations in one subject in a study.
