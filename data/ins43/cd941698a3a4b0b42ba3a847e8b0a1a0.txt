Sometimes it surprises me to think that we are living in a different era. An era where autocracy rules the roost, and the principles of democracy and the tenets of the Constitution are not being followed, says Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan.In a telephonic interview with The Hindu on his way to the Visakhapatnam International Airport on October 17, Mr. Pawan Kalyan expressed his dissatisfaction over the way the State government had handled his planned Jana Vani programme.The government had succeeded in scuttling our programme, but I am satisfied that 70 of my workers and leaders, who had been arrested on Saturday, were released, and only nine sent to remand.
