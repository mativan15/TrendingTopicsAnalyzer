A large Greater Cincinnati private company that has flown under the radar is about to go public through a transaction with a specialty purpose acquisition company.

Fairfield-based specialty logistics and jewelry distribution company Quality Gold Inc. has agreed to a business combination with New York-based Tastemaker Acquisition Corp., a publicly traded SPAC. The deal, expected to close in the first quarter next year, values the combined company at $989 million.

Quality Gold generated $534 million in revenue in fiscal 2022, which ended in March.
