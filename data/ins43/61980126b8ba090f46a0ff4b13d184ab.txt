A Portland man bought a double-decker bus and spent 10 months turning it into a tiny home.

Whit Scott, the owner, estimates that he spent about $25,000 on the conversion.

The bus is parked in Scott's backyard and can be rented for short-term stays on Airbnb.

The first time Whit Scott laid eyes on a worn-down, double-decker bus, he knew he had to have it.
