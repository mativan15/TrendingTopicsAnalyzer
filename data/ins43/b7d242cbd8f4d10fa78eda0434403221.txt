The captain of the Ottawa Senators is hoping Canadian Tire Centre will be rocking for the home opener on Tuesday night. After losing the first two games of the season on the road, the Senators will host the Boston Bruins for the home opener at Canadian Tire Centre. It is the first of five straight games in Ottawa for the club. "It's going to be nice to get back. We are excited to see that place rocking. We need them to be loud," Brady Tkachuk said following the Senators game in Toronto Saturday night.
