PROVIDENCE — A dozen educators from the city's public schools marched down the street in front of the Providence Place mall, wearing matching hoodies with the words 'Providence Schools' and carrying red book bags full of leaflets about career and tech education.

They are part of a new campaign to combat chronic absenteeism, defined as missing at least 10% of the school year, or 18 days in a typical 180-day school year.

A whopping 59% of the district's 22,000 students were chronically absent last year.
