As the tenth largest city in the United States and the self-proclaimed 'Capital of Silicon Valley,' San José, Calif. has deployed or tested dozens of 'smart city' technologies in the past several years—including automatic license plate readers (ALPR), public Wi-Fi with Facebook's Terragraph, gunshot detection technology, and predictive policing. In response to public concern, the city of San José started what it dubbed its 'Digital Privacy Advisory Taskforce' in the fall of 2018.But according to a series of emails obtained by Motherboard via a public records request, the city has been ignoring and butting heads with the privacy experts it appointed to keep its surveillance technology in check.
