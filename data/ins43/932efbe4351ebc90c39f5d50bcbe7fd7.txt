iPhone 14 Plus is witnessing a much lower demand than expected, leading Apple to halt production.
 The iPhone 14 hasn't impressed customers and critics, and the same can now be said for the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple's newest addition to the iPhone lineup with a larger display and bigger battery is apparently finding not many takers. As a result, the decision makers in Cupertino have already asked their contract manufacturers to halt production of the iPhone 14 Plus immediately. The company is reassessing the demand and could come out with a new forecast.
