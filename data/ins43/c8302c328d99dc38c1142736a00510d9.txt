The USC Trojans are unbeaten. They have a Heisman Trophy candidate in quarterback Caleb Williams. So obviously, the Trojans are underdogs of more than a field goal to Utah (4-2) on Saturday.
While that line may seem out of whack to the casual bettor — and based on all the public money coming in on USC, that's the case — Utah is in a great spot at home to give the Trojans their first loss.
USC has played two road games this season, beating lowly Stanford by 13 and barely getting by Oregon State, 17-14.
