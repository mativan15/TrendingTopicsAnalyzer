AFTER months of political upheaval in Maharashtra, a bypoll for the Andheri East seat has culminated in sudden, unexpected calm. The BJP has withdrawn its candidate, in solidarity with Rutuja Latke of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), leaving her the only contestant in the fray.
The BJP took the decision after both the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) of Raj Thackeray and the NCP appealed to the party to not field a candidate against Rutuja, the wife of Sena MLA Ramesh Latke, whose death necessitated the November 3 bypoll.
