The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has challenged the Bihar government's decision to suspend Dr Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of Patna's Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), without giving him an opportunity to defend, and said it will take legal recourse if the government did not revoke its decision taken on Friday.IMA's national president Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said he has written separate letters to Bihar governor Phagu Chauhan and chief minister Nitish Kumar, seeking their intervention to revoke the suspension order.
