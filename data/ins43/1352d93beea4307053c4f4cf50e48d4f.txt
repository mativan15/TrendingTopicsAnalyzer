Investors can earn very close to the average market return by buying an index fund. But in any given year a good portion of stocks will fall short of that. That's what happened in the case of Polaris Inc. (NYSE:PII): its share price dropped 27% while the market declined 25%. The silver lining (for longer term investors) is that the stock is still 5.7% higher than it was three years ago. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 11% in the last 90 days. Of course, this share price action may well have been influenced by the 7.
