ARLINGTON, Texas — Oklahoma State coach Josh Holliday pointed to the miscues.

The Cowboys' cracks in their defense emerged at the most inopportune time. A mishandled bunt. An errant throw.

It was certainly costly.

'They took full advantage of it,' Holliday said.

Fourth-seeded OSU's run in the Big 12 Tournament ended Saturday night in Globe Life Field in a stinging 9-2 loss to No. 5-seeded Texas, leaving the Cowboys one win shy of a third straight championship game appearance.
