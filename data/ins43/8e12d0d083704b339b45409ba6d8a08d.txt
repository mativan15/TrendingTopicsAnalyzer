Coinbase Global (COIN) will significantly benefit from the potential transfer of about $1.6 billion in USDC from MakerDAO to Coinbase Prime, Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau said in a research note to clients.

A Maker Improvement Proposal submitted by Coinbase in September laid out how a chunk of USDC could be moved to Coinbase Prime for custody and rewards. 'Coinbase is uniquely situated to offer a USDC Rewards Program to MakerDAO that meets this evaluative criteria,' according to the proposal.

Currently, 88% of the votes are in favor of the proposal, with a final deadline in three days.
