British Prime Minister Liz Truss described herself as 'a fighter and not a quitter' Wednesday as she faced down a hostile opposition and fury from her own Conservative Party over her botched economic plan while losing another member of her government. Within hours of Truss' appearance in Parliament for a regular session titled Prime Minister's Questions, a senior member of her government left her post with a fusillade of criticism. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she resigned after breaching rules by sending an official document from her personal email account.
