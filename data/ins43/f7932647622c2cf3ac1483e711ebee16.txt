The scheme offers £100 payment to UK households who are not on the mains gas grid. The payment will ensure that a typical customer using heating oil does not face a higher rate of growth in their heating costs since last winter, in comparison to those using mains gas who are supported by the energy price guarantee.The Government said eligible households on alternative fuels who also have a domestic electricity account would receive £100 as a credit on their electric bill this winter.Others who aren't with an electricity firm at all will instead receive the £100 through an AFP Alternative Fund.
