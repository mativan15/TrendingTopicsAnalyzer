When Thebe Magugu was a fashion student in Johannesburg, little did he know that a second-year assignment would turn out to be a dress rehearsal for one of the most high-profile — and purposeful — collaborations of his career so far.

Students at the LISOF fashion school were tasked to interpret Christian Dior's New Look, the pinch-waisted, fan-skirted look that caused a sensation in 1947. Magugu made his jacket in red, with 'very small, rounded shoulders' and many darts, and the skirt a swirling, full-circle style.
