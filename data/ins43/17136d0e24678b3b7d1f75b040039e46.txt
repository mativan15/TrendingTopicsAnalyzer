I am looking for advice/guidance from anyone who has already taken the extra PT job or freelance path in addition to working FT. Has it worked for you? If yes or no, why? What advice or guidance can you offer? Am I out to lunch?

I am currently FT remote in marketing on a competitive salary, but I need to supplement my income with something PT (my contract does not prevent me from working elsewhere). I am earning a competitive salary, so a job switch isn't optimal for me for the additional $.

I have freelanced a few times over the years to help friends/family start small businesses, but never as a real gig and am nervous that I won't get clients.
