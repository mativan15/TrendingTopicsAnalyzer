...Baby One More Time. Since U Been Gone. Can't Stop The Feeling. I Kissed A Girl. Some of the biggest pop songs of the past 20-odd years, and they all have one man in common: Mysterious Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin. The songwriting and production genius has explored many different styles since penning his first pop-with-a-capital-P hits for the Backstreet Boys back in the mid-'90s, embracing rock and R&B to work with the likes of Coldplay, The Weeknd and Lizzo in recent years. But his latest reinvention is perhaps his most surprising yet: Martin's catalogue of hits form the backbone of & Juliet, a new musical retelling of Shakespeare's classic story set to around 30 of Martin's most recognisable songs.
