Due to the slow functioning of the GSTN portal, the CBIC announced on Thursday that it is considering extending the deadline for filing GST returns for September. GSTR-3B is filed in three instalments on the 20th, 22nd, and 24th of each month by taxpayers from various states. With Thursday being the final day for some taxpayers to file returns, many users reported slowness in the portal while filing their monthly GSTR 3B returns. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) said in a tweet that it had received "an Incident Report" from GSTN regarding slowness in the system, as well as a proposal to extend the due date.
