The restaurant owner who banned James Corden from his eatery has admitted to ‘feeling strange' about accusing the star of treating his staff poorly. 
Keith McNally, owner of Balthazar restaurant in Soho, claimed that Corden, 44, was ‘extremely nasty' towards his employees after they accidentally mixed-up the comedian's food order. 
According to McNally, the Late Late Show host demanded two rounds of free drinks while on another occasion, the star was allegedly rude to staff after his wife Julia Carey's omelette was cooked wrong.
