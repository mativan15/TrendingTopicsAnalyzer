Former Coronation Street star Ruxandra Porojnicu, who played Alina Pop in the soap, has been in a nasty accident that's left her feeling very sore.
Ruxandra used her Instagram account to reveal a bandaged left hand and wrist, captioning the picture, ‘I'm many things but clumsy too – which is hilarious but also painful.' There are no details of what happened to her other than it was obviously a clumsy accident, but at least Ruxandra is seeing the funny side to the incident, which leaves us hopeful that she'll be feeling better very soon.
