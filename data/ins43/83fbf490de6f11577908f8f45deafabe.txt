US President Joe Biden's off-the-cuff remark that he thinks of Pakistan 'as maybe one of the most dangerous nations in the world' has predictably created uproar in what is perhaps the most America-dependent nation in the South Asian region.
Pakistanis are bristling at the implied questioning of the security of its nuclear weapons. The remarks caught the Shehbaz Sharif government off-guard. And it has played right into the full blown polarisation in Pakistan between those who believe former prime minister Imran Khan is their messiah, and those who are on the side of the Sharif family and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz).
