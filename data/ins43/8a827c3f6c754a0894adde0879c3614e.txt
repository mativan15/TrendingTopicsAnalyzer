Wharton professor Wendy De La Rosa and Foster School of Business professor Esther Uduehi first met while pursuing their PhDs. Both took part in The PhD Project, a non-profit organization that aims to diversify the business faculty pipeline. Inspired by this approach, they've now created The Tenure Project to support underrepresented scholars (e.g., Black, Indigenous, and Latinx scholars) through the next big obstacle: obtaining tenure in a historically inequitable system.
In this interview, De La Rosa and Uduehi touch on the far-reaching issues behind the tenure gap, how they started The Tenure Project, and the success of their first conference.
