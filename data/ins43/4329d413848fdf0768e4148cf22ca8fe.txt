 James S. Brady Press Briefing Room 1:28 P.M. EDT  MS. JEAN-PIERRE:  Good afternoon, everybody.  So, we have big news today, and — that is going to benefit as many as 30 million Americans.  Starting today, hearing aids will cost thousands of dollars less than before.President Biden's executive order on competition called on the FDA to make hearing aids over the counter without a prescription; that is now a reality.  This week, retailers across the country, including Walgreens, CVS, Best Buy, Walmart, Hy- — and Hy-Vee will start selling over-the-counter hearing aids in store and online.
