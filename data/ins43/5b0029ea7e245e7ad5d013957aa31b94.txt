Stormwater improvements on State Highway 3 are nearing completion, logging trucks have wrecked a bridge in the Stratford District, and councils are having trouble with Waka Kotahi funding, the Taranaki Regional Transport Committee was told. Waka Kotahi provided an update on roading projects around the region, including the laying of new stormwater pipes near Waitara. The committee heard that 510 metres of stormwater interceptor pipe and 350m of water main pipe had been installed, with work expected to be complete by the middle of this month.
