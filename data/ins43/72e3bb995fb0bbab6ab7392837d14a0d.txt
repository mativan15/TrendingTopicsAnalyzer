Wake Technical Community College is asking voters in November to approve a $353.2 million bond measure to fund capital projects throughout the county aimed at addressing local workforce needs.

Health care is the main focus of the bond measure, with funds supporting a $105 million expansion that will allow the college to grow programs related to nursing and other areas, Wake Tech President Scott Ralls said. The college also plans to allocate a significant portion of the bond funds to building out a permanent campus in western Wake County near Apex.
