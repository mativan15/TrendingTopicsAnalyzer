Tottenham have confirmed they will travel to Israel to play against Roma for the I-Tech Cup in pre-season to fine-tune their preparations ahead of the new Premier League campaign. The match will see Jose Mourinho face Spurs in the managerial dugout for the first time since he was relieved of his duties by the north Londoners back in April of last year.The Portuguese boss failed to win a trophy at Tottenham but has since enjoyed a better time of things in charge of Roma, who clinched this year's Europa Conference League title with a narrow victory over Dutch outfit Feyenoord in the final on Wednesday evening.
