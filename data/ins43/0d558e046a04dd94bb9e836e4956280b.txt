LANSING — When Michigan voters cast their ballots for governor, they can't complain they lack a clear choice.

The Nov. 8 election is the first time women have been on top of both the Democratic and the Republican tickets.

Gretchen Whitmer before the pre-tape of her State of the State speech at Detroit Diesel in Redford Township on Jan. 26, 2022, and on right, Tudor Dixon makes a victory speech after winning the Republican Party nomination for governor at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel in downtown Grand Rapids on August 2, 2022.
