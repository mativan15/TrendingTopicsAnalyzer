Dak Prescott is back.

Six weeks after sustaining an injury to his right throwing thumb that required surgery, the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys has been medically cleared to be a full participant in practice, head coach Mike McCarthy said Wednesday.

Prescott had been listed as a limited participant in practices leading up to the Week 6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and now can prepare for the Cowboys' Week 7 home game against the Detroit Lions.

The Cowboys have not indicated if Prescott will start Sunday's game.
