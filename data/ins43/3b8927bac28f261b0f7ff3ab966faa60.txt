The most aggressive initial challenge to President Joe Biden's student debt relief program reached the Supreme Court on Wednesday. It will fail. The reason why is simple. For decades, the conservative justices have tightened the rules around who's entitled to sue in federal court. And under any reading of precedent, the Republican activists who brought this lawsuit have absolutely no right to challenge a single dollar of debt forgiveness. Those activists work at an organization called the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, or WILL, a dark money conservative group that's most notorious for trying to purge hundreds of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2020.
