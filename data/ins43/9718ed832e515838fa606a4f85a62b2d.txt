(Adds detail, Twitch, YouTube) MOSCOW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A Moscow court on Tuesday said it had fined Amazon.com Inc 4 million roubles ($65,000) for failing to remove banned content relating to drug use and suicide, the first such penalty in Russia for the U.S. tech giant. Russia has fined other foreign tech firms for not removing content, part of what critics say is a campaign by the Kremlin to restrict the influence of Western technology companies, especially since Moscow sent its armed forces into Ukraine.
