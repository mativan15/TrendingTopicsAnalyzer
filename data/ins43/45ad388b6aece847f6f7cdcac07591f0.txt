In a victory for tech giants, America's first and only tax targeting digital ads has been declared unconstitutional. In 2021, Maryland introduced a digital advertising tax for companies with over $1 million of gross revenues from digital advertising services in Maryland and $100 million in annual gross revenues. But from the get-go, the law wasn't well received.The Tax Foundation raised a number of legal concerns with the tax, including definitional ambiguity, suspect sourcing rules, and unworkable geolocation requirements.
