Millionaires have been urged to donate their automatic £400 energy bill rebate to Britain's poorest.
After chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled the grant for every household in England, Wales and Scotland, a Cornwall-based entrepreneur announced the ‘Robin Hood' fund.
It asks those more fortunate to donate their money for distribution to hard-hit families facing ‘acute distress'.
‘For some, this rebate is a welcome income to help tackle the costs of living, which are going through the roof,' Rob Love told NeedToKnow.
