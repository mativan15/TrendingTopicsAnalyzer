Pharr, TEXAS – Thelma Leal can't escape the color blue.

She wore a blue blouse to her job at a furniture store. She drives a blue car. And for decades, she voted blue in every election.

In fact, her husband at one point ran for city commissioner as a Democrat. Until Leal, 63, started asking questions.

Why did she have to vote Democrat? Were there other options? Her husband's father, a die-hard Democrat, told her 'we vote Democrat because that's what we do.'

'What we do,' lo que hacemos has long been a creed in the Rio Grande Valley, a floodplain in the southern tip of Texas with blazing heat, where no one dared to run as a Republican.
