I published a piece in the Daily Beast this week on mental illness and mass shootings. Please give it a read.Recently some middle-aged 'irony boy,' I believe a failed podcaster and failed musician, came after me for whatever inscrutable reasons. This person saw my office in a video I had posted and decided it was the entirety of a studio apartment, then extrapolated from there that I was poor, or something. This is all very strange - if I was that person's age and still Doing Irony Online I'd probably be too embarrassed to critique anyone about anything - but hey, it's the internet.
