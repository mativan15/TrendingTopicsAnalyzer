And the award for most tedious show of the year goes to… the National Television Awards, which ironically viewers would never vote for unless threatened with a razor blade by a Peaky Blinder or double-dared by Ant and Dec. Someone please give the format a double espresso. It needs a buzzer, a comedy roast or Alison Hammond (please let her host everything). Joel's Dommett's strong line in puns might work on The Masked Singer, but it wasn't enough for Wembley Arena and a show that has lost its energy and gloss.
