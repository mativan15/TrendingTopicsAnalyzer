The technology sector is taking an unusually prolonged beating this year. Even the biggest names are getting tossed around like rag dolls. The Nasdaq-100 index, comprised of the 100 largest companies on the exchange, is down a stunning 32.4% since the end of 2021.
Tech stocks that soared in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic have been hit hardest. Few have been hit harder than Zoom Video Communications (ZM -3.26%). Shares of the stock have collapsed around 86.9% from their peak in 2020. Zoom's stock price may have gotten way ahead of itself in 2020.
