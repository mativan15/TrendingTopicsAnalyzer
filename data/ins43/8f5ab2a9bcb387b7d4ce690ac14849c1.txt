Starboard Value has built a sizable position in Vertiv Holdings Co., as another company that went public via a blank-check deal becomes a target for activism, according to people familiar with the matter.

Starboard is believed to be pushing for operational improvements at the supplier of equipment and services for data centers, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn't public.
