In the six years that Rudenko has been in Pittsburgh, he has coached local middle school and high school students as well as worked with Loh to coach the U.S. International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. He also helped train U.S. and international high school students as part of the Mathematical Association of America's Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program at CMU. Under Loh's guidance, the U.S. have placed first four times since 2015. Rudenko has been part of that effort.
"I think that he brings very clearly a strong intellectual ability," Loh said.
