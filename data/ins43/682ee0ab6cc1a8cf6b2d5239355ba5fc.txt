It looks like James Corden will be unable to catch a low-budget flight with Ryanair anytime soon as he has been banned.
The airline company announced its decision shortly after a New York restaurant claimed the actor and presenter had been ‘extremely nasty' to its staff.
Corden apologised profusely to Keith McNally, the owner of Balthazar in Manhattan, after he was briefly barred following allegations he had been unpleasant to employees on two separate occasions.
However, it seems Ryanair remains unimpressed as it declared on its official Twitter account: ‘James Corden BANNED from Ryanair.
