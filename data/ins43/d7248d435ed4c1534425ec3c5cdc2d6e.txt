(RTTNews) - After closing lower for two consecutive sessions, stocks may move back to the upside in early trading on Thursday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 108 points. The futures remained positive after payroll processor ADP released a report showing private sector employment increased by much less than expected in the month of May. ADP said private sector employment climbed by 128,000 jobs in May after jumping by a downwardly revised 202,000 jobs in April.
