NASA has issued another asteroid warning for today. Could this space rock put Earth at risk?
 NASA's Near-Earth Object Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer, or NEOWISE, completes half its trip around the Sun every six months. The spacecraft takes images throughout the journey which are stitched together to form a sky-map, according to NASA. This sky-map shows the positions and the brightness of millions of celestial objects in space. NEOWISE also helps scientists keep an eye out for any asteroids which might have the potential of Earth impact.
