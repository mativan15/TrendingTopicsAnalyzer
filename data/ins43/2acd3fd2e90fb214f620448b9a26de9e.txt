Twenty-five top US companies paid workers a medium average salary of more than $100,000 in 2021, according to an analysis conducted by The Wall Street Journal.Many of the highest-paid workers were in the tech sector, where competition for highly technical talent has pushed salaries up over the past few years.Although the tech industry is experiencing a recent hiring slowdown, many tech companies have previously been engaged in a war for qualified talent as the labor force struggled to keep up with employers' technical needs.
