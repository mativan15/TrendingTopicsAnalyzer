Dear Miss Manners: My husband and I just got married a couple days ago. We are very into games, puzzles and dinosaurs, and our wedding centerpieces reflected that: We fashioned little baskets with Rubik's Cubes, dice, notepads, cards and small puzzles, along with dinosaurs that I crocheted. We also had many, many board games.

The guests were very excited when we announced that they could take home the games and centerpieces. Everything got politely distributed, for the most part … except the dinosaurs.
