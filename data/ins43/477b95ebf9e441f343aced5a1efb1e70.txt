Sir Keir Starmer has called for an immediate general election following the removal of a second prime minister in this Parliament. Is he right? Constitutionally, no.
Under the Westminster system, a government survives if it enjoys the confidence of the House of Commons. In post-war years, a government has only once been forced to go to the country at a time not of its choosing - James Callaghan's minority administration which lost a vote of confidence in March 1979.
There is no constitutional requirement for a prime minister, selected in the middle of a government's term of office, to go to the country to confirm their appointment.
