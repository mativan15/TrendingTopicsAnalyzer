Included in the price is the following:

 A five-hour wait outside Manchester Airport because some unwashed middle-class tosser with a nose ring and the IQ of a King Chow Mein Pot Noodle has glued himself to the tarmac of the A555. Any attempt to remove the said tosser, by ripping him from the road and leaving his left ear behind, will be swooped on by the police.
