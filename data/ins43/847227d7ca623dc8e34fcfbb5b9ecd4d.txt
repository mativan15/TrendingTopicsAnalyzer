The IRS on Friday raised the amount that Americans can set aside for retirement in their 401(k) and other tax-deferred plans next year.  Beginning in 2023, workers will be allowed to contribute up to $22,500 in their 401(k), an increase of $2,000, or about 9.8% – the biggest jump since 2007, when the limit was $15,500. The IRS makes such cost-of-living adjustments annually, but in times of painfully high inflation, the increases are more significant and impactful for taxpayers. The government reported last week that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of everyday goods, rose 8.
