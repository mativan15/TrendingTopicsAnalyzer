Rishi Sunak should scrap an estimated £200 million 'loophole' that allows wealthy owners of second homes to receive multiple energy rebates, Labour's shadow chancellor has said.In an interview with The Independent, Rachel Reeves claimed the system's design was a result of the chancellor's support package being 'cobbled together at the last minute' and amid damaging Partygate headlines.After the extraordinary U-turn to impose a windfall tax, Ms Reeves also hit out at the inclusion of a tax relief measure for energy companies investing further in fossil fuel extraction — describing it as a 'get out of jail card'.
