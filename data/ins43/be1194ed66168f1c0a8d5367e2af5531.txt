Liz Truss and the Conservative Party are facing increasing pressure from the British press early in the week following a Monday that saw the Prime Minister's platform dramatically binned by her new Chancellor.The Sun dubs Liz Truss the 'ghost PM' across its front and uses its editorial to call for the party to consider installing Rishi Sunak or Ben Wallace as PM.'The great office of Prime Minister was yesterday reduced to an unedifying game of ghost-hunting,' it says.If Truss cannot quickly sort herself out, the grown-ups need to get in a room with 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady and agree a peaceful transition to a sensible figure like Rishi Sunak or Ben Wallace'So what happens next? The thought of a broken PM having to appear at PMQs tomorrow is almost tragic.
