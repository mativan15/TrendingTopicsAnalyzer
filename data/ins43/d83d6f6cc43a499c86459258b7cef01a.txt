More dividend-paying firms either increased their dividends or paid extra dividends than in previous months, while fewer firms announced dividend cuts. It's the kind of combination that typically produces good outcomes for the owners of dividend-paying stocks. Here's May 2022's dividend metadata for the U.S. stock market: 4,041 firms declared dividends during May 2022, a decrease of 453 over April 2022's count and 2,188 more than did a year earlier in May 2021.
