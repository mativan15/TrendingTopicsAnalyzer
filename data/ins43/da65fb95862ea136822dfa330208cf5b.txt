Jesse Lee Soffer is not leaving "Chicago P.D." just yet. The actor, who left Chicago P.D. earlier this month, will return to helm Episode 16, according to reports. The episode will be shown in 2023. Soffer played Det. Jay Halstead in 189 episodes of NBC's police series. He revealed in August that the tenth season would be his final, and he appeared in the first three episodes. 
While shooting for an emotional scene, Halstead told Upton it's not black or white, good or evil, right or wrong, and there's no more of this, and he needed it back.
