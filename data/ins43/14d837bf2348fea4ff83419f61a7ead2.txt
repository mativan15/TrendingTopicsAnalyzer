Mattarella will decide who gets tasked with assembling a coalition after meeting on Friday with Meloni, Berlusconi and the third main right-wing figure, League leader Matteo Salvini.

Meloni's party, which has staunchly backed Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion, triumphed in Italy's general election last month. But relations with campaign ally Berlusconi have since soured. Audio tapes of him expressing sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin during a huddle with lawmakers from Berlusconi's Forza Italia party emerged this week.
