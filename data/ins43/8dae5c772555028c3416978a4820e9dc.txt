Perhaps setting up another future spinoff, Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead introduced a terrifying new kind of walker — one that can turn doorknobs and climb walls, and even has the brainpower to use a rock as a weapon.

The fearsome foursome fought off the assault and learned in the ickiest way possible — when Aaron ripped the 'mask' off of a Whisperer that wasn't actually a Whisperer at all — that rumors of smarter walkers actually hadn't been exaggerated.
