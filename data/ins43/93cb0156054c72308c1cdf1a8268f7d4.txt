Couples are scaling back their wedding plans because of the cost-of-living crisis, a poll suggests.

The poll of 2,000 adults who are engaged, or have been married in the last decade, revealed more than half (54 per cent) thought the tough economic landscape was a reason to cut corners on their big day.

And almost two-thirds (63 per cent) of couples were planning smaller, more sustainable weddings to both protect the planet and their purse strings.

An estimated 350,000 nuptials are set to take place in 2022, with couples choosing pre-owned centrepieces (24 per cent) and, jewellery (16 per cent).
