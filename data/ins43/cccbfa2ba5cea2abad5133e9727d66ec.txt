It was mighty morphin' time at a California restaurant Friday.
 
Staff at NōKA Ramen in Oakland turned into real-life crime fighters when a woman entered their establishment in need of help while the group was dressed in Power Rangers costumes.
 
Detailing that staff at the restaurant were dressed as the beloved superheroes because NōKA Ramen serves a cocktail called "The Noka Rangers," a Twitter user posted a thread about how the scary — and slightly surreal — ordeal went down.
 
"The craziest thing just happened at dinner," the user wrote in their initial tweet.
