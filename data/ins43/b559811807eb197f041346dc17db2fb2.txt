The first renders of Apple's iPhone SE (fourth generation) have leaked courtesy of the somewhat reliable Jon Prosser. These renders show a device that's reminiscent of the now discontinued but immensely popular iPhone XR, with the company moving away from the small iPhone to a more standard size. Apple's next iPhone SE should make its debut in 2024, according to other reports.
Apple's iPhone SE has often used the chassis of older iPhones. The initial SE looked a lot like the iPhone 5, while the 2020 and 2022 iPhone SE had the iPhone 8's design.
