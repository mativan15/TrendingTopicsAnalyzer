Think about those innocent children in Texas, and don't let them out of your mind.
Think about their shock and fear as the gunman opened fire.
Think about their suffering, their little bodies on the floor of the elementary school, the sirens, the screams.
Think about their parents, hoping, praying, waiting in agony. Think about the brothers and sisters, the grandparents, entire families sentenced to lifetimes of the impossible — trying to make sense of senseless violence.
Think about the children who survived but will never escape the memory.
