For EV start-up Rivian (RIVN), 2022 has brought with it mainly headaches and headwinds, and the supply-chain snags have resulted in the company lowering its production expectations for the year.

However, on the earnings call earlier in May, the company sounded upbeat about meeting its production targets, and following a recent chat with the company's CFO, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sees enough reasons to stay upbeat.

For one, despite the departure of executive vice president of manufacturing engineering Charly Mwangi, the arrival of new COO Frank Klein amidst the restructuring of the business (the company is splitting the commercial business which manufactures the Amazon delivery van from its retail business, which makes the R1T and R1S) is a good one.
