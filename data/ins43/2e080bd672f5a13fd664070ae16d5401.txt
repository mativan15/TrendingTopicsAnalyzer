Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is in hot water. That's not too surprising, considering it's been the story of the last few years for this stock. Over the last few years, the multinational computer company has struggled to hold its own against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in the semiconductor industry. The rivalry between the two companies is legendary, but AMD is closing the gap at a brisk pace.





Meanwhile, Intel has other things to worry about as well. Earlier this year, we saw a lot of market enthusiasm for semiconductors as the pandemic proved just how important chips are to the economy, and shortages drove up prices.
