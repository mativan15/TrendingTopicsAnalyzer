The federal government wants a six-month prison sentence and a $200,000 fine for Steve Bannon, the longtime Trump ally who has been convicted of contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee. 'For his sustained, bad-faith contempt of Congress, the Defendant should be sentenced to six months' imprisonment — the top end of the Sentencing Guidelines' range — and fined $200,000 — based on his insistence on paying the maximum fine rather than cooperate with the Probation Office's routine pre-sentencing financial investigation,' prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo filed Monday.
