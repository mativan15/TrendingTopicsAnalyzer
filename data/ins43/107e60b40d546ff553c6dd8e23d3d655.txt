Boris Johnson has sparked speculation about a potential return to the forefront of the Conservative Party after reportedly jetting back to the UK from his Caribbean holiday after Liz Truss's resignation. Mr Johnson was ousted in July after a series of prominent departures lamenting his inconsistent recollections about claims of misconduct by former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher. Former British MEP, and Boris's father, Stanley Johnson said he would welcome his son's return to Number 10 and suggested his election would be "quite a saving" for the UK.
