If the future is electric, then the Back To The Future car has arrived—at least as an electric concept.The famous DeLorean DMC-12 gull-wing, stainless steel car is back from the reincarnated DeLorean Motor Company. On Tuesday it revealed its Alpha5 concept car as an all-electric DeLorean with strong Porsche vibes. DMC, which is no longer the failed auto company started by John DeLorean in 1975, but a rebooted classic car parts brand, first teased a product revival in April. This week, the first images and basic details of the pre-production car were released about the Alpha5, including its name.
