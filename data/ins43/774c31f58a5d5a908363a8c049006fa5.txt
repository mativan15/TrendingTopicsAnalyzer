Rihanna is said to have recorded two songs for the upcoming Black Panther: Wakanda Forever soundtrack, sending fans into overdrive.  
While the world is patiently waiting for the artist to release new music after announcing she will perform at the Super Bowl in 2023, it seems as though we might have that wish granted sooner rather than later. 
According to Hits Daily Double, there are whisperings of Rihanna having musical involvement in the sequel film. 
They report that the movie will follow its predecessor by having an original score release as well as an ‘inspired by' album, which will be released by Marvel and Disney, as well as Def Jam and Westbury Road.
