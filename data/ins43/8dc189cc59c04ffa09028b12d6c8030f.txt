A 22-year-old man was tied to a two-wheeler and made to run for about two kilometres on a busy road in Odisha's Cuttack city as he failed to repay Rs 1,500 on time, police said.
Two people were arrested after the matter was reported to the police on Monday.
'The accused were charged with wrongful confinement, kidnapping and attempt to murder,' Cuttack city Deputy Commissioner of Police Pinak Mishra said here.
The hands of Jagannath Behera were tied with a 12-feet-long rope, the other end of which was attached to the two-wheeler.
