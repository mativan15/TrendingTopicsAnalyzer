At least 647 Norwegian oil workers plan to strike from June 12 if state-brokered wage mediation fails, labour unions said on Friday, putting some crude output at risk of shutdown although gas may not be affected.Workers are seeking above-inflation pay increases and other changes to their contracts but have not released details of their demands.Members of the Industri Energi and Lederne unions plan strike action at 10 permanent offshore installations, including the Njord A, Valhall, Gudrun and several Oseberg platforms, as well as three mobile service units, the unions said.
