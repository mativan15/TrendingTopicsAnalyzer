frender After the recent price collapse, Real Estate Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLRE) is now in a buying zone as the indices are nearing the bottom of the current bear market. A dividend ETF like this one could be very attractive for long-term investors who want to watch their investments appreciate steadily while collecting hefty dividends. Its portfolio concentration on high-quality equity REITs makes it less sensitive to high rates when compared to mortgage REITs. Furthermore, most of its portfolio holdings are set to post record financial numbers in 2022 with expectations that the momentum will continue in the coming year.
