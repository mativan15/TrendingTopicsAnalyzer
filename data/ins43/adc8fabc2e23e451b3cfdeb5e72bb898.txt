getty India's edtech industry is growing tremendously and is estimated to reach $10.4 billion by 2025 with 37 million paid edtech users. I've noticed this rise is fueled by the growing request for nonacademic courses in second- and third-tier cities and the demand for customization in the edtech industry. Over the past five years, the sector has raised about $4 billion in private investment, bringing in global edtech leaders such as Byju's, valued at $15 billion. We have also seen market leaders emerge, such as Byju's, Unacademy, upGrad, Vedantu and more.
