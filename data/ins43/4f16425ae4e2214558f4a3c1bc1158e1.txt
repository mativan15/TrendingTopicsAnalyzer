New York City's chief tech honcho regularly carries a gun to work, a decision that has left staffers concerned and questioning why he's been permitted to do so, according to three sources who've seen him packing heat on the job.

Chief Technology Officer Matt Fraser's sidearm appears at odds with the rhetoric from his boss, Mayor Adams, who has bemoaned the proliferation of firearms and has expressed deep concern about a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that rolled back a New York State law restricting concealed weapons.
