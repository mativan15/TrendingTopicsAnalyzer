CHICAGO, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Berner Foods, a leading supplier of shelf-stable, dairy-based food and beverage products, has selected Evotix, a world leader in environment, health, safety (EHS) and well-being software, to help digitize and streamline their EHS management.
Experiencing tremendous growth, Berner Foods identified the need to invest in health and safety software, rather than continue using cumbersome spreadsheets and forms that provided no visibility or data around health and safety.
