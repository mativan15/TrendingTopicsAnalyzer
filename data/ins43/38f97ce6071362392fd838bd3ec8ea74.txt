ROME (AP) — Italy's far-right political leadership marked the 79th anniversary of the World War II roundup of Rome's Jews on Sunday with calls for such horror to never occur again, messages that took on greater significance following a national election won by a party with neo-fascist roots.

Giorgia Meloni, who is expected to head Italy's first far-right-led government since the war's end, phoned the leader of Rome's Jewish community, Ruth Dureghello, to commemorate the anniversary, according to a community spokesman.
