Logan Paul ended WWE SmackDown on top as he knocked out Jey Uso to send a message to Roman Reigns.
The night started so well for The Bloodline after they beat down Sheamus so badly the star was taken to hospital, but things changed by the end of the show as the fascinating story continues to delight with twists and turns.
In the first match of the night, Solo Sikoa – who as accompanied by The Usos and Sami Zayn – used his family to his advantage to beat Sheamus.
It was a brilliantly physical battle as Solo continues to shine on the main roster, and The Bloodline stood tall after a vicious attack on the Celtic Warrior.
