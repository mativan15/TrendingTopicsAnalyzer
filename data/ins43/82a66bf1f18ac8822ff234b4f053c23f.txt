Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that financial crimes and terrorism were linked through 'dirty money', and urged Interpol to facilitate wider global cooperation to deal with the dual threat, rather than letting these issues be tackled at the local level. Law enforcement agencies have to devise new procedures to deal with the menace, the Prime Minister said at the 90th General Assembly of Interpol, the international organisation that coordinates worldwide police collaboration and crime control.
