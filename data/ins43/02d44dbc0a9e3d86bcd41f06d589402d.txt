Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president and Minister K.T. Rama Rao said they were seeking votes in Munugode byelection based on the last eight years' performance in the State and wanted to know on what basis the BJP had been seeking votes. He alleged that both BJP and Congress had joined hands and become one to defeat the TRS in the byelection. Alair former MLA B. Bhikshamaiah resigned from the BJP and joined the TRS in the presence of Mr. Rama Rao, and Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy at Telangana Bhavan on Thursday evening.
