Oct. 15—HIGH POINT — The city is continuing efforts to establish a "commercial shared-use kitchen," which would provide space for food businesses to rent.

The idea originated in 2018, when the city launched an initiative to foster small-scale manufacturing in distressed areas.

A report identified a need for a shared-use kitchen as a way to help give entrepreneurs a foothold in the food industry and the costs associated with it.

"It provides opportunities for food entrepreneurs to scale their food production," said Planning Administrator Heidi Galanti, part of a team of city staff and stakeholders from the private sector leading the effort.
