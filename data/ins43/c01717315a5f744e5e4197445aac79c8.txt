Leg-spinner Karthik Meiyappan of the United Arab Emirates took the first hat-trick of the T20 World Cup 2022, sending back three Sri Lankan batters in their first-round match on Tuesday. Meiyappan struck in the 15th over when Sri Lanka were cruising along nicely at 117-2 at Geelong. He began by getting the big-hitting Bhanuka Rajapaksa caught at deep cover off the fourth ball of the innings.

The next one moved the other way and left-handed Charith Asalanka was caught behind off a fine edge. The last ball of the innings was a beauty, pitching on the off stump and turning just a shade to beat skipper Dasun Shanaka's defensive prod and clip the bails.
