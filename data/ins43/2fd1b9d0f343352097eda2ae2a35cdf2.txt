Large greenfield sites have been identified in 35 councils' applications to be part of deregulated low-tax investment zones.Seventy-seven areas in England have been identified for development in the zones, where key environmental protections and planning regulations will be relaxed to encourage fast growth, according to data gathered by an environmental campaigner. Two councils, Stroud district council and Oxfordshire county council, have refused to take part. The Oxfordshire council leader, Liz Leffman, said the deregulation was incompatible with their net zero aspirations and commitment to protect and enhance biodiversity.
