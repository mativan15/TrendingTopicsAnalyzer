AgenciesThe US Department of Education started beta testing its student loan debt forgiveness application on Friday. The application, StudentAid.gov, will help the department fine-tune its procedures ahead of the formal launch of the Biden administration's student debt relief initiative. According to the department, forms received during the beta testing phase will be accepted and will not need to be resubmitted when the programme is launched.
According to a department spokeswoman, this testing phase will allow the department to monitor site performance through real-world use, test the site ahead of the official application launch, enhance processes, and identify any potential defects before the final launch.
