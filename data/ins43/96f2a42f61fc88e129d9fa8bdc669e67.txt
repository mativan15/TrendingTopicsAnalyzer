Teenaged Indian Grandmaster D Gukesh upset Magnus Carlsen in the ninth round of the preliminary phase of the Aimchess Rapid online chess tournament, becoming the youngest to beat the world champion. The 16-year old from Chennai beat the world No.1 with white pieces early on Monday to move up to third position behind Poland's Jan-Krzystof Duda (25 points) and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan, 23 points) with 21 points after the 12th round.
Gukesh's 29-move dismantling of the world champion comes a day after his 19-year old compatriot Arjun Erigaisi had post a maiden win over the world champion.
