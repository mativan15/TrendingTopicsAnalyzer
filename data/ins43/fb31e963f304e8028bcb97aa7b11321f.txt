Anthony Koletti, the husband of missing Australian fraudster Melissa Caddick, is likely to face a public examination by court-appointed liquidators after lodging a claim over her assets and asserting that his income went to supporting the fraudster and her teenage son. The latest episode of the podcast Liar Liar: Melissa Caddick and the Missing Millions reveals that Koletti's financial records for a three-year period until March 2020 show thousands of dollars in cash were regularly deposited into his bank account.
