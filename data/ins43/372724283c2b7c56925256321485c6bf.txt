Ever since 2015, Californians have been on a roller-coaster ride with gasoline prices consistently a dollar higher than U.S. gas prices.
But the recent steep climb to a $2.60 more per gallon than U.S. prices is so unprecedented that Gov. Newsom rightly called a special legislative session to enact a windfall profits tax.
The governor correctly sees the forest through the trees. Gas prices in California are not set by some magic market mechanism. They are set by the five refiners that make 97% of the state's gasoline and command their price at every retail gas station in the state — a price that includes an unprecedented profit margin.
