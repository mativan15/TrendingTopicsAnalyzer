Amazon is dropping support for its Cloud Cam indoor security cameras on December 2 this year, according to an Amazon statement provided to MacRumors. Amazon's Cloud Cams were released in October 2017, but now the company is only supporting its Ring and Blink brands instead, according to an email to Cloud Cam users from Amazon. Amazon's heads up on dropping support for the Cloud Cams, while months away, is still a rather short window. Those who bought Cloud Cams as recently as May 26, the day before Amazon's notifications were sent, will feel most of the sting.
