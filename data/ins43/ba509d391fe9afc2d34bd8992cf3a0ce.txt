The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has agreed to a settlement that would pay back fees associated with legal cases, probation and fines for tens of thousands of people who were wrongfully convicted of drug charges, according to court documents.
 

 Roughly $14 million is estimated to go to about 31,000 people whose criminal convictions were vacated. The amounts are meant to refund fees incurred, including: victim-witness fees, probation fees, GPS monitoring, restitution, court costs, fines, drug analysis criminal assessment fees, DNA collection fees, parole fees and driver license reinstatement fees, according to a court filing.
