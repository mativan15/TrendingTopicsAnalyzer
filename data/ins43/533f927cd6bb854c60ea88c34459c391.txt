Marin supervisors said this week that they will support an ordinance that would require that new residential and commercial construction in Marin be all-electric beginning Jan. 1.
The ordinance, which will return to the board for a public hearing and vote on Nov. 15, contains other provisions designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the use of natural gas. These include tougher energy efficiency requirements for additions, alterations and remodels, and increased access to electric vehicle charging stations for people living in multifamily housing.
