BENGALURU: As per Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act, the orders passed by the RERA or Adjudicating Officer need to be executed by the Revenue Department and compensation; delay interest or deposit money needs to be recovered as arrears of land revenue to compensate for the loss incurred by homebuyers.However, inefficient functioning of revenue officials has become a cause of concern for hundreds of homebuyers, who are compelled to wait for years to get the compensation.For example, RERA has sent 631 cases to the revenue department to recover the penalty of Rs 258 crore from 125 builders but the revenue department could recover only Rs 8 crore so far and it is yet to recover Rs 250 crore from 614 cases.
