Sidharth Malhotra who made everyone cry with his film Shershaah - a film based on the life of Captain Vikram Batra, martyred in Kargil War - recently said that it is our duty to take care of the families of the bravehearts who lose their life in the service of the country. Thus, he praised Maa Bharati Ke Sapoot, a Tri-Service fund, which is utilised for the grant of immediate financial assistance to the families of soldiers/sailors/airmen who lay down their lives or get grievously injured in active military operations.
