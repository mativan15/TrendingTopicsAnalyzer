South Florida sports fans are celebrating the return of the Miami Heat and the Florida Panthers. The pro basketball and hockey teams started their new seasons this week.

But with the explosion of sports comes the explosion of traffic. Both the Heat and the Panthers have home games Friday through the weekend, and drivers should take note of possible traffic delays around the downtown Miami and Sunrise arenas before and after the games.

Miami Heat and Florida Panthers home games typically start at 7:30 p.
