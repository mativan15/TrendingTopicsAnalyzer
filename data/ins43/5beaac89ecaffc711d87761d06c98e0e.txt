But as power bills soar, do the numbers stack up already? Do the costs of installing panels outweigh the ongoing savings?LoadingLet's start with the costs: to get solar panels, you must pay upfront for not only the panels but also an inverter and installation costs.According to the SolarQuotes website, run by engineer and former CSIRO employee Finn Peacock, you can expect to pay between $5500 and $9000 for the full installation of a good quality 6.6kW solar panel system (the minimum Peacock recommends for most households) across Australia.
