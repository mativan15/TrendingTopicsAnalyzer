NAIROBI -Forces from Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray conceded on Tuesday that they had lost control of the populous town of Shire to the Ethiopian military and their allies, while the government signalled it believed it was winning on the battlefield.

Ethiopia's army and allies including troops from neighbouring Eritrea have been battling Tigray forces on and off since late 2020, a conflict that has killed thousands, displaced millions and left hundreds of thousands on the brink of famine.

'If we don't defend ourselves against our enemies, they will continue the atrocities,' the Tigray authorities said in a statement.
