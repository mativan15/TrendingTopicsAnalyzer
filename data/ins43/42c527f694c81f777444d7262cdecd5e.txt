Checking accounts are the daily workhorses of your financial realm. They're where your money comes in and where it goes out, whether to make payments or to transfer to savings accounts, stock brokerages or other higher-interest investments. While savings accounts let you gradually build money towards financial goals, checking accounts let you manage your day-to-day finances by accepting deposits and facilitating payments.The best checking accounts provide a wide range of deposit and payment services with no fees for monthly maintenance or minimum balances.
