The prime minister, Liz Truss, has committed to retaining the triple lock on pensions, meaning they will rise in with inflation. In response to a question from the SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, she said she was 'completely committed to it. So is the Chancellor.' She was speaking during Wednesday's prime minister's questions in the Commons and her statement appeared inconsistent with earlier comments from her Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.On Monday Mr Hunt had refused to make any commitments on 'individual policy areas'.
