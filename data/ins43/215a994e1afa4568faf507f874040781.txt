SVB Financial Group, parent of Silicon Valley Bank, saw its stock drop nearly 24% Friday as analysts slashed their price targets on the bank's shares. It's been an ugly year for SVB, which has lost two-thirds of its market value since Jan. 1.

Piper Sandler cut its price forecast on the shares to $265 from $400, and RBC Capital slashed its target to $350 from $474.

On Friday, SVB closed at $230.03, down $72.43 on almost 10 times average daily trading. The bank saw 5.6 million shares change hands, compared to average daily volume of about 582,000.
