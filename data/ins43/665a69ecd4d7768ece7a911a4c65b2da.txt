jetcityimage General Electric (NYSE:GE) is facing an uncertain future, which is reflected in the company's valuation. The industrial corporation is confronting a variety of challenges, including rising raw-materials costs, supply-chain issues, a highly cyclical Aerospace division, and increasingly unstable free cash flow guidance. With General Electric's results date approaching next week (October 25th, 2022), investors may wish to avoid the industrial giant until it outlines a clear route for its free cash flow in 2022 and 2023.
