Hollywood Commission




	The Hollywood Commission is launching its second Entertainment Survey with the goal of giving voice to entertainment industry workers.

	Chaired by Anita Hill and founded by board members Kathleen Kennedy and Nina Shaw, the Hollywood Commission was formed in 2017 to bring together entertainment executives, independent experts, and advisors to take the necessary collective steps toward tackling the culture of abuse and power disparity in the industry.

	The survey is a temperature check to identify the progress that has been made up until now and where work still needs to be done.
