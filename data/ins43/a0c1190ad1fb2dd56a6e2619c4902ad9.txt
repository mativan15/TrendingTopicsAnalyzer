Cara Delevingne has revealed the moment she realised she is a prude was when she was invited to take part in a masturbation seminar – which involved physically getting involved.
The model and actress, 30, has made her own Planet Sex docuseries in which she explored her own sexuality in ways she'd never done before.
Speaking at Mipcom in Cannes, Cara revealed that there was one moment during filming that got a bit too real for her.
She explained: ‘I went into the masturbation seminar thinking it was going to be a classroom and I'd have a notepad, and instead it was a pink, leather gym mat on the floor, with six people going, 'Well, take your underwear off.
