RALEIGH — After years of complaints from some residents that too much of local tourism-generated tax dollars goes toward marketing Asheville, legislators have introduced a bill that would change that funding formula — and add a new fund that could benefit community-oriented projects.

As it stands, by law the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority must spend 75% of the occupancy tax revenues on marketing and promotion, while the other 25% goes to the Tourism Product Development Fund, which funds projects and venues that can result in visitors staying in the area longer.
