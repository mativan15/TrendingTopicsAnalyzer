Travelling via train and shinkansen is a quintessential Japanese experience. However, train rides, especially on the shinkansen, can add up to be a costly expense. Lucikly for tourists, Japan Railways has created a host of discount rail passes exclusively for foreign passport holders with short-term visit visas, all of which offer unlimited rides on trains and shinkansen across multiple days. (Psst... some of these JR passes are also available to foreign residents in Japan – more info here.)  Aside from the popular Japan Rail Pass, which gives you access to most JR trains and shinkansen across the breadth of Japan, there are a number of other discount passes that could also save you a lot of money.
