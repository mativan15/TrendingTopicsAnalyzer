Bitcoin rose for the second consecutive day and was recently trading just over $19,500, a nearly 2% gain over the past 24 hours and stark contrast from last week's late roller coaster ride.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tracked U.S. equity indexes, which also climbed with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 recently up 3.5%, and 2.7%, respectively, as investors awaited the latest third-quarter earnings reports and housing data that seems likely to reflect a continued cooling of the real estate market.
