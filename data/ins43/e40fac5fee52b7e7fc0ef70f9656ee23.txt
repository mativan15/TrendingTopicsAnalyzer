An Oregon company won a $200 million federal grant to help it build a new battery component plant that's expected to employ 650 people, but whether the jobs will come to the state was unclear.

The grant to Lebanon-based Entek was among 20 totaling $2.8 billion that the White House announced on Wednesday. The money, intended to shift battery manufacturing from China to the U.S., comes through last year's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Entek makes battery separators, components in a range of battery types, in Lebanon, about midway between Salem and Eugene.
