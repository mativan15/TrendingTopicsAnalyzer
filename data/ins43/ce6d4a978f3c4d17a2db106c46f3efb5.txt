Igor Danchenko was acquitted in federal court Tuesday on all four counts of lying to the FBI about where he obtained the phony information that he secretly fed to ex-British spy Christopher Steele for his fictive dossier that smeared Donald Trump as a Russian asset.  The loss is another setback for special counsel John Durham, but the verdict comes as no surprise.  The case was tried in Alexandria, Virginia where 80% of residents voted Democrat in the last presidential election.  In a politically charged case involving names like Trump and Clinton, it was always an uphill battle for Durham, just as it was in the earlier trial of Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann who was acquitted by a Washington, D.
