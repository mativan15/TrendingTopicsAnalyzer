Meta has agreed to sell the GIF platform Giphy after a UK regulator upheld its ruling that owning the platform would damage competition and innovation.

Britain's competition watchdog had ordered Meta last year to reverse the deal, a year after Facebook's parent company announced it had bought Giphy.

The company appealed to a tribunal, which rejected most of its arguments on Tuesday.

After reviewing the case further, the Competition and Markets Authority concluded that 'the only way to avoid the significant impact the deal would have on competition' is for Meta to sell Giphy to an approved buyer.
