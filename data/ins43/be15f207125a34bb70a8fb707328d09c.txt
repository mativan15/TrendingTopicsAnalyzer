wacomka/iStock via Getty Images Shares of Xencor, Inc. (NASDAQ:XNCR), an up-and-coming player in the bispecific antibody and cytokine space, have fallen by 46% since my 2019 update. Performance is just above flat during the past 5 years, and so far in 2022 shares have lost one-third of their value. As I revisited, I was reminded of attributes I find attractive during this rough patch for biotech (low valuation, picks and shovels aspect, capital efficient operation, highly productive R&D efforts, exposure to novel targets such as B7-H3, and early signs of promise with engineered cytokines).
