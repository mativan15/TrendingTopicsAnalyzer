The 100m road overbridge (ROB) across 381st milestone at railway third gate in Tilakwadi, Belagavi, which was opened for the public last week, has been closed for repairs after potholes restricted movement of vehicles on the stretch. The railways civil work engineering department has restricted movement of vehicles on the overbridge for an indefinite term. The department stated that it regrets the inconvenience and will resume movement on the stretch after engineers certify it. Belagavi BJP MP Mangala Angagi and Belagavi South BJP MLA Abhay Patil had opened the bridge for public last Wednesday.
