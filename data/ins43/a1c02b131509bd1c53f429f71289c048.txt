LAKE GEORGE — The Howard Johnson's restaurant in this upstate New York resort village — the last of the once-pervasive eateries serving food under orange roofs with blue spires — is closed.The restaurant just south of Lake George in the Adirondack Mountains did not open over Memorial Day weekend and is for lease, according to the Times Union of Albany. A post on the Facebook site HoJoLand last week said plastic tables, chair and memorabilia were removed and there were 'cobwebs on the door.'HoJo's were well known to baby boomers, who grew up on the restaurants' 28 ice cream flavors and fried clam plates.
