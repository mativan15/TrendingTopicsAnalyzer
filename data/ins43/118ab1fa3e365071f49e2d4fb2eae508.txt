Rep. Cori Bush requested information from student-loan company MOHELA on its involvement in a lawsuit.

Six GOP-led states recently argued Biden's debt relief would hurt the business operations of MOHELA.

Bush said the company cannot be silent on the legal issues and asked how it is protecting borrowers.

President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness may be moving full steam ahead, but some conservative groups are still trying to stop the relief in its tracks.
