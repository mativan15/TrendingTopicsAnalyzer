Residents feeling adrift after the August floods and landslides now have a single point of contact to go to for help – the newly created navigator role at Nelson City Council. Katie Sellars has been in the role for about a week and has already fielded calls from about 20 people looking for help with their properties. 'I don't necessarily know the answers but I know where to get the answers,' Sellars said. Prior to this role she worked as a librarian, which she said was very similar, 'connecting people with information'.
