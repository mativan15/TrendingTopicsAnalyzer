We're wrapping up a pretty volatile month of trading. May had some pretty big swings, but ultimately the major market indexes are roughly where they were at the end of April. Stocks fell through most of May, clawing their way back last week. 
Will June bring more of the same? I'm going to make some predictions about what the month ahead will mean for Netflix (NFLX -2.10%), cruise line stocks, and the tenuous Elon Musk deal for Twitter (TWTR -1.77%). Let's dive right in.
