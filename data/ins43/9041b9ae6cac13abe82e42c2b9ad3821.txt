As the enthusiasm around AI image and text generators grows, Jasper, a startup developing what it describes as an "AI content" platform, has raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. The tranche is the company's first, remarkably, and comes as Jasper is in the process of acquiring AI startup Outwrite, a grammar and style checker with more than a million users worldwide.

CEO Dave Rogenmoser tells TechCrunch the funding will be put toward building out Jasper's core products, improving the customer experience and bringing Jasper's technology to more apps.
