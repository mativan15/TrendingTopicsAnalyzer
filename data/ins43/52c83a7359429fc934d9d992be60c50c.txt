Access to healthcare is only getting worse, with long waiting lists, more specialist referrals being rejected, and people's quality of life suffering. JOANNE NAISH reports. If Renee Veal lived in Auckland she'd get surgery for her debilitating jaw condition for free. Because she lives in Christchurch, she'll have to pay $90,000 for the surgery – or live with the pain. The 27-year-old has a degenerative joint disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Her chronic pain leaves her struggling to sleep, eat, smile and laugh.
