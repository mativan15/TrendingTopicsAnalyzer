The last merger changed that story materially with the result of a far more flexible future for shareholders. The merger allowed the company to add a considerable amount of condensate production to that natural gas production. Condensate in Canada often sells at a premium to oil because condensate is needed to make thermal and sometimes heavy oil flow through pipelines.
