Chalmers should be wary of conventional thinking about problems that are of unconventional origins. Just as the 'coronacession' was unlike an ordinary recession because it was caused by government-imposed restraints on the supply side rather than efforts to curb excessive demand, so he shouldn't be using demand restraint to try to fix disruptions to supply.Inflation problems normally arise from an overheated economy leading to excessive wage growth. The standard solution will involve cutting real wages to make labour less expensive.
