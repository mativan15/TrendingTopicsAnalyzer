Labor groups said Thursday they'll pursue all avenues in resisting the draft law, which would require them to supply enough staff to guarantee minimum service levels when taking industrial action, or face the removal of legal protection and automatic dismissals.

The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, representing 96% of UK train drivers, said that piecemeal operations envisaged in the legislation would encourage overcrowding and also lead to disruption following strikes, with trains out of position for the resumption of full services.
