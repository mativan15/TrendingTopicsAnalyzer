Kanye West sparred on live TV with Chris Cuomo as the host ripped his 'ugly,' 'demonstrably false' and 'inherently antisemitic' claim that an all-controlling 'Jewish underground media mafia' is out to get him.
The rapper-turned-fashion mogul sat in the back of a car for a feisty interview Monday on Cuomo's NewsNation show in which he was challenged over earlier saying he was 'going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.'
Cuomo repeatedly challenged the star, now known as Ye, as he doubled down while trying to justify his slurs.
