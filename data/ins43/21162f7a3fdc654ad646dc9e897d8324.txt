The Supreme Court temporarily blocked a Texas law from taking effect that would ban large social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter from "censoring" viewpoints on their platforms.
If the law eventually goes into effect, it would force social media companies to change how they moderate posts, which would likely exacerbate problems with misinformation, hate speech and other distasteful content on these platforms.
A federal appeals court will hear the full challenge to the Texas law. But it's likely the case will end up back at the Supreme Court, where justices will be asked to balance the First Amendment rights of individuals and large social media companies.
