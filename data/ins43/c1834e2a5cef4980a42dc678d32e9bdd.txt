[Photo/Xinhua] Xi Jinping's report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China sets out clear directions and brings fresh opportunities for the future development of the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, said leaders of various sectors in the two cities. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said in a post on his social media page on Sunday that Xi's report is a "stabilizer" in advancing development in the Hong Kong SAR, and it's inspiring to see that he mentioned "one country, two systems" and Hong Kong and Macao multiple times.
