Meta has taken aim at Apple's iMessage in an advertisement that ratchets up the corporate rivalry between the two Silicon Valley tech companies. Meta is targeting Apple's iMessage in a new advertisement that ratchets up the rivalry between the two companies. On Monday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of an ad in New York's Penn Station that suggests Meta's WhatsApp is more secure and private than Apple's messaging system and traditional text messages. "WhatsApp is far more private and secure than iMessage, with end-to-end encryption that works across both iPhones and Android, including group chats," Zuckerberg posted on Instagram.
