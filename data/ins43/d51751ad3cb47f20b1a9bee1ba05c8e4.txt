Having Will Schufreider on the mound was exactly what Grayslake Central wanted.The junior right-hander's performance in the Rams' Class 3A sectional semifinal on Thursday was virtually a carbon copy of what he had produced the entire season.'It's hard to put adjectives for how he competes,' Grayslake Central coach Troy Whalen said. 'He's what you want in your pitchers. He really comes at you and tries to win every pitch.'Schufreider succeeded in doing so in many more instances than not against sixth-seeded Crystal Lake South, but one pitch in particular in the top of the fifth cost him in the second-seeded Rams' 1-0 loss in Grayslake.
