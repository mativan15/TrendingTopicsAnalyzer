For those weary of platinum jubilee bunting last week, there was Danny Boyle's Pistol, the new Disney+ six-part series on the Sex Pistols, created by Craig Pearce.It was a big risk tackling the brief (mid to late 1970s), sacred, big-bang cultural moment of punk. Boyle had to encapsulate the filth and the fury while eschewing generic, theme-park punk. Does he manage it? Of course not – no one has ever managed it. Not in the overrated 1986 film Sid and Nancy, where Gary Oldman laboriously gurned in full Sid Snot cosplay, and not now in Pistol.
