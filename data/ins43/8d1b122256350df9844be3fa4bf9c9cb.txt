Company location: Boulder

Industry: Medical Devices

Top local executive: Amy Beckley, CEO

About: CEO and scientist Amy Beckley founded Proov nearly six years ago after she solved her own struggle to become pregnant with an inexpensive progesterone supplement. Realizing others could benefit, Beckley started Proov and designed a suite of products to help before and during pregnancy, including a urine-based hormone test strip capable of confirming ovulation quality and high-absorbing iron, a critical nutrient often left out of prenatal vitamins.
