Tensions are still high for thousands of Islanders still waiting to receive $250 in provincial aid nearly a month after Fiona devastated the province. The frustration is clear at the Red Cross site in Charlottetown, as another long line formed Friday. People began waiting before dawn, but not even that was a guarantee. Many were past the cutoff and told to come Saturday after about 120 to 150 appointment tickets were given out. The Red Cross is responsible to distribute the funds, but it is provincial aid money.
