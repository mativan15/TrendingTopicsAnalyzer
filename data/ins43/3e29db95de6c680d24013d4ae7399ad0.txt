Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Lisa Gretzky has served two terms as member of provincial parliament for Windsor West, but a full slate of candidates is looking to unseat the veteran politician. Gretzky has served in a number of critic portfolios including homelessness and education, and most recently, the critic of community and social services. She says there's more work to be done to make life more affordable. 'I look forward to continuing to be your, once at Queen's Park, to working alongside you to ensure that you're able to afford a home, that your kids get the best education, and that our seniors are given the respect and dignity that they deserve,' Gretzky says.
