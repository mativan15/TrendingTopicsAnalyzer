The Florida Gators could use some depth on the defensive line, and Billy Napier is looking to the transfer portal to fill that hole for the upcoming season. The latest name to join the list is former Tennessee and West Virginia defensive lineman Darel Middleton, according to Blake Alderman of 247Sports.

Middleton and Napier have had discussions with each other, and the 6-foot-7-inch, 305-pound lineman plans on meeting the staff in person on June 2 and 3, per Alderman's report. No offer is on the table just yet, but an in-person visit is sure to speed up that process.
