To celebrate the release of A Plague Tale: Requiem, the follow up to Asobo Studio's award-winning action-adventure stealth game A Plague Tale: Innocence, we've teamed up with PLAION UK and Focus Entertainment to offer three lucky IGN fans the chance to win a copy of the game and some exclusive artwork inspired by the franchise.

In partnership with PosterSpy, a trio of artists have created alternative movie poster pieces capturing the atmosphere and essence of the sequel in their own unique style.
