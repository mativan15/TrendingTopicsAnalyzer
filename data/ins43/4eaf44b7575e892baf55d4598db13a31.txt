It's raining money on Beacon Hill, with unexpectedly high revenue streaming in from all manner of taxes. Now, because of an obscure 1986 law, the state is poised to send some of that back to residents.

Under the 1986 law, the result of an ill-advised ballot question, when the state collects more tax revenue than allowed, it must send it back.
