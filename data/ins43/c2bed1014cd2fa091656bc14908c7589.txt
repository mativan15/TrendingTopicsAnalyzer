For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term Severfield plc (LON:SFR) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 34% in three years, versus a market decline of about 0.4%. And over the last year the share price fell 27%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 14% in the last three months.
