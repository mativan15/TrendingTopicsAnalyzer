(Bloomberg)—Global shopping-mall owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield is in talks to sell a property in Florida as it prepares a 'radical reduction' of its US holdings. Pacific Retail Capital is proposing to buy the Westfield Brandon Mall near Tampa. Terms of a deal, which may not materialize, are still under negotiation. Chief Executive Officer Steve Plenge said the firm would offer about $200 million, based on a projected 9% to 10% annual return on the investment. 'We're very interested in that property,' said Plenge, whose firm owns 25 shopping centers valued at about $3 billion.
