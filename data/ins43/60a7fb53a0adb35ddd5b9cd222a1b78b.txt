Better-than-expected earnings this quarter are masking the pain to come for the stock market, according to Morgan Stanley's top stock picker.The bank's chief equity strategist Mike Wilson said Thursday that surprisingly upbeat earnings are failing to show investors that earnings are set to fall and the stock market has yet to bottom out. "We're not sure that earnings are going to come down fast enough to convince the market how bad 2023 is going to be on the earnings front," he told Bloomberg TV.
