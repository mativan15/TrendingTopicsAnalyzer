For years, elected officials from across the political spectrum in New York City have scored points by attacking a common enemy: Real estate developers.

Politicians routinely quashed projects. Some officials argued they were protecting a neighborhood's character and property values. Others said they were fighting corporate greed. On Friday, a left-leaning City Council member, Julie Won, said she would oppose a big new project in her Queens district, calling it a 'gentrification accelerator.'

But a housing shortage and affordability crisis may be changing the political calculus for some progressives who have traditionally been among the most fervent critics of the real estate industry.
