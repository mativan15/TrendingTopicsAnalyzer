Litigants in the Gyanvapi case have demanded a probe into news channels obtaining video footage of the mosque inspection after they were given copies of the video. The Varanasi district court had provided litigants copies of the video on Monday. Rakhi Singh - one of the five plaintiffs who sought permission to 'pray at the Shringar Gauri idols on the western wall of the mosque' - asked the district court to order a CBI probe into the leak. After videos and photos related to the commission were provided to litigants, many news channels started broadcasting the footage, Singh said in her plea and added she feared 'anti-national forces could be at play.
