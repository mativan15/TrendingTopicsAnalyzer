Simon Cowell joked with Britain's Got Talent semi-finalists Scooter Boys that he ‘might have to borrow' one of their helmets, four months on from his most recent electric bike crash.
Presenters Ant and Dec went to Simon for his comments after the four youngsters, aged between six and 10, had performed their daring scooter tricks act during Friday's final semi-final.
The quartet had suffered a false start to their original audition after a crash, prompting Simon to joke then that, despite them receiving four yeses from the judges, he was ‘never letting Eric my son watch this audition'.
