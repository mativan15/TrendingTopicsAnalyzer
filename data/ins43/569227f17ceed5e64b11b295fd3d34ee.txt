Elon Musk is considering a hiring freeze and job cuts of up to 10% of staff at Tesla because he has a 'super bad feeling' about the state of the economy, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.Tesla currently has about 5,000 job openings advertised worldwide, and 100,000 employees globally. The email was sent to Tesla executives late on Thursday with the subject line 'pause all hiring worldwide', and comes days after Musk ordered all employees to return to the office for at least 40 hours a week or face immediate termination.
