One of the most contentious decisions taken by state governments during the COVID-19 crisis – the mass closure of schools – was avoidable and should not be repeated unless strong health advice outweighs the cost of closures, an independent review of Australia's pandemic response has found.A review panel led by Western Sydney University chancellor and former top public servant Peter Shergold found that closing schools in response to outbreaks early in the pandemic was justified, but state governments departed from Australia's pandemic planning and health advice by shutting all classes for entire school terms in 2020 and 2021.
