Savings rates are continuing to rise, with best-buy deals offering 5%-plus, so if your money is earning a pittance, now is the time to switch to a better-paying account.Research issued this week found that while there are a growing number of fairly decent deals emerging, almost £270bn is languishing in accounts paying no interest at all. It also found that fewer than a third of people have switched accounts in the past 12 months, while about half have not switched for five years or longer or have never switched.
