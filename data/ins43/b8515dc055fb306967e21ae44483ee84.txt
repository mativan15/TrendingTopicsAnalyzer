MEXICO CITY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Walmart's Mexico unit on Thursday said its third-quarter net profit rose 10% from the year-earlier period, helped by strong same-store sales as the retailer works to keep prices low at a time of swelling inflation.

Walmart de Mexico, the biggest retailer in Mexico, posted a net profit of 12.15 billion pesos ($603.8 million). The quarterly revenue of 197.89 billion pesos equated to a 12.4% rise from the prior July-to-September period.
