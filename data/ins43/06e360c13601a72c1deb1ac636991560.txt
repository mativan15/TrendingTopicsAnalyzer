Tesla (TSLA -7.55%) stock is one of the most followed stocks in the market. That's not surprising given shares of the electric-vehicle (EV) pioneer have performed phenomenally over the longer term. 
Shares have rocketed from their initial public offering (IPO) split-adjusted price of about $1.13 in June 2010 to $204.99 on Oct. 14, 2022. This performance has transformed an initial investment of $1,000 into about $181,407. By comparison, the S&P 500 index has turned a $1,000 investment into $4,250 over this period.
