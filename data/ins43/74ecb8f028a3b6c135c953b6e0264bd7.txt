With its Q3 earnings beating and its revenue trailing consensus estimates, Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) stock has slipped 1.9% in midday Tuesday trading.
Also, CFRA analyst Alexander Yokum downgraded Truist (TFC) to Sell from Hold, on his view that future expenses will be higher than expected, leading to lower-than-expected operating leverage.
"We also see pressure in noninterest income as investment banking/trading, wealth management, and mortgage-income continue to face pressure from rising rates and a slowing economy," Yokum wrote in a note to clients.
