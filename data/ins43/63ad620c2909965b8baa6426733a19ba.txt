There's a law in the United States that says companies aren't supposed to track young children, but they do it anyway. More than two thirds of the most popular kids' iPhone apps collect and share personal information, according to a recent study from Pixalate. By some estimates, digital ad firms have collected an average of 72 million data points about every kid by the time they turn 13, the age legal data collection is supposed to start. A new app from the security firm Disconnect aims to do something about it.
