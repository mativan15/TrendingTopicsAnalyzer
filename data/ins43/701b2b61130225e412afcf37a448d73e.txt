Uber is banking on autonomous vehicles and the supposed upcoming self-driving revolution to prop up its $1 billion advertising empire. The company is launching a new in-house advertising arm that will create targeted ads for passengers informed by their destination history, Uber announced in a statement on Wednesday. Uber's advertising division is projected to become a '$1 billion-plus revenue opportunity by 2024,' advertising director Mark Grether, a former ad boss at Amazon, said at the company's investor day last February, after seeing ad revenues balloon from $11 million in 2020 to $141 million in 2021.
