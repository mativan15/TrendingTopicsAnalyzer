Erik ten Hag has been criticised for "disrespecting" Cristiano Ronaldo since taking charge at Manchester United. The Dutchman arrived in the summer, just as the Portuguese star made it clear he wanted to leave the club. He was unable to find a suitor as the Red Devils made it clear he would not be sold. Ronaldo missed out on pre-season and Ten Hag, despite retaining the player, has only used Ronaldo sporadically. Of the nine Premier League games so far Ronaldo has only started twice, coming off the bench on six occasions and was an unused substitute in the Manchester derby.
