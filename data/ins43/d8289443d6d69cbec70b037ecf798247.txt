It wasn't long ago that there was debate whether the Jacksonville Jaguars were a top 10 team in the NFL. Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence told reporters near the end of September that 'you can't deny that we are a really good team.'

Three consecutive losses later and there's plenty of people willing to deny that.

The latest loss in the Jaguars' slide was a 34-27 defeat at the hands of the Indianapolis Colts. The defense couldn't get off the field and couldn't protect a one-point lead after Lawrence led the Jaguars down the field for a go-ahead score with less than three minutes left.
