Terrible news, but hardly surprising:  
Energy costs will close two major ‘green' manufacturing operations
• BMW is moving manufacturing of the electric Mini from the UK to China where manufacturing is powered by cheap coal.

• Britishvolt, a major battery manufacturing startup, is on the brink of collapse.
Both companies have cited high energy prices as the reason for their problems.
Claims that the UK's economy will be based around ‘green industries' are clearly false. 
• Manufacturing of renewables and EVs will be built in places where energy is cheap, which means places where it is derived from fossil fuels.
