If over the top action sequences, legendary superheroes and WTF moments sound like your type of viewing, then check out the trailer and cancel any plans you had tonight! The moment we've all been waiting for has finally arrived…The Boys are here. And they're back with a vengeance. Dark, irreverent, and downright depraved, The Boys is far from your stereotypical superhero show. Why use your superpowers for good, when you can abuse them and get what you really want, right? The story of a group of vigilantes (Billy Butcher and his crew) out to combat the immoral antics of a bunch of so-called superheroes (The Seven), this is one twisted action series you won't want to miss.
