Jimmy Eat World are an absolute staple of the American rock scene, having influenced young music fans for close to thirty years.
First formed in 1993, the band – comprised of Jim Adkins, Tom Linton, Rick Burch and Zach Lind – have released 10 studio albums, toured the world, and had generations screaming out the lyrics to The Middle during their angstiest teenage years.
Now Jimmy Eat World are preparing to play the When We Were Young festival alongside the likes of My Chemical Romance and Avril Lavigne, proving that emo is not only nostalgic but rapidly approaching middle age, and making us all feel terribly old in the process.
