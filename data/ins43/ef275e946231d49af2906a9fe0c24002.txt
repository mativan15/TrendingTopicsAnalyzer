Vacancy levels in India's top office property markets is expected to remain range-bound at 16-17% in the current financial year of 2021-22 (April-March), despite a sizable addition of supply as expected rise in absorption, owing to the expected rise in absorption in the backdrop of resumption of work from office, said ratings agency ICRA. The net absorption rose to the highest level in the first quarter of the financial year in the last ten quarters, indicating recovery supported by healthy deal traction in new leases.
