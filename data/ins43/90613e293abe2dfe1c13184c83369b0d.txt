TOKYO - With the automotive industry rapidly shifting toward electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline-powered automobiles, a Tokyo-based manufacturer of truck components has entered the field of urban farming. Otsuka Tekko company started producing vegetables indoors with artificial light in an effort to diversify its business, as the outlook for the manufacturing side of the firm is becoming increasingly uncertain. The company has been growing lettuce and basil on multi-tiered shelves lit by LED lighting in an experimental cultivation space.
