Thousands of Missguided customers could be left out of pocket as administrators are not expected to pay refunds that were applied for before they were called in on Monday and deliveries of orders are not guaranteed.The online fashion retailer's website gradually closed down on Wednesday, including access to customer services, after a £20m deal to acquire the brand was agreed with the Sports Direct owner, Frasers Group.The Guardian understands that administrators from the advisory firm Teneo, who are to operate Missguided for the next weeks under the deal with Frasers, are not in a position to pay refunds requested before they were appointed on Monday.
