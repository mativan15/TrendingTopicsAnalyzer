Early on, it looked as though the stock market might have a solid day on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.30%), Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -0.61%), and S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.80%) all posting sizable advances. However, bond yields rose to levels not seen in well over a decade, and that spooked stock investors. All three major indexes closed the session lower.
