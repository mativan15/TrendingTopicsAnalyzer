The space sees hallways covered from the floor to the ceiling in framed paintings inspired by Qajar art from the Persian dynasty, 16th-century Mughal miniatures, Indian Pichhwais, and vintage photographs. Glass chandeliers hanging low from the ceiling light up this decked-out maze, where tables overflowed with food plated on silver— a special arrangement for the event.
