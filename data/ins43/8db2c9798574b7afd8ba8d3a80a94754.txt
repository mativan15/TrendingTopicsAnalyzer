Semiconductor giant Nvidia has had a rough start to 2022.In February, its plan to grow into even more of a behemoth got derailed when it walked away from its $40 billion blockbuster acquisition of chip designer Arm amid controversy. And then in late May, it froze hiring after its stock price sank from lower-than-expected revenue forecasts amid the war in Ukraine and supply chain woes relating to COVID-19 lockdowns.But it isn't all doom-and-gloom for Nvidia. The $475-billion chip giant recently announced record revenues and growth in its gaming and data center divisions, released the latest update of its autonomous-driving software development suite Hyperion, and is slated to release the successor to its artificial intelligence dedicated chip Hopper later this year.
