By Australian Associated Press Published: 23:25 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 23:25 EDT, 16 October 2022 Victorians' extraordinary efforts during the flood crisis should outweigh the poor behaviour of a few, the premier says, as police investigate looting in water-ravaged Maribyrnong. Police are searching for three men after a blue Ford Territory pulled up outside a Burton Crescent home in Maribyrnong about 7am on Monday and a man went inside and stole several items. He was wearing high-vis clothing, a beanie, and a face covering at the time.
