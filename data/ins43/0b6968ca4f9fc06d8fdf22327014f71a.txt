alvarez/E+ via Getty Images C3.ai (NYSE:AI) recently reported Q4 results with revenue growing 38% yoy and coming in ahead of expectations. While non-GAAP operating losses were better than expected, losses still mounted to -$21 million for the quarter and -$81 million for the year. Non-GAAP gross margins continue to remain healthy around the 80% level, but significant investments in operating expenses continue to weigh on profitability. In a disappointing fashion, the company guided FY23 revenue around 7% below expectations with non-GAAP operating loss essentially remaining flat yoy.
