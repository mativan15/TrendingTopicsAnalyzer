New Delhi: Even as the government has been forced to import 8 million tonnes of coal for this fiscal, Minister for Coal Pralhad Joshi on Thursday said that India's dry fuel production will touch 900 million tonnes in the current fiscal.All efforts are being made by Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its subsidiaries to achieve this goal, he said at a function here.The target is ambitious, considering the fact that CIL's production in 2021-22 was 622 million tonnes.However what is more significant is the fact that owing to a huge spike in demand, for the first time ever in its history, CIL - which is the largest producer of dry fuel in the country - has been forced to import the commodity.
