The Congress party's presidential elections have triggered huge interest as political parties in this country rarely conduct internal elections. The dominance of elections in India's democratic system doesn't extend to the parties contending in it, which are always run top-down. Most parties are subservient to one or two supreme leaders. Electoral defeat does not loosen their control or hold over the party.
Comparative evidence from other democracies, however, shows that the general trend is toward greater internal democracy, decentralisation, transparency and accountability within parties.
