"We're trying to build this thing the way we believe in," said Atlanta Falcons coach Arthur Smith as the team's mentality and culture continues to become more and more apparent.

The Atlanta Falcons are in the second year of the new regime led by coach Arthur Smith and general Terry Fontenot.

In year one, Smith guided the Falcons to a respectable 7-10 record, out-performing most national expectations. However, the team had a point differential of -146, and lost eight games by double digits, including four by 20 or more points.
