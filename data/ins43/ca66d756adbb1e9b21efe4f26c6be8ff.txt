While shortages of certain foods and other products can be disconcerting, it's downright worrisome when medicines are in short supply. The U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) explains why this happens: "Drug shortages are caused by many factors, including difficulties in acquiring raw materials, manufacturing problems, regulatory issues, and business decisions, as well as many other disturbances within the supply chain."

These other factors can be as simple as a sudden increased demand, which may happen due to things like allergy or flu season, but COVID has added to that sense of urgency, due to both supply chain issues—such as with the alarming 2022 baby formula shortage—and because the virus causes symptoms that necessitate over-the-counter (OTC) meds.
