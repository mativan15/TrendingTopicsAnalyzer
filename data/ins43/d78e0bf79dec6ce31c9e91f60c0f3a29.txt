Drew Angerer/Getty Images News Snap stock (NYSE:SNAP) was reeling, down 27% as it held a conference call Thursday afternoon after the latest in a growing string of disappointing quarters. The company highlighted a few positive measures - it beat on profitability measures, outpaced expectations for user growth and authorized buying back $500M worth of its stock. But in a grim year for advertising-focused media, Snap logged its worst-ever revenue growth and fell short of analyst expectations. "Our business continued to face significant headwinds this quarter," CEO Evan Spiegel said on the call, while recapping that the company refocused on three strategic priorities: growing community and deepening engagement; reaccelerating and diversifying revenue growth; and investing in augmented reality.
