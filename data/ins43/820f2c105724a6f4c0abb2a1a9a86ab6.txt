The former chancellor Rishi Sunak had been the favourite to succeed his old boss Boris Johnson as prime minister after his resignation in July.

But he failed to persuade Tory members, who ultimately put Liz Truss in Downing Street in September.

Mr Sunak's campaign messaging had been primarily focused on one issue: the worsening state of the UK economy, and his plan to sort it out.

During that contest, Mr Sunak had told the BBC he would rather lose the Tory leadership race than "win on a false promise".
