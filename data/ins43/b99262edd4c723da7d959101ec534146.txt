Monday was a busy day for Scott Mikelonis, who was recently selected to serve as the chief executive of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce and just hit the ground running this week.

The Irvine resident — a former executive director for Orange County-based PMP Management, which provides community management services for more than 300 homeowner associations across multiple states — was tapped last month for his background in business development and working with budgets, boards and their respective constituents.
