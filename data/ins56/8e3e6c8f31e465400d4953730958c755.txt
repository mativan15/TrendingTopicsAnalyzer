At long last, Dyson's best-selling Airwrap 2.0 has arrived. The cult-favorite hairstyling tool has regularly sold out since its 2018 debut, and the British company — which counts Hollywood hairstylists Jen Atkin and Matthew Collins among its ambassadors — has released a new and improved version of the popular product.
Available as of June 2, the new Airwrap multi-styler Complete is priced at $600 and has been 're-engineered for faster, easier styling without extreme heat,' says the company in a release.
