Priya Sharma (Fiona Wade) was left in tears in tonight's Emmerdale after Leyla Harding's (Roxy Shahidi) cruel comments about her burn scars.
After spending most of her night working, Leyla was on-edge as we opened the episode, trying to prep for her all-important meeting with two huge clients.
Annoyed at Liam's (Jonny McPherson) pestering, Leyla set off for work.
However, Leyla's day started to go downhill when she discovered Priya had upset the all-important clients.
Leaving Priya to deal with the journalist for a magazine, Leyla and Suzy (Martelle Edinborough) arrived at HOP for their meeting.
