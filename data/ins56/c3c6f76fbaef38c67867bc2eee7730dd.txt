CLEVELAND — Gerrit Cole brought the Yankees back from the brink. They're Bronx bound, still chasing a championship.

Cole gave New York what it needed, seven solid innings and Harrison Bader hit a two-run homer as the Yankees saved their season and forced a decisive fifth game in the AL Division Series with a 4-2 win over the Cleveland Guardians in Game 4 on Sunday night.

'This series certainly isn't over, and we have bigger goals,' Cole said. 'But I'm definitely having the time of my life and I love it and I can't wait to keep going.
