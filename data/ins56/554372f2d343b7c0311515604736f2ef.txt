It appears Iowa will have their highest-ever draft pick in the 2022 NBA draft if this prediction comes to fruition. In Jonathan Givony's most recent mock draft for ESPN, he has Hawkeyes forward Keegan Murray going No. 5 overall to the Detroit Pistons.
Murray exploded onto the scene this past season with Iowa, averaging 23.5 points, 8.7 rebounds, 1.9 blocks and 1.3 steals per game. His points per game average was tops among all Power Five players and his rebounds per game constituted second-best in the Big Ten.
