The executives of top-notch companies, who are residents of the upscale Epsilon neighbourhood are haunted by the probability of a submersion of their colony again due to deluge, though they are unaffected by the current spell of heavy downpour. People of the posh colony in suburban Yamalur are worried that they may have to once again face the travails of having to move out of their houses in case of flooding. Many parts of Bengaluru witnessed heavy overnight rainfall. "This time there is absolutely no problem in our layout but I am not sure whether the problem has been sorted out because there appears to be some pile-up of debris in the lower stream of Bellandur lake, which may cause problem in the future," Vinod Kaushik, the CEO of a startup company told PTI.
