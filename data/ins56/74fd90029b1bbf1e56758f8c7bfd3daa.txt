Hundreds of farmers whose fields are situated between the barbed-wire fence and the zero line at the India-Pakistan border in Punjab are fed up over persistent problems causing difficulties for cultivating their land. The farmers of six border districts—Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur and Fazilka—are now ready to give affidavits for selling their land to the Central government. A delegation of the Punjab Border Area Kisan Union (PBAKU)-led by its president Raghubir Singh Bhangala and vice president Surjit Singh Bhoora recently met Minister of State Jal Shakti and Tribal Affairs Bishweshwar Tudu and expressed their inabilities to till their land located beyond the fence, which is manned by border security force (BSF).
