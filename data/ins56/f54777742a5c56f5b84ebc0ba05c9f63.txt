In a landmark move by the NSW Independent Casino Commission, the Star in Pyrmont has copped a massive $100 million fine and will have its gambling licence suspended from Friday, October 21. This will be the first time in NSW history that a casino suspension has been enforced, and the largest fine issued to one in as long, given that the maximum fine for a casino in breach of codes of conduct was bumped up to $100 million from just $1 million a month ago. So what happened? The NICC last month released a scathing report, which found the Star was unfit to hold a casino licence after an inquiry identified a litany of compliance failures.
