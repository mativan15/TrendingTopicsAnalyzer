In 34 schools, none of the Class 10 students cleared the board exams this year. It would be easy to blame the pandemic for the dismal performance, but the rot goes much deeper. Fuming at the results, education minister Ranoj Pegu announced that all schools with zero pass percentage will be shut down, saying that there was no point in spending taxpayer money on them. He later clarified that these schools won't be shut down but they would be merged with others depending on enrolment and distance.
