One of the more notable transformation stories in tech recently is Amazon (AMZN 0.16%). The online seller pioneered e-commerce in North America and many parts of the world. And with its role in creating the cloud, it later evolved into a conglomerate.

However, mounting e-commerce losses mean that the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), drives most (or sometimes all) of the company's profits. This does not negate the investment case for Amazon, but profiting from Amazon will require investors to look at the internet and direct marketing retail stock in a different light.
