A brand new university is set to open its doors to post-secondary students in southern Ontario in 2024. The University of Niagara Falls Canada will be ready to welcome students, pending provincial government approval. It will offer small class sizes, 'first-class' student supports, and Global University Systems Canada, the operator of the university, says the university will provide students 'with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in the 21st-Century workforce.' Students will also get to choose between in-person, online, and hybrid-style classes.
