Google Assistant has been losing features over the past several months and two more are gearing up to be quietly cut. Assignable reminders and location-based reminders will be sunset 'soon' according to the Google Assistant support page. This might be a tricky change for people who have been relying on the features since they were introduced in 2019.
Assignable reminders are a great way to divide tasks among groups of people as they reduced the number of assignments and notifications individuals received when collaborating with others.
