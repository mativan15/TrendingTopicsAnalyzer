This claim is at odds with what Koletti told the Federal Court in December 2020, only weeks after his wife went missing.On that occasion, Koletti produced bank records to show he only had $1.95 to his name.'I was last employed on a part-time basis as a hairdresser until the COVID-19 lockdown commenced in late March 2020,' Koletti said.The court has also heard that as his wife was the primary breadwinner, it was decided he would quit work altogether to take care of home duties and look after his stepson.
