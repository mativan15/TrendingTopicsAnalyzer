They're showing off their big tips. 
Two stunning servers have gone viral on TikTok after revealing how much money they rake in during a Saturday shift at a Twin Peaks restaurant in Florida. 
The waitresses, identified only as Erika and Faith, posted their video to the viral streaming platform site last week, where it has clocked up over 2.3 million views as of Thursday evening. 
Erika and Faith — who have declared they are 'dating' — started off their video by sharing a kiss in their car before clocking in for their shift.
