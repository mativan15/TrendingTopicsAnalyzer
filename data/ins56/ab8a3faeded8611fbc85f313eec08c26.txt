The San Francisco 49ers made the biggest trade of the 2022 season — and the biggest trade since Tyreek Hill became a Miami Dolphin last spring — when they traded for Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey. It's a calculated risk for Niners general manager John Lynch to take. He's getting an All-Pro runner and receiver to add to an already loaded stable of playmakers. He'll also inherit an expensive contract that pays a player who only played 10 games in 2020 and 2021 $19 million annually.
