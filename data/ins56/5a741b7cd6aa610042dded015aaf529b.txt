Popularly social media posts feature authentic MRI images of fetuses. Future parents beware: When imaging a fetus, doing so with magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, may induce nightmares. Take, for example, this compilation of images that was first posted to a Reddit forum in late 2021 and has circulated on social media in the months since. These three images once again rose to popularity in mid-May 2022 when the Twitter account @dhomochameleon shared three such images, which garnered more than 61,000 retweets and nearly half a million likes on the social media platform 
Fun fact of the day: the reason why pregnant people get ultrasounds and not MRIs, is that in an MRI, this is what a fetus looks like.
