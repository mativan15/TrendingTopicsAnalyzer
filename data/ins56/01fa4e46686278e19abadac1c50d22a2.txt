Memorial Day weekend is finally here, which means it's time to break out the grilling supplies and sunscreen and gear up for summer. In the days leading up to the holiday — which falls on May 30 this year — many brands are hosting major sales on everything from mattresses and furniture to grills and TVs. For those looking to revamp their home this summer, the majority of deals will be on a range of big-ticket outdoor products, including patio furniture, grills and other summer essentials, said The Real Deal editor Kristin McGrath, who recommended looking out for deals on large appliances like refrigerators, as well as mattresses and baby items, including car seats, monitors and strollers.
