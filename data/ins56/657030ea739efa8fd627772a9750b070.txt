A 34-year-old driver of a school principal was arrested on Wednesday for sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl, in Hyderabad's posh Banjara Hills area, the police said. The principal, who was initially absconding, was also arrested later in the day for reportedly ignoring a complaint of the minor's parents, they added. According to the police complaint lodged by the survivor's mother late on Tuesday, her daughter joined the school five months ago and was a student of lower kindergarten. Since Monday, the survivor was complaining of pain in her legs and, when enquired, she told her mother about the sexual assault, said assistant commissioner of police (Banjara Hills), M Sudershan.
