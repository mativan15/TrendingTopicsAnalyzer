I WAS in Sri Lanka, the island of serendipity, from May 2 to 13. It was an unplanned visit, and the idea was to visit five cities: Pasikuda, a beach town on the eastern coast; Polonnaruwa, an ancient city and the second oldest of Sri Lanka's erstwhile kingdoms; Sigiriya, the famous rock fortress located in the northern Matale district; Dambulla, another ancient town in the central province; and Negombo, a major city on the island nation's west coast, which has been in the news recently for the wave of anti-government violence it saw.
