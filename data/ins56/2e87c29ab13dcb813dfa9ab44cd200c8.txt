Condemning the "provisional attachment" of its bank accounts by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Popular Front on India (PFI) on Thursday claimed that its "uncompromising stand" against the Sangh Parivar's "divisive politics" is the only reason for it becoming the target of the agency's "politically motivated" cases. The ED has attached at least 33 bank accounts of Islamist organisation PFI and a linked organisation called Rehab India Foundation as part of an anti-money laundering investigation against them, officials said on Wednesday.
