Elvis Presley-themed wedding chapels in Las Vegas could find themselves becoming heartbreak hotels, as the company that owns the King's image rights cracks down on their use.Authentic Brands Group, which controls Presley's name, image and likeness, has told themed chapels to stop using his persona in themed weddings, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.The licensing company sent cease and desist letters to multiple chapels this month, meaning that ceremonies traditionally presided over by impersonators in jumpsuits and shades may be under threat.
