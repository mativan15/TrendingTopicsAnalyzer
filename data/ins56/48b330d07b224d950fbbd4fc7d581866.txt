We had secured the favorable interest rate right before things got shaky and despite the current market conditions closed the deal without any hiccups. REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (PRWEB) June 02, 2022 Freshwater Investments has acquired 84-unit Hanover Apartments in Beaverton, Oregon for $26,5M. Built in 1998, an ideal vintage for value-add strategy, the property is comprised of good size 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom apartments with an average unit size of 918 square feet. Ideally located within Beaverton, one of Portland's most coveted suburban areas, the Hanover property is only 15-minute drive from the Portland downtown.
