PHOENIX (AP) — Former President Donald Trump endorsed investor Blake Masters in Arizona's crowded U.S. Senate primary Thursday, giving his blessing to another acolyte of tech investor Peter Thiel after his nod helped 'Hillbilly Elegy' author JD Vance secure the GOP nomination in Ohio.

Trump's endorsement could shake up a race with no clear frontrunner, which has been largely defined by jockeying for Trump's support. Despite his reelection loss, the former president remains popular with the GOP base.
