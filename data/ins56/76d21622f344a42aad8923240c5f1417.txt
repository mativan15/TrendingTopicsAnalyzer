Should you try to be like Queen Elizabeth, never retire, and keep working well into your 90s and possibly until your final day on Earth? Sure—if you have a job like hers. Do you shuttle between palaces in a chauffeur-driven limousine? Do you command an army of courtiers? Do you set your own hours? Are you not only your own boss, but the actual monarch of your own country? Can you have people thrown in the Tower of London (in theory, anyway) when they annoy you or get in your way? If all of these things apply to you in your retirement job, well—keep at it.
