How the Christian McCaffrey trade affects fantasy football (will D'Onta Foreman or Chuba Hubbard do much?)

I have to lump them together for now because we need to see who takes over the backfield in Carolina.
Last year, it was Hubbard who took over when McCaffrey went down. He did catch 25 passes and ran for 612 yards, so maybe he's the No. 1 back?
Or do you go with Foreman, who was solid for the Titans when Derrick Henry was out (566 yards on the ground and nine catches for 123 yards)?
I'm going to say this is a 60-40 situation for someone, and that 60 goes to Hubbard, given that the Panthers might be chasing points in second halves a lot.
