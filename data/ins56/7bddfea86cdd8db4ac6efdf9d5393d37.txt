Oct. 15—Brothers Bobby and Chris Hogue are in the middle of designing a new entertainment venue at a former Hempfield grocery store, but they already know there's nothing quite like it in the region.

814 Lanes & Games is set to open next year at the former Shop 'n Save building along Route 136, bringing up to 100 jobs to the area. The facility will feature bowling, ax throwing, sport simulators, laser tag, an escape room, a high ropes course, more than 50 arcade games, a restaurant and a bar.

"It's just a great community," said Bobby Hogue.
