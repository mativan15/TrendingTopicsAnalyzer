Bitcoin (BTC -1.61%) dropped below $30,000 per coin in May. The question on everyone's mind is: Can Bitcoin reach $100,000 by the end of 2022? While a 3.3-times increase in price may seem out of reach for many, this sort of growth is not unheard of, especially for Bitcoin.
When Bitcoin dropped 40% in March 2020 due to COVID-19-induced market turbulence, it then rallied more than 10 times in the 12 months that followed. Past events are not a predictor of future performance, but we may be able to draw analogies to give us confidence in predicting the direction of the market.
