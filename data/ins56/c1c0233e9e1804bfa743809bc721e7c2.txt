The CEO of electric vehicle charging firm Beam Global just bought a battery startup in a deal worth $15 million. Now, he's looking to land other strategic deals this year.Beam, based in San Diego and Chicago, is targeting an accelerating charging infrastructure market. In the US, charging infrastructure needs to expand by 20 times what it is now in order to meet the Biden administration's goal for half of all vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emissions, according to global consultancy McKinsey. This could cost a hefty $35 billion.
