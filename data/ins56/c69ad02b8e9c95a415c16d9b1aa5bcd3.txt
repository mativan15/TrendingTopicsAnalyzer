Oct. 15—With the holiday spirit and feelings of nostalgia it brings, decorating a home for the Christmas season is something that many families look forward to each year. However, some people take holiday decorating to a higher level than most, and some even love decorating and festivities so much that they celebrate holidays other than Christmas with similar gusto.

Such is the case with Lone Oak-based artist Laura Irrgang, who keeps a room of her studio decorated for Halloween year-round.

"Halloween was always a favorite time of year for me growing up, because I liked making costumes and dressing up in general, so Halloween was like the Super Bowl for me," Irrgang said with a chuckle.
