Celeste, whose name has been changed, is currently working in education beyond the state pension age, in what she describes as a 'necessity'. She has not taken a break due to caring responsibilities for children, nor has she reduced her hours, working six days a week to make ends meet. Celeste exclusively told Express.co.uk: 'I hadn't been motivated initially by money and was lucky that I could rely on my husband.'But he somehow managed to withdraw his very good pension in an effort to save his business some time ago.
