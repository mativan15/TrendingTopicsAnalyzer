Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault visited South America to rally support for biodiversity and nature conservation ahead of a critical United Nations conference being held in Montreal.

After two years of delays, countries that signed the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will meet for the 15th 'Conference of the Parties' — commonly referred to as COP15.

From Dec. 7 to 19, delegates will meet in Montreal to try to agree on a framework to halt biodiversity loss by 2030.
