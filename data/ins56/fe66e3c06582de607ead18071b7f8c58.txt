OPINION:

The Cato Institute filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education, alleging President Joe Biden's plans to erase student loans violates taxpayer rights.

Absolutely correct. This is a cut-and-dry instance of Peter getting screwed to pay off Paul's loans.

Why should those who've paid, worked hard to pay, or are still working hard to pay off student debt suffer for the laziness and whininess of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez look-alike losers?

Or, as Cato CEO Peter Goettler put it: 'Forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab for other people's college loans is bad policy, but in the case of President Biden's order, it is also illegal because neither President Biden nor the Department of Education has the power to cancel student loans without congressional authorization,' The Hill reported.
