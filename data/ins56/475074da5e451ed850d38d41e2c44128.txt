Mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs), which invest in debt, not property, have also been sold off as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates. AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC) is a mortgage REIT that focuses primarily on investing in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. AGNC Investment is probably the safest stock in the mortgage REIT space given that a potential recession would impact it less than most other mortgage REITs.
