A complex modernization of the German Armed Forces would require re-inventing 'an image of an enemy,' Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, the head of the German Bundestag's Defense Committee, has said. Now, as Russia continues its military operation in Ukraine, the Bundeswehr sees once again 'what an enemy might look like,' the MP told the RND media group on Tuesday.A whopping €100 billion ($107.35 billion)-worth military modernization fund announced by the German government on Tuesday is a major boost to the German Armed Forces, which marks 'the first step' on a long road of the German military 'meeting the expectations' of Berlin's NATO partners, Strack-Zimmermann said.
