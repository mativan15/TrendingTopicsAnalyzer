The razor-thin margins in Arizona's statehouse make it a prime target for Democrats hoping to turn the state blue in November's midterm elections.

Republicans control Arizona's Senate with a 16-14 advantage and hold the House by a 31-29 margin. In a year with highly-competitive races for governor and U.S. Senate in the state, Democrats sense an opportunity flip the script in a state that has been under Republican control for nearly a decade-and-a-half.

"In a crucial election year, flipping just one seat in the Senate would end unchecked right wing control of the legislature and put 11 electoral votes out of reach from any attempts to steal the 2024 presidential election," the States Project, an outside group that spends money for Democrats in state-level races, says of Arizona.
