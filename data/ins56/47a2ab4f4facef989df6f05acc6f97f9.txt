Joe Raedle Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) a pandemic-time stock market darling, is currently a sinking ship. The company is facing multiple impending storms at once. Demand destruction comes from low consumer sentiment due to inflation and high-interest rates, financial disaster coming from staggering losses, debt, and shareholder dilution, and finally, the prospect of macroeconomics further worsening from today's levels may sink Carvana into bankruptcy. The company's stock already fell 96% from its peak, but I strongly believe that Carvana has not hit the bottom yet.
