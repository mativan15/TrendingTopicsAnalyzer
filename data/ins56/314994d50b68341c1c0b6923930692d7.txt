Lottery operator Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI) breached the terms of its licence once during 2021 by contacting a group of players who had excluded themselves from its games, the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery said on Wednesday as it published its annual report.The regulator, Carol Boate, said the breach had occurred as a result of a time lag in the operator's systems that meant marketing communications were sent in error to 48 players who had self-excluded themselves from playing National Lottery games up to 36 hours earlier.
