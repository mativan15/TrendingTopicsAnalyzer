Rick Ledsinger began his career as a tire builder for Dunlop Tire Corp. in 1975. After working for several years on the production side and moving his way up to a production manager's role, new management at the company eliminated his position.

In wake of that move, the new management asked him in the early 1990s if he was interested in moving into human resources.

'It wasn't necessarily my decision at that point, but it was my then plant manager asking me to do that because they had a need in HR,' Ledsinger said.
