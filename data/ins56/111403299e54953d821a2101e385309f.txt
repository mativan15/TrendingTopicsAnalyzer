Willowdale is one of several Toronto wards where the lack of an incumbent will see a new face on city council, but the battle for the coveted seat has been overshadowed by an on-going dispute over the location the city settled on for one of its modular supportive housing sites.
The program is among the city's plans to respond to a housing crisis and provide affordable housing units to an eighth of Toronto's roughly 8,000 residents experiencing homelessness. The pre-constructed units can be opened on a reduced time frame and by using city-owned land, they're cost-effective for a city with budget constraints.
