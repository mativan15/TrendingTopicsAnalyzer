Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced on Thursday that only green crackers will be permitted in the state this Diwali. Except for green crackers, all types of firecrackers are prohibited from manufacture, sale, or use. Other types of firecrackers emit highly toxic gases and pollutants into the atmosphere, so only green crackers will be permitted, he said, according to an official statement here. Khattar stated that open spaces have been designated in each district for the sale of green crackers.
