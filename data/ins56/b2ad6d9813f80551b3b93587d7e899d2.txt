A refugee from Iraq who works for Domino's has been crowned the world's fastest pizza maker after crafting three in just 70 seconds.
Zagros Jaff, 33, had never even seen a pizza before he arrived in Britain at the age of 16.
But having worked for the restaurant chain in Portsmouth for the last 15 years, he has learnt a thing or two.
Zagros wowed judges and a crowd of 8,000 people as he fought off pizza makers from around the globe to claim the crown at The Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
Celebrating his win, he said: ‘It was a great feeling – I am so excited to have won.
