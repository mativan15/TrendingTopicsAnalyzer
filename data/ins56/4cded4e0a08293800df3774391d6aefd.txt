All four candidates for Kingston mayor gathered at Bayridge Secondary School Wednesday morning to participate in the city's only in-person mayoral debate of the municipal election.
'It's hard to get your voice heard, especially as a newer candidate,' says Skyler McArthur-O'Blenes, one of the candidates running for mayor.'It's hard to get to every door, and I know I haven't gotten to every door. So opportunities like this, it's great, because we can all have a shared space where questions can be asked equally, and we can all, you know, do our best to answer.
