New York, United States, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While the traditional use of cobalt extends to date in providing a brilliant blue color to ceramics, glassware, and inks, newer applications have evolved to take center stage. For instance, cobalt superalloys are extensively used in gas turbines, where high-temperature resistance and resistance to corrosion are crucial. Cobalt is also a key contributor to the development of a greener society as it acts as a catalyst in desulphurization reactions for clean fuels and gas-to-liquid technology.
