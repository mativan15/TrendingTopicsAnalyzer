Economic clarity and leadership is needed to "get us through this mess", the boss of a chemicals firm said.The government has reversed most of the mini-budget tax measures just weeks after they were announced.Adrian Hanrahan, managing director of West Bromwich-based Robinson Brothers, said the past few weeks had caused a lot of disharmony in the country."Making one announcement then rowing back against that, it's impossible to plan the business around such uncertainty," he said.Mr Hanrahan added that the mini-budget from the last chancellor had cost the firm £400,000 due to the exchange rate.
