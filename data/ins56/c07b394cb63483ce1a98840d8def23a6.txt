June 1, 2022 / 12:11 PM / CBS News After two years of pandemic challenges, Erica Gutierrez's Mexican heritage shop in Pasadena, California, is still just hanging on. Gutierrez's has not taken a paycheck, and is surviving off savings and the help of her family.  During the pandemic, the city gave her a $10,000 grant, but she has since used all the funds. Now, her business is struggling with inflation. "We have to pay more for products. We have to pay a lot more for shipping," Gutierrez told CBS News' Carter Evans.
