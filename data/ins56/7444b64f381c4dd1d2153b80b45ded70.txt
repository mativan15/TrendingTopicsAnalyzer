Ahead of the release of The Crown season 5, creator Peter Morgan has defended it against criticism.
The upcoming series is set to cover some of the most difficult years of the monarchy during the 1990s, including what was labelled the late Queen Elizabeth's ‘annus horribilis' of 1992 when three of her four children split from their partners and a major fire broke out at Windsor Castle.
It will also feature Princess Diana's infamous Panorama interview with Martin Bashir in 1995 following the breakdown of her marriage to Charles, as well as his sit down with Jonathan Dimbleby a year earlier, during which he confessed to adultery.
