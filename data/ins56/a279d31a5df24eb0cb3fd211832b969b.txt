Down beyond the shadiest part of the woods in a beautiful park near Edinburgh, Tracey Emin has chosen the perfect spot for a work that proves just how much she has come back to life after her brush with death.There in a clearing, under a canopy of beech leaves, the giant bronze figure of a woman is crouched, face down on gently rolling ground. The sculpture is, of course, stock still but the position of her left hand suggests she must be very much alive. Just as Emin, her creator, intended.'It's so different because of the undulation of the landscape and the hill,' the artist explains.
