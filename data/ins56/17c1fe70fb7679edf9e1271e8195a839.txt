Oct. 15—SWANZEY — Senior Jack Lorenz kick-started the offense and classmate Luke Weston kick-started the defense, as the Monadnock football team rolled over Kearsarge, 48-20, as the fog rolled over the field Friday night in Swanzey.

The Husky defensive line was menacing all night long — led by Weston — and came up with nine tackles for loss and five sacks in the first half alone.

The biggest sack came in the final minutes of the first half. Down 22-14, Kearsarge had the ball with a chance to drive down the field and tie things up at the half.
