The stock market is attempting to put together a rally after making new lows a week ago. Oversold rallies, as they're sometimes called, typically reach the declining 20-day moving average (MA). The current oversold rally has already accomplished that, since the 20-day MA of the S&P 500 SPX, -0.80% is at roughly 3670 points. This rally has also managed to close the first (lowest) gap on the SPX chart, below, by trading up to 3760. But now the rally appears to have stalled. There is resistance in the 3750-3800 area, and it would take a close above 3800 to upgrade this from an 'oversold rally' to a 'bear market rally.
