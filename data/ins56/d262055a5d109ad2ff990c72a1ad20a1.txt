Deandra Dottin calls herself World Boss. No prizes for guessing who inspired the nickname. She often lives up to it. Take for instance the way she performed in the final of the Women's T20 Challenge at Pune last weekend. After scoring a 44-ball 62 (one four, four sixes), she took two wickets with her seam bowling to guide Supernovas to a four-run win over Velocity.She had arrived in India a few days after cracking a 53-ball 111 (eight fours, nine sixes) for Barmy Army against Spirit at Dubai in the Fairbreak Invitational tournament.
