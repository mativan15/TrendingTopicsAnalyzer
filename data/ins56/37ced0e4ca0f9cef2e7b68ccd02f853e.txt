It's always nice to see a player come into his own and it seems like sophomore receiver Troy Franklin is living up to his four-star recruit label.
The 6-foot-3, 178-pounder from East Palo Alto, Calif. has been a favorite target for quarterback Bo Nix in the first half of the season. He leads the team in receptions (27) and receiving yards (429). With a big second half of the season, plus either a Pac-12 title game, a bowl game, or even both, Franklin has a chance to become the program's 12th receiver to accumulate 1,000 receiving yards.
