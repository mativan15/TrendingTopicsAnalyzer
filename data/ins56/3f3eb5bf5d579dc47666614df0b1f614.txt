PANAMA CITY — A popular night club allegedly involved in recent controversies has shut down.

In a Facebook post on Wednesday, officials with Vibez announced the club at 300 U.S. 98 is closed until further notice after it was "targeted" and "forced to shut down ... by the city."

However, soon after the post went live, City Manager Mark McQueen issued a statement that said "Panama City has never targeted Vibez nor required the business to close."
