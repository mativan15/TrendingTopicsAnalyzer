The FTSE 100 has just made a comeback to 7,000 levels, but the recent crash has left me with some incredible bargains. And I'm looking to capitalise on this drop before the market rebounds fully.

I'm looking for a firm operating in a growing sector with a global footprint, stable business model and steady growth.
