While the women's tournament will be held from November 7-13 in New Delhi, the men's event is slated for December in Indore. So far, 12 Indian players have signed up for the women's event before the October 24 deadline for registration.
Both tournaments carry a healthy $20,000 prize purse, which is the biggest selling point of the US-based UTR, of which Stephen Amritraj—nephew of Indian legend Vijay Amritraj—is the Chief Tennis Officer.
UTR has a universal player rating system across gender and categories (pro, college level, various age groups).
