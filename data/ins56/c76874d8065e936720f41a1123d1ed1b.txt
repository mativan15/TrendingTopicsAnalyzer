Don't be fooled by the fighter planes or explosions. It's the feelings that brought audiences to "Top Gun: Maverick," legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer said during an interview for Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on Monday.

"It's always about the emotion," he said. "A lot of people can shoot great action, but if you don't have the emotion, you don't have a great movie."

In Bruckheimer's career — which features some of Hollywood's biggest blockbuster successes like "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Bad Boys" — "Top Gun: Maverick" still stands out.
