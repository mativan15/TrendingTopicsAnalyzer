If you're like me, May is usually around the time every year I get lost in the abundance of new music. With me still trying to dissect all the underlying messages from Kendrick Lamar's last release, I have missed out on a couple of other releases from artists I enjoy. One of them being from another great storyteller like Kendrick, TyFontaine. The Southeast D.C.-born artist has finally released his long-awaited full-length project, BMG(Beautiful Michi Girls). You can tell he treated this project near and dear to his heart, with this being his first full project since his Internet Money departure, and he treated it like so.
