Made put itself up for sale last month (Made)

Embattled online furniture retailer Made has received a 'number' of unnamed approaches to acquire the business that put itself for sale last month after running into liquidity problems.

Made said it had received a number of 'non-binding indicative proposals' for the company and has now 'invited a select number of parties' to progress towards firm offers by the end of October, following a due diligence process.

'The proposals provide a range of different transaction structures, including possible offers for the issued and to be issued share capital of the company,' said Made.
