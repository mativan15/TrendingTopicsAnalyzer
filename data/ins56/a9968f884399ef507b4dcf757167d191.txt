Welcome to Money Distilled. I'm John Stepek and every weekday I'll be looking at the biggest developments in the world of markets and economics, and explaining exactly what it all means for your money.

I want to hear from you, so send your feedback, opinions or questions to me at jstepek2@bloomberg.net. I plan to print the best comments every Friday, so if you'd rather I didn't consider you for publication, then please make that clear, or else I'll assume you're happy to see your name (or email pseudonym) in lights.
