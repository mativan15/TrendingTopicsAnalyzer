Love Island's Jay Younger has claimed he was told to ‘stay away' from Paige Thorne despite them both ‘clearly' being into each other.
The personal trainer, 28, entered the villa as a bombshell, and was soon coupled up with eventual winner Ekin-su Cülcüloğlu after she crawled on the floor to get a sneaky kiss on the roof in scenes more hectic than a week of being Liz Truss.
After Paige revealed that she wasn't allowed to talk to Jay when he arrived, he's now explained it was because producers felt their connection would be ‘too predictable'.
