Colorado Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar announced on Wednesday that team captain and star forward Gabriel Landeskog is set to miss 12 weeks of action after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery.

Landeskog has yet to appear for the Avalanche in the 2022-23 NHL season, with Bednar saying last month that the 29-year-old was set to miss the start of the new year.
