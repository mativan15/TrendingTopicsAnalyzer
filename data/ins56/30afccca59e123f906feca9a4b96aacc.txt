It looks like Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings' shares on or after the 9th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of June.
