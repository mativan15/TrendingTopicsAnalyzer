Consumer advocates on Thursday urged US regulators to investigate video game maker Electronic Arts for the misleading use of a digital 'loot box' that 'aggressively' urges players to spend more money while playing a popular soccer game.
The groups Fairplay, Center for Digital Democracy and 13 other organizations urged the Federal Trade Commission to probe the EA game 'FIFA: Ultimate Team.'
In the game, players build a soccer team using avatars of real players, and compete against other teams. In a letter to the FTC, the groups said the game usually costs $50 to $100 but that the company would push players to spend more while they played.
