Top Gun: Maverick is poised to continue its epic box office run this weekend; with no major competition at US multiplexes, it'll soon zoom past the $250m mark in domestic grosses alone, with $400m or more still well within its sights. It could wind up the highest-grossing movie of the year, at least until Avatar 2 drops. If you read the analysis of certain right-leaning pundits, Top Gun: Maverick's triumph is their triumph, and a rebuke of 'woke culture' – by which is meant, movies and TV shows that do not exclusively feature white men in their leading roles.
