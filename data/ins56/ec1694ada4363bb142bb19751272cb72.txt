The Centre on Monday approved lowering the cut-off marks for admission to PG medical courses for 2022-23 while taking into consideration that a large number of seats had gone vacant in the PG counselling held for the last academic session. The reduction in cut-off marks will be by 25 percentile across all categories, official sources told PTI. The decision has been taken based on recommendations by the National Medical Commission (NMC), they said. 
Around 1,400 seats had remained vacant mainly in pre- and para-clinical subjects in the last session, the sources said.
