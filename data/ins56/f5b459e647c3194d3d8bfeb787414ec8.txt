The e-commerce giant will discontinue the Kindle eBook store on June 30, 2023, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. It promised to continue supporting Kindle readers or refund any device purchases made after January this year.

Amazon's Kindle pullout coincides with growing regulatory pressures on both local and foreign companies that operate in China, including censorship and content curbs.
