Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who is crushing the market with double-digit returns this year, urged investors to flee equities as the Federal Reserve continues to deflate the market with aggressive rate hikes. "As long as official policy is to make the stock market go down, so that people are less wealthy, so that they buy fewer things, so that prices stop going up, all while doing nothing about fiscal policy, we believe the correct posture is to be bearish on stocks and bullish on inflation," Einhorn said in an investor letter obtained by CNBC.
