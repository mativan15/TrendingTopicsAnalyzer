Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday blamed President Biden for inciting 'chaos' and 'terror' amid anti-regime protests happening around the country.

In a statement through the country's official news agency, Raisi, who was elected Iran's president last year, gave a stern warning to Biden about the ongoing crisis in his country.

'The American president, who allows himself through his comments to incite chaos, terror and destruction in another country, should be reminded of the eternal words of the founder of the Islamic Republic, who called America the great satan,' Raisi reportedly said.
