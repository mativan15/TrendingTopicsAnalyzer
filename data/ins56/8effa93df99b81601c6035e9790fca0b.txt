It's a $75,000 a year problem and it's getting worse as fly-by-night dumpers leave rubbish on Hamilton roadsides and in the city's parks and gullies. Mattresses, TVs, used nappies and green waste are among the items being dumped, often under cover of night, leaving city council staff to deal with the cleanup. Rubbish and recycling transitional manager Trent Fowles said it costs an annual $75,000 to pay for contractors to dispose of the waste. That excludes gullies, so the overall figure will be higher.
