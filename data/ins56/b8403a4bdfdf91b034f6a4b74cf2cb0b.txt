US stocks fell Thursday, stung by yields that charged higher after a regional Federal Reserve president said more rate hikes are needed to deal with stubborn inflation. Wall Street's major averages swung into the red after Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker in a speech said the central bank remains on its path toward further interest-rate increases. "Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4% by the end of the year," he told the Greater Vineland Chamber of Commerce in Vineland, New Jersey.
