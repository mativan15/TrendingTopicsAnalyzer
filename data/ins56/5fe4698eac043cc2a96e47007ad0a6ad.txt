According to an awful lot of observers, Republicans are about to win a midterm victory because they are laser-focused on addressing the country's economic problems and have managed to moderate their views on the cultural issues that previously troubled so many voters.
This approach may work for the GOP in the context of a midterm election when disgruntlement with life itself hurts the party that controls the White House and Congress. But aside from the fact that they have no actual policies for reining in inflation that won't horrify the very voters who elected them, Republican candidates and their conservative-party base haven't actually given up their extremist views on cultural or 'values' issues, as a new survey from Pew Research Center makes clear.
