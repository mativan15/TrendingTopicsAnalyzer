Scheduled after the Commonwealth Games and the World Championships, the wrestling competition at the 36th National Games in Gujarat was devoid of several top stars – including World and Olympics medalists Bajrang Punia and Ravi Dahiya, Olympic medallist Sakshi Malik and double Worlds bronze medallist Vinesh Phogat – primarily because of fitness issues.Commonwealth Games 74kg gold medallist Naveen Malik entered the competition with an injury and gave a walkover to his opponents after taking part in a bout, while Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Pooja Gehlot (50kg) withdrew after entering her name.
