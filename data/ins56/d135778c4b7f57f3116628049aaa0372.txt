Israel and the United Arab Emirates signed a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) on Tuesday – the first such deal between the Jewish state and an Arab country. The agreement, signed in Dubai by Emirati Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq Al-Marri and Israel's Economy and Industry Minister Orna Barbivay, came less than two years after the countries established diplomatic relations as part of the Abraham Accords brokered by the Trump administration.

It's a big deal for several reasons. First and foremost, it will boost economic ties between the two regional powerhouses, with trade already at an estimated $2.
