Baseball fans who have been wondering why Houston Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña makes a heart sign with his hands after big-time plays finally received an answer after Wednesday's 4-2 Game 1 win over the New York Yankees.

The star rookie spoke with TBS reporter Lauren Shehadi shortly after Houston's victory at Minute Maid Park to open this season's American League Championship Series. When asked what the gesture means, Peña had a simple response.

"It's for my mom," he said.

The most recent instance of Peña breaking out the heart sign came after his second home run in as many postseason games.
