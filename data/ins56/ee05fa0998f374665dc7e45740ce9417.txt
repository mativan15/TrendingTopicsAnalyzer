MarkRubens/iStock via Getty Images Introduction Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (OTCPK:DPMLF) is different from other precious metals plays. Its business model consists of two parts: a pure gold mining segment - now there are two gold mines located in Bulgaria: Chelopech and Ada Tepe; and Tsumeb, a processing facility in Namibia. Dundee had to purchase this facility to safely process the concentrate produced by Chelopech (and contaminated with arsenic) As a result, orthodox investors interested in exposure to gold are quite skeptical about Dundee.
