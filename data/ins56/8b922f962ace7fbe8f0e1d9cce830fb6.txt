Sharp and fast and aggressive-looking as it is, the Lamborghini Urus is actually kind of tame. Like, too tame. Thankfully, the new Performante gives the Urus a harder edge, elevating its performance to a level you'd be hard pressed to find in any other SUV.The changes start with a healthy diet. The Performante is 104 pounds lighter than the also-new Urus S, with things like a carbon fiber roof and hood, lightweight wheels and a titanium exhaust contributing to this major weight-savings. The Performante also ditches the SUV's standard air suspension and replaces it with fixed steel springs, giving more consistent cornering characteristics, though the ride quality is slightly worse for the wear.
