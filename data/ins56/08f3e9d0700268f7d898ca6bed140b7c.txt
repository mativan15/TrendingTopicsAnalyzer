Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine has overshadowed the fighting in Myanmar, clashes between the Tatmadaw and resistance forces take place daily. The National Unity Government says it now controls half the country's territory, although most of that is in the hands of armed ethnic groups that have long battled the military in remote borderlands.The unity government claims that at least 14,890 regime soldiers have died in the fighting, while it has lost just 1000 fighters. The regime refuses to discuss casualty figures.
