The gaming industry has metamorphosed completely from its old days of pixelated graphics and restricted audio qualities to becoming the mainstream entertainment experience for many, especially, youth in India. 
A few years back, you would be hard pressed to find anything above 150-odd gaming studios.

The segment grew by leaps and bounds during the pandemic both in India and globally.
