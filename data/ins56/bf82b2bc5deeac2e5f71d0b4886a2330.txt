AIADMK Secretary (East) A. Anbalagan on Sunday said the DMK, which was in power in Tamil Nadu, was raising the bogey of Hindi imposition to distract the attention of the people from the tax hikes it had imposed in recent months.Addressing a press conference, Mr. Anbalagan said the DMK, which came to power in Tamil Nadu by making more than 500 'false promises' in the last Assembly election, had imposed many taxes such as property tax, house tax, drinking water tax and electricity tax, and made the lives of the common people miserable.
