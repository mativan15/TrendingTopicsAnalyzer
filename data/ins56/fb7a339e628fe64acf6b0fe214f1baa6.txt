Kevin Spacey was found not liable for battery in connection to Anthony Rapp's sexual assault claims.
 
On Thursday CNN reported that a New York jury determined the House of Cards actor, 63, was not responsible for battery related to Rapp's allegations that Spacey made a sexual advance on him when he was 14 years old.
 
The jury of six men and six women deliberated for more than an hour before concluding there was insufficient evidence to prove Spacey inappropriately touched Rapp, according to NBC News.
