West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, whose Trinamool Congress came to power after dislodging the Left government in 2011 on the back of the anti-land acquisition movement at Singur in Hooghly district, claimed that she didn't drive the Tata out, and in fact, it was the CPM. "They acquired land forcibly, I returned it to unwilling owners," Banerjee.Addressing ‘Bijaya Sammilani', where prominent personalities and Durga Puja committees of the eight districts of the northern part of the state were invited, Mamata Banerjee said she wants to create job opportunities for the youth of Bengal by building factories and hotels, and make the state a tourist destination of the world.
