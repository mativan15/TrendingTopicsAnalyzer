Sean Gallup Foxconn Technology Co. (OTCPK:FXCOF) launched two electric vehicle prototypes this week as it continues to prep to enter the automobile manufacturing industry. That makes five concept cars that Foxconn has developed as it tries to show off its auto credentials. The Taiwanese firm's stated goal is to design and manufacture vehicles for an existing brand and CEO Young Liu was not shy this week about mentioning Tesla (TSLA) as one of the EV players that it would like to build cars for in the future.
