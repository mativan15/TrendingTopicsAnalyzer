Alessandro Bastoni's agent has confirmed the player is keen to stay at Inter Milan despite transfer interest from Tottenham. Spurs are keen on a move worth more than £50m for the defender but face a challenge in convincing him to leave the club. The 23-year-old is believed to be happy at the San Siro and, while a dead is not dead in the water, Joško Gvardiol of RB Leipzig has emerged as an alternative target. Bastoni worked with Conte during his time in charge of Inter and formed part of the side who ended Juventus' dominance in Serie A, winning the League title in the 2020/21 season.
