FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Max Duggan and No. 13 TCU found themselves down in a hurry in their biggest game so far with coach Sonny Dykes.

When it was all over against eighth-ranked Oklahoma State, the Horned Frogs were getting swarmed by their fans after needing some extra time to wrap up an impressive comeback.

'It shows the culture of this team,' Duggan said.

Kendre Miller scored on a 2-yard run in the second overtime and TCU won 43-40 in a matchup of the Big 12's last remaining undefeated teams Saturday.
