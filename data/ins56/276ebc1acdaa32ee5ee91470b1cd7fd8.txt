Companies have grappled with labor shortages over the last few years as workers have quit at near-record rates. Now some businesses are trying to make it more costly for employees to join the Great Resignation. Nearly 10% of US workers are covered by training repayment agreement provisions, according to a study from the Cornell Survey Research Institute, first reported on by Reuters. These provisions, or "TRAPS" as critics calls them, require workers to reimburse their employer for some of their job training costs if they quit too soon.
