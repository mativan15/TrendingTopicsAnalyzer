An old feed store is now a new dog treat bakery at 35 Oakland St.in Manchester. (Chris Dehnel/Patch )MANCHESTER, CT — Friday's grand opening of the Dog Barkery was symbolic of how one corner of Manchester's north end has become revitalized. The Dog Barkery is the baking operation of the Leaps & Bones per supply chain. Next Door sits the Take Care Tattoo Co. and adjacent is a plant that processes pellets. They have all taken the place of an old feed depot that, for all intents and purposes, has ben sitting vacant and all but forgotten.
