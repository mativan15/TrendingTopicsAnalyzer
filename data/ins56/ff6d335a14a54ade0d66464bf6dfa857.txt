The cocreator of dogecoin has made some harsh comments about Elon Musk, calling the Tesla and SpaceX CEO a "grifter" who wasn't capable of running basic code. However, Palmer criticized Musk in his interview with Crikey and shared some details of his "interesting past" with the billionaire. According to Palmer, he first messaged the billionaire on Twitter some years ago after creating a bot that would help detect if there was a cryptocurrency scam in a Twitter mention and send an automated report to the platform flagging the scam, per Crikey.
