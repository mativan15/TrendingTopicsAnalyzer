WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government will continue taking steps to release additional output from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as needed and then replenish the reserve, a senior U.S. energy adviser said on Wednesday.

President Joe Biden has been clear that he will continue to work to bring down prices for American consumers after a spike in energy prices from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adviser Amos Hochstein said in an interview with CNN.

Biden is due to make remarks on gas prices on Wednesday, including announcing another selloff from the nation's emergency oil reserve.
