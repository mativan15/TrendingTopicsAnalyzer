During the pandemic, I started seeing a lady from the EU who is a yoga instructor and 25 years younger than me (I am 73). Although we live quite a distance apart, we have seen each other fairly often, and messaged almost every day; generally when we do meet she comes to my house, and I have occasionally visited hers which – as I understood it – she rented and shared with a housemate.
I have always felt slightly insecure about our relationship, partly due to the age difference, but chiefly because I have no illusions about our relative attractiveness: at the outset, friends warned me about the possibility that she was only interested in my money (I am comparatively wealthy).
