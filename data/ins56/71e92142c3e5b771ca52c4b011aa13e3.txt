A net, a 30-metre pitch, and four players kicking a ball back and forth across the ground... This is "razball", a sport created in Bobo-Dioulasso, a town in southwest Burkina Faso, in July 2021. One year after its creation, we spoke to the creator of the sport, which is becoming more and more popular.

The sport was invented just last year by Zakaria Bandaogo. He says the sport is about more than just athletic prowess.

The vocabulary used in razball is a reflection of the different cultures of Burkina Faso.
