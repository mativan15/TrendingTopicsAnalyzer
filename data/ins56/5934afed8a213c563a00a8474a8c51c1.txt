has entered into an agreement with blusmart electric mobility for the delivery of 10,000 xpres t electric vehicles.
This is the biggest order in India by far for delivering the biggest EV fleet. Tata controls 90% of India's electric car sales with just the Nexon EV and one additional model for fleet sales, giving it a crucial first-mover advantage despite EVs accounting for only 1% of the overall auto industry.

Tata announced in June that it would launch ten electrified vehicles by March 2026. According to insiders, it plans to triple EV output to 80,000 cars this fiscal year.
