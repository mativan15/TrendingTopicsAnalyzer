A couple who were offered a refund for a cancelled Qantas booking are still waiting to see the money more than 12 weeks later. Simon Rutherford and Lisa Keenan had booked flights from Auckland to Vancouver via Sydney with the Australian airline in February, spending $4300 on tickets for themselves and their four-year-old son Louie. The flight was set to depart at 1.30pm on June 4, but on March 3, they were notified the flight time had been changed to 6am that day. The new time didn't suit the family, who are based in the Wakamarina Valley between Nelson and Blenheim, and didn't want to have to spend a night in Auckland, as they would be travelling with extensive gear for a three-month trip, including bike boxes.
