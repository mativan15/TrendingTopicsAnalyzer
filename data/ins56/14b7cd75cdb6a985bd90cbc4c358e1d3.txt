British Columbia's premier-designate David Eby says he will focus on making the province a better place to live after he is sworn in as premier in November.
'During this campaign, I have met so many incredible people from across the province. Everywhere I go I hear that while our government has accomplished a lot, there's much more we need to do because so many people are truly struggling,' Eby said.'The cost of housing, the strain on health care, and the impacts of climate change on our communities — we must confront the big challenges people are facing.
