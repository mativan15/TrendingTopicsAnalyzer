A girl in Bihar is being called 'spider girl' because she was born with two extra arms and two legs attached to her waist. The girl is reportedly 2.5 years old and is from Bihar's Nevada district. Since her birth, the girl has had four arms and legs. This obviously was a shock to her family who is from a quite poor background. The video of the girl was first shared by Hindi news channel News24, and has since gone viral. In it, she can be seen walking and doing everything a kid does. However, the extra limbs were left motionless on her waist.
