Former President Donald Trump is set to be deposed for a civil lawsuit accusing him of defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her in a New York department store. Trump lost his bid to delay being questioned under oath by Carroll's lawyers when a Manhattan federal judge brushed aside arguments that a pending appeal in the lawsuit warranted putting the case on hold. The deposition comes two months after Trump refused to answer questions under oath in a deposition by lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James in connection with a civil investigation of his company.
