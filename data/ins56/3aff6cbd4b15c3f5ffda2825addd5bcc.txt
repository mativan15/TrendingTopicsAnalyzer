Democrats behind the scenes are already talking about and making contingency plans for 2024 in case President Biden decides not to seek a second term, moves expected to intensify immediately after Election Day.

Nov. 8 won't just decide what Congress looks like for the next two years. It will in many ways kick off the presidential campaign season and determine what that looks like for Democrats.

If they do better than expected, Biden could make a strong case for running again and the likelihood that he'll get a credible challenger shrinks.
