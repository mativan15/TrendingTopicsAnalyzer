Major corporations are scrambling to repurchase their own shares before a new tax on stock buybacks passed as part of Democrats' major spending bill over the summer goes into effect, an effort that may sap one of the bill's main sources of revenue.

Stock buybacks occur when a company buys its own shares, taking them out of the marketplace, which increases the value of the earnings-per-share and makes each outstanding share worth more money.

A basic arithmetic trick, buybacks were illegal until 1982 and have long been blasted by critics as a legal form of market manipulation and a way for executives to pay themselves more.
