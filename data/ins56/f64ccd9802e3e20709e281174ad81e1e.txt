CHARLOTTE, N.C. — House Majority Whip James Clyburn (S.C.), the third-ranking member of the House Democratic leadership, says he's not commenting on whether President Biden should run for re-election until he sees the results of the Nov. 8 election.

'I have no idea. Until this election is over, I'm not going to focus on '24,' Clyburn said at a campaign event in Charlotte for Senate candidate Cheri Beasley.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) have also sidestepped questions about whether Biden should run for a second term.
