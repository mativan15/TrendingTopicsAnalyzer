In a bid to boost the supply of affordable housing, Premier Doug Ford plans to eliminate development charges for homeowners who want to add rental apartments to existing homes.

Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark, who will table sweeping new legislation Tuesday, said the move is part of the government's push to build 1.5 million new homes over the next decade.

'We'll create an opportunity for people to build that second or third unit in their home without … the lengthy (planning approval) process and, in some cases, development charges that go with it,' the minister said.
