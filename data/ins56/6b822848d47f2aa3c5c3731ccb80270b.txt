The Tory Right was in uproar on Thursday over the 'extraordinary' removal of Suella Braverman as they warned Liz Truss she risked losing their support if she eased immigration controls to boost growth.
In the Commons, MPs said it would be a 'huge mistake' for the Government to soften its tough line on illegal immigration or replace 'mass migration from the EU with mass migration from the rest of the world.'
A senior figure in the European Research Group (ERG) - of which Mrs Braverman was a former chair - said it would be 'completely contrary to our manifesto and contrary to the thrust of Government policy.
