October is quickly coming to a close, which will mark the end of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM). As organisations may know, this is an annual campaign to raise awareness about cybersecurity, emphasising personal accountability and stressing the importance of taking proactive steps to enhance cybersecurity. The overarching message this year was focused on key areas including citizen privacy, consumer devices, and e-commerce security. Now in its 16th year, NCSAM is co-led by NCSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA).
