GREENSBORO, N.C. — National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott (R-Fla.) says Republicans will likely control 52 Senate seats next year and have a pathway to a 55-seat majority, given how recent polls show GOP candidates picking up momentum.

Scott is voicing a more confident view of the Nov. 8 midterm election than Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has predicted the battle for the Senate will be 'really close either way' and whatever party wins is likely to control a very narrow majority.
