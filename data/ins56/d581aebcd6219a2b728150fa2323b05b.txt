A fledgling salsa enterprise is marking a milestone as it prepares for a regional 'future food' showcase. Tex-As Salsas is taking jars from its 500th batch to the inaugural Food Innovation Big Day Out on Friday. The event, hosted by Food HQ, is intended to showcase food innovation in Manawatū. Almost 30 exhibitors are taking part. One of them is Tex-As Salsas, a venture founded by Houston, Texas, native Kari Highstead in Palmerston North in 2019.
