If the turnout is to be considered as the yardstick for measuring success, then ‘Visakha Garjana', organised by the Uttarandhra JAC that was formed to endorse support to the State government's decision on three capitals and decentralised development, can be termed a success.In the Saturday's ‘garjana' in Visakhapatnam, thousands turned up.Though it was much less than the expected one lakh to two lakh people, it could still be called a success, as the crowd, which included students, had come from various corners of the city and district braving incessant and heavy downpour.
