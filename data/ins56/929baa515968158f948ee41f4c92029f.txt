Porter and the 2019 draft class faced a deadline of Monday at 6 p.m. ET to sign a contract extension. "He's been our most consistent guy in terms of getting in the gym every day," general manager Rafael Stone said of Porter last month. "He's really built really good habits. I'm happy for him. A good three months isn't what he's looking to have -- he's looking at the rest of his life.
