gorodenkoff Kintara Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KTRA) said it paused its REM-001 program in cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (CMBC) to save cash. The money will be used to fund an ongoing international registrational study of VAL-083 to treat a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma (GBM), the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Kintara President and CEO Robert Hoffman expects results from the GBM AGILE study of VAL-083 at the end of 2023. By pausing the REM-001 program, Kintara expects to save ~$3M through 2023.
