Crystal RosasBy @LaCrystalRosasJun 2, 2022This past Tuesday, every municipal worker received a memo from the mayor's chief of staff. Part of it read, "All city employees should be advised that, absent a reasonable accommodation, you are required to report to work in person for every scheduled workday and hybrid schedules of any kind are not permitted." The mayor is saying that he wants city workers to 'lead by example' by returning to the office full-time. In addition, at a Wall Street 'power breakfast' yesterday morning, he urged business leaders to bring private-sector employees back to the largely empty Manhattan buildings.
