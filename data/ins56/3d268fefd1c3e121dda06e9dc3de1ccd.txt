 Much to everyone's surprise, Google recently teased a new Pixel Tablet – one which we probably won't see until next year. But one of the most exciting possible features wasn't included in the tease.That feature is a stylus, which is something there's now significant evidence we might see included with the slate. Why? Because – as spotted by tech blog NuGiz (opens in new tab) – a Google tablet codenamed Tangor has been certified by the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI).Of course, it's possible that Tangor is a different device to the Pixel Tablet, but given that we're only aware of one tablet being worked on by Google, that's unlikely, and this certification all but confirms an upcoming Google slate will have stylus support.
