Mariah Carey is entering the crypto space with the launch of her very first NFT, and in true diva fashion, the winner of the NFT will get a full-on experience.
Designed like a boarding pass (on 'Butterfly Airways,' natch), the NFT includes an opportunity to meet Carey and fly with her on a private jet to New York later this month, when the music legend is inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The winner bidder (and a guest) will also get to sit with Carey at her table during the actual induction ceremony.
