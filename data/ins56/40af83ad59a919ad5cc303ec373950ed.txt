Events of the past 12 months, with three British prime ministers occupying No. 10 Downing Street after Liz Truss quit Thursday following just 45 days in office, have shattered that image.

'There is no question that the U.K.'s standing in the world has been severely battered by (Truss's resignation) and by the revolving door of prime ministers,' said Bronwen Maddox, director of the international affairs think tank Chatham House.

'For the U.K. to regain respect — and an image of reliability — it needs to acquire another soon, one who is capable of putting policies into action,' Maddox added.
