India's main opposition Congress party elected Mallikarjun Kharge as its new president on Wednesday in a contest in which the Nehru-Gandhi family, which has led the party for more than two decades, did not compete. The party, which has long touted its secular politics, has struggled to regain support since being routed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014. Kharge, 80, from the southern state of Karnataka, was backed by the party's top leaders.
