Consumer finance firm Real Finance has agreed to repay $1.36 million to borrowers, after acknowledging it charged unreasonable fees. It has entered a settlement with the Commerce Commission, admitting it entered into contracts with borrowers between April 2013 and March 2020 that breached the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA). The fees charged were more than what was reasonable for the loans to have cost the company. Commission chair Anna Rawlings said the law had been clear for many years that fees must be reasonable, and lenders should only recover costs that were closely related to the matter for which the fees were being charged.
