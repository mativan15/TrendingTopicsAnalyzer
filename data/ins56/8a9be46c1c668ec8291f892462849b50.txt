Chargers WR Keenan Allen could make his return in Week 7 following a hamstring injury that has held him out the last five games.

COSTA MESA – Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen will be a game-time decision in Week 7 against the Seahawks, coach Brandon Staley announced following Friday's practice.

'He's closer," Staley said of Allen's likelihood to make his return. "He had a good week. He was in practice — not only in individual [period] but during team — and that was important, to play 11-on-11 and get that unchoreographed movement of having to beat someone man-to-man, having to go feel what it's like to block someone and get that resistance.
