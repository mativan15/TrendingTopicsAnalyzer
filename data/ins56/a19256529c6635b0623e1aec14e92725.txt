After two games in The Bronx, Myles Straw probably could teach a graduate-level class on booing.
The most hated Guardians player in the AL Division Series, Straw has been showered with jeers and taunts at the plate and in center field. Friday, however, Straw heard some Yankees fans turn that ire on one of their own. Aaron Judge, who slugged 62 home runs this season, was booed after his fourth strikeout of the afternoon.
'That's crazy to me. I don't think that should be a thing,' said Straw, who went 0-for-3 with a walk in the Guardians' 4-2, 10-inning victory Friday, which evened the series.
