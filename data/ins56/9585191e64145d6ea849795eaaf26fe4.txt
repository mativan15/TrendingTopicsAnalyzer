TanyaSid/iStock via Getty Images Oatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) is positioned to become the number one plant-based milk company globally, but the company is currently facing high costs and a limited cash runway. Oatly must insource production and realize economies of scale in coming quarters or may need to raise capital under extremely unfavorable circumstances. Assuming the company can transition to cashflow breakeven without diluting existing shareholders, the long-term success of the company is largely dependent on their ability to remain a differentiated premium product in the eyes of consumers.
