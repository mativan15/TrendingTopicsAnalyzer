Rings of Power is no more, having ended on a Sauron-laden note last week. Amazon is committed to the show for the long haul, so it will be back soon enough, but in the meantime, they're attempting to fill the void. If Rings of Power was Amazon's stab at a massively popular fantasy series like Game of Thrones, than The Peripheral is their attempt to replicate HBO's Westworld to a certain extent, using many of the same people involved. Namely Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, who are producers on the series.
