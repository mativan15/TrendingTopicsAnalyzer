'Nykaa share price is up from IPO price even today. It is the listing pop from where some amount of share price decline has happened but continues to be in positive territory even from an IPO price,' says Falguni Nayar, Founder & CEO, Nykaa. 
On Nykaa's results and impact on futureFrom Nykaa's perspective, we have had almost 6 million new customers acquisition this year and this is around 4.4 million new customers acquired in beauty and about 1.6 million in fashion. That has been a big investment that we are making for the future and that also reflects a slight erosion in EBITDA.
