NYCstock/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Snap (NYSE:SNAP) is up 5.4% - the Communications sector's top big gainer, but for Netflix - as Citi opens a positive catalyst watch on the stock headed into Thursday earnings. The bank started a 30-day positive watch "given the potential for upward revenue provisions given an improving online advertising environment," with the company's planned 20% workforce reduction offering earnings support. Revenue and EBITDA are likely to beat Citi's and the Street's expectations given that ad improvement, analyst Ronald Josey says, and so Citi will focus on the 2023 outlook which reportedly is looking toward 20% revenue growth and EBITDA of $1.
