The UK's justice system is 'ill-equipped' to tackle a spiralling fraud epidemic and needs a rapid overhaul, a cross-party committee of MPs has concluded.The justice select committee found that traditional crimes were being wrongly prioritised by police and prosecutors in a report released on Tuesday, and described Action Fraud, the UK's centre for collating allegations of cybercrime, as 'unfit for purpose'.MPs also found that policing was inadequate to deal with the scale, complexity and evolving nature of fraud.
