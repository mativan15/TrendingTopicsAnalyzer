With Memorial Day here, there are plenty of Memorial Day sales to check out. One of the true highlights is the Dell Memorial Day sale which has something for everyone. One particular highlight is being able to buy the Dell XPS 17 for $850 off bringing it down to $2,000. A chunky saving on a high-end laptop, it's pretty much one of the best Dell laptop deals around. If you're looking to buy a true portable powerhouse, you can't go wrong with this one. However, be quick — Dell sales are notoriously limited in stock and you really don't want to miss out on such a big discount.
