John M. Chase/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (NASDAQ:CME) may have just completed a 25% drawdown from its recent $251 in late March '22, which may or may not be a tell on a pending change in course in the Fed's monetary policy. In late 2018, the last time Jay Powell was raising the fed funds rate somewhat aggressively, CME peaked in mid-November, 2018, (correcting 18% during that pullback) almost 4-5 weeks prior to the Fed Chair announcing the Fed was reversing course and becoming much more accommodative, which was the case in 2019.
