The Houston Astros and New York Yankees have met less than 100 times in their history, but as of late, it's difficult to describe the relationship between them as anything other than a rivalry.

Houston and New York will meet in the ALCS for the third time in six years, with Game 1 set for Wednesday evening at Minute Maid Park. The Astros boast the top regular-season record in the American League at 106-56, while the Yankees finished seven games back in the No. 2 spot.

Below is a look at the recent history between the two teams, both in the 2022 season and the playoffs.
