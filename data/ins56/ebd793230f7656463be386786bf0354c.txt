Halifax will need to build an additional 38,000 housing units over the next five years to address the housing shortage and account for a population boom, according to a new report. While the city's population is anticipated to grow to 650,000 by 2037, so will the urgent need for homes. "As you know we have goals for the growth of the province, so if we're going to see that kind of growth we need places for people to live," said Nova Scotia Housing Minister John Lohr. The province's housing task force has said it hopes to meet those targets and build 7,600 new units each year until 2027.
