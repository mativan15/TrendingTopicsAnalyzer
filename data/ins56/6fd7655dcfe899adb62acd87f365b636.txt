The Department of Defense announced Thursday that it will subsidize the transportation expenses for female soldiers and their dependents to receive abortions.

It will allocate money for 'travel and transportation allowances for Service members and their dependents, as appropriate and consistent with applicable federal law and operational requirements, and as necessary amend any applicable travel regulations, to facilitate official travel to access non covered reproductive health care that is unavailable within the local area of a Service member's permanent duty station,' a Pentagon memo obtained by the Daily Signal reads.
