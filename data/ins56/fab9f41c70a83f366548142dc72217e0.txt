BOK chief makes pitch for resilience of financial markets amid heightened volatility WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (Yonhap) -- South Korea does not face the same challenge of securing dollars as previous financial crises and currently maintains a "stable" foreign exchange (FX) liquidity position despite recent heightened financial market volatility, Seoul's top central banker said Saturday. Bank of Korea (BOK) Gov. Rhee Chang-yong made the remark in a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank based in Washington, where he was attending annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
