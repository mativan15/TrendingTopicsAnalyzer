Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, has proposed to buy Parler, the social media platform popular among US conservatives, parent Parlement Technologies said on Monday.
Nashville-based Parler, which has raised about $56 million till date, said it expects the deal to close during the fourth quarter of 2022. It did not give a deal value.
The deal comes as Parler, launched in 2018 and styled itself as a free-speech space for those seeking an alternative to platforms such as Twitter, has been reinstated on Google and Apple's app stores after being removed following the US capitol riots in January 2021.
