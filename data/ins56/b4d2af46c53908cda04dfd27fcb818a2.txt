(NYSE:RMD) to Buy from Neutral on Thursday, citing a favorable outlook and expecting the company to report better than expected revenue for Q1 fiscal 2023. The decision comes even as the analyst Lyanne Harrison issues consensus-beating Q3 revenue and earnings estimates for the company, which is expected to report its Q1 FY23 results on Oct. 27 after the closing bell. Raising the price target to $260 from $245 per share, Harrison highlighted the favorable trends in chip supply and production ramp in the company's respiratory care devices C2C and AS11.
