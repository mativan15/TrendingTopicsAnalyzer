A campaign opposing a Newport Beach ballot measure that would allow voters to elect their mayor posted a fictional 'Godfather'-style video over the weekend on social media in which an actor playing a Newport Beach mayor and proponent of the measure is shot multiple times in the chest.The 'Stop the Power Grab — No on B' campaign quickly removed the video from its social media platforms.'The video is disgusting and incredibly tone deaf, especially for the time that we are going through right now in our country,' said Will O'Neill, a Newport Beach City Council member and former mayor who is pushing Measure B.
