SAND555Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) might be hard-pressed to deliver on Q3 and Q4 estimates in light of a seemingly endless slide in commodity prices. Because of this, along with subpar near-term growth metrics, we rate the stock a hold. However, with the world's largest copper reserves and plans to boost production by 90% by 2030, the company is well positioned for the long run. Not to mention, we calculate that SCCO is currently trading about 25% below its intrinsic value. Hence, we plan to revisit the stock once the price of copper stops sliding.
