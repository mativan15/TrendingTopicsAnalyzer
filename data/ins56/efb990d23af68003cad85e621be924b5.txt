Jurgen Klopp will be happy if Pep Guardiola failed to agree a new deal at Manchester City saying it would help Liverpool's title chances if his rival ‘took a sabbatical for the next four years'.

Klopp added he wished Guardiola had ‘taken a sabbatical for the last four' as he acknowledged the brilliance of his opponents ahead of Sunday's Anfield meeting.

The Liverpool manager's remarks were partly tongue in cheek, but he was serious when saying he would have no regrets if the era-defining rivalry between the duo came to an end sooner rather than later.
