Published: 08:14 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 08:14 EDT, 20 October 2022 Alabama coach Nate Oats doesn´t plan to tolerate his team slacking on defense this season. The 20th-ranked Crimson Tide has talent both returning and incoming, but plenty to improve on from a season that crashed to a halt with a first-round NCAA Tournament exit after an end-of-season skid. A team that had risen as high as No. 6 lost its final four games. Oats´ priorities: Better leadership, shooting and, of course, defense.
