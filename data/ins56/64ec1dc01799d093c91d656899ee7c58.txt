Helen Skelton and Gorka Marquez left fans feeling emotional after their Movie Week performance to a Grease hit in Movie Week on Strictly Come Dancing. TV presenter Helen has managed to avoid the dance-off so far but her long-term future on the show has been questioned. Dancing with the Stars expert Gary Edwards claims she may not be "finalist material". Helen had a great night during Movie Week with her dance partner as they took to the floor to Hopelessly Devoted To You. This week they are taking on the Paso Doble to Tamacun by Rodrigo y Gabriela, and Helen has a lot of work on her hands.
