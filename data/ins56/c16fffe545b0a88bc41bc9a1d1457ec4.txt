Supermarket shelves have been stripped of popular brands of potato chips, while fish and chip shops are now struggling to get certain brands with the wet weather and supply chain issues affecting supplies of the humble spud.Earlier this year growers warned the country faced a national potato shortage after wet weather wiped out crops, and prices for fertiliser, fuel and transport skyrocketed because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.And this week PepsiCo Australia, which produces popular chip brands like Smith's and Red Rock Deli, warned stock levels could be affected for several months.
