PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona 's Republican attorney general, Mark Brnovich, on Friday asked the FBI and IRS to look into an election integrity group that claimed to have uncovered widespread fraud in the 2020 election but never provided evidence.

True the Vote, a nonprofit organization, has raised 'considerable sums of money' on its claim that it had evidence of widespread fraud and may have broken federal tax laws, Reggie Grigsby, a criminal investigator in Brnovich's office, wrote to federal authorities.
