After dipping her toes in the Los Angeles fashion industry as a merchandiser and 'not really feeling it,' veteran music publicist Romina Magorno discovered her passion for public relations when she got her first big break at D Baron Media in 2006.  'I took the gig as an assistant at a 30K pay cut, which was insane, but it was in my gut. Something told me I was made to be in public relations,' says Magorno, who credits D Baron Media founder and CEO Diana Baron as the mentor who taught her how to be a true, traditional publicist.
