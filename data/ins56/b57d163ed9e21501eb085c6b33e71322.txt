The stock market briefly bounced back last week from a widespread selloff that began earlier this month, but equities are likely to see further losses as sky-high inflation and an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve continue to pose risks to the economic outlook. That's according to Morgan Stanley analysts, who said in a note that the relief rally in the stock market has limited scope to go much further until the risks begin to fade. INFLATION SOARS 8.3% IN APRIL, HOVERING NEAR 40-YEAR HIGH"Last week's strength will prove to be another bear market rally in the end," the strategists, led by Michael Wilson, wrote in the note.
