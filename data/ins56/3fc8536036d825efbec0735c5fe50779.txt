Florida isn't the best state for highest-earning hotels, but it makes its mark within the top five.

The Sunshine State ranks No. 4 for highest-earning hotels with the average hotel raking in revenue of about $5.98 million, said a HotelTechReport, a Los Angeles-based hotel industry app store. The report analyzed industry data for each U.S. state looking into the number of hotels in each market, number of employees and the number of hotel businesses in comparison to total businesses.

The top states for revenue were Hawaii ($25.
