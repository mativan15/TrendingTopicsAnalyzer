A new round of increases to Queensland government fines, this time targeting e-scooters, will see riders charged up to $575 for speeding, and more than $1000 for holding a mobile phone.

The reforms include speed-limit reductions, mandated warning bells, and a tiered system of fines for offences that didn't previously exist or were lumped into general categories of non-compliance.

From November 1, anyone caught travelling up to 13 kilometres above the new 12km/h speed limit on shared footpaths will face a $143 fine, Transport Minister Mark Bailey announced on Saturday.
