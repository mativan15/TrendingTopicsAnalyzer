Leeds United are not keen on the prospect of a Barcelona swap deal involving Raphinha, according to reports. Keeping hold of the Brazilian could prove tough if the Catalan side firm up their interest, but with money still tight at the Camp Nou, Xavi and co are weighing up whether to cough up for the boosted price-tag after the Whites secured Premier League football on the final day of the season. Raphinha played a huge role in firing Leeds to safety last campaign as his growing pool of admirers watched on.
