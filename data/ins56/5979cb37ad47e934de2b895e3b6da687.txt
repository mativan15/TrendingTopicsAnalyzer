Jun. 5—LEWISTON — It doesn't take long to get to know the man behind the multi-layer business the public knows as Roopers.

At 63, the former soldier turned entrepreneur isn't ashamed to say he's lived a hardscrabble life. Steve Roop has quite literally built from scratch what 30 years later has become a beverage retailer, wholesaler and redemption center behemoth in central Maine.

It all started in March 1992 as a small redemption station on Sabattus Street, built and run by Roop himself. At night he started building out what would become his first beer and wine store.
