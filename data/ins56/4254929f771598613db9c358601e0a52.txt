Carbon Health, a primary care startup that combines software with in-person clinics, said Thursday it had laid off 250 employees. 'For the last few years, we have been more focused on topline revenue growth, patient acquisition, patient retention and service expansion, and we have been less focused on profitability,' cofounder and CEO Eren Bali wrote in a statement. 'While that was the right decision in 2020 and 2021, the macro environment with more volatile capital markets means it is vital that we become less focused on growth and more focused on profitability.
