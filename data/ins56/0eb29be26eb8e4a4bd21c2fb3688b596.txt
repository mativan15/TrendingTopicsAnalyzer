A few closely followed mortgage refinance rates advanced today. Both 15-year fixed and 30-year fixed refinances saw their mean rates rise. Average rates for 10-year fixed refinances also increased. Though refinance rates do fluctuate slightly on a daily basis, homeowners can expect to see rates rise over the course of this year. In recent months, rates have been trending up from historic lows seen during the pandemic, and are now closer to 2018 rate levels. That means if you're looking to shave dollars and interest off your current monthly mortgage payments, these could be the lowest rates of 2022.
