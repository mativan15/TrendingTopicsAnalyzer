OntheRunPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Controladora Vuela Compañía de Aviación, or Volaris (NYSE:VLRS) as it's commonly-known, is the largest airline in Mexico. It started as an upstart budget airline. However, the legacy carriers in Mexico have struggled, with one disappearing entirely and the other going through bankruptcy and significantly downsizing. This has left Volaris as the king of the Mexican airline market; it now has more than 40% national market share coming out of the pandemic.
