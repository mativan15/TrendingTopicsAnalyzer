Today, Vox announced its inaugural 'Future Perfect 50' list, highlighting visionaries who are making a difference today and improving the lives of tomorrow. The list honors change agents — from thinkers whose moral imagination pushes the boundaries of what is possible and activists making the world a better, healthier place on the ground to the technologists imagining the future and the ethicists ensuring it doesn't go awry. The list of visionaries is a distillation of the Vox vertical Future Perfect's mission to surface the important ideas, policies, and programs bending the future toward a more perfect destination.
