ReutersET had reported that the state was working on mapping each family for a family card. The Uttar Pradesh budget for 2022-23 has special focus on farmers and the youth. They are two voter classes that have raised their voice against the BJP government in the recent past. In the first budget of its second term, the Yogi Adityanath government has initiated measures to win the confidence of the largest two voter groups before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Though the farmers' agitation did not hit the BJP's prospects in this year's assembly polls, the state government has announced a scheme to protect the family of accident victims.
