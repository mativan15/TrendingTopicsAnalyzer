Mississippi State University football player Sam Westmoreland died Wednesday. He was 18.

Westmoreland's cause of death was not immediately known, but police told the Mississippi Clarion Ledger that foul play was not suspected.

Westmoreland was a walk-on freshman offensive lineman. He would have turned 19 in two days, according to his school bio.

'Sam was a beloved son, brother and teammate, and a tremendous young man with a limitless future,' Mississippi State football coach Mike Leach said in a statement.
