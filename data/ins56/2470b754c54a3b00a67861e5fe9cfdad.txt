Canola oil and gas are some of the key ingredients fuelling Chris Page's food truck business in Windsor, Ont. But inflation has caused the price of both products to skyrocket over the last year. When Page first started his business in 2021, he said he could buy 16 litres of canola oil for about $19. Now, he's paying $52.50 for the same amount. As a result, Page has raised his menu prices by about 15 to 20 per cent and absorbed the rest of the cost. "Hopefully everything's going to turn around and come back to normal, whatever that is," said Page, owner of The Frying Saucer, which is known for its poutine.
