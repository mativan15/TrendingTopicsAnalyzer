Justin Bieber used to date Selena Gomez for years until they parted ways. In 2018, Justin Bieber tied the knot with model Hailey Baldwin which many fans couldn't accept. Online hate from fans who wanted Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez to tie the knot has to stop with the release of a photo by Tyrell Hampton.

Justin Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber, posing with Selena Gomez, cheek to cheek, more of a 'one world-one love' scenario, with a caption stating 'plot twist.'

Selena Gomez looked stunning in a black tuxedo jacket and matching trousers, while Hailey looked stunning in a brown Saint Laurent.
