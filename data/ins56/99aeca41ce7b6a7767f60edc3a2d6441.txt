Plans are in the works to establish a coffee shop and taproom in an area of Davis with a high volume of student housing.

Business partners Robert Salazar, Quentin Stone and Jacqueline Siefker plan to open Volt Coffee, Tea, and Taps at 1123 Olive Drive in Davis.

Salazar, who is also a tax preparer and owner of The Tax Solutions Group, which operates out of the same building, said the coffee shop and taproom will take up approximately 2,000 square feet of the building. The planned business will also utilize a fenced courtyard area outside the building, where activities like cornhole will be set up and they expect to have food trailers situated.
