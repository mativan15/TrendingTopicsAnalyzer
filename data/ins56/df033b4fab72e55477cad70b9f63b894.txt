Blue Origin sent the first Mexican-born woman and the first crypto-crowdfunded crew member into space today, marking the fifth crewed suborbital flight for Jeff Bezos' space venture.

In addition to the firsts, there was a 'second': Evan Dick, an investor at Dick Holdings LLC who's also an airplane pilot and avid sailor, became the first Blue Origin customer to take a repeat trip to space.

The New Shepard spaceship lifted off from Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas at 8:26 a.
