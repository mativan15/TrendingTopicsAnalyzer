G4, an early 2000s-era television network focused mostly on video games, was revitalised for the modern age last year. Unfortunately, it hasn't succeeded, and Comcast terminated the project — to the surprise of G4's workers, some of which found out they were jobless via Twitter.

Some context: G4 was a TV network that lasted from 2002 until 2012, covering a wide variety of 'gamer-centric' content. Popular shows that existed on this network included X-Play, a review show about games, and Attack of the Show!, a talk show about pop culture and gaming.
