Newfoundland and Labrador's Opposition party is demanding a government-led investigation into privacy breaches at the Baie Verte Peninsula Health Centre.

Seven residents at the long-term care home have had their privacy breached in some way, according to Central Health, with two families telling CBC News staff took inappropriate photos of their loved ones.
