House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday responded to Rep. Elissa Slotkin's (D-Mich.) call for new leadership in the Democratic Party, noting that while there is a need for 'generational change,' in some situations there is 'no substitute for experience.'

'Yes we need generational change, of course we do. But in some cases, there's no substitute for experience,' Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC's 'Andrea Mitchell Reports.'

Slotkin on Sunday, during an appearance on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' made a call for 'new blood' in the Democratic Party, targeting leaders in the House, Senate and White House.
