Robert Mora/Getty Images Entertainment Everi Holdings (NYSE:EVRI) shares rose sharply on Monday as Stifel's review of the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas lauded the company's trajectory. A team of analysts led by Jeffrey A. Stantial and Steven M. Wieczynski indicated that the company's exposure to regional and tribal operators should leave it better positioned in a potential economic downturn. Further, the firm's channel checks suggest that the company should gain slot shipment share and aid in the overall increase in technology on casino floors, both of which are underappreciated in the firm's view.
