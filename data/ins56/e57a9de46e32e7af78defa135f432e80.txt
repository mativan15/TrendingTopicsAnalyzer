The union which represents teachers and other staff at Malden Public Schools overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence against Superintendent Ligia Noriega-Murphy Wednesday night, The Boston Globe reported Thursday. The newspaper reported that the union attributed the vote of no confidence to Noriega-Murphy's failure to communicate before announcing 63 layoffs last month, as well as multiple incidents in which they claim the superintendent tried to make changes that would require union input as per their contract.
