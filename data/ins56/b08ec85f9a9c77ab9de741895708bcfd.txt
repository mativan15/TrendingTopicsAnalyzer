Billionaire activist Nelson Peltz will join the board of Unilever, the consumer goods giant said on Tuesday, heaping pressure on the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise as it reviews its strategy.Shares in the London-listed group jumped 7% as it said Peltz, whose hedge fund Trian has built up a 1.5% stake in Unilever, will join as a non-executive director from July and serve as a member of the board's compensation committee.It is Peltz's latest intervention in a major consumer goods company and he is likely to push Unilever for a bigger revamp of strategy after an unsuccessful 50-billion-pound ($63-billion) bid to buy GSK's consumer healthcare arm in January, Unilever's third attempt.
