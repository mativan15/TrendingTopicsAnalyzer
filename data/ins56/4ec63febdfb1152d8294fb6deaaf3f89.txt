As the title suggests, this paper will be a deep dive into my projections of our future with artificial intelligence. Now, being that this topic can prove to be quite expansive and lengthy I will be restraining this paper to address two main questions. The questions at hand are 'What will our lives look like in the future as these technologies advance yet further?', and in the spirit of the previous papers, I want to ask a more moral/philosophical question that is 'Who is served and who is oppressed or harmed by these technologies? '.
