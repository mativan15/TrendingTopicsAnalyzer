The Golden State Warriors are the most successful NBA team in recent history, having secured three championships (and hopefully counting) in eight years.
The Boston Celtics, however, vie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the title of most successful NBA of all time. Both of those storied franchise hold 17 NBA championships. And Bay Areas are hoping that the Celtics won't break that tie in 2022.
There's certainly a lot on the line when the Warriors and Celtics face off in the 2022 NBA Finals beginning on June 2 at Chase Center in San Francisco.
