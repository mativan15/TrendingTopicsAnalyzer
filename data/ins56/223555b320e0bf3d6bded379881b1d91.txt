The Department of Justice has charged Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at the NFT marketplace OpenSea, with criminal insider trading, the government said Wednesday. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a type of cryptocurrency asset that typically confers ownership of digital files like artwork on a particular blockchain, though this ownership is not usually endorsed by the legal system. OpenSea is a marketplace where users can buy and sell NFTs on the Ethereum ETHUSD, -6.40% blockchain.
