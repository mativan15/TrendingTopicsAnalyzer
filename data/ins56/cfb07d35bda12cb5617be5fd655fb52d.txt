In a strongly worded letter sent to the U.S. Senate, SAG-AFTRA encouraged Congress to pass the bill, as it is an essential step to making all workplaces safe for people of color, and it is consistent with the Guild's efforts to advance equity and inclusion in the media and entertainment industry.

The CROWN Act stands for Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.

'The CROWN Act is a huge step in ending discrimination based on hair in public education and work spaces,' said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher.
