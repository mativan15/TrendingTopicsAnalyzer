Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office initially claimed it didn't have a hand in helping Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when he sent migrant-packed planes from Texas to Massachusetts last month ― but a new report detailing text messages between top Florida officials appears to show otherwise.

The report from San Antonio news station KSAT-TV comes over a month after DeSantis sent roughly 50 immigrants, mostly from Venezuela, on planes from the Lone Star State to Martha's Vineyard on Sept. 14.

Democrats slammed the Republican governor's move, calling it a political stunt and labeling it shameful, reckless and wrong.
