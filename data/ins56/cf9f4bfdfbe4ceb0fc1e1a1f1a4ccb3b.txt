Oct. 20—HIGH POINT — Developers have finalized plans to transform a rural swath of land into the largest industrial building in High Point.

A ceremonial groundbreaking for the first phase of the 550-acre High Point North Industrial Park took place Wednesday at the future site of Ecolab's customer care center warehouse, which will have a total footprint of 1,050,560 square feet at Sandy Ridge and Gallimore Dairy roads.

It will be constructed on 113 acres that were acquired Tuesday by developer PNK Group for $16.
