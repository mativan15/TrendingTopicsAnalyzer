Victoria Gnatiuk Investment Thesis Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is down more than 90% from its peak. Shareholders that backed the gig platform as a high-growth marketplace are likely to be reeling and more likely than not, not wanting anything further to do with the company. Yet Fiverr isn't alone. Nearly all the market darlings from the Covid period are today down 40%, 50%, and often down more than 70%. The big question mark hanging over Fiverr is, will it be able to carve out a high enough profit margin to support its current valuation? And while I'm inclined to believe that's possible, I prefer to wait to have stronger evidence that this is indeed the case.
