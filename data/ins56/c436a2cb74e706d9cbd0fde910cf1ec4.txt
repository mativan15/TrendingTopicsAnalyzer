LONDON — She might not use this exact term, but Queen Elizabeth II is about to get a ginormous victory lap — a huzzah of applause, featuring a mileslong horse parade, 3,200 bonfires, and a serenade at Buckingham Palace by Sir Rod Stewart.For her subjects, what's not to like? Her majesty is giving Britain a four-day weekend to celebrate her 70 years on the throne, her Platinum Jubilee.Thousands and thousands of street parties, garden lunches, and park picnics are planned for Sunday. The amount of jubilee pudding and coronation chicken, fizzy Prosecco, and stout ale to be consumed? Almost incalculable.
