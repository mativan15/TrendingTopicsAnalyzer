ALBANY — The head of the state Democratic party filed a complaint this week alleging Lee Zeldin's gubernatorial campaign is coordinating with outside groups spending big money to unseat Gov. Hochul.

In a complaint sent to the state Board of Elections, Dem party chairman Jay Jacobs argues that the Republican candidate's campaign is breaking election law by working too closely with a pair of deep-pocketed super political action committees.

'Zeldin seemingly has access to information about the super PAC and its activities before they have made any public statements,' Jacobs wrote to state Board of Elections enforcement counsel Michael Johnson.
