The Patna high court on Friday struck down certain provisions of the Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Act, 2021, through which the state government had taken over the powers of appointment and transfer of employees of Grade C and D of the municipal bodies. The court held that the these provisions, added to the state's original Act of 2007, were contrary to the Constitution (74th) Amendment Act, 1992, which aims to achieve self-governance. The court also pointed out that though the state legislature has the power to legislate on matters concerning municipal bodies, its involvement in the functioning of local bodies has to be minimal.
