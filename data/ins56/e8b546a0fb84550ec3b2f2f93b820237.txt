Judge Judy Sheindlin gave a few words of wisdom from her 50 years of expertise to her granddaughter, Sarah Rose, ahead of the second season of their Amazon Studios show, "Judy Justice." During a sit-down chat on Wednesday's episode of "Good Morning America," the television icon said her job hasn't been difficult but that Rose has a lot to live up to when it comes to keeping up the family name."It's been sort of easy. I grew up with, you do the right thing, the right thing happens [and] take responsibility," she said.
