The UK is exploring opportunities for British companies to invest in the defence, renewable energy, and electric vehicle (EV) sectors here, British Deputy High Commissioner Oliver Ballhatchet said on Monday. Mr. Ballhatchet, who interacted with industry representatives, said there is a huge potential for companies in the UK and Coimbatore to cooperate in emerging sectors. Coimbatore is a major centre in the defence corridor and offers opportunities. It also has an exposure to on shore wind energy generation and hence, can look at manufacturing for off shore wind mills.
