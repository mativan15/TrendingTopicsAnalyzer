Silicon Valley's unemployment rate dropped to 2.1% in September, matching the level of two months earlier and well below the national rate, according to a new report.

The local jobless rate fell by 0.2 percentage points from August to September, according to the report released Friday by Joint Venture Silicon Valley's Institute for Regional Studies.

Putting that into people terms, the number of unemployed individuals dropped by nearly 3,100. That left the total number of unemployed workers in Silicon Valley at its lowest level since May.
