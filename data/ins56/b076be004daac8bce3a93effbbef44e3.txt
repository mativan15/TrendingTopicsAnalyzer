Twitter users might have something new to look forward to in the coming months – the Twitter Circle. Twitter Circle is a feature that Twitter offers wherein you can create a small group of people and then share your thoughts with the selected group. Describing the feature, the blog post of Twitter stated that users could select who would be in their Twitter Circle. After that, the people that you have added to the Circle would be allowed to reply to or interact with your tweets.

This newly introduced function of Twitter is quite similar to the Close Friends function on Instagram.
