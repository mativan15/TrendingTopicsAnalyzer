MEXICO CITY — The Mexican government said Tuesday it has agreed to review a labor complaint filed by the United States under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade pact. The complaint filed earlier this month said workers' rights to freely choose their union may have been violated at a Panasonic Automotive Systems factory in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. Mexico's Economy Department said in a statement it would meet with the parties in the dispute to determine if there were any violations of labor codes.
