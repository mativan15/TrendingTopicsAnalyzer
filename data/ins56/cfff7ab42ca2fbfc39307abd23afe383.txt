ROME (AP) — Italy's presumed next premier, Giorgia Meloni, issued a stark warning to Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday that he risked losing influence in any new government over his friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as she asserted a strong pro-NATO, pro-European position about Russia's war in Ukraine.'Italy will never be the weak link of the West with us in government,' Meloni said in a statement late Wednesday. Don't miss: Ukraine aid could dry up if Republicans win majority in House, says Kevin McCarthy: ‘It's not a free blank check' She was responding to private comments by Berlusconi to his Forza Italia lawmakers this week in which the three-time premier boasted of having re-established contact with Putin and exchanged gifts of vodka and wine over his recent 86th birthday, while justifying Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
