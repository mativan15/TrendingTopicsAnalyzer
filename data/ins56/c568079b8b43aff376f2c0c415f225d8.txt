Fritz Jorgensen/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), formerly known as Facebook, has been under substantial pressure. The stock recently hit a multi-year low of around $170, marking a 55% decline from the company's ATH achieved in September of 2021. Continuous negative news flow, regulatory issues, growth concerns, an earnings decline, and other factors have plagued Meta, leading to multiple compression and significant stock price declines. Now, the company's long-time COO, Sheryl Sandberg, is departing.
