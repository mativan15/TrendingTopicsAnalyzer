piranka/E+ via Getty Images iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSEARCA:ITOT) is an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to the "total" U.S. equity market, which means that the portfolio spreads far and wide, including both mega-cap companies as well as small-cap stocks. The fund had assets under management of $41.1 billion as of May 27, 2022, making it very popular, while the expense ratio is reported as being just 0.03%, making the fund also very cheap (presumably in part enabled by the wide popularity of ITOT).
