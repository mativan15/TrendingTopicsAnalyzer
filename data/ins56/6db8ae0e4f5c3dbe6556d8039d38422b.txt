When Trey Ganem was contacted by friends in law enforcement shortly after the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that killed 21 people including 19 children, he knew he had to help. 'They said ‘it's like Sutherland Springs but it's kids,'' Ganem told TODAY Parents, referring to the 2017 church shooting in the Texas town that killed 26 people. Ganem's business, SoulShine Industries, makes custom caskets and his skills were used for the Sutherland victims. 'When I got the phone call I knew this was not going to be good,' he said.
