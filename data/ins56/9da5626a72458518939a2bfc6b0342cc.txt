SAN FRANCISCO — Larry Ellison, the billionaire CEO of Oracle who's had extraordinary success buying a string of tech companies, confirmed Wednesday that he recently failed in a second attempt to buy a professional basketball franchise, fewer than six months after his surprising loss in a bidding war for the Golden State Warriors.
'I did offer $350 million' for the New Orleans Hornets, Ellison told reporters, adding that he was 'slightly outbid' by the National Basketball Association when the league bought the bankrupt team last month from owners George Shinn and Gary Chouest.
