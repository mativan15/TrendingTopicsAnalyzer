NASCAR suspended Bubba Wallace for this weekend's race at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Tuesday after finding that he deliberately spun reigning champion Kyle Larson at Las Vegas in a 'dangerous act' of retaliation before confronting him afterward. Wallace had a shoving match with Larson and contact with a NASCAR official after the crash and the stock car series classified the infraction as behavioral. Steve O'Donnell, the executive in charge of competition and racing operations, said the penalties were for what happened on the track, not the fracas a few moments later.
