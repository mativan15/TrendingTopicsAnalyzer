South Africa's former chief justice, Mogoeng Mogoeng, said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post last week that he believes that his country and Israel should resume full diplomatic relations soon.

'Not only our country but our continent as well, Africa, have a critical role to play in facilitating healthy relations between South Africa and Israel,' he said. 'I am confident that with the prayers that are going on – there is a team that holds prayers for the peace of Jerusalem every Saturday back home – at one point, and I believe not far from today, that will become a practical reality.
