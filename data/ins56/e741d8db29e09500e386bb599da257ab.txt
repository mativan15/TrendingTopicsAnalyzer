It's 4pm on the day after Dussehra, and Dr Paramjit Singh, a resident doctor at a district dispensary at Punjab's Sangrur district, has already seen three patients with complaints of breathing distress, cough, wheezing or some form of lung-related problem. It is that time of the year when farmers start setting their fields on fire to get rid of the stubble left on the fields to prepare for the next crop season, and its impact is seen in the state's local clinics and hospitals.Sangrur is among the 10 districts identified by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) for reporting the highest number of stubble fires.
