(Bloomberg) -- Texas Governor Greg Abbott expanded his lead over Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke, posting a double-digit advantage with less than three weeks to go before the vote.

Abbott, a Republican, had 54% support from likely voters compared with 43% for O'Rourke, a former US congressman from El Paso, according to a poll released Friday by the University of Texas/Texas Politics Project.
