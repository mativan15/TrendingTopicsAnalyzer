More Video Harry Brumpton, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) -- Mergers and acquisitions activity in Australia could pick up into next year as the country's pension funds start to deploy some of their almost $1.3 trillion cash pile. That's the view of Marissa Freund, head of M&A for Australia and New Zealand at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Sydney. While the current uncertainty over the pace of global interest rate hikes and geopolitical concerns has helped curb deal volumes in 2022, this huge source of funds may soon provide a boost to dealmaking, she said.
