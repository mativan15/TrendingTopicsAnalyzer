Lawmakers are making more progress than in the past on gun control — though an assault weapons ban is off the table, one of the senators involved in bipartisan talks said Sunday.In the wake of the massacres in Uvalde, Tex., and Buffalo, N.Y., more Republicans in Washington are participating in gun safety discussions, Sen. Chris Murphy said on CNN's 'State of the Union.''I've never been part of negotiations as serious as these,' the Connecticut Dem said.'There are more Republicans at the table talking about changing our gun laws and investing in mental health than at any time since Sandy Hook,' he added.
