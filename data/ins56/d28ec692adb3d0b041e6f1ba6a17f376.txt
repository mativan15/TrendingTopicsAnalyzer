Social activist Daya Bai on Monday decided to press on with her hunger strike in the State capital seeking solutions to health problems faced by the endosulfan victims of Kasaragod district. Ms. Daya Bai and the action council representing the victims decided to continue the stir on the grounds that the assurances given by the government were not enough. The agreements reached at Sunday's meeting with Ministers Veena George and R. Bindu were not adequately reflected in the formal minutes of the meeting, according to the protesters.
