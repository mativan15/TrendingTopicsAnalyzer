Mee Kuen Chong, 67, who was known as Deborah, was allegedly murdered by Jemma Mitchell after changing her mind about helping to bankroll her renovation project. Prosecutors say she was killed at her home in Wembley, north-west London, with her headless body dumped in woods near Salcombe in Devon last June.
