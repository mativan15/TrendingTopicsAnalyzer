It's been good to be a Nola in the 2022 postseason.
Brothers Aaron and Austin Nola have each played major roles in the success of their clubs so far this October, with the former not having given up an earned run in two postseason starts for the Phillies and the latter hitting .389 with three doubles for the Padres. Thanks in large part to the Nola brothers, the Phillies and Padres are each one victory away from advancing to the League Championship Series.
On Friday, the Nolas had the arguably the best single postseason day of any brothers who played in playoff games on the same day in AL/NL history.
