Jun. 2—A restaurant specializing in Jamaican and Caribbean cuisines is relocating to Moraine after closing its doors in Fairfield in February.

Jamaica Mon Caribbean Cuisine is expected to open toward the end of summer at 3060 Kettering Blvd., where Taco Bell was previously located, following renovations.

Owner Zackina Powell told Dayton.com she decided to relocate to Moraine after five years of leasing a building because she wanted to own a space that she could make her own.

"I'm looking forward to seeing the building and the atmosphere," Powell said.
