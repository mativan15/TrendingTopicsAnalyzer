Kim Kardashian and Kanye West took time out of their ongoing feud to support their daughter North at her basketball game. The former husband and wife arrived at the match separately, with Kim ferrying their three other children to cheer North on. Kim and Ye haven't been speaking since the rapper turned up in a White Lives Matter shirt at Paris Fashion Week earlier this month. He wore the shirt to North's last game, and spectators noticed that Kim refused to even look at her ex husband. The shirt, which featured a photo of Pope John Paul II on the front was also worn by the models and rightwing commentator Candace Owens.
