Automobile dealers are expecting a bumper sale of two- and four-wheelers during the auspicious occasion of Dhanteras this year. The rebound is expected after the two pandemic-hit years disrupted the functioning of the automobile segment. A rush is expected by the dealers for automobiles across categories. Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) President Manish Raj Singhania said dealers are sitting on a record number of bookings this festive season and most customers are insisting on deliveries on Dhanteras.
