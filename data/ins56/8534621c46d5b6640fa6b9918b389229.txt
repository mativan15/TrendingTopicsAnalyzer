WhatsApp is likely to stop working on iPhones that cannot support iOS 12 after October 24.
 Here is a reminder for the iPhone users whose devices cannot run on iOS 12. After October 24, WhatsApp may stop working on your devices. Therefore, you have only four days to either upgrade your iPhone or look for an alternative application to WhatsApp. According to the information provided by WABetaInfo earlier in the month of May 2022, the users of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C will not be able to use WhatsApp on their devices.
