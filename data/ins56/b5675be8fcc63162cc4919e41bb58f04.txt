After Zach LaVine missed the first two games of the Chicago Bulls regular season, coach Billy Donovan said the All-Star guard 'should' be available for Saturday's home opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers at the United Center.

LaVine missed the season opener against the Miami Heat on Wednesday and sat out Friday's game against the Washington Wizards as he continues to recover from offseason surgery on his left knee.

After LaVine felt 'discomfort and soreness' in the knee ahead of the opener, the Bulls placed him into a day-to-day evaluation period and could continue to hold him out of games to manage the injury.
