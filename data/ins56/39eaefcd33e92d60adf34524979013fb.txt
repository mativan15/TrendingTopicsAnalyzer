I went through my curly hair journey to discover my hair type and I somehow have curly Afro hair. I'm not sure if I like it and I'm really really tired of taking care of it that I almost regret it.

-Photo1: how it looks on wash day. -Photo2: finger coils, it takes me a solid hour and it only lasts 3 days before it gets oily, squished and messy. -Photo3/4/5/6: how it looks the day after wash day and throughout week. It gets really messy really fast and doesn't retain the curls. (It really sucks cause I literally no longer go outside because of it). -Photo7: it's from 3 years ago back when I decided to remove all my relaxed hair and grow my natural hair. -Photo8: for as long as I remember my hair looked like this, my mom relaxed my hair since I was a kid and I never knew my hair type.
