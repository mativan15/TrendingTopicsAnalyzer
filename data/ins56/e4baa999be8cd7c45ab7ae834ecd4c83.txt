More than two dozen high-profile tech experts have signed onto a letter asking congressional leaders to apply a skeptical eye to the booming crypto industry.The letter, published Wednesday and addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, among others, comes from 26 industry experts including Harvard's Bruce Schneier and Google Cloud principal engineer Kelsey Hightower.The tech leaders question claims by crypto evangelists that "crypto-assets are an innovative technology that is unreservedly good" and instead urge lawmakers to "take a critical, skeptical approach" toward crypto.
