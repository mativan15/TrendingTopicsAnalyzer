TORONTO - The Toronto Maple Leafs have placed veteran defenceman Jake Muzzin on injured reserve, the team announced Wednesday.

The 33-year-old left Monday's 4-2 home loss to Arizona with a neck injury after colliding with Coyotes winger Clayton Keller in the second period.

Muzzin, who missed the start of training camp with back discomfort and has a concussion history, will miss at least the next three games — Thursday at home against Dallas, Saturday in Winnipeg and Monday in Vegas.

The Leafs recalled defenceman Filip Kral from the American Hockey League in a corresponding move.
