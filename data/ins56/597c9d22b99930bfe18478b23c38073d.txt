A large chunk of New York's prime affordable housing stock is sitting empty and unavailable, according to a newly obtained state housing agency memo. 
Although the US Census Bureau's 2021 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey put the official number of unavailable and unoccupied rent-stabilized units in the boroughs at 42,860, The City acquired a document showing that number to be far higher: 61,000 units. 
The finding is important because it shows 'warehousing' — when landlords purposefully keep apartments vacant — is happening at much higher rates than realized, and during a housing crisis, which those units could significantly alleviate.
