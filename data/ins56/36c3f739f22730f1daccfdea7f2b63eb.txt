The former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is leading the Bharat Jodo Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party was spreading hatred in the country, which needs to be checked at all costs and that his yatra was meant to listen to people's problems.Speaking at a street-corner meeting at Manikurthi near Alur in Kurnool district on Tuesday night, the 41st day of the yatra, Mr. Gandhi promised to stand by the Amaravati farmers in their legal fight against the 'injustice' done to them by the State Government and not establishing the State capital despite acquiring their land.
