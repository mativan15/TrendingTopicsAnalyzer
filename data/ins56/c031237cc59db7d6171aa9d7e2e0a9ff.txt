It's around 7:30 in the evening in Seoul and headquarters of HYBE — the entertainment company that's home to BTS and many other of South Korea's biggest stars — is starting to empty out for the day. But the girls of Le Sserafim are plunging ahead. Earlier in the day, they taped TV performances of a B side from their new EP Antifragile; now they're back at HYBE for dance practice. We make small talk as we head to the special elevators that will take us down to the artist-only floors — the ones with practice rooms, studios, and closets for HYBE's growing roster.
