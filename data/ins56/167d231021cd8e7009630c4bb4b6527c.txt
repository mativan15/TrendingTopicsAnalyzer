Published: 03:39 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 05:54 EDT, 21 October 2022 The Chancellor has vowed to do 'whatever necessary' to drag Government debt lower after official figures revealed that borrowing swelled to £20 billion in September. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that a jump in debt interest grew borrowing beyond the expectations of economists, laying bare the challenge facing the Chancellor and new Prime Minister ahead of the fiscal event at the end of this month. The latest reading for borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, marked the second-highest September on record, only surpassed during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ONS said.
