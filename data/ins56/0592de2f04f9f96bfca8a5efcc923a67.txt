The Baker administration took meaningful steps Friday towards sending nearly $3 billion in excess state revenue back to taxpayers, officially repealing the regulation that governed how taxpayers obtained a credit the only other time that Chapter 62F came into play, in 1987, and releasing a technical document spelling out exactly how the process will work this year.

About 3.6 million Bay Staters are expected to get back a piece of $2.941 billion that state government is required to return after it collected more in taxes last year than a 1986 voter law known as Chapter 62F allows.
