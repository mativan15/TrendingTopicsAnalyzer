It's only natural that many investors, especially those who are new to the game, prefer to buy shares in 'sexy' stocks with a good story, even if those businesses lose money. Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.

If, on the other hand, you like companies that have revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Community Trust Bancorp (NASDAQ:CTBI). Even if the shares are fully valued today, most capitalists would recognize its profits as the demonstration of steady value generation.
