The New York Jets and New York Giants are having early success in their rebuilding efforts.

The New York Giants and New York Jets are proving that rebuilds do not necessarily take 3-4 years to produce instant results.

The Jets moved their record to 4-2 on the 2022 season by defeating the Packers, 27-10, at Lambeau Field, while the Giants have been the talk of the league through the first six weeks of the season.

New head coach Brian Daboll has stepped in and quickly had success, as the Giants sit at 5-1 after defeating the Ravens, 24-20.
