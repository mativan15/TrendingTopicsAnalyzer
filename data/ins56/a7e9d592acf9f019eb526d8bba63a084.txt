Memorial Day weekend always kicks off the unofficial start of summer with public pools opening. However, there is a lifeguard shortage in the city. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Philly's Parks and Recreation department has hired 281 lifeguards, but they still need about 60 guards. It they don't get more guards, this could keep a few public pools closed.
