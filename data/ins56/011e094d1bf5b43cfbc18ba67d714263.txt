May 28—AKRON — Conneaut resident Rueben Schwartz, accused of money laundering, will be released on bond, according to the Northern District of Ohio clerk of courts.

Schwartz was arrested May 19 after federal agents filed an affidavit claiming he accepted more than $300,000 from the sale of illegal drugs for the purchase of commercial buildings.

He appeared at a video detention hearing Thursday afternoon, in which a judge ordered Schwartz be released on bond. As of Friday, the court had not recorded the amount of the bond.
