Oct. 19—TRAVERSE CITY — Even in district playoffs, Division 1-ranked No. 15 Traverse City West boys soccer continues to shut out opponents.

After shutting out Saginaw Arthur Hill 11-0 in the district semifinals on Oct. 18, the Titans extended their shutout streak to six games with a 5-0 blanking of Midland in the district semifinal at the Trojan Athletic Complex on Tuesday.

Throughout the first half, it was anybody's game, but TC West adapted to the inclement weather as the game progressed.

"I'm proud of the boys," West head coach Matt Griesinger said.
