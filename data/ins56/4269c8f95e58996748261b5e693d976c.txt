	The long-anticipated news startup Semafor launches on Tuesday with a team of prominent journalists producing a mix of scoops, analysis and newsletters, but its most unique feature may be in the way that it presents its stories.

	Stories are broken down to different components, starting with the actual news, followed by the reporter's view; a disagreeing view; an alternate, often international perspective; and a look at what is next; 

	The format, called Semaform, was a chief goal of co-founders Justin Smith, former CEO of Bloomberg Media, and Ben Smith, former New York Times columnist and editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, as Semafor enters a busy and crowded digital news space.
