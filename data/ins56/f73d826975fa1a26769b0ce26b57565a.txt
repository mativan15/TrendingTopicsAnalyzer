Farmers should stop supporting POET after opposition to Sioux Falls pork plant

Friends and neighbors, we need to stop selling grain to and buying dried distillers grains from POET until they remember who made them a success.

POET's decision to support the Sioux Falls initiative banning the construction of a modern, new pork processing plant hurts Sioux Falls, hurts South Dakota and, mostly, it hurts farmers and those who invested in POET. Shame on POET!

They can talk about smell all they want, but what really stinks is the misinformation being spread about how the new pork plant will smell like an old pork plant.
