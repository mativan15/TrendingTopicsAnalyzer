UK pharmaceuticals group GSK (GSK.L) is taking over biopharmaceutical firm Affinivax in a $3.3bn (£2.6bn) deal that will bolster its vaccine pipeline.

GSK, the world's largest vaccine maker by sales, is expected to pay $2.1bn upfront plus another potential $1.2bn in potential development milestones.

Affinivax is pioneering the development of a novel class of vaccines, GSK says, the most advanced of which are next-generation pneumococcal vaccines for infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and sinusitis.
