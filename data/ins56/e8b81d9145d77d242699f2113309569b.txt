But he warned: "The enemy can attack our cities, but it won't be able to break us. The occupiers will get only fair punishment and condemnation of future generations. And we will get victory."Five major blasts rocked the capital Kyiv from 6.30am, killing three civilians and burying the injured beneath rubble.
