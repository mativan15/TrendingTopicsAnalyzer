A former Goodwill employee claimed to reveal an insider secret about why there's nothing 'valuable' sold at the thrift store anymore.

The TikToker @scroochmagooch previously worked as a drive-thru ambassador at Goodwill. His job was to take donations from drivers and price them based on their value to be sold in the store. However, anything of real value brought to Goodwill, it turns out, is quickly shepherded away.

'We were told that if we came across anything that was valuable to take straight to the manager so it could be sold to our e-commerce store,' he said.
