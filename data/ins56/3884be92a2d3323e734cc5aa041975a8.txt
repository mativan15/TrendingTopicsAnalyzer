The Memorial Day crowd at Luna Mexican Kitchen got a treat Monday afternoon as Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul — the stars of 'Breaking Bad' — made an appearance at the Pruneyard restaurant to promote their Dos Hombres mezcal.
To the delight of fans of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, the pair got behind Luna's outdoor bar and mixed up three specialty cocktails using the artisan spirit they launched in 2019 — a smoked chocolate margarita, a Negroni with mezcal instead of gin and The Dos Hombres, a coconut-pineapple concoction that was bright blue (you knew something had to be blue, right?).
