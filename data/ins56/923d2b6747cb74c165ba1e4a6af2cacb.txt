The state's Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Cultural Affairs have launched a programme in conjunction with a Nadi Samvad Yatra to revive Maharashtra's rivers and spread awareness about them among the people.
A total of 103 rivers across Maharashtra, which are part of the river basins of Krishna, Godavari, Tapi and Narmada as well as 27 west-flowing rivers, will be a part of the ‘Chala Januya Nadila' (Know our Rivers) programme.
The programme aims to map the condition of these rivers from their source till the end, study cultural interactions of communities with the rivers around them, take time-bound measures to mitigate river pollution, map encroachments and educate the communities interacting with the rivers.
