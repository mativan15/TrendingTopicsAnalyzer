(Brian Higgins/CBC)Pharmacists on P.E.I. will now be paid to assess and prescribe for 32 common ailments under a $3-million program funded by the provincial government, meaning Islanders will no longer have to pay for those services themselves.Since about 2014, pharmacists have been assessing and prescribing for ailments — including cough, sore throat, seasonal allergies, heartburn, minor joint pain, thrush, and skin conditions like eczema and acne —  community pharmacists can also renew eligible prescriptions.
