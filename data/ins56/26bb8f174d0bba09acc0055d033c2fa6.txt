BERLIN — Lawmakers from two of Germany's governing parties on Thursday slammed plans for Chinese shipping company Cosco to take a major stake in the operator of the country's biggest container terminal, warning that they pose a national security risk.

Public broadcaster NDR reported that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has asked officials to find a compromise that would allow the investment to happen, after several ministries initially rejected it on the grounds that Cosco, already the port's biggest customer, could get too much leverage.
