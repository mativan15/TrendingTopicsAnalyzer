The Jets in the playoffs?

No, this isn't a joke. If the playoffs started today, Gang Green would be the No. 6 seed in the AFC. However, there are 11 games left in the season, so a lot can change between now and then.

Currently, the Jets, who are a surprising 4-2, have the second-longest postseason drought in the big four North American sports as they last made the playoffs in 2010. Only the NBA's Sacramento Kings (2006) have gone longer without making the playoffs.

The Jets have a 37% chance to make the playoffs, according to FiveThirtyEight.
