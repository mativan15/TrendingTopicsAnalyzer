As part of our Quantum Jump series exploring digital transformations in the life sciences, McKinsey hosted a virtual fireside chat with Lidia Fonseca in January 2022. As Pfizer's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Lidia is responsible for all data and technology solutions across the organization. She brings more than 20 years' experience in healthcare to her constant quest to improve outcomes for patients through the application of data and digital technology.

In her conversation with McKinsey partner Siddhartha Chadha, Lidia reflects on the value of digital, data, and artificial intelligence in the life sciences and healthcare, the contribution digital has made during the pandemic, and the importance of mindsets and culture in achieving lasting change.
