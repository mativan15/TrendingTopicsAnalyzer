jetcityimage AT&T (NYSE:T) is investing in 5G mid-band spectrum and fibre networks to provide better connectivity solutions to its customer base which should drive medium to long-term growth. The net additions in postpaid phones and fibre were strong in the second quarter and this strength is likely to continue in Q3 and beyond given customer demand for better connectivity. T is improving its Business Wireline business which is putting near-term pressure on the revenue and EBITDA, however, it is expected to stabilize in the back half of FY24.
