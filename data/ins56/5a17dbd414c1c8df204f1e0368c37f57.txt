The Reserve Bank of India in its annual report for 2021-22, has said that undertaking structural reforms to improve India's medium-term growth potential holds the key to securing a sustained, balanced and inclusive growth. The report notes that the Indian economy is witnessing a recovery despite the multiple headwinds in the previous year. 
"The future path of growth will be conditioned by addressing supply-side bottlenecks, calibrating monetary policy to bring inflation within the target while supporting growth and targeted fiscal policy support to aggregate demand, especially by boosting capital spending," it said.
