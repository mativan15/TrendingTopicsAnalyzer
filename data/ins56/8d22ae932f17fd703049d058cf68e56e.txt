Liverpool have received praise for their ability to keep transfer deals under wraps, with former Reds star Mark Lawrenson identifying the Diogo Jota deal as a standout example. The Champions League finalists have a big summer ahead of them after losing out to Real Madrid at the Stade de France on Saturday night. Sadio Mane could yet move on, while former club captain Steven Gerrard has pointed to the need for a new number eight to provide goals from midfield. Sporting director Michael Edwards is also on his way out, with Julian Ward stepping into the role after playing his part in the January acquisition of Luis Diaz.
