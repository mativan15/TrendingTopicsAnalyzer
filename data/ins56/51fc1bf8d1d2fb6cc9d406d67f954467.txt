Shares of enterprise software companies MongoDB (MDB 3.28%), Okta (OKTA 4.42%), and Fastly (FAST 3.45%) rose more than the market today, starting the day up in the high single digits before retreating to lower gains of 2.6%, 3.5%, and 4.1%, respectively, as of 1:25 p.m. ET.
There wasn't much in the way of new news today from any of these companies, but the overall enterprise software sector appears to be gaining favor after nearly a year of brutal declines. Some investors may also be anticipating a recession next year and therefore the end of interest rate increases in the months ahead.
