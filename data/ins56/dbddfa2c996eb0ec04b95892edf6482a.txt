House expected to pass bill that would raise minimum age to own semi-automatic rifle

A gun control package that would include a proposal to raise the minimum age to own a semi-automatic rifle is expected to pass through the House Thursday. The bill also includes efforts to limit third-party sales of guns and to stop the distribution of untraceable firearms. The Democratic-led effort is unlikely to pass the Senate where Republicans can block gun legislation and have indicated they will not support major gun reform.
