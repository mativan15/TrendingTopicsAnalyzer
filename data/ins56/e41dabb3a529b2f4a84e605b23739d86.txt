LA native, Luis Gonzalez developed an app where you can find out where the nearest street food vendors or food trucks are in your area. The app is called Antojo and it allows users to search up local food trucks and street food vendors near them. The app currently shows you the local food spots near you and when you click on one of the spots, it will give you the hours, location and phone number of the place. According to @thefoocommunitynews on Instagram, the app will soon be taking orders for pickup and it is only available to be downloaded on iOS.
