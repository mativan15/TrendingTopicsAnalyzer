Dear Amy: My ex-husband's 38-year-old niece, 'Clare,' is getting married next month and has chosen not to invite me to her wedding.
During our 30-year marriage we lived three to four hours from his family and visited at major holidays. I was present in Clare's life from the time of her birth and during all the years of our marriage. I have seen her at my daughter's wedding, graduations, funerals, and on Facebook over these years.
The bride has blindsided me and my ex-husband by excluding me.
My ex and I have stayed close, and he asked why I wasn't invited.
