The Green Bay Packers look like anything but Super Bowl contenders through six games this season, but quarterback Aaron Rodgers did not want to blame a thumb injury for Sunday's poor performance in a 27-10 loss to the New York Jets.

"It's a little sore," he told reporters while revealing it only impacted his accuracy on "maybe a couple, but not too many."

Rodgers went 26-of-41 for 246 yards, one touchdown and zero interceptions while the offense managed just a single touchdown against the Jets.
