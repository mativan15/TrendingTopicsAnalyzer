NEW YORK, Oct. 21, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Witter.com has been sold for $135,000 US Dollars in cash, making it one of the highest Internet domain sales this decade.

Keane Ecclestone, a spokesperson for the domain's purchaser shared the reason behind the move. "One of my colleagues is always mentioning that all I seem to do is 'witter on about cryptocurrency.'
