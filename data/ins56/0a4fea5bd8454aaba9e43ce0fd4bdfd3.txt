Taser maker Axon Enterprise says it is halting work on a project to equip drones with stun guns to combat mass shootings, a prospect one member of its AI ethics board said was prompting a mass exodus from the panel.The company surprised its own ethics board by announcing the proposal to have taser-armed drones in schoolsThe chief executive said he was disappointed board members resigned before discussing their objectionsThe ethics board said it had already voted against a proposal for a taser-armed police droneThe May 24 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that killed 21 prompted an announcement by Axon last week that it was working on a drone that could be operated remotely by first responders to fire a taser at a target up to 12 metres away.
