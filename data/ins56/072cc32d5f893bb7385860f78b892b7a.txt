(The White House )PITTSBURGH, PA — President Joe Biden was on the scene nine months ago the day the Fern Hollow Bridge collapsed and became a national symbol of America's crumbling infrastructure. He returned to Pittsburgh Thursday to see a nearly completed replacement bridge and tout the benefits of his bipartisan infrastructure law."When I was here in January, I told the governor we would help rebuild this bridge as fast as we could," Biden said, standing in Frick Park, where tons of collapsed concrete fell when the bridge fell.
