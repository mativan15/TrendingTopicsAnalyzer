Ovechkin busts out of scoring slump with 4-point explosion originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington

In 18 NHL seasons, Alex Ovechkin had only been held scoreless in the three first games of a campaign once before, in 2013. He was held dormant in Washington's first three games of the 2022-23 year, and showed how eager he was to bust out of that spell on Monday.

Ovechkin lit up the scoresheet in the Capitals' rollercoaster, come-from-behind 6-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at home, putting up his first two goals of the season to go along with two assists, bringing his total to five points in four contests.
