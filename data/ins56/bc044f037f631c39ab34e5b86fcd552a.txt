Gerrit Cole isn't oblivious to the importance of Saturday's game against the Astros. He's just not allowing the enormity of the situation to impact the way he's preparing for Game 3 against his former club.
The Yankees head home to the Bronx facing an 0-2 deficit after dropping a pair of close games in Houston. In the current 2-3-2 format, teams that have won the first two games of a best-of-seven series at home have gone on to win 43 of 53 series (81%), presenting a daunting task for Cole and the Yankees.
