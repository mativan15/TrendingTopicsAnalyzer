Gabriel Martinelli has been told that he is not yet 'good enough' to play for Real Madrid but Arsenal must tie him down to a new contract.

The Gunners pulled off a coup in 2019 as it only cost them around £6m to sign Martinelli from Brazilian side Ituano.

The 21-year-old has already proven to be an astute signing as he is one of the best young players in the Premier League.

Martinelli shone last term as Arsenal mounted a surprise push for the Champions League places.
