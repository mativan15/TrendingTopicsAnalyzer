The NCAA Baseball Tournament is set.

All 64 schools were announced Monday after the 16 hosting sites were announced on Sunday. Tennessee, unsurprisingly, was the No. 1 overall seed and they'll be matched up with, Super Regional-wise, opposite No. 16 Georgia Southern, which hosts for the first time ever.

Arkansas was tabbed as 2-seed in the Stillwater Regional. The Razorbacks will play Grand Canyon in their first game. GCU was a moderate surprise as an at-large selection, beating out North Carolina State, a team that made the College World Series last year after knocking out the Diamond Hogs in the Fayetteville Super Regional.
