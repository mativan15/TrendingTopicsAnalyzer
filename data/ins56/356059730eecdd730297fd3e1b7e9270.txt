 Nokia Corp. (NOK) is one of the oldest public companies in the world. It started as a paper mill operation in Finland in 1865, later transitioning to telecommunications over the course of the 20th century. A Nokia phone may have been your first mobile back in the 1990s or early 2000s.
With a focus on sustainability and climate change, today Nokia makes products ranging from mobile phones and laptops to televisions, audio devices and tech accessories.
