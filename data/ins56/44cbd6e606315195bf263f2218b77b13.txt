The rental market in the Hamptons is facing an unexpected chill this summer.After two years of strong demand and soaring prices, the supply of rentals in the Hamptons is surging, leading to a wave of last-minute price cuts. Median rental prices in the first quarter fell 26%, according to Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel. Brokers say some owners are slashing prices by 30% or more just to fill their properties."There is a tremendous amount of inventory and people are not renting it," said Enzo Morabito of Douglas Elliman.
