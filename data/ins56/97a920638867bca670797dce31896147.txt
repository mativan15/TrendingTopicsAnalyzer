Britain's new finance minister will announce fresh tax and spending measures on Monday morning — two weeks earlier than scheduled — in a bid to quell turbulent markets, the government says.

It comes amid reports of a growing revolt among ruling Conservative MPs against Liz Truss' premiership, following the fiasco surrounding her budget plans.

The prime minister's position is increasingly in doubt as the central planks of her economic programme are ditched and her authority over her government and backbenchers is shot to pieces.
