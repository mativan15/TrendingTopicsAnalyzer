AgenciesRepresentative ImageIndia's GDP grew by 4.1% in the fourth quarter of FY22. Meanwhile, the overall growth recorded for the financial year 2021-22 stood at 8.7% as against the contraction of 6.6% in FY21. The numbers have come down from the official second advance estimate of 8.9% released on February 28 owing to third-wave of Covid-19 and surging global prices. The fluctuation in GDP numbers could be attributed to the impact of localised restrictions during the Omicron wave and high inflationary pressures hitting private consumption.
