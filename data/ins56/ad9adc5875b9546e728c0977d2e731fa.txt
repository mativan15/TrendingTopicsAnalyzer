ISLAMABAD — 
Pakistan's deposed former Prime Minister Imran Khan has swept a key by-election, reinforcing his opposition party's call for the embattled coalition government to announce early general elections in the country. Khan was a candidate for seven of the eight seats up for grabs in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, in Sunday's vote, calling it a 'referendum" on his popularity.

The 70-year-old politician grabbed six of the seats while the other two were taken by the Pakistan Peoples Party, a major coalition partner in current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government.
