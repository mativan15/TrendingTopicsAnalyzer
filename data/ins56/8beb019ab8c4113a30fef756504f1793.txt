Hong Kong's leader John Lee has delivered an inaugural policy address that emphasised the maintenance of national security and social order after a period of 'chaos', and unveiled big plans to attract new enterprises and world-class talent to the city.
After extended COVID-19 lockdowns and political upheavals in Hong Kong, Lee's speech on Wednesday was focused on reviving the city's credentials as an international business hub and pitching the metropolis as an attractive location for graduates of the world's top universities to live and work.
