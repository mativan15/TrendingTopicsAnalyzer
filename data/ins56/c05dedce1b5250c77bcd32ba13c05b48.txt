Debt mutual fund investors emphasise on the safety of their investments. Perhaps that explains why certain debt mutual fund categories are largely ignored by regular investors. Most mutual fund managers and advisors mostly ask conservative debt investors to stick to safer short-term debt funds like overnight funds, liquid funds, short duration funds, among others. No wonder, most mutual fund investors are unaware about the existence of medium to long duration/term debt mutual funds. According to Sebi norms, medium to long term funds have a mandate to invest in debt and money market in such a way that the Macaulay's duration of the portfolio is four to seven years.
