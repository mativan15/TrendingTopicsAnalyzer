Growing up in a village in Tamil Nadu's Tirunelveli, filmmaker Mari Selvaraj knows the power of moving images and the impact it can have on people. As a kid, however, Mari grew up at a time when going to the movies was deemed wrong and he was punished for it — both by his parents and school teachers. Even the movies he ended up watching in his childhood were mainstream Tamil movies meant for adults. So, he ended up either completely missing the plot or misunderstanding the film altogether. For, the concept of children's movies was relatively unheard of.
