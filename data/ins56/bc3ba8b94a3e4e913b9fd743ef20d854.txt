Sharing your Netflix password with people who are not in your household?

Your days may be numbered.

Netflix said Tuesday it will roll out plans globally to 'monetize' account sharing early next year.

How it will work: Netflix will make it easier for you to share your Netflix account with family or friends who don't live with you by creating 'sub accounts' or 'extra members.' Each sub account would get a login, profile and personalized recommendations.

The company said this week that you will also be able to transfer your profiles to new accounts which would make it easier for people who share accounts to get their own.
