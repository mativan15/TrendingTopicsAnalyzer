Jeremy Hunt has scrapped nearly all tax cuts announced in last month's mini-Budget, including deferring a 1p cut to income tax "indefinitely" and axing a proposed cut to corporation tax in a major U-turn for Liz Truss' Government.  
He said: "No government can control markets but governments can give certainty about the sustainability of fiscal plans... We will reverse almost all the tax measures in growth plan."
Mr Hunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor on Friday, brought forward his fiscal statement by two weeks in a bid to stabilise financial markets.
