S﻿imon Stone, BBC SportA meeting between a side that had only scored three goals this season and one that had taken a single point from seven games was never destined to be a classic.The flaws in both sides were evident. However, Adama Traore remains a threat – albeit inconsistent one – and Diego Costa will get fitter with every appearance, so for Wolves, there is hope.Wolves also had to thank goalkeeper Jose Sa for coming out on top in a game of two VAR penalties.Whilst Neves scored after Harry Toffolo handled Adama Traore's shot, Sa turned away Brennan Johnson's effort after VAR had spotted Mathues Nunes tugging back Ryan Yates.
