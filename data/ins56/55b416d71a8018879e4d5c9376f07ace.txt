Michigan football drove the field early and often against Penn State, thanks in large part to the run game, which accumulated 412 yards on Saturday. The Wolverine defense stymied the Nittany Lion offense, save for one big play by QB Sean Clifford in the first half.
It was the first top 10 matchup of the year for the maize and blue, and the first ranked matchup, at that, and the Wolverines passed the first test with flying colors.
