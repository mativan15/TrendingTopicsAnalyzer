A federal appeals court ruled the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's funding as unconstitutional.

The agency currently receives funding through the Federal Reserve, rather than Congress.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency, called the ruling a "reckless decision."

A court shaped by Republicans just ruled against a key consumer agency Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren helped shape.

On Wednesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)'s funding structure is unconstitutional because the Federal Reserve funds the agency, rather than requiring funding approval through Congressional legislation.
