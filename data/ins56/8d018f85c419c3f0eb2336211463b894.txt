The New Brunswick government is launching a project with an Icelandic research consultancy in an effort to reduce substance use in youth.The project, done in collaboration with Planet Youth, will implement that group's Icelandic Prevention Model, which is credited with lowering substance use in Iceland over the last 20 years, according to a Government of New Brunswick news release. "We know substance use can be a leading contributor to poor health, poor health outcomes and continues to negatively impact our youth here in the province of New Brunswick," said Health Minister Bruce Fitch at a news conference in Saint John Tuesday.
