(RTTNews) - Asian stocks finished mostly lower on Thursday, tracking Wednesday's losses at Wall Street. PBoC's status quo on rates and concerns about economic growth in China also dampened sentiment. The offshore yuan had touched record low to the Dollar earlier in the session. The Japanese Yen too touched the 150 level to the Dollar amidst the continuing monetary policy divergence between a dovish Bank of Japan and a hawkish Fed. China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 9 points or 0.31 percent to finish at 3,035.
