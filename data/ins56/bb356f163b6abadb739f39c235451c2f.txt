Preston Phillips, the spine surgeon shot this week in Tulsa, was a former colleague of mine in Seattle. I did not know him well but interacted with him in conferences and some patient care. He was as well-intentioned a surgeon and nice person as I have worked with. It is easy to blame him for doing a surgery that failed, but it is not his fault. The patient had chronic pain, and almost none of us in medicine are trained to treat it effectively, and the data has been right in front of us for decades.
