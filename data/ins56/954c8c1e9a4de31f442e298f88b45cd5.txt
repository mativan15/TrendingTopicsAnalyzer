The Pittsburgh Steelers announced that safety Damontae Kazee returned to practice on Thursday. Kazee remains on IR but this opens up a 21-day window for the team to either activate him to the 53-man roster or else he is lost for the season.

Kazee is on IR for a wrist injury he suffered during the preseason and it's kept him out of the team's first six regular season games. Kazee also served a three-game suspension during that time for violating the league's policy on banned substances.
