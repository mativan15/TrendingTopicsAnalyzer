Mumbai: Online beauty and personal care products retailer Purplle has held talks with its existing investors to raise $75-100 million, giving it a pre-investment valuation of about $800 million, four people aware of the development said.The Mumbai-based company will raise the money largely from its existing investors Verlinvest, Kedaara Capital and Premji Invest, among others, they said.'This is part of the capital that was already committed to the company. There might be a couple of new investors, but it will largely be an internal round,' one of the persons cited earlier said.
