Gov. Ron DeSantis appears to be the biggest favorite in a Florida governor's race in more than a decade.

That's according to interviews with pollsters, elected officials and political observers on the ground, who say that with less than a month until Election Day, DeSantis has numerous paths to victory.

His opponent, former Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, has precious few.

'I can come up with probably 20 reasons why DeSantis wins,' said Brad Coker, CEO and managing director of the Mason-Dixon Polling and Strategy firm — which had DeSantis ahead by 11 points in a late September poll.
