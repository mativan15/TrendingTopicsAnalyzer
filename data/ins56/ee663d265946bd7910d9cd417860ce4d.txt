Casa Grande cemented its entry into the semiconductor industry with Chang Chun Group starting construction Thursday on its $300 million plant, which is expected to employ more than 200 workers when it opens next year.

The Taiwanese company is building a 540,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution facility on about 84 acres near the northwest corner of Clayton and Burris roads along the Union Pacific rail line. The facility will produce electronic-grade chemicals for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
