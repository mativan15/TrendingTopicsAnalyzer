The multinational hotel chain Marriott is suspending all operations in Russia due to Ukraine-related sanctions, the company said in a press-release published on its website on Friday.'We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK, and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market. We have therefore made the decision to suspend all Marriott International operations in Russia,' the press-release stated.The company says it expects the process to be complex, as Marriott has been working in Russia for 25 years, and operates 28 hotels in the country.
