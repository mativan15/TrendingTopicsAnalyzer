The Arrowhead Report crew predicts whether the Chiefs will rise to 5-1 on the season.

Less than a week after defeating the Las Vegas Raiders in an emotional Monday Night Football outing, the Kansas City Chiefs are back at home for a game with even higher stakes in Week 6.

Five weeks into the 2022 NFL season, it appears that the Chiefs and Buffalo Bills are the top dogs in an AFC that is otherwise still trying to figure itself out. Kansas City's offense remains an efficient machine and its defense is young and hungry, and Buffalo keeps humming along on both sides of the ball with one of the better head coaches in the league leading the way.
