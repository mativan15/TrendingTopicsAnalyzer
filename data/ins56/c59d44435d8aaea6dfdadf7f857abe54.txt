Published: 03:13 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 03:15 EDT, 29 May 2022 Singletons everywhere are taking to social media to swap stories about the turn-offs that give them 'the ick', but dating experts warn it could actually be a sign you're not ready for a relationship. 'The ick' is a term that's been coined to describe a 'sudden feeling of repulsion and total turn-off from somebody you've been dating', according to Michelle Begy, founder of London-based Ignite Dating. Unlike major red flags like violence or infidelity, 'the ick' typically refers to 'little habits or behaviour which suddenly become impossible to ignore'.
