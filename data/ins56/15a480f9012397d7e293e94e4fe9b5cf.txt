Oct. 19—A 33-year-old man already facing one count of assault with a weapon in Flathead County District Court learned on the eve of his Oct. 13 arraignment of another pending felony charge.

Appearing before Judge Heidi Ulbricht, Ronald Eugene Donais pleaded not guilty to the assault charge last week. He had hoped to see his bail — currently set at $110,000 — reduced during a hearing immediately following his arraignment.

But then a pending felony theft charge in a separate case complicated matters.
