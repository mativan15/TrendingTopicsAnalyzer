A day after it popped on news of a debt-exchange offer, Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY -5.48%) was pushed down again. An influential credit rating agency doesn't like the sound of that offer and expressed this with a downgrade of the retailer's debt. As a result, the stock's price tumbled by more than 5%.  
So what
Ever-influential rater S&P Global was the culprit, reducing its estimation for Bed Bath & Beyond's debt to CC, outlook negative. That's one notch down from S&P's previous CCC, which in turn was a reduction made as recently as late August.
