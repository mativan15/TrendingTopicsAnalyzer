The defense in the fraud trial of the Chrisleys rested Thursday.

Attorneys will give their closing arguments on Friday before the jury gets the case.

The Chrisleys are accused of a conspiracy involving defrauding banks and the IRS.

The defense in the trial of Todd and Julie Chrisley have rested their case after three days of testimony from employees, accountants, and a tax agent.

A majority of the defense case was an effort to show the federal jury that the reality TV couple had made an effort before and after they were investigated by the IRS to pay their taxes.
