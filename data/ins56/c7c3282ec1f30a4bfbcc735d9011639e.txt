In a fresh spate of terminations, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has dismissed five employees for allegedly being a 'threat to the security of the State'. The terminated employees include a policeman and a bank manager.
This comes two months after the termination of a professor and a scientist of Kashmir University, a Kashmir Administrative Service (KAS) officer and a manager of the J&K's Entrepreneurship Development Institute (JKEDI).
On Saturday, the J&K administration issued termination orders of Afaq Ahmad Wani, manager of Baramulla Central Co-operative Bank, Syed Iftikhar Andrabi, a village-level worker, Tanveer Saleem Dar, a constable of police's auxiliary wing, Irshad Ahmad Khan, an orderly in Jal Shakti department, and Ab Momin Peer, an assistant lineman in Power Development Department.
