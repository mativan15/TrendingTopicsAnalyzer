Pet parents are unwilling to buy cheap food and that's helped fuel sales for Petco, according to the retailer's chief executive.

'The majority of our business is staples,' Petco CEO Ron Coughlin said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). 'Just like you don't cut back on milk or eggs, pet parents don't cut back on food for their pets. In fact, what we're seeing is upgrading of foods, continued premiumization toward the most premium kibbles, fresh frozen foods.'

Inflation has played a significant role in this issue.
