Cracking the whip on those who scuttled a recent meeting of the Kerala University Senate, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Saturday withdrew 15 of his 17 nominees from the governing body. The extraordinary move comes a few days after the majority of the Senate members, including the 15 nominees, abstained from the meeting called to propose a member on the search-cum-selection committee for the next Vice Chancellor. The sudden development is bound to exacerbate his stand-off with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government that had recommended the nomination of those who have now been removed.
