Twitter was one of the first major tech companies to declare a work-from-home "forever" policy in 2020, but Elon Musk's stance on remote work could cause yet another shake up at the company.On Tuesday, the billionaire — who is in the process of buying Twitter — reportedly issued an ultimatum to his employees at Tesla and SpaceX via email: return to the office or resign. The leaked emails were verified by The Washington Post and The New York Times. The billionaire took a dig at companies that have been more lenient with remote work.
