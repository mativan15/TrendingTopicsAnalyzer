Each year the bears of Alaska's Katami national park ‘compete' in a unique competition - Fat Bear Week. Park rangers select 12 bears and provide two photos of the animals - one taken in mid-July and the other taken in early-September with the latter photo showing each bear after they have eaten lots of salmon to gain weight before hibernating over winter. Fans then vote in a knockout-style competition to determine their favourite ‘Fat Bear'. The final of Fat Bear Week was won this year by Bear 747 over Bear 901, with the champion receiving more than 68,000 votes.
