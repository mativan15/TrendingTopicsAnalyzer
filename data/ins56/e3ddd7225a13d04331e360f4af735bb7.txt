The IPL is India's version of America's Super Bowl. In both events companies line up a series of advertisements, especially shot for the occasion. The Super Bowl this year featured bears and foxes eating Doritos; a Pringles commercial in which everyone has a hand stuck in a tube of crisps, come birth, marriage or death; and a clever one for a crypto firm, starring comedian Larry David, which inverts the traditional endorsement, 'Don't be like Larry.' Watching the IPL on TV is like watching a maalgaadi of ads, with some intermittent bat-ball action.
