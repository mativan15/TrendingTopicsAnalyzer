THE fascination of the Virginia City boom is that it concentrates in one place and in a short period so many American universals, and, concentrating them, makes them at once clearer and more vivid. It was, to begin with, the sublimate of all Western mining rushes: on Sun Mountain the crescendo was roared out at full orchestra, a tutti passage of incredible riches, incredible hysteria, incredible shifts and agonies of fortune. Again, the city that within seven years rose, flourished, and declined on that sagebrush slope was the precipitate of all frontier towns: in those seven years most of the incredible West exists — spectacle, hardness, wildness, intense labor, intense enjoyment, tragedy, humor, cruelty, frustration, triumph, life at white heat, the violence and beauty of the frontier effort realizing itself.
