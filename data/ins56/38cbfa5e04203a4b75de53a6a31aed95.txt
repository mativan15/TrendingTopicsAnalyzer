The centre and Telangana government is at loggerheads over how the latter plans to finance it's loans. Word has it that the reason Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao had refused to meet the Prime Minister few days ago at Hyderabad was due to the fact that the central government was in no mood to sanction any postponement in dues from the state. The state government had sent an SOS to the centre regarding non payment of salaries to government staff in various sectors due to lack of funds. It is learnt from reliable sources that 14000 crores is immediately required to clear all state payments of salaries and to service debts for the month of June.
