Rogers Communications Inc. says the Competition Bureau's opposition to its proposed takeover of Shaw Communications Inc. is not supported by the evidence.
The Friday filing by the telecom giant comes in response to the competition commissioner's announcement in early May that the agency was seeking to block the $26-billion merger over concerns the deal would 'substantially prevent or lessen competition in wireless services.'Rogers says that the commissioner has failed to properly assess the quantifiable effects of the merger, and to properly weigh the efficiencies the transaction offers.
