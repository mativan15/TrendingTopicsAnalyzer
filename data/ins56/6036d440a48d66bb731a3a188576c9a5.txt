New Zealand's largest annual board game convention Wellycon has got under way, and with its kick off it's filled the capital's Indian Cultural Centre with hundreds of people deeply engrossed in tabletop and role-play games. This year is the convention's biggest year to date with about 1200 attendees, said Wellycon chairperson Ceedee Doyle, who has helped organised the event for the past decade. Wellycon had humble beginnings, starting out as a 'convention within a convention', as Doyle puts it, some 15 years ago with only a few participants.
