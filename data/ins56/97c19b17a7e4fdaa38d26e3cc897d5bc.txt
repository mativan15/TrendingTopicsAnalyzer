Marti157900 Jefferies analyst Kyle Joseph sees the stark drop for Conn's Inc. (NASDAQ:CONN) stock after the departure of its CEO as a solid opportunity for investors. Shares of the retailer reeled following the announcement of CEO Chandra Holt's exit from the company as well as the trimming of third quarter guidance. The company now expects revenues to fall 21 to 23% year over year in its Q3 report while operating margin slides in the mid-single-digit range. Full year guidance was pulled altogether.
