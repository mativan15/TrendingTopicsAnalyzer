It's all tied up.
The Phillies and Padres are even at 1-1 in the NLCS and are traveling east to Philadelphia's Citizens Bank Park for Games 3 and 4 of the series.
These games will be the Phillies' first at home in an NLCS since 2010's fateful loss to the San Francisco Giants in six games.
Bryce Harper, Kyle Schwarber, and Aaron Nola have are three wins from the World Series. And if you call yourself a Phillies fan, you better be in the stands cheering for the guys in red and white alongside the Phanatic.
