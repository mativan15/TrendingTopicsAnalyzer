A 'taboo' topic is launching the fifth season of the podcast 'Common Law' at the University of Virginia School of Law.
In a continuation of the last season, called 'Co-Counsel,' the podcast is returning with host Dean Risa Goluboff and four rotating co-hosts. On the first episode, available now, Goluboff and Professor Cathy Hwang interview their colleague Kim Krawiec, whose scholarship focuses on what some scholars call 'repugnant' transactions, such as commercial surrogacy, sperm and egg donation, organ donation and sex work.
