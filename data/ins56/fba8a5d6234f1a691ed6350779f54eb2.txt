Vaping and e-cigarettes have been banned from sale in Mexico, with expanded restrictions on smoking and vaping on the way. 

Vaping products have been banned by Mexico's government. 
Mexico has banned the sale of vaping devices as authorities say they are concerned about the health effects of vaping.
The move was announced by President Manuel Lopez Obrador on World No Tobacco Day and was accompanied by several other measures aimed at clamping down on smoking in public places.
