Tech investor and Arizona Republican Senate hopeful Blake Masters acknowledges that the United States has a gun violence problem. But he also has a theory about why there's a problem—it's 'Black people, frankly.'Masters boiled the issue down in an April 11 interview on the Jeff Oravits Show podcast, telling the host that 'we do have a gun violence problem in this country, and it's gang violence.''It's people in Chicago, St. Louis shooting each other. Very often, you know, Black people, frankly,' Masters clarified.
