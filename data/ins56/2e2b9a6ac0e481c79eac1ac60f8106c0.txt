We had a lull, for a few years there, in our educational Kulturkampf. Terrorism, war, and recession ate up our attention. Cultural battles decamped to the church and courthouse, as gay marriage became the debate of a decade.

But then, inexorably, the school board fights came back. Seemingly everywhere were battles over COVID rules, curricula about race and gender, and, ultimately, the shape of our national identity.
