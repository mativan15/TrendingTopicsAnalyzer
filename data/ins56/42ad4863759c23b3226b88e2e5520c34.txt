Microsoft said it would play nice with labor unions, marking a new approach that sets it on a different path from its industry peers.In a Thursday blog post, the company's president, Brad Smith, said Microsoft recognizes and respects its employees' "legal right to choose whether to form or join a union.""We are committed to creative and collaborative approaches with unions when employees wish to exercise their rights and Microsoft is presented with a specific unionization proposal," said Smith.Smith said the Redmond-based company was embarking on this new approach because attitudes toward the nature of work and companies' responsibilities towards workers have changed.
