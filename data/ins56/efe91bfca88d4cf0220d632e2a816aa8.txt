A fantasy football dispute has led to Major League Baseball handing Cincinnati Reds outfielder Tommy Pham a three-game suspension.

Pham confirmed today that he's been suspended for slapping San Francisco Giants outfielder Joc Pederson. Pham told reporters that Pederson 'said some disrespectful shit' and 'fucked with my money.'

The dispute centered on a fantasy football league that both Pederson and Pham were in last season.
