The first of three defendants in the July 10 shooting of a Lake Norman business leader on a boat is scheduled to stand trial Monday, court records show, in a case that also involves sex charges.

Tom McMahon, a longtime Charlotte-area commercial real estate broker and community leader, was hospitalized in serious and stable condition after the shooting at a Troutman marina, The Charlotte Observer previously reported. The sheriff's office hasn't updated McMahon's condition since the week after he was shot.
