Match Day 22 is on today in an effort to raise money to build a theatre at Monsignor McCoy High School.

'It is unbelievable the amount of awareness that has been developed over the last few weeks with this Match Day,' said Helen Snortland, co-chair of the Friends of McCoy Society. 'We have cheques and cash ready to bank. We've had emails from alumni and heard from those in the community.'

Students at Monsignor McCoy High School have been busy fundraising. Last week they ran Loonie Days, selling hats and popcorn, an entire week of festivities that continued into this week.
