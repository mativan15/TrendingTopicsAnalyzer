Shares in key Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC may have been up in the past few days after it reported better than expected Q3 results, but many financial analysts have downgraded their forecasts for the company amid warnings the tech downturn is likely to be deeper than feared.
The world's largest semiconductor contract manufacturer announced its revenue for calendar Q3 last week, revealing it had beaten its own estimates to hit NT$613.14 billion ($20.23 billion). Shares in the company were up 4 percent following the news.
