In the ramp up to the final week of Ottawa's municipal election race, some council candidates say they have had issues with campaign material being defaced, removed, or even stolen.  In a now viral video, taken in late September, Barrhaven-West candidate Taayo Simmonds accused fellow candidate David Hill of removing his campaign materials from a residential mailbox and replacing them with Hill's own.  Hill later apologized for his actions, calling them a "lapse in judgement." In the wake of that video, other candidates are speaking up about their own experiences.
