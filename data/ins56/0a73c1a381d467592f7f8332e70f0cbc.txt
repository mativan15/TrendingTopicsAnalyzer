Much has been made of the headwinds the ecommerce segment has come up against in recent times. Continued supply chain and inflationary pressures amidst slowing consumer discretionary spending and the impact of the economy's reopening have all impeded the sector's growth.

And as was evident in a disappointing Q1 report, Amazon (AMZN) has felt the pinch too.

J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth thinks the macro headwinds will still have a large part to play in Q2 – particularly in the first half – yet as comps ease in the latter half of the year, and Amazon makes further headway in 'key under-penetrated categories' such as grocery, CPG, apparel & accessories, & furniture/appliances/equipment, revenue growth should also pick up steam in 2H22.
