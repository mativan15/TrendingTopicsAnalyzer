The jazz club was closed for two and a half years during the pandemic.

Historic music venue Wally's Cafe Jazz Club is making a post-pandemic comeback.

After being closed for over two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the popular spot reopened on Sept. 12, and has returned to hosting three bands a night featuring blues, funk, jazz, and Latin jazz salsa.

Originally founded in 1947 by Barbadian immigrant Joseph L. Walcott, Wally's is a family business owned by Elynor L. Walcott and managed by her three sons, Frank, Paul, and Lloyd Poindexter.
