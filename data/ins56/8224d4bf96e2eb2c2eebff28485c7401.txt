AgenciesIn the last assembly polls in 2018, the saffron party contested 47 seats. BJP, which is a partner of ruling coalition in Meghalaya, will contest 60 seats in the next year's assembly polls, state president Ernest Mawrie has said. Assembly polls in the state are expected early next year. 'The BJP would do well in Meghalaya in the upcoming polls as the people are very happy for the schemes being implemented by the party-led Central government,' Mawrie told mediapersons. Relationship between the saffron party and National People's Party (NPP) turned sour after BJP 's state vice president Bernard Marak was arrested for allegedly running a brothel.
