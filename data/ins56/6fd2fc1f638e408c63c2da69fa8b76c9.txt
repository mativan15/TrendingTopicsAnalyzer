The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has issued a stop order preventing Web3-focused investment manager Holon from offering three crypto funds to retail investors.

ASIC said it made the interim orders to protect retail investors from potentially investing in funds that 'may not be suitable for their financial objectives, situation or needs.'

The order will impact the Holon Bitcoin Fund, the Holon Ethereum Fund, and the Holon Filecoin Fund, all three of which have U.S. crypto exchange Gemini acting as their custodian, providing storage and security services.
