A new study is investigating whether low doses of ketamine combined with a mindfulness programme could help people struggling with alcohol. The use of low dose ketamine, an anaesthetic, for the treatment of alcohol use disorder had been trialled in several recent studies overseas, said Dr Charlie Mentzel, a senior lecturer at the University of Otago's Department of Psychological Medicine. A Dunedin-based trial that began several weeks ago involves participants who 'drink so much that it is negatively impacting their lives'.
