For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it completely lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson.

So if you're like me, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG). While that doesn't make the shares worth buying at any price, you can't deny that successful capitalism requires profit, eventually.
