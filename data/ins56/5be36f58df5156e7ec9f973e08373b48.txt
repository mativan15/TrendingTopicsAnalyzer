An energy efficiency project at Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Robinson, Illinois, refinery was named one of the Top Projects of the year at the U.S. EPA's recent ENERGY STAR® Industrial Partner Meeting.

The steam turbine optimization project lowered the refinery's demand for purchased electricity by 630 kilowatt-hours by increasing the steam available as an energy supply.

This reduction will avoid almost 2,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions annually, the equivalent of eliminating the burning of 2.
