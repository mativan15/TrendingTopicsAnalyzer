Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Coupa Software Incorporated (NASDAQ:COUP) recently reported a strong end to their FY22 with revenue growth coming in nicely above expectations. Even with the continued headwinds of the company moving away from lower margin professional services revenue, subscription revenue growth has remained strong. However, guidance for FY23 was rather disappointing as revenue growth is expected to be 15-16% below the company's typical 20%+ levels. In addition, with continued focus on investments, non-GAAP operating margins are expected to decline towards the mid-single digits, below the 12% level seen in FY22.
