As two former MPs elected to the House of Commons in 1986 and 1992, we have seen a thing or two over our time in politics, and particularly Conservative politics. We lived through the tumultuous nineties and both survived the 1997 election rout. We both went on to become Chairman of the Conservative Party. It is with these experiences that we warn our Party, of which we both love dearly, that now is the time to unite or wither.
It is hardly an original maxim, but divided parties don't win elections – in fact, they lose them badly.
