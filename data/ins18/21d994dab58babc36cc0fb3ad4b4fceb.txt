Scientists, governments, and companies from around the world are increasingly investing in a potential source of energy that could provide unlimited, clean power to everyone on Earth: nuclear fusion.

Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It's the opposite of nuclear fission, the process used in today's nuclear power plants, which splits atoms apart.

In fusion, two atomic nuclei are combined to create a heavier nucleus, and the process releases energy.
