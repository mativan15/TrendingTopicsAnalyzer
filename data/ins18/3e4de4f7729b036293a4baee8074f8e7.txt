Mumbai: The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has granted bail to former deputy manager of the Punjab National Bank, Gokulnath Shetty, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with ₹13,850-crore fraud at the nationalized bank. However, he will not come out of jail, as he is also arrested in two separate cases registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). One of them involves fugitive diamantaire Neerav Modi and the other involves his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, also a diamond trader.
