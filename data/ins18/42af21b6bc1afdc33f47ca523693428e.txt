Following a successful bid to acquire the remaining assets of the bankrupt crypto broker Voyager, crypto exchange FTX.US is offering a recovery plan that would see Voyager customers recover about 72% of their funds recovered, according to a Bloomberg report.

The deal, however, can't be completed until U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael E. Wiles approves Voyager's bankruptcy payout plan, which reportedly may be considered in December.

Before approving the arrangement, Wiles insisted Voyager should include the so-called 'fiduciary out'—a standard bankruptcy clause that allows a company under court protection to consider higher bids before a sale is declared final.
