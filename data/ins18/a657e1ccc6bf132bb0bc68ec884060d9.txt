VICTORIA - A battle over police services in one of British Columbia's largest cities is looming with the election in Surrey of a new mayor promising to bring back the RCMP, who are currently being replaced with a municipal force. Mayor-elect Brenda Locke, who defeated mayor Doug McCallum in the municipal election, pledged to keep the RCMP in Surrey during her victory speech Saturday night.But Locke's pro-Mountie comments drew swift responses Sunday from the provincial government, the Surrey municipal force and the police board who all suggested switching back to the RCMP is not a done deal.
