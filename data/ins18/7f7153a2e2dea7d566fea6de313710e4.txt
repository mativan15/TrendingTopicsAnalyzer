Spirit Airlines' shareholders should vote against a proposed merger with Frontier Airlines in favor of a competing offer from JetBlue Airways, a prominent shareholder advisory firm recommended Tuesday.The firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, said that while the rival offer from JetBlue may face more regulatory scrutiny, it would offer Spirit investors more money and more choice, depending on whether they expect the recovery in travel demand to falter. Many large investors take ISS' recommendations seriously when deciding how to vote on corporate proposals, director candidates, and other matters.
