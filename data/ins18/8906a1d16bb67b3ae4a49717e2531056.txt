The House Committee on Oversight and Reform is investigating whether Jared Kushner used his position as senior adviser in the Trump administration to secure a $2 billion investment from a Saudi Arabian wealth fund. Kushner formed a private equity firm six months after leaving the White House, where he had oversight over Middle Eastern diplomacy and developed an unusually close relationship with Saudi Arabia's de facto leader. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), leader of the committee, sent Kushner an eight-page letter requiring that he provide documents related to the Saudi fund's investment in his firm within two weeks.
