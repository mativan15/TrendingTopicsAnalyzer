Sir John Major has blasted Netflix hit series The Crown as a ‘damaging and malicious' work of fiction in a new statement.
The former prime minister, who was in office from 1990 to 1997, will be portrayed in the show's upcoming fifth series by actor Jonny Lee Miller.
However, the politician's spokesperson took aim at the show's rumoured version of events for series five on Saturday night, calling the its plot lines ‘a barrel-load of nonsense'.
The fifth chapter of the period drama is expected to have a time jump, as audiences are transported to the early 1990s in Buckingham Palace, with Imelda Staunton taking over from Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II.
