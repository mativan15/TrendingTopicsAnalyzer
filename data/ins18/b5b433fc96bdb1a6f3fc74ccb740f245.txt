M﻿ark Mitchener, BBC SportBournemouth and Southampton meet on Wednesday for the 27th time in league football – but the 11th since 2015, as the Cherries' two spells in the Premier League have increased the frequency of meetings between two sides who once went 50 years between league encounters (1960-2010). As the Saints supporters will be quick to tell you – Bournemouth are not their rivals and never will be (that status being reserved for Portsmouth in perpetuity). However, given current form, Southampton have far more to worry about than whether this game counts as a 'derby'.
