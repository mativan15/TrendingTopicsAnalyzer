Jun. 3—While passenger rail service hasn't returned to Berks and Montgomery counties quite yet, a bus service that will connect Reading and Pottstown to trains in Philadelphia will begin on Monday.

Amtrak has announced it will launch thruway bus service between Reading and Philadelphia, with a stop in Pottstown. The service will initially feature two daily round trips.

The bus service is designed to connect riders with Amtrak trains headed to the more than 1,000 destinations that are part of Amtrak's national network.
