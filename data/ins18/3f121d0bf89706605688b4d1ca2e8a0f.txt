SAGITTARIUS (Nov 23-Dec 21)The day may bring favourable results for working professionals. Your work, which got stuck in the past, will also be completed. Some of you may earn a good reputation and get recognition at your workplace. You may, however, remain a little indecisive today. This could result in frustration and may lead to wrong decision-making. However, a windfall or win in a lottery may keep you motivated. You will put in hard work to achieve your goals. You may also be inclined to stay aloof and look within to understand your life purpose.
