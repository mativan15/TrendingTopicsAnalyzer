VIRGO (Aug 24-Sept 23) Today looks comfortable in terms of money in your hands. Make all economic decisions based on thorough understanding of the matter at hand. Don't let emotions cloud your judgement. You may consider making long-term investments once you are comfortable with your routine expenses. You may have to overcome opposition from your family for your choice of career, but you will be able to convince them easily. However, do not switch jobs for now, wait for a better time. Married or old couples may go on a date night or spend time in some fun activity.
