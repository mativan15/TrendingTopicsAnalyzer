As such, the company has guided for lower 2022 growth in net interest income, targeting low forties growth from a year before vs. mid-forties growth in the prior outlook. "The challenging environment is pressuring balance sheet and NII growth, and we expect these conditions to persist for the foreseeable future until public markets stabilize," said CEO and President Greg Becker.
