It certainly might concern Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) shareholders to see the share price down 43% in just 30 days. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 281% in that time. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 56% decline over the last twelve months.
