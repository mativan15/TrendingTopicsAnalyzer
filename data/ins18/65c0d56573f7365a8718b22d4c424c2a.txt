As Russia's war continues, demonstrations in support of Ukraine were held in many cities across Europe and Canada on Saturday, including in Halifax.
Dozens of Ukrainians gathered at Peace and Friendship Park in the city to call for more support and to continue raising awareness of what's happening at home.
Tetiana Yaremchuk, from Mariupol, said she left her home six months ago.
Yaremchuk said the region she is from has been entirely destroyed, but her parents remain back home.
'It (wasn't) easy to start a new life from the very beginning,' Yaremchuk said.
