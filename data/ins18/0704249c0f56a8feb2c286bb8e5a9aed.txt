Jun. 1—Wagoner has a temporary new location to start summer when it moves Summerfest to Maple Park this weekend.

The festival, which runs Thursday through Saturday, will feature carnival rides, live music and concessions. It was held in downtown Wagoner in 2021.

"Our downtown is under construction right now," said Wagoner Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Kristen Mallett, "We're doing a streetscape project and a stormwater project. All that would affect the area that we normally would have the festival.
