It's easy to match the overall market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Life Time Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LTH) share price is down 44% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 25%. Life Time Group Holdings hasn't been listed for long, so although we're wary of recent listings that perform poorly, it may still prove itself with time. Furthermore, it's down 27% in about a quarter.
