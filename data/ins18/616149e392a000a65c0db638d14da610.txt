There's an image Hannah Starkey describes as her calling card, and it's displayed at the entrance to her exhibition. Made in May 1997, it shows a young woman in a cafe with her hand on a mirror; initially it seems as if she is looking at herself, but on closer inspection she's holding a moth against the glass. An older woman wearing rollers is caught in the reflection, looking on from the sidelines.Starkey, who was born in Belfast in 1971, made this image as part of her final show at the Royal College of Art, so it's interesting it's still so important to her.
