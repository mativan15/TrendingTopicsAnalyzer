STORY: Here are five business stories making headlines in sub-Saharan Africa this week.

South Africa's Gold Fields is set to become one of the world's four biggest gold miners, after agreeing to acquire Canada-based Yamana Gold in a $6.7 billion all-share deal.

However, shares in Gold Fields fell 20% on Tuesday (May 31), with investors voicing concerns about dilution on a call with the CEOs of the two companies.

Also in mergers, West Africa-focused Tullow Oil will acquire Capricorn Energy in an all-stock deal worth around $827m.
