US stocks were mixed Thursday as investors sifted through quarterly earnings reports, including from electric vehicle maker Tesla, and assessed mixed readings from the jobs and factory fronts. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down. Tesla shares were under pressure after the company posted record third-quarter revenue but cut its vehicle delivery target. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla should be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. But tech advancers after earnings included AT&T and IBM.
