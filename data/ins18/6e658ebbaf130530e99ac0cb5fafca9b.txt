Olympic silver medallist lifter Mirabai Chanu, one of the biggest names at the 36th National Games, made light of a wrist injury to live up to the billing as she took the gold medal in the women's 49kg weight class.Mirabai took pride in being the flagbearer for Manipur and in her maiden National Games crown. In order to achieve that, Mirabai, a 48kg silver-medallist in 2015, had to overcome the odds of competing with a dodgy wrist and attending the opening ceremony on the eve of her competition for the first time in her life.
