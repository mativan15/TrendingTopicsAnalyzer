The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, a metaphysical thriller by Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka, has been awarded the 2022 Booker Prize for Fiction for the novel's 'ambition of its scope, and the hilarious audacity of its narrative techniques'. The announcement was made by Neil MacGregor, Chair of 2022 judges, in a ceremony at the Roundhouse, London, on October 17.
According to Booker's website, the novel encapsulates the story of a war photographer who has woken up dead in what seems to be a celestial visa office.
