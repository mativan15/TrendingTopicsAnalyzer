Wachiwit Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has restored some Russian apps to its App Store, The Guardian reported, just three weeks after it removed them for sanction violations. The tech giant re-added Russian social network VKontatke, along with email provider Mail.ru, both created by Russian company VK. VKontatke has more than 75M monthly active users and is the country's largest social network. It is unclear why Apple (AAPL) reinstated the apps. Apple (AAPL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.
