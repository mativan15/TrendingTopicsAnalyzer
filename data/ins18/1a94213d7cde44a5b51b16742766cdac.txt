Britney Spears has joined her husband in showing support for the protests taking place in Iran.

As of last month, many people have been protesting in the country against the strict rules set out by the government. The protests began in direct response to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died while in custody of the 'morality police'.

Amini was held by the country's police for allegedly having a loose headscarf, or hijab. Although police have denied any mistreatment, and say she died of a heart attack, her family believe otherwise.
