	Former UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has been strong criticized by a British government report over her claims a Channel 4 documentary used actors.

	The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee's special report into Dorries' comments about fakery in reality show Tower Block of Commons considered why she had not reconsidered evidence provided at a previous political committee that she could not prove.

	The report today published scathing findings that suggest she had used the situation 'to traduce the reputation of Channel 4.
