New York, United States, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Optical character recognition (OCR) is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of printed, typed, or handwritten text into machine-encoded text, either from a scanned document, a picture of a document, a scene photo, or subtitle text superimposed on an image. It's a standard method of digitizing printed texts to be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed online, and used in machine processes like cognitive computing, machine translation, and (extracted) text-to-spreadsheet conversion.
