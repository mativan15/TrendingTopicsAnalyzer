Gary Windass is set to find himself in an incredible heated exchange in Coronation Street, as he encounters a number of deadly thugs. 
Pictures reveal Mikey North, who plays Gary, filming scenes – including the intense showdown – on-location for the ITV soap. 
Gary is seen handing over a bag of cash to the thugs, who are thought to be former associates of dead Rick Neelan. 
The former loanshark slides the bag across the floor towards the heavies, who subsequently remove the cash and head off.
As noted, an intense exchange takes place, but will Gary be left fighting for his life? Or will he manage to get the upper hand on whoever it is that has antagonised him?
It's been quite a year for Gary, after Rick's body was recovered.
