TAMPA — Hillsborough County's allocations of American Rescue Plan dollars began with potholes and is winding down with pickleball.

On Thursday, county commissioners authorized spending $34 million of the overall $285.9 million it received from the federal government via the relief effort signed by President Joe Biden in March 2021.

In a series of three unanimous votes, commissioners agreed to spend $24 million on affordable housing, nearly $7 million at the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and $3 million for 36 new outdoor pickleball courts at six county parks.
