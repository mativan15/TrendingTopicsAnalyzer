Shanahan: McCaffrey trade 'not a rental' for 49ers originally appeared on NBC Sports Bayarea

Christian McCaffrey is arriving in the Bay on Friday after the 49ers pulled off one of the most exciting trades in franchise history Thursday night, sending four draft picks to the Carolina Panthers for the All-Pro running back.

And, pending a physical, he's not going anywhere anytime soon.

"This is not a rental," Kyle Shanahan said on KNBR on Friday morning.
