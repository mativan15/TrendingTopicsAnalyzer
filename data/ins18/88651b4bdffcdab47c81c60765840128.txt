Ample rice reserves in India, the world's biggest exporter of the food staple, and expectations for bountiful monsoon rains should allay concerns about the possibility of any 'drastic' measures to curb exports, according to National Commodities Management Services Ltd. Global markets are fretting that rice may be next on the agenda after India restricted wheat and sugar exports. Unlike other commodities such as edible oils and wheat, which surged on supply disruptions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, rice has been broadly stable on bumper output and huge stockpiles.
