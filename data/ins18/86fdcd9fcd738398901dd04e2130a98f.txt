Company directors could be jailed for not taking appropriate measures to prevent fraud at their organisations under proposals expected to be set out this week.MPs are due to propose an amendment to the economic crime and transparency bill which would include corporate and director-level liability for ‘failure to prevent' criminal activity.Two all-party parliamentary groups — on fair business banking and anti-corruption and responsible tax — are supporting the amendment, which they say is necessary to put an end to the UK being a 'jurisdiction of choice for dirty money'.
