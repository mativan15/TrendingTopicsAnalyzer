NBA commissioner Adam Silver told reporters this week that China's response to former Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing his support for anti-government Hong Kong protesters in 2019 cost the league hundreds of millions of dollars.
Morey, who is now general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, tweeted in October 2019 an image that read, 'Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.' Morey would later delete the tweet and explain that he did not intend to offend Rockets fans or his friends in China.
