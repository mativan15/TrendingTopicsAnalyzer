Tuesday morning, nine o'clock. A large mug of coffee. A blank page on a computer screen. A cursor flashing in the top left-hand corner. Showtime.Maths is not my strong point so I needed all my fingers and toes to work out how many columns I have written since joining the paper in 2015. I reckon it is about 350. I used to do a weekly Notebook column as well. Maybe 300 of those.So half a million words, give or take. Am I really that opinionated? I can barely decide which pizza delivery firm to ring on a Saturday night.
