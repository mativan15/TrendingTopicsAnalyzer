Virginia and Georgia Tech faced off Thursday in a game that won't be remembered fondly, but was still…absolutely a football game.
The Cavaliers snapped a three-game losing streak with a win in Atlanta — a place they haven't tasted victory since 2008 — in a 16-9 affair that featured very little offense and a lot of mistakes. GT were 2.5 point favorites in the game.
Despite holding a 410-201 advantage in total yardage, the Yellow Jackets still had a chance to win the game as they drove the field, down seven, with 36 seconds remaining.
