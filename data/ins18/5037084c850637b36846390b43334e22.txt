It 'should be easy' for the Canadian federal government to identify China as a strategic rival in its Indo-Pacific strategy, the former Canadian ambassador to China told the Canada-China relations special committee on Tuesday.
Guy Saint-Jacques, who served as ambassador to China from October 2012 to October 2016, said Canada has 'learned a lot about China' in the past few years — from the detention of 'the two Michaels' to how Beijing is using trade as a weapon.
'In my perspective, it should be easy for Ottawa to conclude that China has become a strategic rival competitor and that we have to align very closely with our friends and allies,' said Saint-Jacques.
