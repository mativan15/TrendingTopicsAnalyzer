FIRST ON FOX: Google's ad platform temporarily suspended the account of a conservative children's book publisher in the days following the release of its most recent book, a fantastical retelling of the collusion narrative involving former President Trump and Russia. Google told Fox News Digital that the suspension had been overturned later Tuesday.

BRAVE Books, which has published children's books defending the Second Amendment and warning against critical race theory, received a notification from Google Ads Monday that its account had been suspended for violating Google's "Circumventing Systems policy.
