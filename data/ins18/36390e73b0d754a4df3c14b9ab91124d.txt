The sharp negative market reaction to Britain's plans of tax cuts and large new borrowing is likely to be a stark warning to the emerging new Italian government and other EU countries to keep fiscal policy responsible, senior euro zone officials said. European Union governments are now facing a quandary, torn between the need to shield households and companies from the surge in energy prices and the need to fight record inflation and keep public finances sustainable. Italy in particular has long been a concern to other EU countries because of its large public debt of around 150% of GDP and slow economic growth -- a combination that some fear could one day trigger a debt crisis that could threaten the euro zone.
