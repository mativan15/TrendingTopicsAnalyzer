The Cleveland Guardians had their season end on Tuesday night after falling to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the ALDS. With that, many players get to remedy some bumps and bruises they sustained throughout the marathon 2022 season. One of their best players, Jose Ramirez, was playing through more than a minor injury. Ramirez is scheduled to undergo right hand surgery "in the coming weeks," The Athletic reports. It's an injury that was an option to get surgery on at the midpoint of the season, but he decided to play through it because he would've missed a lot of time.
