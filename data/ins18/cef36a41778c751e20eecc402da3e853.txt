Aaron Boone is considering some lineup changes for Game 3 of the Yankees' ALCS series against the Houston Astros. But he's not showing his hand just yet.

With the Yankees down 2-0 to the Astros and the series moving back to the Bronx on Saturday, Boone spoke to the media Friday afternoon about the team's search for offense. Teams who hit a lot of home runs typically win in the postseason but Houston's pitching staff has limited the long ball and left the Yankees searching for answers.

Harrison Bader could be one of those answers, as the outfielder hit leadoff in Game 2 at Minute Maid Park on Thursday night.
