Great British Bake Off has been a heartwarming baking competition since its inception in 2010. Since then, the programme has moved from BBC One to Channel 4 and had a change-up in its presenters and hosts but still manages to fill the entertainment spot. Each week the bakers have a theme they need to fulfil, and last week was Mexican week. However, it has caused some controversy as a restaurant critic for New York Times, Tejal Rao, has claimed the show has hit "rock bottom".The American critic accused the British show of being "casually racist" during their Mexican-themed week.
