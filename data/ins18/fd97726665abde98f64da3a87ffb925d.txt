OPINION:

Chicago Public Schools now spends more than $29,000 per student, up from $17,800 in 2020. This is despite an 8.9% enrollment decline over the same time period. Far from alone, school districts around the country are sharply increasing spending regardless of falling enrollment. It is not only an economic debacle, but student learning is plummeting during the spending spree.

In the fall of 2020, more than 3 million students around the country did not show up to school — a half million of those were kindergartners whose parents opted to forgo online school for their non-reading 5-year-old children.
