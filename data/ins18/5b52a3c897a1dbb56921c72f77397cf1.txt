SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. — Sweden's Ingrid Lindblad shot the lowest round by an amateur in the 77-year history of the U.S. Women's Open, a 6-under 65 that gave her the early lead Thursday at Pine Needles. "She was fearless," said playing partner Annika Sorenstam, Sweden's most famous female golfer. Because she's an amateur, Lindblad wouldn't be able to collect the record $1.8 million first-place prize if she holds on to win the event. She would have had to declare as a professional before the tournament began.
