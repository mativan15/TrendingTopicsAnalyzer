A Muslim youth initiative that has already helped to expand a Toronto-area hospital is now in London. Saturday, the first-ever Mercy4Mankind Charity run, to be held in London, took place at London's Greenway Park. Runners and walkers were lacing up their shoes to compete in a 5K race or a 1K stroll with all benefits to Children's Hospital in London. Organizer Jalees Khokhar says the goal is to grow the event from its humble first-year beginnings. Pointing to the larger Toronto-area event, he says local Muslim youth wanted to start similar runs in London and Windsor to ensure funds went to local hospitals.
