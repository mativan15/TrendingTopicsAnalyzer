Legendary value investor Jeremy Grantham, who co-founded investment firm Grantham, Mayo & Otterloo, made his name calling and profiting from market bubbles, from the Japanese asset price bubble to the dot-com crash in 2000 and the housing crisis in 2008.In the run-up to the dot-com crash, he implemented an aggressive long-short strategy. It returned 80.3%, net of fees, from October 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002 when most investors experienced tremendous losses.Then in early 2021, Grantham once again called a bubble in the stock market as the Federal Reserve deployed easy monetary policy to stimulate the economy in light of the pandemic and risk assets surged as a result.
