President Joe Biden said the US economy is robust, and that 'inflation is worldwide.' He believes that the economy is worse worldwide than in the USA. Biden considers that other countries lack sound policy and economic growth, not the USA. He called UK PM Liz Truss's plans for tax cuts a mistake and criticized the decision, which is causing turmoil. 
US President Biden said he was not the only person thinking it was a mistake and was predictable. He concluded by saying that Great Britain has to make the decisions on its tax policies, not him.
