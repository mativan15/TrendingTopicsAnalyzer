[Photo by MK database] South Korean safe freight rates have been raised seven times since last year and are expected to continue to go up during the second half of the year as oil and commodity prices spike, exacerbating the logistics cost burden on cargo truckers. According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport on Sunday, the government has raised safe freight rates for cargo trucks four times last year and three times this year. The cargo union announced that it will go on strike on Tuesday, demanding the abolition of the sunset clause and the expansion of items included in the safe freight rates system.
