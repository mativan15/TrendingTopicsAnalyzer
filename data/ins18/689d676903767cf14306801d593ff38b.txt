It was another game where it seemed Denver Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson didn't seem in sync with his offense, but head coach Nathaniel Hackett revealed another potential reason after the 19-16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Wilson was dealing with a hamstring injury throughout the game, Hackett said via DenverFan.com. The veteran signal caller didn't have to come out of the game, though the Broncos were keen to try to run the ball against the Chargers' defense. They handed the ball off 23 times, with Latavius Murray surprisingly getting most of the touches, going for 66 yards on 15 carries.
