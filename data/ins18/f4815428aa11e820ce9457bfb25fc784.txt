At first, Nikola Jokic wouldn't concede that his right wrist was an issue.
'It's fine,' he said when asked about the sprain that limited him to just three of five preseason games. Pressed further, Jokic was asked why he was still wearing tape over it and whether it was bothersome at all during games.
'A little bit,' Jokic said. 'Maybe it's a new trend.'
Tired of the probing questions, Jokic unraveled his tape and tossed it on the ground. And what to make of the open 3-point shots that had been there against the Warriors on Friday night but he'd bypassed?
That, he said, had nothing to do with his balky wrist.
