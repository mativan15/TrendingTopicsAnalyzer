(Bloomberg) -- Three months ago, Elon Musk sounded a bit exasperated again with the analyst he once cut off for asking what he dismissed as 'boring, bonehead' questions.

'I mean, I think we've said this now for many years, and I know it has proven true: Tesla does not have a demand problem,' Musk told AllianceBernstein's Toni Sacconaghi on the company's last earnings call. 'We have a production problem.'

Whether he likes it or not, Musk is almost certainly going to have to address this topic again.
