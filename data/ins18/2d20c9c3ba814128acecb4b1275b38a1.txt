Crab Du Jour has closed its Manchester location. (Chris Dehnel/Patch )MANCHESTER, CT — After weeks of operating with sporadic hours, the Crab Du Jour restaurant has apparently closed for good at the Shoppes at Buckland Hills mall in Manchester. Monday of this week would have marked its 13th month in business to the day. On Thursday night, the restaurant was dark at the peak of the dinnertime period. The phone first went unanswered and then a prompt said the call could not be completed. A mall staffer answering the phone said the eatery was indeed closed, but could not cite a reason.
