Ottawa motorists will be feeling some pain at the pumps today, as gas prices set a new record. Prices jumped five cents a litre at Ottawa gas stations overnight to 211.9 cents at some stations. "It's insane," said Nathalie Ric while filling up the gas tank on Friday. "I hope something happens, something changes cause this is unsustainable." The previous record for gas was $2.099 a litre, set on May 18. Tow truck operator Rob Corneau spends his day working on the roads of Ottawa, paying up to $250 a day to fill up the truck.
