Public schools and colleges that receive federal funding – which is nearly all of them – now find themselves caught between new state laws banning abortion and stripping the rights of students who are transgender and nonbinary, and a federal law that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.

The Education Department is warning schools that some of the state laws local officials must uphold conflict with their legal obligations to Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination.
