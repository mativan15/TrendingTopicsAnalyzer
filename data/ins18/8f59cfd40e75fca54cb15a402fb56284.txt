The axolotl, with its permanent grin and youthful-looking body, has captured hearts thanks to TikTok and the popular video game Minecraft, which added the salamander to its universe in 2021. More and more people have been getting them as pets. "I would attribute about 90% of axolotls' popularity to Minecraft and TikTok, but mostly Minecraft," Jake Pak told NPR over email. He says nearly every kid who comes to Axolotl Planet, the breeding and sanctuary company he co-owns, is there to see one in real life after learning about them from the game.
