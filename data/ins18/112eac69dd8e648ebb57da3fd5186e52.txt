The Los Angeles Rams are looking for a "fresh new start" for running back Cam Akers, who will be sidelined until they find a new destination for him. Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Friday that Akers would likely not play Week 6 against the Carolina Panthers, and now ESPN reported they are considering their options. Akers was on the injury report as out due to personal reasons. Those options are either finding a trade destination for Akers or "we'll figure out a solution how to best move forward with him here," McVay said.
