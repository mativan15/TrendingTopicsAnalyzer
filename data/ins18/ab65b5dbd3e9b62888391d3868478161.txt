Keeping warm this winter will deliver yet another economic blow to American households struggling to keep up with inflation thanks to colder temperatures and higher energy costs.

More demand, limited supply, the war in Ukraine, lower temperatures and rising market prices all mean that energy bills are set to see sharp increases, a major contributor to the 40-year-high inflation consumers are experiencing.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is forecasting sharp increases in average household heating bills from October through March, depending on the type of fuel used, including a 28% ($931) increase for households using natural gas; 27% ($2,345) increase for heating oil, used mainly in the Northeast; 10% ($1,359) increase for electricity, and a 5% ($1,668) increase for propane costs.
