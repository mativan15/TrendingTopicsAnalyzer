Brian May, 75, has described his 'anger and disgust' at the way the current Conservative government has conducted itself in a rage-fuelled rant on Instagram. In view of his 3.1 million followers, the Queen musician called for a general election and suggested the reinstatement of Boris Johnson, 58, as Prime Minister would be 'the last straw'.Yesterday Liz Truss, 47, told the public she would be stepping down as PM and that her replacement would be appointed in the space of just one week. However, many people across the country are now calling for a general election, including the Queen guitarist.
