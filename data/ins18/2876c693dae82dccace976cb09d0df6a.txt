After the ‘PayCM' campaign, the Karnataka unit of the Congress has launched the ‘SayCM' campaign seeking responses from the chief minister to 50 questions posed by the Opposition.
The campaign used the same graphic as that of the PayCM campaign with the visage of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in a QR code format. The text in the graphic read, 'SayCM 90% undelivered' and 'Do we need to PAYCM for CM to SAY'.
The 90 per cent undelivered slogan was in reference to the Congress's allegations that the BJP government was unable to fulfill even 10 per cent of the promises made in its election manifesto.
