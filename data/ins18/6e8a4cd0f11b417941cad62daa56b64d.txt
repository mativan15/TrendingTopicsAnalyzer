Business owners in a roundtable discussion Thursday in Gary hosted by the Republican National Committee said finding workers and dealing with inflation are the top issues they face today as they navigate the current economy.

About 50 people gathered at Sole Café in Gary for the discussion featuring Sen. Todd Young, who is running for reelection, and candidate for the First Congressional District Jennifer-Ruth Green.

There were no other Republican candidates at the event; Lake County's Republican Party Chairman Dan Dernulc, who himself is running to unseat democratic State Rep.
