The trade came hours after Anderson was involved in a shouting match with wide receivers coach Joe Dailey on the sidelines during the Panthers' 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday (October 16) and was kicked out of the game by interim head coach Steve Wilks. "Carolina had shopped Robbie Anderson recently, and all parties appeared on the same page," Rapoport tweeted.
