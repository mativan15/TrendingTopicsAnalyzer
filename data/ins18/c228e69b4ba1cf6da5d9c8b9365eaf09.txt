An update has emerged on Oleksandr Zinchenko amid interest from Newcastle United heading into the summer transfer window.

What's the talk?

According to The Athletic, the Magpies and Everton have both been touted as possible destinations for the Manchester City full-back ahead of the 2022/23 campaign.

The report claims that his future at the Etihad Stadium is up in the air this summer, although there is no mention of how much money it would take to snap him up from the Premier League champions.
