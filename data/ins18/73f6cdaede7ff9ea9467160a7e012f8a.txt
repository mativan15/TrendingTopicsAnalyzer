Netflix's ad-supported tier is drawing applause from advertisers and cautious optimism from Wall Street. But for the writers and producers who make the shows and movies for the leading streamer and other platforms, feelings are mixed.With Netflix's Basic with Ads plan rolling out November 3, subscribers will pay a lower price ($7 a month; the current lowest-price plan is $10 per month) in exchange for seeing ads on the service. Ads will be capped at four to five minutes per hour and will appear at the beginning and during shows and movies, with exceptions for new Netflix original films and certain other content.
