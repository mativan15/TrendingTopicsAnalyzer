"Whether on the battlefield or in the preparation of a military career, those who died while serving their country should be remembered not for their death alone, but for their life and their accomplishments … not only that they died for a cause, but that they also lived and worked for that cause."

– Remarks by RI Adjutant General Leonard Holland at Donald Kingsley's funeral, June 12, 1970

Four Special Forces veterans, the youngest being 74, met one morning this past week to remember two of their own.
