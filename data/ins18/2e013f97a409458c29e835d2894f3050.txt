The central government on Friday decided to grant taxpayers a one-day extension to file their monthly goods and services tax returns (GSTR-3B) because of some technical glitches in the GST portal on Thursday. 'The GST Implementation Committee of GST Council has approved extension of the due date of filing GSTR-3B return for the month of September 2022, for the monthly filers, from 20th October, 2022 to 21st October 2022.
