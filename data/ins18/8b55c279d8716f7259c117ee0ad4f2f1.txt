Sell in May? They certainly did, but rather than go away as the old stock market adage suggests, traders returned to aggressively buy the dip, causing some of the wildest monthly swings in recent times.There was plenty of selling in the first half of the month across asset classes, driven by aggressive central banks, inflation and China's lockdown policies. But markets subsequently started dialling back expectations of U.S. interest rate rises.Now worries over rising prices are back at the forefront; on Tuesday, oil climbed above US$123 per barrel and eurozone data showed record 8.
