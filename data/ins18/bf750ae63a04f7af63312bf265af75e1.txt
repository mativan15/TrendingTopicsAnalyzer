A string of text messages between campaign consultant Eric Foglesong, in blue, and 'ghost' candidate Jestine Iannotti shows him predicting 'PAC checks' will be supporting her campaign, while saying he contributed the 'extra money,' $500 that was listed in campaign-finance records as a loan from Iannotti.

State charges against a 'ghost' candidate and her alleged collaborators further taint the 2020 election of state Sen. Jason Brodeur, who represents Seminole County and a small portion of Volusia County.
