Whether we're getting an early start on our holiday shopping or looking to treat ourself to a little R&R (in other words: online shopping), Nordstrom is a tried-and-true favorite destination.
More specifically, the brand has a unique flagship line, Nordstrom Made, that we need to full-on feature. The retailer's team of fashion designers in Seattle have created one-of-a-kind brands and pieces — available at Nordstrom, of course — that are inspired by real-life Nordstrom shoppers.
