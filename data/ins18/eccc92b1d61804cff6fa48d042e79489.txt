After the Clippers' television deal with Bally Sports expired this summer, some fans wondered on social media why Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, whose tech background fueled a wealth unmatched by any other owner of a professional team in North America, didn't simply start his own channel to broadcast the games.

Ballmer had thought about changing the televised sports-viewing experience since his time at Microsoft and tested new broadcast ideas since buying the Clippers in 2014. He and Second Spectrum, a Koreatown-based sports analytics company, unveiled Clippers CourtVision, which added new modes to the regular cable-subscription broadcast in 2018 such as one displaying the probability of a shot taken by a certain player at a certain spot and another using animations to liven up dunks and big plays.
