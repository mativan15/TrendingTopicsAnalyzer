When a retired Boston Pops clarinetist gave $100 million to Boston University's medical school last month, everyone focused on his unusual backstory. Edward Avedisian ended his career as an accomplished musician, but he was the son of Armenian immigrants who'd worked in the mills of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He and his four siblings had grown up poor but close, and his parents had taught them to serve others. One became a pharmacist, another a nurse, and while Avedisian himself made his living as a clarinetist, he made up for such self-indulgence by giving most of his fortune to Boston University, a school once run by a friend who'd grown up a few doors down in Pawtucket.
