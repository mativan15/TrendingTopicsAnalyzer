 Sri Lanka's Supreme Court blocked the country's parliament from approving a bill that would have allowed the state to arbitrarily detain suspects for up to two years for "de-radicalisation", MPs were told Thursday.The bill was put forward last month by the government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was brought to power earlier this year after mass protests over an economic crisis forced his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of office.
