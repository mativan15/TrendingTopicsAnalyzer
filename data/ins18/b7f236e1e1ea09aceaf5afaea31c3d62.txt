Ukraine has accused Russia of orchestrating a "mass deportation" of residents in the Kherson region, which is has illegally occupied for months and annexed after a sham referendum in late September.  Moscow has enacted martial law in eastern Ukraine and says it is "evacuating" residents while it fires missiles around the country. "Putin's martial law in the annexed regions of Ukraine is preparation for the mass deportation of the Ukrainian population to depressed areas of Russia in order to change the ethnic composition of the occupied territory," Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said on Wednesday.
