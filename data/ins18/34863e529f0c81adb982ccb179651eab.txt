Mercedes-Benz's optional Burmester audio systems are already some of the most high-end sound systems on wheels, but Monday's announcement of new partnerships with Apple Music and Universal Music Group will bring a whole new aspect of enjoyment to the in-car music experience and cement Mercedes' position as the "gold standard of sound."Soon, Mercedes-Benz cars will be the first vehicles to natively support Apple Music's spatial audio with Dolby Atmos. Meanwhile, Universal will begin basing its sound quality approval process on Mercedes-Benz vehicles, debuting a new "Approved in a Mercedes-Benz" seal.
