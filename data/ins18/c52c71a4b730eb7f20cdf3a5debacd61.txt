When it rains, it pours. After several weeks of relative quiet,  dividend-paying healthcare businesses are reporting quarterly results left and right. Unfortunately, not everyone is telling stories that the stock market wants to hear.
Shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT -0.16%) slipped more than 6% lower in response to the company's third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2022. The company reported earnings per share that beat analyst expectations by about 23%, but investors couldn't get over declining sales from more than one of Abbott's operating segments.
