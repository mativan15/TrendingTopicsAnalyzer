Jun. 4—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — Rebecca Slate finished her time at North Star High School while not only becoming her class' valedictorian and a full-time emergency medical technician, but also staying involved in a variety of extracurricular activities.

"I don't give less than 110%," she said.

Slate graduated with a GPA of 4.37, and her high school achievements included serving as the cheer captain and drum major and placing as an Outstanding Young Women finalist.

She earned her qualifications as an EMT during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she had a lot of time on her hands, and has since worked with the Boswell Fire Department.
