Ticket company StubHub announced Friday that ticket sales for Mariners' home games during the American League Division Series outpace those of any other active team in the postseason.

Saturday's Game 3 matchup between the Mariners and the Houston Astros is the highest-selling Division Series game.

According to StubHub, Game 3 is outselling the second-most in-demand Division Series game — Game 3 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres — by 35%.

StubHub says total sales for the Mariners-Astros series (including Astros home games) are second behind the Dodgers-Padres series.
