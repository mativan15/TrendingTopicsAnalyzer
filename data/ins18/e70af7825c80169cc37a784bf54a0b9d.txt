BlackBee Investments, a prominent seller of property investment to retail clients, is winding down operations by restructuring its extensive property assets and disposing of its European licence to offer investments to the public.It follows the settlement of a dispute with management at its Aperee nursing homes business that had obstructed the sale of most of Aperee's properties to a large European real estate fund.The decision by one of the country's largest alternative investment managers to exit the business was influenced by rising interest rates, according to sources.
