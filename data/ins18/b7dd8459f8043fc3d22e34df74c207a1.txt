Club holding Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reports an impressive quarter. Crimped by strong dollar. But nice gains in all lines. Cancer drug Darzalex and Crohn's disease drug Stelara saw robust demand. Really good consumer. J&J going to split into a consumer company and a pharma company. Trims the top end of its Q3 operational sales and adjusted earnings-per-share ranges. The Dow stock rise more than 2% in Tuesday's premarket.
Activist investor Starboard takes a major stake in Club holding Salesforce (CRM), sees significant opportunity.
