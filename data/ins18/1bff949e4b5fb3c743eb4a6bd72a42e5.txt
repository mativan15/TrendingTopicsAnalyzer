Is there a solution to the contentious state of U.S. politics? Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the first partner of the state of California, thinks so, but it requires more women leaders. 'The threefold answer: focusing on our common humanity; getting more women into leadership, especially mothers and women of color; and then obviously, we've got to call out those who are profiting off of dividing us,' Newsom said during Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in Laguna Niguel, Calif., last week. Gender equity has been a priority for Newsom, an award-winning filmmaker and wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom.
