The president of one of the Triad's most prominent group of companies says the groundbreaking for construction of a 1.05 million square foot distribution center, most to be occupied by Ecolab at the planned High Point North Industrial Center, is just the latest example of an industrial boom period for his companies.

"There's been more activity in the last year than there's been in the last 10 years," David Griffin Jr. told Triad Business Journal on Thursday.
