Cnooc Ltd. said net income probably more than doubled in the first nine months of the year, as China's biggest offshore oil and gas driller continues to reap the benefit of higher energy prices.

Preliminary net income rose as much as 108% from last year to 109.8 billion yuan ($15 billion), based on Chinese accounting standards, according to a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange on Sunday. The firm said earnings surged due to higher oil prices, and record oil and natural gas output. Cnooc didn't break out its third-quarter results.
