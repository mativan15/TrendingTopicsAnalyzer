The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has vowed to get borrowing back under control less than a month after his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled a £45bn unfunded tax plan that sparked turmoil on financial markets.
Mr Hunt said: 'Strong public finances are the foundation of a strong economy. To stabilise markets, I've been clear that protecting our public finances means difficult decisions lie ahead.
'We will do whatever is necessary to drive down debt in the medium term and to ensure that taxpayers' money is well spent, putting the public finances on a sustainable path as we grow the economy.
