Businesses could receive the first payments from the Government's €1.25 billion energy support scheme next month, according to the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe.The Minister announced a €1.25 billion scheme to aid enterprises hit by soaring energy bills in September as part of Budget 2023.Mr Donohoe said on Wednesday that the Government hoped organisations could begin applying for the support in mid-November with 'payments flowing to recipients after that'.The scheme has been extended to preschools and some professional services, while Government also intends to introduce a mechanism that will allow enterprises established this year apply for the aid.
