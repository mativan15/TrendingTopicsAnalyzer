Hello again, neighbors. It's Monday in Sandy Springs and I'm back in your inbox with everything you need to know about what's happening in the community. But first, today's weather: Sunny and not as warm. High: 73 Low: 37. 📢 I'm looking for business owners and marketers in Sandy Springs who want to build awareness, connect with customers and increase sales. I have a limited number of sponsorships available to introduce our Sandy Springs Daily readers to local businesses they need to know about. If that's you, then I invite you to learn more and secure your spot now.
