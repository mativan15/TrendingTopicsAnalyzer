Investors in Club holding Disney (DIS) appear to have been encouraged by streaming competitor Netflix 's (NFLX) better-than-expected third-quarter results Wednesday — a sentiment that's not misguided, but requires some context. Disney shares were outperforming the broader market Wednesday, rising about 0.7%, to roughly $99 per share, while the S & P 500 lost 0.8% in midday trading. Disney's uptick came as Netflix surged more than 12% on the back of strong subscriber additions, breaking a consecutive two-quarter streak in which it lost paying customers, while beating estimates on revenue and profit.
