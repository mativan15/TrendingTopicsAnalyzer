The true crime genre has a tendency to portray killers and victims in a way that only leads to further pain, and Netflix's new series about the the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is no different. This approach is summarised by the show's exclusion of a powerful statement from the uncle of one of Dahmer's victims.On the last day of Dahmer's trial in 1992, the families of the men and boys who lost their lives at his hands gave victim impact statements to the court.Stanley Miller, the uncle of Ernest Miller, appeared with a photo of his nephew pinned to his suit pocket.
