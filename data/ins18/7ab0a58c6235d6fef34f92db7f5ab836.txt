miniseries/E+ via Getty Images Investment Thesis MarketWise (NASDAQ:MKTW), a multi-brand financial digital subscription services platform went public through a SPAC merger with Ascendant Digital Acquisition Corp last July. The stock initially popped from $10 to $15 but then quickly started plummeting and is now trading at $3.18, almost 80% below its all-time high. The company has multiple subscription-based products which makes it a financial SaaS (software as a service) company. Its business model is very capital-light and therefore enjoys strong margins and cash flow.
