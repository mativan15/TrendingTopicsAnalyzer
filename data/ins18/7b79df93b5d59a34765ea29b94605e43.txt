Hennepin County will spend more than $27 million to create and preserve 1,900 affordable housing units, the county's largest ever funding initiative for housing. The 22 projects include new housing lead by developers of color and housing in neighborhoods impacted by the civil unrest following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. The money will assist projects delayed by rising costs due to the pandemic, preserve existing affordable housing buildings and create a new home ownership assistance program.
