Queensland household and businesses electricity bills are set surge again unless the state government intervenes in the market to cut wholesale prices, the opposition says.

Household and business electricity bills will surge at least nine per cent across Queensland, with firms in the southeast set to cop a 19.8 per cent rise in 2022/23.

Retail bills will leap after wholesale electricity prices quadrupled to $171 per megawatt hour in the year to March, on the back of increased demand and generators setting higher prices amid soaring coal and gas costs.
