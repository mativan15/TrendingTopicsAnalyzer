Whitehouse has long been tracing the corporate money that he believes has too much influence over politics in general, and the courts specifically, and he writes that the goals of the book 'are to create a historical record of what's gone haywire, to issue a wake-up call about the sordid role of dark money in our courts and our democracy, and to make the case that the situation merits alarm and correction.'The book probably isn't going to be on the top of any Republican's Christmas list, and The Wall Street Journal is unlikely to offer a loving review, but Whitehouse doesn't spare some of his own allies, either.
