Teams in the NFL are expecting the Green Bay Packers to be active searching for a wide receiver before the league's trade deadline.
General managers who spoke with ESPN's Jeremy Fowler are 'certain' that Brian Gutekunst and the Packers are 'looking for potential receiver help on the trade market' as the Nov. 1 trade deadline approaches.

The one name mentioned by Fowler as a speculative target was Pittsburgh's Chase Claypool, although New England's Kendrick Bourne and Nelson Agholor, New York's Darius Slayton and Kadarius Toney and New Orleans' Marquez Callaway were all mentioned as potential trade options on the receiver market over the next two weeks.
