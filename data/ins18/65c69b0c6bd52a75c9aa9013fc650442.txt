The Boston Celtics face off against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 1 of the 2022-23 NBA regular season on Tuesday, Oct. 18, facing a team that is likely to be one of their toughest competitors at the top of the Eastern Conference standings this season.
Game 2 doesn't get much easier on the following Friday against the Miami Heat, and much of the early slate of games Boston plays in the months of October and November looks to be challenging as well. Who will they likely be competing with to get home court advantage in the 2023 NBA Playoffs? How will the season go without Robert Williams III, and Danilo Gallinari?
The hosts of the CLNS Media 'Celtics Beat' podcast are joined by Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix to talk over how interim head coach Joe Mazzulla has his work cut out for him even with some of the best players in the league to do it.
