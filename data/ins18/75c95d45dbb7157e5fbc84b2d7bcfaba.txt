The Strictly Come Dancing ‘mole', who has been prematurely leaking results from the show before they air on Sunday nights, has confirmed getting revenue from his venture.  
David Thorp has built up quite the fanbase with his ‘The Strictly Spoiler' account amassing more than 57,000 followers and counting.
Basically, the hunger for early Strictly results is thriving.
However, Strictly stars have slammed Thorp, including judge Anton Du Beke who appeared on Loose Women on Tuesday pleading with the ‘super leaker' to ‘please stop'.
