A judge cancelled Friday's sentencing hearing for prominent defense attorney and convicted money launderer Kenneth Ravenell after Ravenell's lawyers renewed their request for a new trial.

U.S. District Court Judge Liam O'Grady denied on May 13 Ravenell's first request for a new trial, writing that the 'interest of justice does not require the granting of a new trial.' A jury convicted Ravenell, 61, of one count of felony money laundering in December, but acquitted him of narcotics, conspiracy and racketeering charges.
