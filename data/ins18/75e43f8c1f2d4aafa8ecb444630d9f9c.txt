'Earth is now our only shareholder,' Yvon Chouinard, owner and founder of Patagonia, wrote in an open letter on the company website last month.

Chouinard, who established the outdoor apparel company 50 years ago, transferred ownership of Patagonia to a new non-for-profit entity called the Holdfast Collective in August. The non-profit will focus on fighting climate change. Holdfast Collective owns 100 per cent of the non-voting stock of Patagonia which carries economic value but not decision-making authority.
