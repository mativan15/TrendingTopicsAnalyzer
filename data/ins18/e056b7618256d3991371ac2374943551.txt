Auburn defensive end Derick Hall's work this season has been noticed.
Hall was one of 90 college football players to be put on the Rotary Lombardi watchlist on Monday. The Rotary Lombardi award is given every year to college football's best lineman — offensive or defensive. That means that any player who plays on the line of scrimmage generally has a shot to win the award, meaning that Hall is surrounded by defensive linemen, offensive linemen, edge rushers and even linebackers.

So far, Hall has amassed 27 solo tackles, four sacks, a forced fumble and an interception.
