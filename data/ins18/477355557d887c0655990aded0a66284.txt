SINGAPORE — Loh Kean Yew repeated his Badminton World Championship final win at the Denmark Open, ousting India's Kidambi Srikanth in their last-16 tie at the Jyske Bank Arena in Odense on Thursday (20 October).

The men's singles world No.5 - who had beaten Srikanth last December to earn his monumental world title triumph - was triumphant once more against his world No.
