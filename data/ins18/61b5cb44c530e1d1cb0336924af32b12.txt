The Saskatchewan Roughriders still have a chance at clinching a playoff spot. However, the battle won't be easy, as the Riders must win their final regular season games and hope the Hamilton Tiger-Cats lose. 'They know, they can do the math too. They know we got to take care of business this week and hope the chips fall in our favour,' Riders head coach Craig Dickenson said. The Riders returned to practice on Tuesday after their final bye-week of the season. It was also their first time returning to the field since losing to Hamilton.
