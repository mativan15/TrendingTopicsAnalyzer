Smashing a place for himself (and his throne) in the increasingly crowded comic book superhero movie space this week is Black Adam.

Starring box office juggernaut Dwayne Johnson, ' Black Adam,' opening Friday, is the titular antihero's origin story, and will also introduce a new team of superheroes to the DC Extended Universe.

Johnson's debut as Black Adam has been a long time coming. The wrestler-turned-actor was originally announced to play the character back in 2014, and was expected to debut with his rival Shazam — the superhero formerly known as Captain Marvel (no, not that Captain Marvel) — in the same film.
