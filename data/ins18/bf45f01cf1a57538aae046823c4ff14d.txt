MADRID (Reuters) - Santander said on Friday it would launch a tender offer for the 4% of shares in its Mexican unit it doesn't own, a step prior to its delisting.

The euro zone's second-biggest bank by market value intends to carry out the offer at the latest during the first quarter of next year, Santander said in a regulatory filing.

The shares would be worth about $290 million, as Santander Mexico's market value was 146 billion Mexican pesos ($7.28 billion) on Thursday, according to data from Refinitiv.
