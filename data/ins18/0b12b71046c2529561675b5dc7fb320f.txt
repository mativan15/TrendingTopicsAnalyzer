General Insurance Employees' All India Association (GIEAIA) has expressed its reservation about linking pay to performance and demanded the merger of all four public sector general insurance companies. Linking wage revision for the wages from 2022 with the performance of the individual and the company is contrary to the practice in any PSU, central or state government, the GIEAIA said in a statement. This action, if implemented, shall lead to encourage privatization in the name of key performance indicator (KPI), GIEAIA general secretary Trilok Singh said.
