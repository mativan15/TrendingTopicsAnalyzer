z1bI saw a billboard recently for a CD at an online bank that offered an attention-grabbing 4% yield. This was something that was simply unheard of 2 years ago, when interest rates were at historic lows. I don't plan on taking them up on the offer, though, as that means missing out on potentially great opportunities in beaten down stocks. Plus, I wouldn't want to lock my money up at a sub-inflation rate of return for a year, when I can buy a high-quality and higher yielding stock at a discount. This brings me to Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), which is now trading very cheaply relative to its recent levels.
