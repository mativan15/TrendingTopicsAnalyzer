A 24-year-old woman who was arrested on Saturday in a north-eastern suburb of the capital is in custody on charges of murder and rape of a minor, torture, acts of barbarity and concealment of a corpse, the Paris state prosecutor said. A 43-year-old man is also in custody, charged with helping to hide the girl's body, according to the prosecutor's statement.
