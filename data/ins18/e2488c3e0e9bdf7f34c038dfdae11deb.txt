Amber Heard can't pay the $10.4 million she owes Johnny Depp, her lawyer revealed Thursday — as sources told The Post the actress is 'broke' due to hefty legal fees associated with the bombshell defamation trial. 
'Oh, no, absolutely not,' Heard's attorney, Elaine Bredehoft, told NBC's 'Today' when asked if the actress had the means to cover the hefty judgement handed down by the jury on Wednesday.
The high-profile court battle with her ex-husband has left the 36-year-old actress hurting for cash, according to sources, including one who also placed the blame on Heard's past lavish spending, on travel, clothes, gifts and wine.
