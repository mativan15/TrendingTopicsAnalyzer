N'Golo Kanté has been ruled out of the World Cup after a hamstring operation that will sideline the France and Chelsea midfielder for four months.The 31-year-old suffered the injury in Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in August 14 and had surgery after suffering a setback in his rehabilitation.The decision to have surgery came after the Chelsea head coach Graham Potter, who has been unable to call upon Kanté since taking charge at Stamford Bridge, admitted last week there were long-term concerns over the midfielder's fitness record.
