I run a restaurant and getting good help is still a huge problem. Can I require my existing employees to work longer hours? We currently have 8 hour shifts but we would like to expand them to 10 hours until we find more help.
Getting a good restaurant reservation is still a huge problem, too… As a starter, I offer the very nice news that yes, you can require an expanded shift from 8 hours to 10. For the main point, I pair that fact with the lovely news that expanding the shift does not necessarily trigger overtime pay — which is one and a half times the worker's regular rate of pay — since overtime in New York is calculated on weekly hours worked in excess of 40.
