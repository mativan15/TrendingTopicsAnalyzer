Marriott hotels will pull out of Russia following the latest wave of Western sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, the company announced Friday. The hotel chain had already moved to close its corporate office in Moscow and pause expansion in the country. New sanctions have made operation impossible, however, the company says. Marriott has operated in Russia for 25 years."We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market," the statement read.
