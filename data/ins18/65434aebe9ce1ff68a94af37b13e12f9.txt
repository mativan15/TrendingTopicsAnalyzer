(JTA) — A local school board candidate in a suburb of Indianapolis is drawing criticism for insisting that 'not all Nazis were bad' and that teaching that they were would represent 'indoctrination.'

Matt Keefer, an anesthesiologist who is running for school board in Zionsville, Indiana, initially made the comment in response to a Facebook user who pressed him for specifics about his platform, which starts with the statement, 'Empower teachers to educate, not indoctrinate.' The user asked: Would teaching students that all Nazis are bad cross the line?

Keefer said it would.
