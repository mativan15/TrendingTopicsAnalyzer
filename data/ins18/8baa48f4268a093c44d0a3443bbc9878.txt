Times are hard. The world has rarely been gnarlier, and that's on top of our existing emotional wreckage. Sure, you'd love to see a therapist, a good one whose office has fancy tribal art and more than one chair so that you don't have to sit on the doctor's lap. But either you don't have insurance or you have the silly kind that therapists ignore.That's why we created HealScreen. For only pennies per cyber-session, you can connect directly with one of our many license-adjacent counsellors. No dismissive insurance companies wishing you the best of luck with your borderline personality disorder or payment sliding scales that never seem to slide down to the embarrassing depths you need them to.
