CNN —

Arman doesn't sleep much anymore.

'In my nightmare, I see someone is following me in the dark, ' he said. 'I'm alone and no one is helping me.'

He says his life was forever altered in early October, when he was arrested on the streets of Tehran for joining anti-government demonstrations, and then tortured by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – known as the Sepah – for four days.

The abuse was psychological and physical, he told CNN, including electric shocks, controlled drowning and mock executions.
