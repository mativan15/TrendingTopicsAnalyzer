OTTAWA—High-ranking officers from the Ontario Provincial Police will appear at the Emergencies Act inquiry on Friday, when they are expected to add to previous testimony that detailed a damning description of the Ottawa police response to the so-called 'Freedom Convoy.'

Supt. Craig Abrams, a senior OPP officer, will face cross examination by various parties with standing at the public inquiry — including lawyers for former Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly.

Abrams and other witnesses at the inquiry have raised questions about Sloly's leadership during the convoy's three-week occupation around Parliament Hill last winter.
