The US supreme court temporarily blocked a Texas law that would bar social media companies from removing user posts based on their 'viewpoint', as lower courts battle over whether it would violate first amendment rights.In a 5-4 decision, the justices granted a request from two technology industry groups that have argued the Republican-backed measure would turn platforms into 'havens of the vilest expression imaginable'.Tuesday's ruling reverses a decision made on 11 May by a court of appeals, which industry groups including companies such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube sued to block.
