The UK's new chancellor Jeremy Hunt has taken an axe to Kwasi Kwarteng's so-called mini-Budget just weeks after it was announced. In a statement on Monday morning, Mr Hunt said he would be getting rid of 'almost all' of the tax plans his predecessor had not already ditched following the backlash to the plans. It comes after a host of tax-slashing measures unveiled by Mr Kwarteng – who Mr Hunt replaced on Friday – spooked markets and saw the pound slump to an all-time low. Mr Hunt confirmed he would be ditching many of these measures, saying the 'most important objective' for the UK at the moment was 'stability'.
