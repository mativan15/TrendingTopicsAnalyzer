S&P 500 futures were lower Tuesday morning, as Wall Street resumes trading following the Memorial Day holiday. Stocks posted strong gains last week, ending seven-week losing streaks for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite and an eight-week slide for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The S&P 500 and Dow rose 6.5% and 6.2%, respectively, their best weekly advances since November 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the best-performing major U.S. stock index last week, gaining 6.8%. (CNBC) Stocks were aided in the latter part of last week by quality retail earnings and the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation measure suggested price pressures in April eased somewhat.
