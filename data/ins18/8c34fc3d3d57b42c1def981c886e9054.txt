Kanye West's ongoing public meltdown and antisemitic outbursts have become too extreme even for the famous rapper's most unapologetic, scandal-prone backers. This now includes the leader of the Republican Party, who used to brag that West was 'a friend of mine for a long time.'

In the days since West punctuated his recent tirades by posting to Twitter that he planned to go 'death con 3' on 'JEWISH PEOPLE,' former President Donald Trump has told multiple people that West is acting too 'crazy' and that he needs some professional 'help,' according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.
