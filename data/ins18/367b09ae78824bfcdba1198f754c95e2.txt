tupungato Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) rose after the bank reported 3Q-2022 earnings, with BAC likely benefiting from a strong market rally that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.86% yesterday. However, I do not believe the enthusiasm is warranted because macroeconomic risks such as inflation, slowing economic growth, and higher interest rates pose a threat to consumer banks. Overly hopeful and optimistic bank investors appear to be ignoring recession warnings. While the earnings release may provide some temporary relief to bank investors, I believe Bank of America will begin trading at a discount to book value within the next 3-6 months.
