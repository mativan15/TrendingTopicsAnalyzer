Having more cycle routes would be good for drivers, the head of the AA has said, as the Government considers cutting funds for walking and biking.
Encouraging motorists to take shorter journeys by car can cut household fuel costs, and reduce congestion on the roads for other drivers, Edmund King said.
'Even though we're a motoring organisation, that doesn't mean you need to use your motor all the time,' Mr King said.
'And journeys under a mile and a half are in many ways the most expensive way to use a car, because your car's not warmed up, you're only going a short distance, and you've got to pay to park.
