October 17, 2022 04:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A newly released video game can help inspire young adults to prepare for an earthquake or other natural disaster. It's just in time for International ShakeOut Day on October 20 when people across the globe will be practicing earthquake safety.



The game is the outgrowth of a research project undertaken by a team of researchers at Lewis & Clark College, who were concerned that the Northwest lacks an 'earthquake preparedness culture.
