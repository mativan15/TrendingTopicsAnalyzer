By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 01:30 EDT, 17 October 2022 Queensland's water minister says promised federal funding for the Paradise Dam won't be axed as part of a review of the former Morrison government's election pledges. The Albanese government could reprioritise some of the former government's promised funding for road, rail and dam infrastructure projects in the upcoming budget. Those include a $5.4 billion pledge for the Hells Gate Dam near Townsville and $500 million for the Urannah Dam near Mackay.
