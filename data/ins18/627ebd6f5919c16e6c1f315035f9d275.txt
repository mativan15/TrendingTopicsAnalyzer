SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands of Australians on Monday returned to homes and businesses to assess flood damage even as evacuation warnings remained in inland regions of the southeast and authorities warned of more rain ahead which could trigger renewed flooding.

Major flood warnings are in place across many regions despite little rainfall over the weekend with many swollen rivers only expected to reach peak flood levels this week.

"We are living in very dangerous times in the days and weeks ahead," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said during a media conference from Forbes, one of the worst-affected towns in New South Wales state.
