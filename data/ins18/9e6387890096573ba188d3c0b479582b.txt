By Michael Dabaie Lands' End Inc. shares were down 2.6%, to $10.85, premarket Thursday after the retailer lowered its fiscal year outlook, citing pressures such as supply-chain delays and inflation. The retailer of casual clothing, accessories, footwear and home products guided for fiscal 2022 revenue between $1.62 billion and $1.68 billion. That would be below its previous forecast for $1.68 billion to $1.75 billion. The company sees 2022 earnings per share between 60 cents and 88 cents and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $100 million to $112 million, it said.
