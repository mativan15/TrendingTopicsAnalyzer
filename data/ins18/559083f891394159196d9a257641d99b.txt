By Reuters Published: 20:34 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 20:34 EDT, 20 October 2022 The Denver Broncos are preparing quarterback Brett Rypien for the event that he must start Sunday's game against the visiting New York Jets in place of the injured Russell Wilson. Wilson was a limited participant for the second straight practice due to a hamstring injury suffered in last week's 19-16 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. He's also playing through a injury to his throwing shoulder, a partially torn lat muscle.
