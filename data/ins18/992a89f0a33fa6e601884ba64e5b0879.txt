Since the beginning of the year, Calgary police say they've had close to 50 reports of sextortion cases and now warning kids and teens to be careful about who they send images to.
Sextortion is a form of blackmail where online scammers — often using the disguise of a phony social media profile — establish a connection with potential victims and express romantic interest, according to CPS.The tactics can take place on many social media platforms. From speaking to victims and their families, Calgary investigators believe most cases stem from Instagram or Snapchat, where the scammer poses as a young woman and sends a private message.
