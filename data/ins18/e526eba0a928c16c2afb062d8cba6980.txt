New Delhi: Samvat 2079 is set to kick off on Monday and Dalal Street, as always, has high expectations from the new year of the Hindu calendar. However, analysts have recommended being wary of select sectors, which could dent investors' portfolios. Global factors including rising inflation, interest rate hikes, recessionary worries, the downturn in commodities and geopolitical crises are likely to impact the market in the coming year, according to analysts. Amid this backdrop, they suggested that sectors with exposure to global factors such as oil and gas, metals, IT and others should be handled with more care than before.
