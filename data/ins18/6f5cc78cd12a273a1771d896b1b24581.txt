In 2019, IBM purchased the Raleigh open-source software giant Red Hat for the handsome sum of $34 billion. The parent company, known as Big Blue, hasn't seemed to regret adding something red.

Red Hat revenue grew 18% in the third quarter of 2022, which ran from July to September, IBM reported Wednesday. This continues a streak of Red Hat revenue increasing at least 15% every fiscal quarter since the acquisition.

IBM reported 15% revenue growth overall, beating expectations. Yet even when IBM's overall growth has stalled or decreased in recent quarters, Red Hat has been a consistent producer.
