Antonio Conte has ruled Tottenham out of the Premier League title race.The Italian saw his side beaten in meek fashion at Old Trafford on Wednesday night, continuing their trend of struggling in big away games this season.Fred and Bruno Fernandes scored on a difficult night for Spurs, who mustered only two shots on target all evening.In truth, the 2-0 scoreline served only to flatter the visitors and their trend of not being able to compete with big-six rivals is a big concern.They currently sit third and level on points with champions Manchester City and four behind League leaders Arsenal but Conte does not believe they are yet ready to be serious contenders.
