While calls to 'fire' Dr. Mustafa Hirji and eliminate public health departments are echoed in campaigns of several candidates running in the Oct. 24 municipal election, a Brock University professor says there's a good reason the changes they hope to implement are beyond their reach.

Brock health sciences professor Dan Malleck said public health organizations are meant to be free of political influence, allowing medical professionals like Hirji, Niagara's acting medical officer of health, to make decisions and enact policies that will save lives and protect people from illness.
