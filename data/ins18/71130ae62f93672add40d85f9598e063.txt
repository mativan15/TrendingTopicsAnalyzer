A new prime minister will be chosen next week after Liz Truss announced her resignation.

After insisting less than 24 hours earlier she is a 'fighter, not a quitter', the Conservative party leader stood at a podium outside 10 Downing Street on Thursday to say her brief time in the top job will come to an end.

There are now growing calls for an early general election.

Liz Truss will still have to meet the King in person to formally tender her resignation, as is tradition.

This will take place immediately before the monarch asks her successor, also in person, to form a government.
