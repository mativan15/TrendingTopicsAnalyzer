'At this point, I don't think the consultation process has anywhere near run its course.'The government confirmed four elements of the workplace bill to act on key Labor promises in the federal election campaign.The first is to ban pay secrecy clauses so that companies cannot prohibit staff from talking about their pay if they want to, something Burke has promised over the past year as a way to stop behaviour that he believes can discriminate against women.The second is to make gender equity an objective of the Fair Work Act, giving the industrial umpire a principle that could influence its decisions on pay and conditions.
