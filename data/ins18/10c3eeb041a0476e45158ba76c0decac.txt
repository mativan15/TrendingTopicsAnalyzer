Sheryl Sandberg is leaving Facebook after 14 years as its chief operating officer and her exit is prompting broader changes to the executive reporting structure within the company.Her successor, Javier Olivan, has been with the company for 15 years and will have almost twice as many direct reports as Sandberg had in the same role, Insider has learned. Olivan previously had several people reporting to him in his role as chief growth officer. He will be keeping essentially all direct reports, while adding most of those that previously reported to Sandberg, according to an analyst note from investment research firm Bernstein and Insider's own reporting.
