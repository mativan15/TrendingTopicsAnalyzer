A closer walk with God has also meant a hike up the property ladder for two pastors of the controversial Arise Church. Brothers John and Brent Cameron stepped down from their positions in the church on May 27 over allegations of abuse and harassment in the organisation. The church, which has 12 branches around New Zealand, has launched two reviews – one into allegations interns at the Arise Church Ministry School were overworked and exploited. The accusations were first made public by journalist David Farrier on his Webworm platform.
