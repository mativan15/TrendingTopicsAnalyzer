It's safe to say that the Irish felt disrespected by their seeding in the NCAA Tournament. The committee forced Notre Dame to the road this past weekend, but it didn't matter one bit.

The Irish played some fantastic baseball during the Statesboro Regional, winning their first two games, once against Texas Tech and then host Georgia Southern. Tonight's rematch against the Red Raiders, with a one-game cushion, was all that was standing in front of the Irish for a return trip to the NCAA Super Regional round.
