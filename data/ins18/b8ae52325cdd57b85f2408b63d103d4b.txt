Nairobi — 
International concern is rising about an offensive by Ethiopian and Eritrean government forces in Ethiopia's Tigray region. Ethiopia's federal authorities on Monday said they will assume control of airports and other infrastructure in the region, while the Tigray regional government said it would respect an African Union call for an immediate cease-fire.
Ethiopian authorities said Monday their forces will take charge of the aviation, transport and communication infrastructure in the embattled Tigray region.
