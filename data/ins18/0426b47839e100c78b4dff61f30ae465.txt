Two new polls are shining a light on the extent of financial concern within Canadian homes.  Credit reporting company Equifax Canada says consumer reliance on credit cards is only increasing -- and in Alberta, that's resulting in very high levels of non-mortgage debt.  Equifax says average individual consumer debt jumped in the first three months of 2022 to more than $25,000 in the province. That's the highest level in the country.  In Calgary, that average sat at $24,987 in the first quarter.  Much of that debt is focused in the 36 to 65-year-old age groups.
