A business owner sent this note to new employees: 'I'm writing to let you know that [the company] wants to provide a path for you to be successful with our company. You will not find another company that is willing to provide you the opportunity and training to be successful and go as far as you want to go. Please make an appointment to come meet with me on most Saturdays. Sometimes, I also work on Sundays. We can discuss a path for improvement. It is very simple to understand and achieve if you are willing to do it.
