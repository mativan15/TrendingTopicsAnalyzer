This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window.Mark Twain, visiting Montreal in 1888 St. Clément opened to parishoners in the late 19th century. Now, it sits unused. A window pane is missing from one of St. Clément's doors. Mass is no longer held at St. Clément church. Parts of St. Clément are fenced off and the grass is overgrown as the local parish responsible for the church gathers at another building. The St. Clément church has stood for more than a century in Montreal's eastern Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district, but it has been years since the building was open to the public.
