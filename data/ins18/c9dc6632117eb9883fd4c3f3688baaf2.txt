Switzerland could force power plant operators to participate in a national energy reserve as it seeks to safeguard electricity supplies this winter.

Under a decree presented by the government on Wednesday, providers will be asked to participate in the creation of a hydropower reserve, a pool of reserve power plants and emergency diesel generator groups. If it can't secure the targeted reserves at 'reasonable charges,' operators may be obliged to participate, according to the decree.
