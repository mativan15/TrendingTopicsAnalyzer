A new artisanal bakery is set to open in East Lancashire later this month

The Bread Shed is set to open in Bury Road, Rawtenstall, on October 24, serving gourmet sandwiches, freshly baked bread and beyond.

Bread Shed takes the place of street food takeaway, The Hut, which used to exist at the cabin.

Owners Sean and Dan Firth-Powell, from Love Clough, own Bread Shed and can't wait to open.

Sean, who is also the catering manager of Alder Grange School in Rawtenstall, said: 'We have been looking for a good artisan bakery for the school but couldn't find what we were looking for locally.
