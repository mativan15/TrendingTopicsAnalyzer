Titled Fashion Silhouettes, the show is the first offering by China National Silk Museum's Fashion Museum, a long-term art exhibition space at Hangzhou Tower. The exhibition features costumes from the 18th to 20th century with selections from the silk museum's Western Collection, such as an 18th-century corset, and dresses of Neoclassicism and Romanticism. During the mid-19th century, 'independent designer' began as a profession. The exhibition displays works of famous designers such as Jeanne Lanvin, Pierre Balmain, and Yves Saint Laurent, accompanied by exquisite shoes, hats, and handbags, showing the flourishing design scene of the 20th century.
