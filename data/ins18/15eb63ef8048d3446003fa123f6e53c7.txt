Anyone rushing to stock up on gin for the long weekend may well pause when they clock the very high prices for certain craft brands. 
Is gin really worth £30 or £40 a bottle? The answer is yes, sometimes, when you want a treat to squirrel away and bring out for an occasional sip. There are undoubtedly some superb premium gins out there.
But this is not that time – this is a weekend for street parties, big celebrations, family half-term get-togethers. This is the moment to splash the gin around (adults only and within reason, of course) and for that purpose many of us want to find the best value.
