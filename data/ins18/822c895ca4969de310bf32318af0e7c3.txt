Yvonne Deboer booked a whole year off work to support Johnny Depp.

The travel agent and self-proclaimed 'number one fan' left behind her life in Los Angeles to come to Fairfax, Virginia, for the entirety of the actor's defamation trial.

For the last six weeks, she has spent every day inside the courtroom watching the case unfold and every night camped outside the courthouse to snap up one of the limited spaces in the public gallery the next morning.
