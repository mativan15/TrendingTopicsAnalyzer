The Jewish passion for social justice in our era

We are in need of such humility today. The Jewish passion for social justice in our era is marked by the prophetic voice. The prophetic voice is the voice of moral clarity. There is no ambivalence in Moses's relay of God's demand to Pharoah: 'Let my people go!' or in Amos's call for the rich to remove their foot from the neck of the poor. When we speak from the prophetic perspective, there is no room for negotiation or compromise. 'Tzedek, Tzedek tirdof!' we are commanded in Deuteronomy in ringing tones.
