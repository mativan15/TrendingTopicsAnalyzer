Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. That downside risk was realized by AJ Bell plc (LON:AJB) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 26%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 13%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 20% in the last three years.

While the last year has been tough for AJ Bell shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise.
