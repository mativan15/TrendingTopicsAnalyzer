The state has agreed to refund millions of dollars in fees and fines paid by more than 30,000 defendants whose drug convictions had to be overturned because they were based on testing performed by Annie Dookhan and one other disgraced state chemist.The settlement of the class action case brought on behalf of defendants whose convictions were overturned will cost the state roughly $14 million, according to an estimate from the office of Attorney General Maura Healey, who defended the state in the case.
