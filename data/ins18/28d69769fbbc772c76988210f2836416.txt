As the sun began to break through the clouds over Los Angeles, cousins Glynis Phillips and Kim Polk danced their way up Crenshaw Boulevard. Music blared from a nearby stage, and the smell of barbecue wafted from a food truck.'Oh, we ain't done dancing,' Phillips said, reaching out to Polk with a laugh.They're in the middle of the Taste of Soul Family Festival in Inglewood, California. The free street festival is held on the third Saturday of each October and designed to reflect and celebrate the Black cultural experience, fused with other cultures and traditions.
