Florida NewsBy Gordon ByrdOct 18, 2022TAMPA -- Police have arrested a man on assault and other charges after they say he crashed his SUV into his own business during a violent argument with a woman. They say a blue GMC crashed through the front of the business in the 3200 block of South Dale Mabry around 8:00 Tuesday morning. A woman told police 31-year-old Pavel Terentev hit her in the face with his fist just before getting out of the SUV, then tried to steer it and strike her. She ran away, and it went through the front window instead.
