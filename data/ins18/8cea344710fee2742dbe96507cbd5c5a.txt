Chelsea manager Graham Potter lavished praise on Manchester United and said on Friday that the team had come a long way since his Brighton & Hove Albion side defeated them on the opening day of the Premier League season.Potter, who left Brighton to take over at Chelsea last month, oversaw a 2-1 win against United in Erik ten Hag's first league game at the helm back in August.United has bounced back impressively since that loss to occupy fifth place in the table with 19 points from 10 games, just a point behind Chelsea who it meets at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
