Published: 07:17 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 07:17 EDT, 29 May 2022 Patrick Sandoval will be on the mound to start the game for the Los Angeles Angels Sunday afternoon against the Toronto Blue Jays in Anaheim, Calif., and he wants very badly to be in the same spot when the game ends as well. Sandoval (3-1, 1.79 ERA) pitched into the eighth in his start last Sunday against Oakland, but was replaced with one out in the inning after he issued a walk. When Sandoval returned to the dugout, he slammed his hat and glove to the ground.
