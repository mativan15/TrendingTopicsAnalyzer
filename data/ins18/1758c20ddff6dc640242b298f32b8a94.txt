Healthcare leaders have urged the UK's new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to make good on his previous commitments to fix the NHS's workforce and pensions crises and not to cut spending on health services amid the current economic turmoil facing the country.Hunt was appointed to replace Kwasi Kwarteng on 14 October by the beleaguered prime minister, Liz Truss, who has seen her premiership unravel in just a matter of weeks after her government announced a series of radical and unfunded tax cuts in its 'mini-budget' last month.
