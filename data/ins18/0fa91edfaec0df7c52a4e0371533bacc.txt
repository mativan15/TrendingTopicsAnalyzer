The government on October 17 said the price rise in wheat and rice has been "normal" and it will intervene in the market to offload the grains if there is any abnormal increase in the rates. Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey, in a press briefing, also said the government has surplus stocks of both wheat and rice in its godowns which will be used for making market intervention. "Price rise is not abnormal as it has been perceived and projected...," Mr. Pandey said. Citing the example of wheat, he said the "price rise is normal" as the last year's wholesale price was depressed as the government sold huge quantities under its Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) to bulk consumers, he said.
