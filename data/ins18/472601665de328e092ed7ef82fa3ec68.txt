Crexendo (NASDAQ:CXDO) will acquire Allegiant Networks that will expand Crexendo's business and footprint, particularly in Kansas and Missouri.
Allegiant is a strong regional telecom and data services company.
The proposed transaction is a natural continuation of the M&A strategy that is focused on adding strong companies that are currently part of our ecosystem, that use the company's platform and allow to expand its reach and offerings.
