When is New York City's COVIDiocy going to end? 
The latest, utterly deranged ploy from our public-health alarmists is legislation dreamed up by Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, aimed at laying down onerous new ventilation rules for indoor spaces. 
This is 'critical to protecting us long-term from this virus, from future waves and similar transmissible diseases,' says Levine. 
Bull. Adding dozens of pages to the city's regulatory codes will do nothing except impose massive costs (including on taxpayers) for retrofitting ventilation systems or building new ones and offer yet another opportunity for contractors and consultants already cozy with the city to rake in big bucks.
