Mr Biden claimed the American economy was 'strong as hell' and inflation was 'worse off everywhere else' than in the United States.
'The problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries, not so much ours,' he told reporters on a visit to Portland ahead of next month's midterm elections.
Craig Mackinlay, the Tory MP for South Thanet, compared Mr Biden's remarks to Barack Obama's warning that Britain would go to the 'back of the queue' for a trade deal if it left the European Union.
