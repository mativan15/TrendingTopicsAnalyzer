The Government will change the law to stop military pilots training the Chinese army after the Ministry of Defence warned British personnel against helping Beijing's forces.
'China is a competitor that is threatening the UK interest in many places around the world,' said James Heappey, the armed forces minister, after reports that up to 30 former British pilots were training the People's Liberation Army.
The pilots had served in the Royal Air Force and across the British military but had done nothing illegal.
