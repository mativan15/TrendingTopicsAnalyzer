WASHINGTON — German lawmakers today passed a €100 billion (U.S. $107 billion) defense budget boost, initiating a major spending spree over several years that is expected to include seven new P-8 Poseidon maritime-surveillance planes in addition to five copies ordered last year.

The bill to establish a special fund for Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, passed parliament by a vote of 593-80, with seven abstentions. Together with the country's regular defense budget of roughly €50 billion, the money is meant to get Berlin to spend an average of 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense over five years — a fiscal target set for NATO members.
