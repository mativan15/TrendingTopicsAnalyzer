Prior to 1979, local team announcers called the World Series on the national radio feed. Since then, the broadcast has been led by national guys. That latter list of national play-by-players isn't long:
Vin ScullyJack BuckJon MillerDan Shulman
Beginning next year on ESPN Radio, a new name will be added to that list, The Post has learned.
Jon Sciambi
Sciambi will take over for Shulman on next year's World Series. Shulman remains on the call this year, his final one on ESPN Radio.
New deals: The moves are all very cordial and come with both Sciambi and Shulman receiving new contracts.
