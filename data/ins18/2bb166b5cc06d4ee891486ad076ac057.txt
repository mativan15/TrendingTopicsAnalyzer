Warby Parker, the eyewear brand founded to lower costs in a market dominated by players including Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, was among the first retail startups to use a direct-to-consumer business model. Since making the first Disruptor 50 list in 2013, Warby Parker has expanded its eyeglass business to include a brand of contact lenses, vision exams and almost 200 bricks-and-mortar locations. The company is looking to open hundreds of stores in the next few years, according to co-CEO David Gilboa, but also sees a future tied to telemedicine.
