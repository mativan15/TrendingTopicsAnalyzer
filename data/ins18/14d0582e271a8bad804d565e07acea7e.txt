Millions of households are skipping meals or struggling to put healthy goods on the table, according to a new poll, with many cutting back on food bills and luxury treats "to navigate the tough months ahead".Around 85% of people in the UK are spending less on food shopping as a result of the cost of living squeeze, most commonly by looking out for items on promotion, research by consumer group Which? suggests.
Half of respondents said they are trading down to cheaper products than they were buying previously.
