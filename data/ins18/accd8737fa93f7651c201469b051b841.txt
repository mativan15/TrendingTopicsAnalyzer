THE impact on the City from the chaos in central government was laid bare today when Schroders revealed that its funds plunged by an extraordinary £21 billion in the last three months.

That is a direct result of the crisis in pension funds that followed the now ditched mini-budget that saw investors panic sell British bonds due to concern about the state of the nation's long term finances.

Schroders, one of the grandest names in the Square Mile, has been around since 1804 and is generally regarded as one of the most stable and best run City institutions.
