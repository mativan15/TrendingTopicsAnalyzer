Tuesday's Bachelor in Paradise starts right where Monday night's explosive episode ended: Jesse Palmer has just evicted all of the women in order to bring in five new women — Kate, Sarah, Eliza, Jessenia, and Florence — to see if BIP can bring the 'playas' out in Playa Escondida. (I'm sorry.)

Serene, Genevieve, Lace, and Jill are all sobbing as they pack their bags and hop into what has to be *extremely Jesse Palmer voice* the most morose group car ride to a luxury hotel in Bachelor history. Feet are up.
