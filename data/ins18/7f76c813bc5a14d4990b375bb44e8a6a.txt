Collider.com The '90s were a transitional decade for horror. It delivered heirs to the '70s slashers in the form of Scream, Jason Goes to Hell, and Freddy's Dead. New entries in established franchises, like Alien 3, Hellraiser 3, and Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness, made a big impact. Prestige horror also got a boost with the critical success of The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, and Misery. Some international horrors like Ring also found success with English-language audiences.
