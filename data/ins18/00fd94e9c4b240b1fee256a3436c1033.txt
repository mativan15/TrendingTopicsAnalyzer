Hello Medium,It's been a long time since my last post. Mostly because of work and the public launch of Membr, my Chrome-based note-taking extension.I rolled out some features and improvements leading up to the launch, this included a redesigned landing page and finally the ability to generate summaries of any website's content among other minor bug fixes and improvements.Left: A summary of this blog post generated by Membr Notes; Right: Summary of a Financial Times article on the current Financial crisisI recently did a Product Hunt launch for it and let's say I have lots of lessons on what not to do and what to do when launching a digital product 😅.
