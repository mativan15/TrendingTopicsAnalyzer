Delhi government issued an order withdrawing the Rs 500 fine for not wearing masks in public places that it had imposed to curtail the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital, reported PTI. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had in a meeting last month decided to stop levying the penalty after September 30 amid a decline in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. 
However, no official notification had been issued. The move comes a few days after Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's meeting with the senior health officials regarding the emergence of Omicron's new sub-variants.
