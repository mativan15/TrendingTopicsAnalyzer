Kanye 'Ye' West has inked a deal with Parlement Technologies to buy Parler, a copycat of Twitter that was started to 'fight against Big Tech, Big Government, censorship and cancel culture.'

West's move to acquire Parler comes after Twitter and Instagram restricted the music artist and entrepreneur's accounts earlier this month because he posted anti-Semitic comments.
