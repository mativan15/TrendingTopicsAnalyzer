I had been waiting with bated breath, checking websites daily, all in anticipation of when Apple would announce its latest iPads. The reason? I had decided it was time to give up on the idea that an iPad could be a laptop replacement, and get rid of my old one in favour of something newer, but simpler.

That is, I understand, not exactly a ringing endorsement. But having tried and failed to use an iPad Air as a mobile computer, I switched to a new MacBook Air, which, if it weren't so overpriced, I would recommend unreservedly.
