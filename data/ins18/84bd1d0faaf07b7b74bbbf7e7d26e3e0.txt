Jurgen Klopp rejects claims he inflamed Liverpool vs Man City tensions - PA

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is taking legal action after being accused in media outlets of xenophobia against Manchester City's owners in the toxic aftermath of his side's 1-0 win over the champions at Anfield.

Klopp last Friday had made comments about the spending power of the champions compared with rival clubs but on Tuesday said his comments were 'misunderstood.'

The enthralling encounter on Sunday saw Klopp receive a red card for berating an assistant referee and yesterday the Football Association charged him with misconduct.
