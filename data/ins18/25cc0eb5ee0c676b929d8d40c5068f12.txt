The movie will star Levy, Ruth Negga ('Passing'), Himesh Patel ('Station Eleven'), Luke Evans ('Beauty and the Beast'), Celia Imrie ('Better Things'), Arnaud Valois ('Spring Blossom'), David Bradley ('Game of Thrones') and Jamael Westman (West End's 'Hamilton'). In addition to directing and starring in the film, Levy also wrote the screenplay.
