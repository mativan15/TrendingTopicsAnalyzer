This unit gets a B because the five-man group consists of two guys who get most of the playing time and snaps.
A.J. Brown has 33 catches for 503 yards and two touchdowns through six games, taking what the defense gives.
DeVonta Smith is also on a terrific pace, logging 33 catches for 397 yards. Both players are on pace for 1,000 yards receiving, but the other two receivers, Quez Watkins and Zach Pascal, have combined for 12 catches on 16 total targets through six contests.
