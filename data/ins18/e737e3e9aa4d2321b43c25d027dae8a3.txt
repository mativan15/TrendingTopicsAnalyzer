A British Columbia doctor who sued his local health authority after being attacked by a patient may be regretting his choice not to accept a settlement. Dr. Rajeev Sheoran, who works in the Okanagan region, was offered a settlement of $625,000 when he filed a civil suit against the Interior Health Authority. Believing he was entitled more – millions more – he instead chose to take his case to court, where he ended up being the one paying. What happened that brought the case to court occurred in December 2014.
