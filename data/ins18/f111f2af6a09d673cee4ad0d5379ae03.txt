Google may have had another major leak of its next phone, giving us a peek at the Pixel 7 months ahead of its scheduled release later this year.
An alleged prototype of Google's upcoming flagship was posted on eBay as spotted by Android guru Mishaal Rahman spotted on the Pixel subreddit.
This is the second major Google device leak within just a few weeks after after a Pixel Watch prototype was ‘left' at a restaurant.
Google had just formally confirmed the incoming Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro during its 2022 I/O developer conference this month.
