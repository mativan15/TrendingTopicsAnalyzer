Former President Donald Trump lost his bid Friday to halt New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation into his business dealings. A federal judge dismissed Mr. Trump's case where the 45th president had argued for an injunction against Ms. James' civil investigation, claiming the Democratic attorney general has been a partisan political opponent of his for years. Mr. Trump claimed she was violating his constitutional rights by targeting him over his political views, but the judge didn't agree.
