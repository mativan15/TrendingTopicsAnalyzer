EDMONTON - Michael Stone had a goal and two assists as the Calgary Flames got a bit of revenge for last season's playoff ousting by Edmonton, defeating the Oilers 4-3 on Saturday.

Mikael Backlund, Nazem Kadri and Andrew Mangiapan also scored for the Flames, who improved to 2-0.

It was the first time since the 2009-2010 season that the Flames have won their first two games of the NHL regular season.

Cody Ceci, Connor McDavid and Ryan McLeod scored for the Oilers (1-1).

The Flames got off to a quick start, scoring 1:13 into the opening frame when Backlund was able to deposit the rebound in front after Oilers' starter Jack Campbell made the initial save on a deflected shot.
