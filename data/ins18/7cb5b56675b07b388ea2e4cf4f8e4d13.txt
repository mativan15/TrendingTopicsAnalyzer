Universities across Britain are pledging to 'decolonise' their curricula in defiance of ministers as they compete for awards from a scheme accused of causing 'the most egregious wokery' on campuses.
Of the 23 universities handed an award as part of Advance HE's race equality charter (REC), 20 – including the University of Warwick and Imperial College London – have explicitly said they are 'decolonising' courses, while the remainder have pledged to 'liberate', 'diversify' or introduce 'compulsory race equality' to their syllabi.
