If you look at Aimee Gregg 's LinkedIn profile, you'll see that she started with International Paper (IP) in 2000, as a management trainee. These days, she's its VP of containerboard — and she's just been tapped to join a high-powered organization's board of directors.

Gregg has been named to the board of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest industrial trade association in the country. With over 14,000 members, it looks to help manufacturers compete in the global economy, and address an array of challenges, like supply chain disruptions, inflation, and the labor shortage.
