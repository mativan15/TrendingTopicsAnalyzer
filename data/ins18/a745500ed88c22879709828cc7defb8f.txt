Union minister and BJP ally Ramdas Athawale has supported the 22 pledges B R Ambedkar had drawn up while converting to Buddhism, and said he as a Buddhist is "proud" of them. These pledges, which include not worshipping Hindi deities, are at the centre of a political row after the then Delhi government minister Rajendra Pal Gautam was forced to resign due to the BJP's vehement protests against the AAP leader's presence at a conversion event where these vows were recited. In a tweet on Saturday, Athawale said, "We accept these 22 pledges drawn up by Bodhisattva Baba Saheb Ambedkar and I as a Buddhist support these 22 vows.
