Mogadishu — 
Somali veteran journalist Abdalle Ahmed Mumin is out on bail after being arrested last week on security-related charges.
Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, the secretary-general of the Somali Journalists Syndicate, or SJS, appeared in a Mogadishu court Sunday, six days after he was arrested at the airport and stopped from traveling to Kenya to visit relatives.
Mumin was accused of disobeying the law, according to the charges seen by VOA. The country's attorney general office charged Abdalle on behalf of the information ministry, which recently issued a directive barring Somali journalists from reporting news related to Islamist militant group al-Shabab.
