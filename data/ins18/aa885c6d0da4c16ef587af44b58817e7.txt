It won't be easy for the Detroit Lions to get back into the win column in Week 7. The Lions come off their bye week to be a hefty underdog against the Dallas Cowboys in the early betting lines.
The 1-4 Lions are 6.5-point underdogs in the opening line at Tipico Sportsbook. Dallas is coming off a 26-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night in Week 6, dropping the Cowboys' record to 4-2. The Cowboys will get QB Dak Prescott back for the visit from the Lions after the regular starter missed the last five games with a thumb injury.
