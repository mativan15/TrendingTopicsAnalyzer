The serial thief who led the city in shoplifting busts last year with a staggering 46 arrests says he exploited his Queens neighborhood's fears, lax store security and soft-on crime prosecutors, during an exclusive jailhouse interview with The Post.
Isaac Rodriguez, who made the paper's Oct. 3, 2021 front page as the 'Man of Steal,' pilfered a Jackson Heights Walgreens at will — at least 37 times last year — loading up on anything he could easily flip for cash, which he then quickly converted to heroin-cocaine speedballs.
