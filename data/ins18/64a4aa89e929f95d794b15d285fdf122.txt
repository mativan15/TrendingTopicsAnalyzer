Expanding London's pollution charge zone for older vehicles boosted Transport for London's (TfL) income by almost £100 million, according to new research.

RAC analysis of TfL figures found the move to make the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) 18 times larger generated an estimated £93.6 million of additional revenue from drivers.

The data was published ahead of the first anniversary of the expansion on Tuesday.

The Ulez was first launched in April 2019 but initially only covered the same area of central London as the congestion charge.
