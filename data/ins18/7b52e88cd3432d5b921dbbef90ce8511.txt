Targetting the BJP-led Centre for 'using' central agencies 'to silence' Opposition parties, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday claimed that the BJP would find 'no entry' across the country in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
Addressing a public meeting in Purulia district, Banerjee said, 'Let me make it very clear that there will be no entry for BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. They have to go. There are no chances of the BJP returning to power. There is no place for BJP's politics of violence and hate.
