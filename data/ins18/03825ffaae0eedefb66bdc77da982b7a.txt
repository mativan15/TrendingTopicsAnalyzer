NORWICH — Straddling parts of both New London and Tolland Counties, the 19th State Senate District is a sprawling area.

However, both candidates vying for that seat met at Norwich Free Academy Wednesday.

The incumbent is Democrat Cathy Osten, who has held the seat since 2013. She has served in the U.S. Army, worked for the state Department of Corrections, and was the First Selectman of Sprague. Her opponent is Republican Pietro 'Rocky' Camardella, a first-time candidate who immigrated to the United States after his service in the Italian Navy and Merchant Marines and has been known in Norwich for decades for his photography.
