(Bloomberg) -- China's central bank halted its cash withdrawal via medium term loans for the first time in three months in a bid to boost the economy as the Communist Party's twice-a-decade leadership congress gets underway.The People's Bank of China injected 500 billion yuan ($70 billion) via its one-year medium-term lending facility on Monday, matching the amount maturing this month. The outcome was predicted by five out of the eight economists and analysts in a Bloomberg survey.The move underscores China's accommodative monetary policy stance as the economy suffers due to Beijing's Covid Zero policy and a slump in the housing market.
