When Doane Hanus took over Thunder Thighs Costumes, one of the first orders of business was to take an inventory of everything in the sprawling 1,800 square-foot space at 16 Busy Street.

'After my Mom passed away about five years back, I decided ‘let's go through the stock, it's going to take some time.' I was young enough but also naïve enough to think it (stock inventory) was going to take two years. We're still doing it,' Hanus said, with a rueful smile.

Hanus estimates there are between 1-million and 3-million items in total — 'I think' — including props like swords and guns and costumes from the 1700s to the present.
