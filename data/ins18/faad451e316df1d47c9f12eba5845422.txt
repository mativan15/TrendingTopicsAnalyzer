Marty's, a late night sports bar that began in Southside with Marty's PM, is expanding to a third location in Trussville later this month.

The new spot at 1423 Gadsden Hwy., Suite 131, follows the success of the restaurant's second spot, Marty's GM in Irondale, which opened in 2018.

'We had such a great reception with Irondale, and there's not a 21-and-up bar in Trussville, so we decided to move out here to offer that,' said General Manager Sarah Thurmond, who joined Marty's in May 2020. 'We have a lot of great folks who come to us in Irondale who live out here in Trussville.
