Michael Owen believes Mohamed Salah is still Liverpool's talisman and is backing him to finish as the club's top scorer this season. Salah, 30, has scored nine goals in 14 games this term - but just three of those have come in the Premier League. He is some way behind Erling Haaland's tally of 15 in the competition, with Harry Kane and Ivan Toney bagging nine and eight goals respectively. Yet Owen thinks Salah will score plenty of Premier League goals this season. He hit the winner against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday and will be looking to find the net again in Liverpool's next home game against West Ham on Wednesday.
