A former soldier's 'war lesson' at a nursery school in Russia has prompted concern about military propaganda targeting ever younger children.In photographs and video shot at Kindergarten No. 31 in Korolyov, near Moscow, an army veteran named Pavel Firsov is seen showing an automatic rifle and a grenade launcher to pupils aged four or five.The aim of the lesson was to demonstrate 'qualities that distinguish a true defender of the Motherland', local officials said in an online post that was later removed.
