Guinea's military government agreed to a two-year plan to return the country with the world's biggest bauxite deposits to civilian rule.

The decision of the government led by Mamadi Doumbouya sets aside an earlier plan by the junta to transition over three years, the Economic Community of West African States, said in a statement, after a visit by delegates to the capital, Conakry, on Friday.
