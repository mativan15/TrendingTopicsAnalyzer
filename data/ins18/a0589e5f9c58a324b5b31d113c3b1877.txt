"Shock factor, very high. Disappointment, very high. It's crushing," Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said. "Each guy gave everything they had all year long, and a tremendous season. The great thing about baseball is the unpredictability, and the tough thing about it is the same thing."

The Dodgers are the most dominant regular season team of the last decade. They have won 73 more regular season games in the last 10 years than anyone else. They have beaten their regular season opponents by more than 1,700 runs in that span, more than 700 more than the second-best Houston Astros, according to MLB.
