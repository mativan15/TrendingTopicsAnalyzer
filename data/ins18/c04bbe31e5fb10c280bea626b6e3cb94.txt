Goodbye Washington Real Estate Investment Trust. Hello Elme Communities.

Reflecting its wholesale shift into residential real estate, the D.C.-based real estate investment trust, better known as WashREIT, announced Monday it has rebranded. In a statement, president and CEO Paul McDermott said the new name is a combination of the words 'elevate' and 'home." The decision comes after WashREIT (NYSE: WRT) sold almost all of its office and retail assets to focus on becoming a regional multifamily operator.
