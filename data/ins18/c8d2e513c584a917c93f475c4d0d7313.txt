Published October 14, 2022 11:20pm EDT Former Democrat congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard shared why she decided to leave the Democratic Party on Friday's "Hannity" and how the party has evolved over the years. TULSI GABBARD: I got to be honest, I've heard directly from a couple who have been encouraging and gave me good feedback. I've heard a lot of expected hatred and vitriol coming from the mainstream media establishment in Washington, the permanent Washington, the Democratic Party elite, all trotting out the same old, tired criticisms that have nothing to do with substance.
