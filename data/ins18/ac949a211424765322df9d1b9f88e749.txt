Liverpool defender Andy Robertson believes that goalkeeper Alisson Becker has been 'let down' by his teammates this season following the Reds' victory over Manchester City on Sunday. Mohamed Salah scored the only goal of the game as Jurgen Klopp's side returned to winning ways, but it was Alisson who received plenty of plaudits for his sublime assist to set up the Egyptian's winner, whilst also making a number of saves to preserve a clean sheet. And following the game, Robertson hailed Alisson as the world's best goalkeeper, although he made an honest admission over Liverpool's own performances this season and their impact on the Brazilian international throughout the campaign.
