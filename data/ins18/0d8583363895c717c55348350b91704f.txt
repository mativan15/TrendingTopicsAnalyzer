Dwayne Johnson appeared to bump into a familiar face at the Black Adam premiere after he was seen greeting Daniel Craig's daughter Ella Loudon.
The Rock was in London town on Tuesday night for the star-studded premiere of his new DC Comics' blockbuster at Leicester Square. 
Rocking – excuse the pun – a purple satin suit and no shirt, Dwayne posed on the red carpet at Leicester Square alongside his co-stars Noah Centineo, Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Shahi. 
However, there was another red carpet guest who Dwayne was particularly pleased to see – James Bond actor Daniel's eldest child Ella.
