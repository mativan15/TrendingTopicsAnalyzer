Since the spring, thousands of migrants have been arriving regularly at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, most of them Venezuelan families escaping the country's economic collapse.

Many lack ties in the city and have sought housing in the city's homeless shelter system. But officials have struggled to find enough room.
