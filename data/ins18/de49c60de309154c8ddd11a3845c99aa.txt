South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem signs a bill Thursday, Feb. 3, 2022, at the state Capitol in Pierre, S.D., that will ban transgender women and girls from playing in school sports leagues that match their gender identity.

A new initiative to cut off school lunch funds for schools that deviate from federally-backed transgender policy in classrooms has South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem threatening a lawsuit.

Weeks after the United States Department of Agriculture proposed new rules that would choke dollars from public schools that prohibit transgender youth from participating in sports or using gender-designated bathrooms of their choice, the first-term Republican governor Thursday vowed to resist the measure with litigation.
