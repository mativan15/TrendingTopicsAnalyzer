Opinion On October 7, Ukrainian soldiers fighting on the front line reported outages on the Starlink satellite internet service. The outages were most notable in the southern Kherson region, where the most intense fighting was taking place.
Starlink is used for force command and communication, as well as relaying drone video for targeting decisions: the loss was described to the Financial Times as having a 'catastrophic' impact on the rapid advances Ukrainian forces made at the time.
A few hours later, the service was restored.
