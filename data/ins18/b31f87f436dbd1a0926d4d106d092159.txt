Grzelcyk was initially hurt on a Jan. 22 hit from behind by Winnipeg's Pierre-Luc Dubois. The injury worsened over the following 50 games, limiting him to five playoff games (0-0–0, minus-6).Grzelcyk feels he should fit in well in Montgomery's quick-moving system.'I've been following Monty ever since he's been coaching at Denver,' Grzelcyk said. 'They've always had a great offensive team. Definitely want to pick his brain and be a sponge these next few games.'Jack Studnicka's patience paid off. He was set to make his season debut in Game No.
