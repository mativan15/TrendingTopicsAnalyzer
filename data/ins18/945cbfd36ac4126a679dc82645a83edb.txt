HOUSTON – Off the bat, Aaron Judge's eighth-inning drive appeared to be on a home run trajectory.

Alex Bregman's third inning, three-run homer off Luis Severino held up, sending the Yankees to a 3-2 loss and 2-0 deficit to the Houston Astros in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series.
