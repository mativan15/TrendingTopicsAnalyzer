When Unity CEO John Riccitiello talks about the metaverse, it's not a horrible idea to listen. Riccitiello has been in games and computing a long time. The first game he played was Pong. The first games he coded — 'miserable' text-based games, he says — were on a PDP-1011 mainframe computer released by Digital Equipment Corporation in the 1960s and boasting less raw computing horsepower than a five-year-old iPhone 8. He's the former CEO of Electronic Arts, and an early investor in the Oculus product that Mark Zuckerberg eventually bought and jonesed so hard for he changed Facebook's name to Meta.
