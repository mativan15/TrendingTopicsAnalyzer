The Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a notice to Union government in a gender discrimination case where the Army has reserved 90% vacancies in the Army Dental Corps (ADC) for men.
The petitioner in this case is Dr Satbir Kaur, a dental surgeon from Punjab.
Dr Kaur, an applicant for Short Service Commission in the ADC, has approached the high court pointing out that out of 30 total vacancies, the Army has reserved 27 seats for men and just 3 for women.
The clearing of National Eligibility and Entrance Test for Master's in Dental Sciences (NEET-MDS) is a must for applying for ADC.
