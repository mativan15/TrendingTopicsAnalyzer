Savers are depositing more money into fixed savings accounts now that interest rate rises have made locking away your money a more enticing prospect.In April £868 million more was deposited into fixed-rate bonds and notice accounts than was taken out, according to the Bank of England, up from a £445 million net increase in March. In every month from November 2020 until March more money had left fixed-rate bonds than was saved into new ones.Meanwhile, less money is being deposited into easy-access savings — £2.
