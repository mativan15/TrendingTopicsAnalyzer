Australia's competition watchdog says that three of the country's four biggest airports made a profit last financial year, even as travel plunged amid coronavirus restrictions.

Sydney Airport made $148.5 million in 2020-21, while Brisbane made $48.1 million and Perth earned $27.9 million, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission said on Monday.

While that's far less than they made before the pandemic, the ACCC said it was surprised the airports were able to turn a profit at all and said it was watching their margins closely.
