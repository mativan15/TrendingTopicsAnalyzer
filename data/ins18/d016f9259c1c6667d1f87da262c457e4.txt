Nile Gardiner, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, spoke about the Sussexes, who have returned to the UK for the Jubilee weekend. In particular, he hit out at Meghan, claiming she "relentlessly thinks about herself". Speaking to Express.co.uk, Mr Gardiner said: "I think it's very clear that Meghan and Harry have been using their royal status to advance their own personal agenda and that's especially the case with Meghan Markle."If you look at their vast Netflix deals, there's a huge amount of money involved and Meghan Markle especially has used her royal status as a sort of publicity machine to advance her own personal interests.
