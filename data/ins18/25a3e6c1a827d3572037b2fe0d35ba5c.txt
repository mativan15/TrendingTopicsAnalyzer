The government has ordered a competent authority to take appropriate action against ex-NCB official Sameer Wankhede for his shoddy probe into the Aryan Khan drugs haul case, according to reports. In the issue of Sameer Wankhede's forged caste certificate, the government has already taken action. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) granted Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, a clean chit in the 'drugs on cruise' case.

Wankhede led a raid on the Cordelia cruise ship and recovered a variety of narcotics as well as Rs 1.
