"Knives Out" director Rian Johnson has confirmed speculation about one of the film franchise's titular players: that Daniel Craig's character, Benoit Blanc, is queer.During a press conference at the London Film Festival, Johnson addressed the speculation after he was asked about a scene in which Benoit appeared to have a live-in male lover."Yes, obviously he is," the director simply told press."There's nobody in the world I can imagine in bringing me more joy for Benoit Blanc to be with," Johnson continued.
