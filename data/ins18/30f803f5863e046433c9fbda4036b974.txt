AMSTERDAM, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The Dutch government will invest up to 3.5 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in military procurement, the defence ministry said, in a policy turnaround in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

After years of declining spending, the Dutch military will purchase between 2023 and 2026 a rocket artillery system and 10 howitzer cannons for up to 1 billion euros.

The Netherlands will also purchase a mobile air defence system for up to 2.5 billion euros, Junior Defence Minister Christophe van der Maat wrote in a letter to parliament.
