Environmental activists from Just Stop Oil attacked a luxury car dealership in central London on Sunday as part of a series of actions against oil and gas development that began in early October.

As a group of activists blocked traffic in a sit-in protest on Park Lane on Sunday morning, one of them sprayed orange paint over the window of the Aston Martin dealership in one of the capital's most exclusive areas.

The Just Stop Oil group launched a series of daily actions and blockades in the capital in early October.
