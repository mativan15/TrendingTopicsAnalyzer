A hacker who stole unreleased songs from Ed Sheeran and sold them on the dark web has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Adrian Kwiatkowski, 23, illegally accessed the cloud-based accounts of dozens of top musicians, including Frank Ocean, Post Malone and Kanye West.
He would then steal unreleased material from these artists and trade their songs online in exchange for cryptocurrency.
City of London Police, who investigated the case, believe Kwiatkowski had made over £131,000 pounds from selling the illegally-obtained tunes.
