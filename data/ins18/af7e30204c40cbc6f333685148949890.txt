PITTSBURGH – President Joe Biden stood at the edge of a bridge with Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman on Thursday and talked mostly about the bridge.
The structure, which partially collapsed in January and was rebuilt with $25 million in federal funds expedited after the passage of last year's bipartisan infrastructure bill, served to illustrate the president's argument before next month's midterm election: Democrats have done big things to improve Americans' day-to-day lives.
The January bridge collapse occurred on the same day Biden was visiting Pittsburgh to talk about infrastructure.
