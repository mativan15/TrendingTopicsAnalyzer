Tim Boyle/Getty Images News Abbott (NYSE:ABT) on Friday said it is developing a new biowearable device that will continuously monitor glucose and ketone levels in one sensor. ABT said the system had already got a breakthrough device designation from the U.S. FDA. The company is already conducting clinical studies on the system, with trials to take place in 2023. The new glucose-ketone sensor will be the same size as Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 3 continuous glucose monitoring sensor. ABT said a glucose-ketone monitor is especially important for people with diabetes who may be at a higher risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition where ketone levels rise to dangerous levels in the blood.
