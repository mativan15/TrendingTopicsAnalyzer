After a brief pause of three years, the National Memorial Day Parade has wrapped D.C in a whirlwind again. One thing that has piqued the public's interest globally is that the parade will be led by First Lt. James H. Harvey III, a pilot with the renowned African American Tuskegee Airmen 332nd Fighter Group. Harvey is a decorated Korean War aviator. He has flown many American fighter planes, like F-47 and F-51, even though he wasn't in combat during the second world war. Along with his three buddies, he was selected to fly in the first gunnery competition hosted by the Air Force, "Top Gun" style.
