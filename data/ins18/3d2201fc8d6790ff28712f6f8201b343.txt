The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday unanimously re-elected senior leader D. Raja as general secretary at the conclusion of 24th party Congress in Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh. He took over the reins in July 2019, when the then general secretary, Sudhakar Reddy, stepped down due to ill-health. The 73-year-old Mr. Raja is the first Dalit to occupy the position in a mainstream communist party.
