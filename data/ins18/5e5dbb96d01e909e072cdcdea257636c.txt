Liz Truss was dealt a major blow yesterday after losing the support of influential Tory website ConservativeHome.Its editor Paul Goodman tore into the embattled Prime Minister's economic programme after she sacked her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and delivered a brief press conference on Friday to announce the reversal of corporation tax plans.In a blog post entitled 'It's all over for Truss', former Wycombe MP Mr Goodman wrote that the Prime Minister was 'damned' either way, but said she looked 'more like a ghost than a premier' in recent days.
