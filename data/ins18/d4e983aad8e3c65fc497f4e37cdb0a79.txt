Published: 01:30 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 01:30 EDT, 30 May 2022 An Australian company has worked out how to permanently destroy so-called "forever chemicals" that have left a toxic legacy at defence sites, airports and dumps across the nation. The PFAS family of chemicals includes more than 4000 manufactured substances that can be found in everything from make-up and household cleaning products to firefighting foam and hydraulic fluid for aircraft. They're commonly called forever chemicals because they don't naturally break down, can travel long distances in water and air currents, and accumulate in soil, water, animals and humans.
