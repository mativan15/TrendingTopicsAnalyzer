Emmerdale's Will Taylor will be caught out by partner Kim Tate next week on the ITV soap, and viewers know she is one character you do not want to get on the wrong side of. Soap fans are aware that Will has recently learned Kim's son Jamie Tate is still alive, after his apparent death in September. Jamie faked his death in a car crash and has been in hiding with daughter Millie and her grandmother Hazel ever since. Gabby Thomas and Dawn Taylor had initially found proof of his fate before questioning said evidence.
