U.S. consumers have considered reducing or even dropping their insurance coverage as they look to cut costs amid economic pressures, a recent survey said. More than half (53%) of Americans rated their financial state between "poor" and "fair" as they fight the headwinds of inflation and rising interest rates, according to the Nationwide survey.As a result, consumers have cut back on spending in several areas, including 38% who said they are eating out less frequently and 32% who said they are buying cheaper products than those they typically use.
