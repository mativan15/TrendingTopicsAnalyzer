From the Flames calls to attention the serious environmental effects of ongoing drought in California coupled with climate change through two poignant photographs from the frontlines of the Caldor and Dixie Fires. Addario is a Pulitzer Prize winner and one of the five most influential photographers of the past 25 years as named by American Photo magazine in 2015. Her work is often centered around important social and environmental issues such as human rights and climate change.

Through this drop, Addario wants to raise global awareness of the severe effects of climate change, while honoring those affected by the 2021 fires by donating 10% of proceeds to the Wildland Firefighter Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides assistance to fallen firefighters' families and to firefighters injured in the line of duty.
