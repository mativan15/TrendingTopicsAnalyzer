During this week's new episode of The Kardashians on Hulu, Kylie Jenner opened up about experiencing postpartum "baby blues" following the birth of her second child, a son, whose name we still do not know.

"It's been really hard for me," Kylie told her older sister Kendall Jenner . "I cried nonstop every day for the first three weeks."

Kylie explained, "It's just the baby blues and then it kinda goes away. I had it with Stormi too."

"Your hormones are probably all over the place," rationalized Kendall.
