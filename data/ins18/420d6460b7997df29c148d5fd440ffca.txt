Yesterday, Tom Henderson reported that Bungie was making a new, PvP-focused game based on a revival of its Marathon IP. That report has since been followed up by further info from another industry insider, Jeff Grubb, with all of this being the most detailed look yet into what else Bungie is up to besides endless Destiny 2 updates. Grubb confirmed he's heard about Bungie's Marathon game as well, and has additional details about the project. This is actually a project in partnership with NetEase, the Chinese gaming company that invested $100 million in Bungie back in 2019, well before the Sony purchase.
