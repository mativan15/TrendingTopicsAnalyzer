Whitehall was put into lockdown this morning with people evacuated after a ‘suspicious package' was found. 
Hundreds of people were gathered at Horse Guards Parade, behind Downing Street, after they were told to leave their buildings and the area was closed off.
Police have now assessed the item and declared it as ‘non-suspicious', so the cordon has been lifted and workers have been allowed to return to their offices. 
Roads had been closed to all pedestrians as well as vehicles from Parliament Square past Downing Street and the Cenotaph.
