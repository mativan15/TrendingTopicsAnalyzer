Inflight cake-cutting and quiz contests were some of the slew of activities organised by Air India Express (AIE) on Saturday in 58 of its flights across its networks to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the first maiden commercial flight by J R D Tata in 1932. The celebrations began at 8 AM on a Kochi-Muscat flight and on 57 other flights of the airline, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India (AI), till 5 PM, an AIE spokesperson said. This is the first major function held by the airline after AIE and AI were taken over by the Tata Group which had in 1932 founded Tata Airlines that was later renamed as Air India.
