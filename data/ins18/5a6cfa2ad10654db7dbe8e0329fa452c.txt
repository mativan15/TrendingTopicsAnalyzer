The Baltimore Ravens have added plenty of talent to their secondary over the course of the 2022 offseason. They first signed safety Marcus Williams to a five-year, $70 million contract, then drafted safety Kyle Hamilton as well as cornerbacks Jalyn Armour-Davis and Damarion Williams in the 2022 draft. However, after losing cornerback depth throughout free agency such as Anthony Averett, Tavon Young and Chris Westry, there were question marks as to whether the team had enough experience at the position behind Marlon Humphrey and Marcus Peters.
