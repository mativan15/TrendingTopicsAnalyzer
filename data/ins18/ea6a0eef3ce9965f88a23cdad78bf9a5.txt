U.S. stock futures rose Friday morning, setting the major indexes on track to end a weeks-long losing streak after a string of more upbeat corporate results at least temporarily offset fears of a steep economic slide.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose. The blue-chip index headed for a 4% weekly gain as of Thursday's close, which if maintained, would mark its largest since mid-March. The S&P 500 had fallen for the seven consecutive weeks prior in its longest losing streak since 2000. Dow and Nasdaq futures each also gained Friday.
