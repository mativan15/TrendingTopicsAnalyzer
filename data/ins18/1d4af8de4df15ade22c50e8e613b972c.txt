U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Thursday declined to block President Joe Biden's plan to cancel billions of dollars in student debt, the legality of which had been challenged by a Wisconsin taxpayers organization represented by a conservative legal group. 
The Brown County Taxpayers Association had made an emergency request to put on hold the debt forgiveness plan, which was announced in August and meant for people who had taken out loans to pay for college. Barrett denied the request without explanation.
