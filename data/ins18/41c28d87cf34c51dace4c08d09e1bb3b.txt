PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – $300,000 is going toward helping HIV/AIDS patients in Philadelphia and it's because of the AIDS Walk Philly event over the weekend. The money raised will help those in need of emergency assistance.

More than 27,000 people in the Greater Philadelphia Area are living with HIV/AIDS.

Organizers also say our area has a new infection rate three times greater than the national average.

The first AIDS Walk Philly happened in 1987 organized by members of the lesbian and gay community center.
