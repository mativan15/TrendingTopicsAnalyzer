While the collapse of TerraUSD rattled many investors this month, one crypto leader sees the fallout as exactly what the industry needed.'It's an important moment for the crypto industry,' Paolo Ardino, chief technology officer of Tether (USDT), the most traded cryptocurrency, told Yahoo Finance between stints at the World Economic Forum and Coinmarketcap's 'The Capital' conference. 'One that will definitely expedite regulations — and not just for stablecoins.'Since the algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD, began to 'de-peg' from its $1 mark on May 7, the global market capitalization for all crypto assets has dropped by more than 25%.
