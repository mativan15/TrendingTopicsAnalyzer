Recovering Black Sox softball pitcher Daniel Chapman got through the New Zealand trials unscathed and is expected to pitch at the National Fastpitch Championship before the World Cup team is named. Head coach Mark Sorenson insists 'there are still some spots up for grabs'' at this weekend's NFC provincial tournament in Christchurch before the 16-man Black Sox squad is named on Tuesday for the World Cup in Auckland from November 26 to December 4. The Black Sox held four trial games in Auckland last weekend, with Chapman taking an important step in his comeback from back surgery.
