OPINION: I couldn't vote in these local elections, but their outcome will affect me greatly. I live and grew up in Northland. Summers are spent on the beach, winters are spent trudging through absurd amounts of mud on the farm, and I study our unique and fascinating history every year at school. But I also have to face our ridiculously terrible roads. I drive on them every day; navigating terrible corners with no shoulder, endless corrugations on metal roads, and dips that make me fear for the life of the 2008 Mitsubishi Galant I consider my pride and joy.
