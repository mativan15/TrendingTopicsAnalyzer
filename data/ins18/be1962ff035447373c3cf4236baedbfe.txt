Huw Edwards has admitted he is rather red-faced over rumours that he will be knighted following his coverage of the Queen's death and subsequent funeral on the BBC One.
The broadcaster broke the historic news that the late monarch, who had reigned for 70 years, had died on September 8 aged 96.
In the days that followed, he continued to lead reports on the channel before fronting the coverage of the funeral, which took place on Monday, September 19.
Viewers were in awe of Edwards' unfaltering professionalism and he received high praise at the time for ‘holding it together' throughout.
