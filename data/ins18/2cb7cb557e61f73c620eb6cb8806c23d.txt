Jun. 3—AUBURN — Sally Christner is the only Androscoggin County commissioner left from when Larry Post was hired as the county's first administrator nearly seven years ago.

At Wednesday's meeting — Post's last as county administrator — the commissioner from Turner and board chairwoman praised Post for his accomplishments and ability to steer the county clear of the multiple crises it faced in 2015.

Christine rattled off the turmoil Post faced when he began his tenure — a union working four years without a contract, a weakened relationship with the Budget Committee after commissioners walked out of a meeting with them one week before Post started, and towns preparing to file suit against the county over whether commissioners could raise their own salaries.
