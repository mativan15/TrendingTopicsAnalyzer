The numbers: Industrial production rose 0.4% in September, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday. The gain was above economists' expectations of a 0.1% gain, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. Output in August was revised to a slight decline of 0.1% from the initial estimate of a 0.2% fall. Capacity utilization rose to 80.3% in September from 80.1% in the prior month. The capacity utilization rate reflects the limits to operating the nation's factories, mines and utilities.  Economists had forecast a 80% rate.
