Marilyn Monroe's birthday is definitely something to celebrate.
The Hollywood icon would have been 96 on June 1 and to commemorate the milestone, Julien's Auction is selling her personal effects and memorabilia.
Fans will be able to bid on items such as her film costumes, jewelry, photographs, handwritten notes, files and other relics from her life and career.
In conjunction with Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the auction — titled 'Hollywood Legends' — will be carried out in Beverly Hills, Calif. from July 15 to July 17.
