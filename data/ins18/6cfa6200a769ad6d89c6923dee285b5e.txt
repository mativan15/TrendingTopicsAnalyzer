As the families of those lost in last week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, continue to grieve, two Texas businesses are stepping up to do their part in helping victims' families get through this extremely difficult time.  Funerals began on Tuesday of this week after a gunman opened fire last Tuesday, May 24, at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde — killing 19 innocent children and two teachers. Trey Ganem, owner of SoulShine Industries in Edna, Texas, made customized caskets for 18 of the 19 children killed at Robb Elementary, and one adult, free of charge.
