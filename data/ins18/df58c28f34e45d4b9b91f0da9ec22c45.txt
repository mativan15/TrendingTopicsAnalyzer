Back in 2017 Sonos released one of its best products for the money: the Sonos One smart speaker, which offered great sound and an affordable entry into Sonos' excellent whole home audio system. When the Sonos Beam soundbar appeared it wasn't the same kind of slam dunk, in part due to its relatively high price. Now, with the arrival of the Sonos Ray soundbar, the company finally has a One equivalent for its TV speakers. The Beam costs a lot more than the Ray, but it gives you Dolby Atmos, bigger sound and built-in voice control.
