Condo owners in St-Jerome are worried they'll lose everything after they say the builder cut corners, leaving them with massive repair bills. "It doesn't feel that good," said Claude Beauvais, one of the presidents of the condo association. He bought one of the 48 condos in the Laurentians two years ago. Last year, while doing work on the balconies at the three adjacent buildings, a contractor discovered major issues with water infiltration that was making them unsafe. "The fire department came here and at first told us to get out of the buildings in the next couple of hours," said Beauvais.
