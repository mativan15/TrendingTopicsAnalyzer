Two Canyon Country men were arrested on suspicion of being drunk in public, with one in possession of a leaded cane/baton, on Thursday night, according to Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station officials.   According to Deputy Natalie Arriaga, a spokeswoman for the SCV Sheriff's Station, deputies responded to a call for service in regards to a public fight on the 18500 block of Soledad Canyon Road. The call stated a Hispanic man was outside a business attempting to fight customers.   'Upon arrival, deputies observed two males with alcoholic beverages in hand, sitting on a bench in front of the business,' wrote Arriaga in an email to The Signal.
