Published: 17:46 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 17:55 EDT, 2 June 2022 Boxers have been told by a leading promoter that to appear on Sky Sports they must provide assurances they are not working with Probellum - a company that has been linked to Daniel Kinahan by one of the most prominent figures in US boxing.Sportsmail has seen a version of a letter sent to fighters by Boxxer - one of two promotional groups used by Sky - in which they are required to sign a document stating they are not working with Probellum or the recently-shuttered MTK Global due to 'adverse publicity' around claims made about their connections to Kinahan.
