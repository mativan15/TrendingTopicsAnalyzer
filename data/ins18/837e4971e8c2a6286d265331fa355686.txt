Brad Ashton of RSM UK, a tax firm, said people had been left 'between a rock and a hard place' and forced to accept costly charges for taxes that may not in fact be due. 
Payment demand letters from Parcelforce, part of the Royal Mail group, said customers must pay their invoices within 20 days before the parcels are returned to the sender. The firm said parcels will not be delivered otherwise, even if the customer believes the charges are incorrect. 
The letters state Parcelforce was 'unable to enter into disputes' into the charges 'raised on behalf of HM Revenue & Customs' and that any complaints should be made direct to the tax authority.
