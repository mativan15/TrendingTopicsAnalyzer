The future of a prominent stretch of road in front of Parliament Hill is being debated. Wellington Street remains closed since the convoy and some, including one city councillor, would like it to stay that way, while others argue it's another blow to local businesses. Only a handful of authorized vehicles, including tour buses, can drive down a half-kilometre stretch of Wellington Street, between Bank and Elgin streets. The prominent Canadian road, which offer a post-card perfect view of Parliament Hill, was blocked by trucks during February's 'Freedom Convoy' occupation, and then closed and barricaded, after police removed the trucks.
