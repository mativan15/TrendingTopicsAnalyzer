HARARE (Reuters) - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is planning a food relief programme targeting 700,000 people in Zimbabwe from October as the effects of a poor harvest and the Ukraine war continue to show, an official has said.

Zimbabwe's government is working with agencies to provide food aid for 3.8 million people, the WFP said.

The southern African country has been struggling to feed itself since 2000, when former leader Robert Mugabe championed the seizure of white-owned farms to resettle landless Black people.
