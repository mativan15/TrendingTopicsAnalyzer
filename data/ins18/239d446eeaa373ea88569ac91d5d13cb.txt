Where there was once a lorry park, there are now raised beds overspilling with alliums, tulips, and campanula. Office workers tilt their faces towards the sun, as they sip coffees on the deck and chat with their colleagues. A meeting is being held in the treehouse, as a loft of homing pigeons coo nearby.Although most buildings at the 6-acre south Berlin office campus Atelier Gardens are low-slung, from the higher ones you can see the tall grass and daisies in the disused Tempelhof Airfield.Host to organisations like the alternative business school Kaospilot and Extinction Rebellion, Atelier Gardens is a testing ground for many of the campus' changemaking tenants, and its natural elements echo their values.
