You could rightly say that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 2.10%)(BRK.B 2.12%) CEO Warren Buffett knows a thing or two about investing in the stock market.
Since becoming CEO in 1965, he's led Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an average annual return of 20.1% and created almost $690 billion in value for shareholders (himself included). On an aggregate basis, Buffett has overseen a greater than 3,600,000% increase in his company's share price in 57 years. Berkshire Hathaway's share price could plummet 99% tomorrow, and it would still be handily outperforming the S&P 500, including dividend payouts, since the beginning of 1965.
