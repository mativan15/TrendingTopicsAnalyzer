Images showing smoke billowing from a building have been shared in Facebook posts claiming the scenes depict Ethiopia's invasion of Shire, Tigray's largest city. This is false; while Tigrayan rebels said Ethiopian and Eritrean forces had captured Shire, the photos circulating online were taken in 2021 when a building caught alight in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.

A Facebook post published on October 17, 2022, includes a collage of photos showing a building on fire. One of the images shows the burning structure from a distance, while the other pictures are close-ups of the block engulfed in flames.
