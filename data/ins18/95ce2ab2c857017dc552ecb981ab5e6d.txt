Strictly Come Dancing star Matt Goss wiped away tears after becoming the third celebrity to be eliminated from the show following the dreaded dance-off.
The Bros frontman, who was partnered with Nadiya Bychkova, found himself in the dance-off with Kym Marsh and her pro partner Graziano Di Prima.
The two couples performed their routines again in a bid to impress the judges, with Matt and Nadiya taking on the Jive to Paul McCartney's All Shook Up, while Kym and Graziano performed their heir Samba to Volare by the Gipsy Kings.
