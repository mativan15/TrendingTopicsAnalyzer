AgenciesREPRESENTATIONAL IMAGEEven as investments in most sectors have remained below pre-Covid levels, it is the government that is the driving force behind India's road to full economic recovery with private investment gradually picking up. With the exception of mining, machinery, metals, and chemicals, investment in most sectors has remained below pre-Covid levels, as per CMIE. Investments in the manufacturing sector were 12.1% above pre-Covid levels led by machinery, metals and chemicals, Nirmal Bang wrote in a note on Friday.
