Whether you're a current employee or changing jobs, you may need to choose between pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions, and it may be trickier than you expect.Here's the difference: Pre-tax 401(k) deposits reduce your adjusted gross income, and the money grows tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay levies on withdrawals.
