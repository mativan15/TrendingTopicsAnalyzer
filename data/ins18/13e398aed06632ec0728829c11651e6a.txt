Netflix delivered a surprise to streaming industry watchers by adding 2.41 million paid subscribers in the third quarter, doubling its own growth projections. In July, the company said it expected to add just 1 million new subscribers.The Oct. 18 earnings report suggests Netflix has emerged from its recent struggles after two quarters of subscriber declines, and a steep drop in its stock price. The company now expects new subscriber growth to double again next quarter as it adds 4.5 million new subscribers by the end of the year, likely fueled by new sign-ups to Netflix's cheaper ad-supported tier.
