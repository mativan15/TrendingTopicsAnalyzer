Moscow is reportedly gearing up to blow up a major dam and blame Ukraine for the attack in a move that would flood the entire Black Sea port city of Kherson. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, has warned that the incident could cause mass deaths and destruction in Kherson, where Russia reportedly wants to withdraw its troops from as it is struggling to resupply its soldiers. But Kyiv is aware of Russia's plan, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling for an international observation mission to prevent a potential catastrophe at the dam's hydroelectric plant.
