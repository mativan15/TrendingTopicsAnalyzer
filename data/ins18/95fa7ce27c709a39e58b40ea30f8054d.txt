Imagine, then, what a defiant act it would be to publish a cookbook such as "Black Power Kitchen" in this moment. A collaboration between the Ghetto Gastro, a collective founded by Pierre Serrao, Jon Gray and Lester Walker, from the Bronx, and the writer Osayi Endolyn, it is a blatantly political project. Note its design by New Studio: the cover and graphics that hark back to Black Panther Party posters from the 1960s and the album covers they inspired in the rap and hip-hop community 20 years later.
