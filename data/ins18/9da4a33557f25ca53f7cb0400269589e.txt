ROCKFORD, Ill. — Illinois residents are eligible to receive part of a $100 million class-action settlement after Google was accused of violating privacy laws in the state.

The tech giant was accused of violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act regarding its use of a face regrouping tool in the Google Photos app.

Google used the tool to sort faces it spots in photographs by similarity.
