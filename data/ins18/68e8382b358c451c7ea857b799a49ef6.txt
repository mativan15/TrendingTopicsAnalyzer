A day after the University of Tennessee's biggest football victory in decades, the school was being roasted online for asking fans to crowdfund the replacement of two goalposts that were torn down in the post-game celebration. On Saturday, the unbeaten Volunteers upset Alabama, 52-49, on a last-second field goal. That snapped a 15-game losing streak to Alabama, and vaulted Tennessee to No. 3 in the Associated Press poll, its highest ranking since 2005. After the game, fans swarmed the field, and the goalposts were toppled (a dangerous act in itself) and carried out of the stadium.
