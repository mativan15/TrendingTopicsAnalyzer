India slammed OIC-IPHRC (Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission) for its comments on the sentencing of Yasin Malik in terror-funding case. Speaking on the matter, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, "India finds unacceptable the comments made by OIC-IPHRC today criticising India for the judgement in the case of Yasin Malik."

"Through these comments, OIC-IPHRC has implicitly expressed support for the terrorist activities of Yasin Malik, which were documented and presented in the court," he said.
