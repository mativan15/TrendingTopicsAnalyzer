The Trinamool Congress leadership in West Bengal has criticised the Centre for what it claims is the government's failure to protect Kashmiri pandits, and raised concern over the safety and security of the people living in the valley. 'How many pandits have been murdered and why are they protesting in front of BJP office or on the roads?' TMC's national spokesperson Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said on Friday. 'Those who revoked Article 370 and claimed that absolute peace will prevail in the valley, and all the pandits will be rehabilitated in Kashmir again, now must answer the questions--where is the safety and security in Kashmir? Why are the pandits or the people who want to be in the mainstream, not safe there?' 
The situation is likely to affect tourism and people will prefer to choose alternative destinations for travel, Debjit Dutta, chapter chairman at Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), said.
