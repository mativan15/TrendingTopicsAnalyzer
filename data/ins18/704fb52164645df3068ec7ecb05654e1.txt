Six firms were among those that made moves to establish themselves in Orlando so far this year.

Those that entered the area included plans for new U.S. headquarters, an expanded office or a relocation. The changes come with dozens of jobs and can often include investment into thousands of square feet of building space.

Why this matters: Office relocations can bring new jobs and can sometimes draw companies to locate with others in the same industry. That can create more business opportunity and draw other investment in the future.
