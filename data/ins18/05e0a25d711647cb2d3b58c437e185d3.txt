Roman Abramovich has completed the $5.3 billion sale of Chelsea Football Club nearly three months after the Russian oligarch was hit by Western sanctions.
The club said in a statement on Monday that the group led by LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly and investment company Clearlake Capital Group had taken on ownership of the Premier League soccer team.
Clearlake and Boehly, who will be chairman of the holding firm, will have joint control and leadership of the club, Chelsea FC said.
Abramovich announced he was selling Chelsea FC on March 2 after 19 years of ownership.
