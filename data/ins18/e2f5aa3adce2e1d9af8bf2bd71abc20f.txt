 Equity benchmark indices managed to end in the positive territory after facing volatility in the latter part of the trade on Friday amid gains in Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turning net buyers in the market on Thursday after many sessions also added to the momentum. The 30-share BSE Sensex ended 104.25 points or 0.18% higher at 59,307.15, logging its sixth day of gains. During the day, it jumped 388.
