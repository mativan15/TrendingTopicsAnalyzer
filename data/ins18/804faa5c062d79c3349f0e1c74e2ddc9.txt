Workers at London's biggest bus operator, Go-Ahead, have secured a 10.5% pay deal, heading off the threat of more industrial action in the capital.About 7,700 bus staff, both drivers and engineers, will benefit from the increase, which is slightly ahead of current CPI inflation.The agreement comes as approximately 600 Arriva drivers in Kent have also suspended strikes planned for later this week, while voting on an improved offer.Bus drivers around the country have called a series of strikes this year, demanding pay rises in line with rampant inflation after working in difficult conditions during the coronavirus pandemic.
