There can be another day of commuter chaos as protesters of "Just Stop Oil" are still blocking the Dartford Crossing. After two climbers from the group climbed "The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge", that connects Kent with Essex, it was closed. The demands of the two climbers from the government include halting the 'licences and consents' for all new oil and gas. According to National Highways, the closure of the major road bridge on Monday caused a two-hour delay during rush hours. On the anti-clockwise carriageway, there were six miles of congestion, and in the opposite direction, it was five miles long.
