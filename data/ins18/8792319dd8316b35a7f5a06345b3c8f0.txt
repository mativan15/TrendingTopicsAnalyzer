OPINION: The nonprofit money-in-politics tracker OpenSecrets just reported 'Democratic mega-donor George Soros is currently the top individual super PAC donor for the 2022 midterm election.' This is not the least bit surprising. Democrats can't win on ideas. So they turn to their cash cows for support.  George Soros regularly interferes in elections in which he has no personal stake. This is the real tragedy of America's electoral system: very often, races go to the highest bidder — and too often those highest bidders are far-leftists with beaucoup money bent on destroying American exceptionalism.
