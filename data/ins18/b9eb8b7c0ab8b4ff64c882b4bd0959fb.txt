Alena Kravchenko/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reported strong advertising growth numbers in the recent quarter with quarterly revenue of $55 billion and YoY growth of 23% in this business. However, it is also facing tough competition due to the rise of Amazon (AMZN) in the digital advertising industry.
