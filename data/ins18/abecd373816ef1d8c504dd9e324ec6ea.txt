Jun. 4—JOHNSTOWN, Pa. — Dominick Iannello was born with a rare form of leukemia. His treatment lasted one year and he was been in remission for nine years.

The 10-year-old boy was out in front of more than 100 walkers on Saturday taking part in the Johnstown Walk of Hope held at Trojan Stadium. The event raises money for local cancer patients and their families.

This year's event was special for Dominick, his mother, Crystal Mitchell, said.

"He had a heart transplant last year," she said. "When he got out of the hospital right after his transplant, we came down during the walk and he only made it part way.
