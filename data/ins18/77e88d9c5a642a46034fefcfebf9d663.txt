Microsoft Corp. isn't the only U.S. company pointing to the dollar's surge as a potential problem.A strong dollar has been a hot topic this week since the software giant MSFT, -1.66% and Salesforce Inc. CRM, -1.85% pointed to challenges the currency is causing for earnings. It's been flagged in other industries too, including by Pfizer Inc., PFE, +0.99% eBay Inc., EBAY, -1.42% and MasterCard MA, -1.45% since foreign sales can be hurt by a strong greenback. 'The strengthening dollar has been a story for awhile,' said Dec Mullarkey, SLC Management's managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation, pointing to the dollar's DXY recent climb to nearly a 20 year high, as measured against a basket of rival currencies.
