WASHINGTON —

Four months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, the future of abortion rights is still uncertain.

States around the country have moved to expand and contract access to the medical procedure, leaving behind a web of mismatched laws for women to navigate.

On Tuesday, as abortion foes continued to push for a national ban, President Biden vowed to use federal law to protect abortion rights. The president asked voters to help his party hold onto the House of Representatives and send two additional Democratic senators to Washington so they can vote to change the chamber's rules, circumvent a GOP filibuster and ensure federal protection for abortion access.
