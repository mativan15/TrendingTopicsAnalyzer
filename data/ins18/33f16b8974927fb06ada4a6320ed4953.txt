Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has been told that his 'unacceptable behaviour' that saw him get sent off in his side's 1-0 win over Manchester City could warrant a 10-match suspension. The German coach berated the assistant referee as a foul was not awarded for Bernardo Silva's challenge on Mohamed Salah, though he is set to be in the dugout on Wednesday for the visit of West Ham.Klopp has been charged by the Football Association with a breach of FA rule E3, which covers "comments which are improper, which bring the game into disrepute, which are threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting".
