Age Hammeken Danielsen has hunted narwhals since he was a child. He and his father would travel along Greenland's fjords on a small motorboat, armed with rifles and harpoons and dressed in polar-bear fur trousers and sealskin boots to insulate them against the freezing weather.Danielsen, now 33, is a licensed hunter in Ittoqqortoormiit, a remote settlement of 345 people in east Greenland. Narwhals are his main source of income. Known as 'the unicorns of the sea' for their long spiralled tusks, they are a Greenlandic delicacy.
