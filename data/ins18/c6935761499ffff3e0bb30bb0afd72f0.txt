When Dachel Caballero headed to an appointment at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Miramar earlier this week, the 30-year-old Cuban man thought he'd go back home to his wife and newborn child.

But once inside, Caballero knew something was wrong when officials stripped him of his belongings. He was then taken to Broward Transitional Center, a detention facility for immigrants in Pompano Beach.

Caballero is one of several Cubans who were detained under former President Donald Trump — and who now face the likely prospect of being sent to Cuba, as the Biden administration appears to be weighing resuming deportation flights to curb a mass exodus from the island.
