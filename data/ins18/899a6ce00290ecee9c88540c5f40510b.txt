Ross KaminskyOct 19, 2022Ted Trimpa is an attorney and a Democratic strategist who had a lot to do with turning Colorado blue, electing Jared Polis as governor, and so on. Unlike many activist Democrats whom I view as frequently opposing fundamental American values, I think Ted is a rational guy working for the wrong political team. He's not (in my opinion) a Bernie Sanders nutjob although he's also definitely a liberal, maybe even a "progressive." He's at least an honest one. He has a better take on what's REALLY going on in Colorado politics than most people and I'm looking forward to hearing his take.
