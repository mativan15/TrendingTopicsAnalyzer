Collider.com The Vampire Chronicles' Lestat de Lioncourt is a tragic and misunderstood character in literature. Throughout media, we've seen him as jealous, sadistic, and disobedient at best. In the film adaptations, Lestat is either shown as a selfish antihero or the antagonist unfairly. To truly understand Lestat's motives, one cannot watch big-screen adaptations alone because his movie, which would give background to his actions, has never been made. It's a shame because his backstory, as presented in The Vampire Lestat, justifies many of the actions in his wholly unholy existence.
