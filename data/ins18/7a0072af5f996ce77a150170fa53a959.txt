A Russian warplane crashed Monday in a residential area in the port of Yeysk on the Sea of Azov after suffering engine failure on Monday, the military said. A Su-34 bomber came down after one of its engines caught fire during takeoff, the Russian Defense Ministry said.
 It said that both crewmembers bailed out safely, but the plane crashed into a residential area, causing a fire as tons of fuel exploded on impact. Regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev said that emergency services were working to put out the fire.
