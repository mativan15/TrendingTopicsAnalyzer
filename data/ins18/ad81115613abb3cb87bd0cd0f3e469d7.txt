Just call him jolly old St. Dick.
Dick Van Dyke was spotted last Friday handing out money to homeless out people looking for a job at the Malibu Community Labor Exchange. 
The 96-year-old 'Mary Poppins' star is allegedly a massive giver of the nonprofit and frequently returns to the spot to help those who are looking to find employment. 
Dressed in a long-sleeved white, grey sweatpants and black slip on shoes, Van Dyke was handing out $5 bills as well as chatting with those who came to seek help.
