India's manufacturing sector growth steadied in May, as international orders increased at the fastest pace in more than 11 years despite higher selling prices and business sentiment being dampened by inflation concerns, a private survey showed on Wednesday. The S&P Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 54.6 in May, a tad lower than the previous month's reading of 54.7. New orders and production continued to rise at the pace registered in April.

A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below it suggests contraction in activity.
