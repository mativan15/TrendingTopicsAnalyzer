The Ramaz School of New York City brought its entire high school student body of over 400 Jewish adolescents to Israel for a week-long trip to discover the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people.

'This trip was a great opportunity for teachers to share their love of Israel with kids in a really tangible way,' said David Deutsch, Ramaz History Teacher. 'I thought it was particularly meaningful to model for kids that love of Israel can exist side by side with criticism.'

The Birthright-style trip saw the Jewish-American students visit iconic sights all across Israel, such as Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv, Netanya, Tiberias, and Tzfat.
