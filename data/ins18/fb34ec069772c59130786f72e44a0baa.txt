(Reuters) - A San Francisco federal judge has removed one of his law clerks from a patent dispute between Google LLC and Sonos Inc after Sonos raised concerns about the clerk's ties to the tech giant, according to a Wednesday notice.U.S. District Judge William Alsup recently told the parties that the unnamed clerk had worked for Google years ago and still owned Google stock, which he had placed in a blind trust. He rejected Sonos' request for more information.Sonos said last week it believed the clerk had also worked for the law firm that represents Google, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, while the dispute was pending.
