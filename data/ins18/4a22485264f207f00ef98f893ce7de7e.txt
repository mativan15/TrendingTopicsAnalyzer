Molly-Mae Hague has fans obsessing with the newest update to her home, after sharing her renovation journey on Instagram.
The 23-year-old, who recently announced she is expecting her first child, a baby girl, with Tommy Fury, also 23, paid a nod to her Love Island journey with neon wall lights reading a special quote.
For those who may not remember, Molly-Mae told Tommy just before leaving the villa: ‘I can't wait for the adventures that we haven't even dreamed of yet.'
The quote then resurfaced when the pair made their pregnancy announcement (and basically broke the internet while doing so).
