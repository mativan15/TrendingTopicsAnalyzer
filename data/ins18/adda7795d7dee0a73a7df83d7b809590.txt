Luke Rockholdcan feel proud about his last fight at UFC 278, even it wasn't exactly how he wanted to go out.

Rockhold, a former UFC middleweight champion, lost a bloody war to Paulo Costa, who claimed a unanimous decision win this past August in Salt Lake City. Afterward, an emotional Rockhold signaled it would be his final fight, although he never used the word 'retirement.' Since then, Rockhold has backtracked and remains open to competing in MMA or another combat sport.

In his first fight in three years, Rockhold showed a lot of heart and resilience against Costa – and gave us a memorable blood-thirsty moment – which was set off by the fact that he broke his nose 'on the first punch of the fight.
