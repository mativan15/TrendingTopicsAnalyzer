Jaeson Cardiff never meant to get into the business of making soap.
He was actually working as a plumber when, in the depths of an inner-city condo's utility room, he started developing an idea to help the environment.'We're trying to convert emissions into useable goods and have those goods sold on the open market,' said Cardiff.He's now the co-founder of CarbinX, a cleantech company in Calgary that has developed a technology to capture carbon monoxide from natural gas appliances, like furnaces and boilers.
