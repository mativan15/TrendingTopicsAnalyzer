With the Federal Reserve set to begin letting bonds mature off its $9 trillion balance sheet, the key metric to watch will be whether Treasury volatility picks up as a result in a market already suffering bouts of low liquidity.The Fed's so-called quantitative tightening (QT) could also send yields higher, though analysts say this will depend on the direction of the economy, among other factors.The Fed will let bonds mature off its balance sheet without replacement starting June 1 as it attempts to normalize policy and bring down soaring inflation.
