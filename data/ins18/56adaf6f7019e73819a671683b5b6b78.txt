A Victoria-based fitness centre is throwing its support behind Tour De Rock, offering up free classes this weekend to raise money that will help children in their fight against cancer. Cycle Beat Club, an indoor cycling club on Johnson Street, is offering two free classes on Sunday morning, with a minimum donation of $15 for Tour De Rock. "Thirty dollars or more and their name will get put into a draw," said Cycle Beat Club owner, Sally Larrington-Brown. "I'm hoping that we can raise at least a couple thousand dollars.
