The MSCI Semiconductor Index , a benchmark for chip stocks that's down by 43% this year, reflects the wider market's sentiment toward a potential slowdown in economic growth. In such an environment, some investors have begun to ask whether it might be prudent to dump chip stocks in favor of companies in other outperforming sectors. Speaking to CNBC "Pro Talks," Foord Asset Management's Brian Arcese said despite the negative returns this year, it was better to stay invested in select companies than walk away from the sector.
