Holidaymakers want to experience ‘complete culture shock' in 2023, new research suggests.

58 per cent of travellers want to get ‘out of their comfort zone ' next year, according to a Booking.com poll of more than 24,000 people.

Tourists will prioritise far-flung, adventurous trips - with 40 per cent of respondents expressing a desire for ‘complete culture shock.'

Nearly half (47 per cent) of travellers will seek out a destination with completely different cultural experiences and languages to their home country, while a quarter (24 per cent) want to visit lesser-known cities off the beaten track.
