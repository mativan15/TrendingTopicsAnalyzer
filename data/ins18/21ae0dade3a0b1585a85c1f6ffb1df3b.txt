NORTH PORT -- It was in the works before Ian, but it certainly comes in handy now. Governor Ron DeSantis visited Toledo Blade Elementary during its first day of class since Hurricane Ian, to announce that the "A" school is getting $142,000. It's one of 96 schools in five counties that took the worst from the storm that are getting money for getting an A or improving a letter grade from year to year. "Now that you're dealing with what we're dealing with, this may come in handy," the governor said.
