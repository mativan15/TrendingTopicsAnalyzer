AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Friday sought to know from the BJP why his offer to provide free electricity to the people of Gujarat was 'troubling' the saffron party even as he claimed that the ministers in the western state were enjoying free power supply.
Hitting out at C R Patil, the BJP's chief in Gujarat, for allegedly taking potshots over freebies being offered by 'some leaders' in the state, the Delhi chief minister said in order to provide free electricity, corruption has to be ended.
