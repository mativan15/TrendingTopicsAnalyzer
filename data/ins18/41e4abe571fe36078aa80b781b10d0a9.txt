You're feeling a stronger sense of belonging this month and your Aries June 2022 horoscope proves it! After all, Mercury retrograde comes to an end on June 3, giving you a better understanding of the type of foundation you're trying to build. As Mercury stations direct in your second house of cash flow, you may feel ready to start setting financial goals and building toward a standard you've set for yourself.

However, by June 11, you may experience some financial turbulence as Venus joins forces with Uranus in your money-making second house.
