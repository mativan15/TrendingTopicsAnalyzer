The Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) business model continues to grow in popularity, and for good reason. Fundamentally, it's the same as a traditional eCommerce business. But, instead of your having to fulfill orders one by one, Amazon stores your products for you and even picks, packs, and ships them out to customers.

With private labeling, you also have the opportunity to build your own brand and website, thereby increasing the value of your business.
