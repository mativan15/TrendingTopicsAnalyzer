A nine-foot statue of Emmett Till, the Black teen kidnapped and killed for whistling at a white woman in 1955, was set to be unveiled Friday in a Mississippi park located just a short drive from an elaborate monument to the Confederacy.

The massive bronze rendering, a jovial depiction of Till in slacks, a dress shirt and a tie with one hand on the brim of his hat, is at the heart of Rail Spike Park in Greenwood. The area will be called Emmett Till Square at Rail Spike Park. It will be just a few miles away from the Leflore County Courthouse, which is also the site of a monument featuring a group of Confederate soldiers.
