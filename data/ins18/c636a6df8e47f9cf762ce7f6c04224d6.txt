ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I'm Alison Beard.
The U.S. is a nation of immigrants. Immigration is part of our melting pot mythology. Historically, it's helped to create the workforces that built our infrastructure and businesses. It's also given us science and tech innovators, from Albert Einstein to Sergey Brin. But immigration is a hot button issue nowadays, not just in the US, but in lots of developed countries. Who's trying to come in and why? Who succeeds? How do immigrants affect cultures and economies? Are they a blessing or a burden?
Our guests today have been investigating these issues for more than two decades.
