Published: 11:59 EDT, 29 May 2022 | Updated: 12:04 EDT, 29 May 2022 Staten Island business owners have seen a surge in interest thanks to Kim Kardashian's low key visits with her local-boy boyfriend Pete Davidson.While they may have hoped to keep a low profile with their unglamorous outings, their dates to pizzerias and movie theaters have driven an influx of celebrity tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of them, sit where they sat and eat what they ate since going public last year. There are now lines out the door at Campania, the Italian restaurant where the pair shared a pizza, salad and jug of sangria in October, and the local movie theater which they visited in December has been booked out in her honor.
