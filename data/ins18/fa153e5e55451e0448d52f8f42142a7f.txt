Discussing Schickerling's non-selection, Jones said: "It's a tricky one, mate. We obviously selected him [for Australia and the Barbarians] because we got the all clear that he was eligible, but there's been some discussion, so we've asked World Rugby to clarify. It wouldn't be fair to select him until we've got clarification from World Rugby.
