Xinhua | Updated: 2022-10-21 09:22 Share - WeChat TOKYO -- The Japanese yen dropped past the psychologically important 150 level versus the US dollar on Thursday, marking the first time the currency has dropped to this level since 1990.
Market analysts here said the US dollar was bought on continued speculation the US Federal Reserve will forge ahead with its aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle soaring inflation in the country, which sent long-term US 10-year Treasury yields surging.
The Fed's continued aggressive monetary tightening policy, in stark contrast to the Bank of Japan's commitment to its ultra-loose policy, has seen a widening interest rate gap between the two countries and is catalyzing yen selling, they explained.
