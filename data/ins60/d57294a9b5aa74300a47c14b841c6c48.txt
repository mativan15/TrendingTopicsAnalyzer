UFC welterweight Jack Della Maddalena is not interested in cherry-picking any of his fights.
The former Eternal MMA champion has finished all but one of his professional wins and is eager to take on the division's best. The likes of rising stars Sean O'Malley and Paddy Pimblett haven't been initially keen on fighting ranked opposition without a pay raise, and while Maddalena (11-2 MMA, 1-0 UFC) understands that approach, he doesn't apply it to himself.
'It makes sense,' Maddalena told MMA Junkie.
