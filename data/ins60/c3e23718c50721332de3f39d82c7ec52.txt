The Cowboys extended Michael Gallup this offseason after moving on from Cooper. Cooper's 2022 fate was sealed when the ink dried on his 2020 contract, with the way the deal was structured he was destined to be moved on from after two seasons.

It was written, literally.

Gallup basically costs half of what Cooper would have, and his deal can be escaped from anytime after 2023.
