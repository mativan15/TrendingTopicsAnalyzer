FIRST ON FOX: A former Keystone XL pipeline welder sharply criticized President Biden after the White House announced new measures intended to drive gasoline and energy prices down on Wednesday. "I don't know how he gets away with keep saying that he doesn't have anything to do with [high gas prices] when they've got everything to do with it," Neal Crabtree told FOX Business in an interview.Crabtree — a member of an Arkansas pipeliners union who had worked on the Keystone XL project in Nebraska — and hundreds other workers were laid off hours after the president took office on Jan.
