Democrat Maura Healey plans to fill in the 'yes' bubble on a pair of ballot questions dealing with taxes and immigration, while Republican Geoff Diehl will select 'no' on the two measures whose fates will be decided by voters on the same day they pick the first new governor in eight years.

The gubernatorial candidates met Thursday for their second and final debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election, sparring over how to blunt the sting of rising energy costs and prepare for a possible COVID-19 surge, and debating just how much power a governor has when Democrats in the Legislature have veto-proof majorities.
