Perhaps the only idiom that has remained true in every Israeli election is that Israeli voters love IDF generals.

In nearly every election, another general announces his or her candidacy. Fourteen out of the 21 retired chiefs of staff entered politics, as did 28 major-generals, 11 brigadier-generals and 16 colonels.

To this day, parties seek out security experts to run on their lists – and the higher the rank, the better.

It began with the likes of Moshe Dayan and Yigal Alon, continued with Yitzhak Rabin, Shaul Mofaz and Ehud Barak, and came to a height in 2019 with Blue and White's 'Party of Generals,' including Moshe 'Bogie' Ya'alon, Gabi Ashkenazi and current Defense Minister Benny Gantz.
