The attic in my grandmother's house was where she kept all the kindling for the kitchen fire. This is where I first came across B.M. Zuhara. Alongside bundles of dry branches, there were stacks of old Vanitha magazines, their crisp pages perfect for starting a fire on a cold rainy day. Nestling between advice columns and fruit salad recipes were the chapters of Mozhi, a novel about a Muslim woman who has been divorced by triple talaq. First published as a serial in the monthly magazine, Mozhi was the second of Zuhara's books, many of which were set in the milieu of wealthy Malabar Muslim households, with female protagonists who keenly felt the indignities of their golden cages.
