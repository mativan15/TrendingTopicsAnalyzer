I had a wide-ranging and occasionally raucous conversation with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon last night at the Fortune Global Forum dinner in New York. I asked him to elaborate on his recently cited views on the economic outlook. His answer: 'It's not about predictions—it's about probabilities and the range of possible outcomes. Right now, I think there's about a 5% chance of a soft landing. I think there's maybe about a 30% chance of a mild recession, and maybe a 30% chance of a harder recession—think a possibility of 6% unemployment.
