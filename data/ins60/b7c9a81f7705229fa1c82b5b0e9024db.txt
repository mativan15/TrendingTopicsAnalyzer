Business is blooming at Flowers of Worth.

The floral boutique, at 205 Worth Ave., has been in an island fixture for 50 years, with three owners over the decades. Eight years ago, Faith Murray saw an ad that the business was for sale and bought it.

'When I came to Palm Beach it was like coming home. Worth Avenue is such a heavenly place,' Murray said. 'The shop is a family affair. We live and work on the island.'

Murray runs the day-to-day operations with her daughter Devin. When other daughter Erinn, who lives in Vienna, comes home for a visit, she too works in the shop.
