The global chip shortage that bogged down the auto industry for almost two years is showing signs of easing, at least for now, claims a report by Bloomberg. The report claims that automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW are among the carmakers that are getting enough high-tech components to produce at full capacity after experiencing crippling outages for several months.
