Oct. 15—LARAMIE — There's a lot of positives to build upon after the Laramie High football team put together one of its better road games in recent memory Friday night in Rock Springs.

In the end, the scoreboard was in favor of the Tigers 35-13. But the Plainsmen showed flashes of how they are improving, especially in the first half, down just 14-7 at halftime.

"This was a really big step for our program, most notably with our issues all year of playing on the road," second-year LHS coach Paul Ronga said during a KOWB 1290 AM postgame show.
