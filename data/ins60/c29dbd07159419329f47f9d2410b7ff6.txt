The U.S. has raised concerns with Saudi Arabia about an American citizen whom the kingdom sentenced to 16 years in prison for posting tweets critical of the Saudi government.

'We have consistently and intensively raised our concerns regarding the case at senior levels of the Saudi government,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. 'The Saudi government understands the priority we attach to resolving this matter.'

The State Department on Tuesday confirmed the man, Saad Ibrahim Almadi, remains in detention.
