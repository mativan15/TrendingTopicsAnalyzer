Britain has ordered farmers to enact measures to curb bird flu cases, as the virus spreads in other parts of the world from Europe to the US.

The UK government on Monday declared a prevention zone that requires farmers to take necessary steps like keeping free-range birds within fenced areas. The move follows a decision to raise the risk level for avian influenza in wild birds from medium to high, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.
