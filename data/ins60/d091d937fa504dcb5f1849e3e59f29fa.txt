Robbie Anderson just wants to help the Carolina Panthers win. But he can't do that if he's not on the field.

The seventh-year wideout, who got into a shouting match with receivers coach Joe Dailey and was eventually sent to the locker room by interim head coach Steve Wilks on Sunday, made that argument following the team's 24-10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. When asked why he was so openly frustrated during the Week 6 outing, Anderson said he wasn't expecting to be taken out on third down attempts.
