NEW DELHI: Cigarettes-to-hotels major is expected to announce its September quarter results after market hours today. While the revenue is expected to increase 17.2% year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 15,884 crore in Q2, the FMCG major's profit after tax (PAT) is likely to edge higher by 16.7% to Rs 4,315 crore, shows an ET Now poll of brokerages. Amid continued pressure on input costs, the margins are likely to decline to 34.5% from 38.5%. The revenue growth is expected to be led by continued growth in cigarette volumes and steady performance across businesses.
