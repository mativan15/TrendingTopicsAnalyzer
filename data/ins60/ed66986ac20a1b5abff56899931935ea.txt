Getty Images Thesis Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 quarter was not that bad, but the bank disappoints against expectations and peer JPMorgan (JPM). Revenues missed expectations by about $327.80 million and decreased by almost 14% year over year. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan beat expectations and grew revenues by about 10% year over year. The trading day following the Q3 results, Morgan Stanley stock lost as much as 5%, while JPM stock was up 1%. I still believe Morgan Stanley is a long-term winning bank. But, if you can buy JPM and MS at competitive valuation (in fact MS stock is slightly more expensive), then I just think it makes perfect sense to underweight Morgan Stanley.
