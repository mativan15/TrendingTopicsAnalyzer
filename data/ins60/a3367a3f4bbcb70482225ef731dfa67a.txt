onurdongel On Wednesday, October 19, 2022, midstream giant Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) announced its third quarter 2022 earnings results. The company's stock has certainly been on something of a wild ride for the past two years, as it fell victim to the crash in everything energy-related back in 2020, but has since rebounded. The market appears to have been quite disappointed with these latest results, though, as the stock plummeted in after-hours trading alongside the earnings announcement. This is likely because Kinder Morgan posted an earnings miss, although it did beat analysts' revenue estimates and showed substantial year-over-year growth.
