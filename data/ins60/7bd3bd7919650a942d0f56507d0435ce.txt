A Hong Kong outdoor cinema operator cancelled the screening of a Batman film, citing concerns from the government that the movie was too violent. The showing of the 2008 movie The Dark Knight set for Oct. 27 at the open-air Grounds venue was called off 'based on direction from the HK Government Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration,' according to a notice that organizers sent to ticket holders on Thursday. Iron Man will be shown instead and refunds were available.  The Hong Kong government recommended that the screening be scrapped because 'for an outdoor screening, the level of violence was not appropriate,' according to an emailed statement from the organizer, Hong Kong-based Greater Bay Media Entertainment Ltd.
