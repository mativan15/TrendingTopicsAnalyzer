Updated: 03 Jun 2022, 10:36 AM ISTDefined under Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, any immovable property can be transferred through a gift deed. Similar to a sale deed except that no money is paid in the transfer of the property, a gift deed too has to be registered with the sub-registrar office under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, and as per section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. Failing to do this, would render the contract invalid.The person giving the gift is known as the donor and the one receiving the gift is known as the donee.
