So what can you do in the metaverse today? Indian platform Loka lets users take a virtual tour of Connaught Place in Delhi. Another platform, Zippy, lets users 'run' the Boston marathon from wherever they are. Platforms like AjnaLens and Imaginate are working with Indian multinationals to offer simulated training on a factory floor or a deep-sea drilling rig.
