The return comes in the form of share buybacks to the tune of $350m and is just one manifestation of the solid progress Genworth has made over the last several years to secure the future for its shareholders. Going forward, Genworth owners are now positioned to become the primary beneficiary of the company's cash flows, a delightful outcome given the tumultuous road of yesteryear.
