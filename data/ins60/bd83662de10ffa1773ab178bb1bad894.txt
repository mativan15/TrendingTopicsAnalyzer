Steven Gerrard will have endured an awkward journey back to the Midlands after Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat at Fulham on Thursday night. Villa sacked the 42-year-old just one hour after the fatal loss in the capital, leaving him in an uncomfortable situation while still at Craven Cottage.Harrison Reed, Aleksandar Mitrovic and a Tyrone Mings own goal propelled Fulham up to ninth in the Premier League. At the same time, it dropped Villa down to 17th after just two wins in their opening 11 games this season - enough for the club's owners to call time on Gerrard's tenure.
