Zimbabwe's biggest platinum project, struggling to get off the ground for the past two years, has a new challenge. A major stake held by a Russian tycoon is scaring off potential financiers for the $3bn (R46bn) mine, people with knowledge of the matter said.Initial development work on the Darwendale deposit began in early 2020, but operations at the project were soon halted because of a lack of capital and the site has been abandoned since early last year, according to a report by Zimbabwe's Centre for Natural Resource Governance.
