UFC star Conor McGregor is primed to make his return to the mixed martial arts (MMA) circuit after nearly spending one year on the sidelines.
However, his boxing career is not over by any means necessary as he told Sky Sports News while in attendance at the Monaco Grand Prix this past weekend.
'Boxing is my first love in combat sports. I had such a great time the last time I was out there. Obviously, my return will be in the Octagon for UFC--that story is far from over, in fact it's just being written, it is just the beginning,' said McGregor.
