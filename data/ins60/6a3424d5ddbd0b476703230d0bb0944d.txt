Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Tuesday said the bank was pivoting away from its previous strategy of building a full-scale digital bank with Marcus.
During an hour-plus long conference call, Solomon was forced to admit missteps as analysts, one after another, peppered him with critical questions.
Even one of the bank's successes — winning the Apple Card account in 2019— has proven less profitable than Goldman executives expected.
