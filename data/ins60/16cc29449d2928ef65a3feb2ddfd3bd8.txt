The Indianapolis Colts are making a change in the quarterback room, promoting third-stringer Sam Ehlinger to the backup role behind veteran starter Matt Ryan, per Mike Chappell of Fox59.
Despite the addition of veteran Nick Foles this offseason, head coach Frank Reich and general manager Chris Ballard are rolling with Ehlinger as the backup quarterback, which was his role for the majority of the 2021 season behind Carson Wentz.

Chappell reported that this change in the room isn't a direct indictment on Ryan's status as the starter.
