When Gangs of London debuted it broke records for having the highest body count and being the most violent show on British TV. 
The first season of the Sky Atlantic drama followed the collapse of underground criminal organisation and family empire the Wallace Group, with new gangsters The Investors taking charge of London.
As Sean Wallace (Joe Cole) sought to avenge his father Finn's (Colm Meaney), there were co-ordinated violent attacks on a traveller's settlement and a safe house in the coutryside, to name but a few.
