Leonardo DiCaprio is heading to a money laundering trial as a witness.  The "Shutter Island" actor will be among 72 witnesses prepped for former Fugees member Prakazrel "Pras" Michel's case.  In 2019, one of the founding members of the 1990s hip-hop group Michel, was charged in a campaign finance conspiracy that took place during the 2012 presidential election, the Justice Department confirmed then. A four-count indictment accused Michel of conspiring with fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, usually known as Jho Low, to make and conceal foreign campaign contributions.
