English French OTTAWA, June 03, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today's decision by Fisheries Minister Joyce Murray to continue overfishing capelin, a critically depleted forage fish in northeastern Newfoundland (NAFO Area 2J3KL), fails to follow Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)'s own policies and puts at risk wild fisheries and the communities that rely upon them. Oceana Canada has been calling on Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to close the fishery to protect the stock, which has been critically depleted and overfished for more than 30 years.
