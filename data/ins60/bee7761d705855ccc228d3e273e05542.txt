Published: 14:46 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 14:51 EDT, 21 October 2022 Reece James admitted he has been told by a surgeon he could be out for two months with the knee injury he suffered against AC Milan earlier in October. The England right-back had been in line for a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the World Cup in Qatar in November, but the damage to his knee could put an end to his bid to make the final 26-man squad. The 22-year-old Chelsea defender had been handed starts in both of England's last two games by manager Gareth Southgate in an apparent show of faith ahead of the tournament, and now looks set to miss out entirely.
