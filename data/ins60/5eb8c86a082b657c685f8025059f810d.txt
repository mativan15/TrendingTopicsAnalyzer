Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Jefferies has downgraded advertising technology firm PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM) to Hold from Buy, in more fallout from the macroeconomic-worry storm set off by Snap's stock-crushing warning on guidance. Macro indicators are "deteriorating at a faster pace," analyst Brent Thill says, with more cautious spending patterns as the upshot (and getting worse as an economic slowdown deepens). While that pain will be widespread, hitting big spaces like e-commerce: "For businesses, one of the first things to get cut is advertising spend, which can happen very quickly," Thill says.
