The Washington Commanders released their first injury report Wednesday ahead of the Week 7 matchup against the Green Bay Packers.
Quarterback Carson Wentz highlighted Washington's absences and the Commanders have yet to decide if they are going to place him on injured reserve. Wentz fractured the ring finger on his throwing hand in last week's win over Chicago Bears.
