Police sources say criminals were able to buy over $3,000 worth of luxury glasses from a store in the South Hills Village Mall as part of a sophisticated scheme involving a victim in Alabama.

Our sources tell Channel 11 that two men were seen on surveillance video May 25 at an eyeglass store, buying Cartier glasses with a credit card they manufactured with someone else's stolen credit card number. The card was even able to swipe.

We're told the suspects also used a fake ID with a name that matched the name on the fake credit card, so a clerk would have never known anything was wrong.
