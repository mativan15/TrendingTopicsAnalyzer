The Arizona Cardinals released their second injury report of Week 7 Tuesday as they prepare to face the New Orleans Saints Thursday night. After only an estimated injury report Monday, Tuesday's was based on actual participation in their practice, which was only a walkthrough.

One player was upgraded but it was otherwise the same as the first of the week.

The details are below.
