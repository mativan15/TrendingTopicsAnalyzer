(RTTNews) - After a notable move to the upside early in the session, treasuries gave back ground over the course of the trading day on Monday. Bond prices pulled back well off their best levels of the day, ending the session roughly flat. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, inched up by less than a basis point to 4.015 percent after hitting a low of 3.910 percent. With the uptick on the day, the ten-year yield ended the session at its highest closing level in over fourteen years.
