New Delhi: Educational apps and websites, run by government and private entities of 49 most populous countries, indulged in practices that put children's privacy and safety at risk, international non-government organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said in a report. The report tracked 164 educational apps and websites from these countries, including some from India, between the March 2020 to November 2021 period. In its analysis of the apps, HRW found that of the 164 apps and websites, as many as 146 or 89 per cent engaged in some behaviour which put the safety, privacy and confidentiality of children using these platforms for education, at risk.
