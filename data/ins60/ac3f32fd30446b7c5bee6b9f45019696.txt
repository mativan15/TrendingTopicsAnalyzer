Oct. 20—Have you had a need for a llama llately?

You could have found one of the fuzzy creatures Tuesday by visiting the Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce's annual Business Expo held at the Anniston City Meeting Center.

More than 80 businesses set up booths and displays showcasing their products and services during what officials believe may have been one of the largest such gatherings ever held.

"They were lined up at the doors when we opened this morning," said Chamber director of membership and investor relations Kim Boyd.
