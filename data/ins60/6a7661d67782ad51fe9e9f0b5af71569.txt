On Friday the Seahawks placed running back Rashaad Penny on the injured reserve list. He underwent surgery on his broken fibula and will miss the rest of the 2022 season.

That opened up a spot on the 53-man roster, and now we know who will be filling it – at least for this week.

The team just announced that linebacker Christian Jones has been elevated from the practice squad for tomorrow's game against the Cardinals.

Jones has been in the NFL since the 2014 season, playing a total of 127 games, mostly with the Bears and the Lions.
