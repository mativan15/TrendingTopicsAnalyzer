October 18, 2022 A record 28 teams were selected in a competitive process to participate in eLab, Cornell's student startup accelerator, as part of the 2022-23 cohort.
The program will narrow the cohort in the spring based on the teams' performance and business models. Student founders from any field across Cornell may apply; once accepted, participants engage in entrepreneurship bootcamps, conduct customer discovery, refine their business plans and gain access to a network of successful Cornell alumni, all while earning college credit.
