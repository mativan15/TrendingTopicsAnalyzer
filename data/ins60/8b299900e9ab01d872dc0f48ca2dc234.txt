LONDON, June 02, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanCarbon is a new energy provider and supplier where carbon emissions are not released into the atmosphere. Instead, they are captured, stored, and transformed. The produced energy is 100% renewable, and there are no carbon emissions. The building blocks of the CleanCarbon project are physical waste-to-energy Ultra-High Temperature Gasification (UHTG) installations, a patented technology recently developed in Europe. This technology offers a new standard of efficiency, low cost, and sophistication in waste management and energy recovery.
