On Monday, the federal government proposed a national handgun freeze that would suspend the importing, buying or selling of handguns across Canada.
One Vernon gun store, Eagle Industries Ltd., has been selling guns for years. Owner David James Brown said the business made the decision two months ago to start shutting down the store's gun section, but with ammunition and guns now difficult to find, the decision has been hastened.'There has been a steady stream since the announcement by our illustrious leader for people looking for handguns,' Brown said.
