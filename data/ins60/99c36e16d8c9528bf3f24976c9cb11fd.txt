ATLANTA — Defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans huddled his unit for a stern sideline speech as the 49ers' game fell further out of reach Sunday.
It wasn't a big huddle.
This was a different defense without Nick Bosa and five other would-be starters missing because of injuries. This wasn't the NFL No. 1 crew.
By the time Ryans lashed out in that minute-long sideline huddle, the Atlanta Falcons already had built up a 28-14 lead, and that held up as the final score before a bipartisan crowd in the 49ers' first visit to Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
