LONDON (AP) — Aleksandar Mitrovic's second-half penalty salvaged for Fulham a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth in the English Premier League on Saturday.

Dominic Solanke scored 63 seconds into the game and set up Jefferson Lerma's first-half goal for Bournemouth, which twice gave away leads but ultimately extended its unbeaten run to six games under interim manager Gary O'Neil.

Mitrovic started at Craven Cottage after missing time because of an ankle injury and equalized seven minutes after halftime. The Serbia striker was hauled down by Lerma on a free kick and his penalty kick sent Neto diving the other way.
