Coffinmakers at the Co-op's only manufacturing facility in the UK are set to take strike action in a row over pay, bringing production to a 'complete stop'.About 50 workers at the factory based at Bogmoor Place, Glasgow, have rejected a pay offer which their union, Unite, said is a 'real-terms' pay cut.The offer from Co-op is 'less than half' of the latest estimate of inflation according to the retail price index (RPI), at 12.3%.Unite would not confirm what the Co-op's pay offer was.The Co-op trades on being different to bad employers; it should not be proposing a real-terms pay cut for their Funeralcare workers, especially when they can well afford to pay fairlyEmployees will walk out from October 31 every day until November 7 when action will conclude.
