Oct. 16—WATERFORD — If you were dressed in a costume and listening to some spooky tunes on Sunday afternoon, odds are you were at Camp Harkness' Fall Fest.

Families flocked to the camp for food trucks, craft vendors, fall-themed crafts for kids, face painting, hay bale rides and a costume contest in an effort to support the Camp Harkness Foundation.

"We're just trying to bring the community in so that they see what we're all about," said Director Elisa Marcoux.

Marcoux, dressed in her lobster costume, said that while the camp has put on similar events in the summer, Sunday was the first time they've hosted a Fall Fest.
