Groupon shares appear to have received a sharp boost in recent sessions from the emergence of an activist investor in the local-deals site.

RPD Fund Management, a New York-based firm run by the investor Ahmet Okumus, now owns 9.9% of Groupon (GRPN), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated May 27. RPD had previously disclosed a stake in Groupon using a 13G filing, which implies a passive stake.
