In a move that does not come without risk for either side, the Boston Celtics and reserve forward Grant Williams have allowed the deadline for a contract extension to pass for the Tennessee product, Williams is now set to enter restricted free agency at the end of the 2022-23 NBA season.

On the player's side, while there are not many teams who would likely have the cap space to beat the offers at or near the full midlevel exception next season, it only takes one to force Boston to the table with a comparable offer to avoid risking Williams for nothing.
