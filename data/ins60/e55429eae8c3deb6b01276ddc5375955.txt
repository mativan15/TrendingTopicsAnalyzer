Strictly Come Dancing is often praised for bringing people together and providing some warm and feel-good entertainment during the winter months. Many contestants speak fondly of forming lifelong friendships after taking part, however, former Blue star Simon explained how his experience on the BBC competition was very different to the public perception. The boyband icon called some of the people of the show "childish" and revealed he hasn't spoken to his dance partner, Kristina Rihanoff, in years.
