The world's biggest crypto exchange, Binance, along with rival FTX, is being accused by online users of manipulating the price of the APT token, which saw its price gyrating wildly immediately on its listing. Both the exchanges had made investments in the layer-1 blockchain, which rose to $100 and crashed to $1 on the day of its listing on the platforms.The wild swing in the token's price brutally impacted many small investors. And speculation has grown among at least some investors that the investors in the Aptos blockchain could have got APT tokens for their investments, which were dumped in the markets leading to the price crash.
