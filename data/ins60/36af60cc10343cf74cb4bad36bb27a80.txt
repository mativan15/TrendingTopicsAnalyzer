Rice prices have started falling as the Aman rice has started arriving in the market.Retail prices of staples in Indian households - rice and atta, or wheat flour - have fallen by 7% and 5%, respectively, in the last 10 days, bringing some relief to consumers. While the ban on wheat exports helped cool prices of the grain and atta, arrival of the summer rice crop, which is sown in January-February, has brought down the prices of the commonly consumed non-basmati rice. In western and eastern India, wheat at the mandi level costs ₹23 a kg, while in northern India, the major producing hub, the price is ₹22.
