The New York Yankees, with their backs against the wall, took Game 4 from the Cleveland Guardians, 4-2, to force a decisive Game 5 in the ALDS. The series moves back to the Bronx on Monday night, where it will be all hands on deck for both teams, as Aaron Civale and Jameson Taillon are expected to pitch "bullpen games." The Yankees got the scoring started early in this one, as Anthony Rizzo singled home Gleyber Torres, who also singled as the first batter of the game. He stole second as Aaron Judge struck out to put himself in the position to score.
