Matteo Colombo/DigitalVision via Getty Images Traders will have time to decorate graves on Monday as all exchanges in the US will shutter for the day to observe the Memorial Day holiday. Of course, the trading for crypto never closes and will be available throughout the holiday. In fact, lower volume on the US holiday has led to some volatile trading in recent years, perhaps providing ample trading opportunities. Per Bloomberg, crypto-market volume dropped 43% and 35% on the holiday in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
