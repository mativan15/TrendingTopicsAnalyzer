(Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG's embattled DWS Group Chief Executive Officer Asoka Woehrmann resigned hours after a police raid at the asset manager, the culmination of months of controversy surrounding the executive.Stefan Hoops, head of the German lender's corporate bank, will assume the top role at DWS from June 10, according to a statement Wednesday. His previous role will be taken by David Lynne, who leads the corporate bank for Asia-Pacific based in Singapore. The departure of one of Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing's former close allies underscores the rising pressure since former DWS chief sustainability officer Desiree Fixler's allegations that the company inflated its ESG credentials.
