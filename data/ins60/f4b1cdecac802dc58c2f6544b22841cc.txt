General Motors can launch its Cruise driverless taxi service in San Francisco after receiving approval from regulators.The robo taxis, which can steer themselves autonomously, will be able to accept paying passengers for rides between 10pm and 6am on selected streets at a maximum of 30 miles per hour.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) published a draft resolution that stated the service could operate 'without a safety driver present'.The regulators issued the permit despite safety concerns arising from Cruise's inability to pick up and drop off passengers at the curb in its autonomous taxis, requiring the vehicles to double park in traffic lanes.
