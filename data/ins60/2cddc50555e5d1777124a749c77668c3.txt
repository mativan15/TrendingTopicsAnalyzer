Not even Roblox is safe from Wordle clones, although player numbers show that it's not the ideal platform for the word guessing game.
While the internet is chock full of Wordle clones, it seems like the majority of them were made just for fun. Very few of them have come close to being as popular as the original game (Quordle and Heardle are probably the most successful) but making Wordle clones is almost like a hobby at this point.
It wasn't surprising to see several clones pop up on mobile app stores with the more cynical purpose of using Wordle's popularity to make money.
