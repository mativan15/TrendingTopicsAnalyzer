Klasha 2.0 is the latest version of Klasha, which includes new and updated features of the website's interface, business products including KlashaWire and Payment Links. These updates are flagged under a new brand colour which is warm, bright, and hardly seen in the ecosystem: PINK. Months ago, during one of the brainstorming sessions at Klasha, Jessica Anuna, Klasha's CEO, and the engineering team birthed PINK Money, the instant P2P money feature on the KlashaCart application (formerly Klasha app) where you can send and receive money quickly to other users on the app, without hidden fees or extra charges.
