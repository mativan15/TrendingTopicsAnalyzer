A new report finds investment at its lowest level in years.

Elon Musk's SpaceX vehicles have rocketed up to the International Space Station and have deployed Starlink satellites by the dozens with every one of their launches. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has Blue Origin expeditions selling trips to wealthy space travelers and guests including William Shatner of Star Trek fame.

In his new book, Boldly Go: Reflections on a Life of Awe and Wonder, Shatner wrote that going to space felt like a funeral. The actor went to space with Bezos last October at 90 years old.
