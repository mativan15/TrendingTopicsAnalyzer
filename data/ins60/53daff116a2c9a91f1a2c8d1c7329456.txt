By Denny Jacob Splunk Inc. on Monday said it named Sharyl Givens as its chief people officer. Ms. Givens joins the software maker after 11 years at Proofpoint in human resources leadership roles, including the past eight years as chief human resources officer. The executive change is the latest at Splunk. In September, the company said Chief Financial Officer Jason Child will depart later this year. In March, the San Francisco-based company hired Gary Steele as its chief executive officer. The change also comes as activist investor Starboard Value LP has a sizable stake in Splunk and plans to push the company to take action to boost its stock price, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
