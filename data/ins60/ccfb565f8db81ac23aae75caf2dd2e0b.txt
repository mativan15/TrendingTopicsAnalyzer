As every investor would know, you don't hit a homerun every time you swing. But it would be foolish to simply accept every extremely large loss as an inevitable part of the game. It must have been painful to be a AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) shareholder over the last year, since the stock price plummeted 85% in that time. A loss like this is a stark reminder that portfolio diversification is important. We note that it has not been easy for shareholders over three years, either; the share price is down 38% in that time.
