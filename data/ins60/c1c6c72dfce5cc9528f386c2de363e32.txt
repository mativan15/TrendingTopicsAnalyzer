Liz Truss and Suella Braverman had a ‘fiery' bust up before the Home Secretary left her job yesterday, it has been claimed.
On a day of utter chaos in Parliament, Ms Braverman used a brutal resignation letter to unexpectedly quit following a security gaffe that saw her send classified documents from a personal email.
Many Tories now fear the Government is in a death spiral and believe it is just a matter of time before the prime minister is forced from office – amid suggestions she could be gone within ‘hours not days'.
