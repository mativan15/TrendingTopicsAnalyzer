Baltimore's spending board is poised to approve a $300,000 payment next week to settle a lawsuit brought by the rapper Young Moose against convicted former Gun Trace Task Force Detective Daniel Hersl.

The settlement is on the Board of Estimates agenda for Wednesday, with lawyers for the city and Kevron Evans, known as Young Moose, having reached the agreement May 10.

Filed last March in Baltimore Circuit Court, the complaint sought $1.5 million in damages for Evans, 28, accusing Hersl and other officers of planting drugs on Evans, applying for warrants based on false allegations and illegally arresting him.
