PARIS — The former president of the Louvre museum has received preliminary charges for alleged antiquities trafficking during his tenure as head of the famous Paris museum. Police in the French capital charged Jean-Luc Martinez on Wednesday with "complicity in organized fraud" and money laundering, according to the Paris prosecutors' office. The prosecutor's office said that two of Martinez' former colleagues in the Louvre's Egyptian antiquities department were also taken into custody this week but released without charges.
