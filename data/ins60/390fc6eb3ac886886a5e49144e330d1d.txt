LoadingWhat do economists suggest? Scholar in labour economics at The University of Melbourne, Nicolas Herault, says economic models surprisingly have very little to teach about tipping.'Economics can't tell us the ideal or optimal tipping amount, nor which sectors we should tip the most,' Herault says. 'However, if we think of tipping as a way to boost salaries for low-paying jobs, it makes sense to prioritise sectors with low wages such as hospitality and retail services.'Where should we tip – and how much?According to data from payments platform Zeller, Australians do tip, with Tasmanians the most generous of all states and territories.
