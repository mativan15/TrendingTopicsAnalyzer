Washington state is likely to collect more than twice as much money from a new carbon credit system over the next three years as originally estimated, possibly setting the Legislature up to spend more on carbon reductions in its transportation and building sectors next session.Although the exact dollar amount the state will reap is uncertain, the new projections have given environmental and transportation advocates reason to hope that more can be spent on reducing emissions from heavy-duty vehicles like freight and garbage trucks, as well as toward converting homes to more energy-efficient heating and cooling systems like heat pumps.
