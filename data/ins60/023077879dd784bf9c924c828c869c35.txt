By Reuters Published: 09:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 09:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - British Conservative lawmaker William Wragg said on Wednesday he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Prime Minister Liz Truss after being "ashamed" of her mini-budget. The government has told lawmakers that a vote on her fracking policy later on Wednesday would be treated as a test of confidence, and those who vote against it will be removed from the parliamentary party. Wragg, who opposes fracking, said he would vote with the government so that a letter of no confidence he had submitted would not become void.
