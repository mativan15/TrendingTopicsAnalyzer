Higher mortgage rates did nothing to stop home price momentum in March.U.S. home values jumped 20.6% in March from the year before, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index, up from a 20% increase in February and marking the largest year-over-gain in the index's 35-year history.The acceleration occurred even as mortgage rates jumped nearly a full percentage point during the month.'Those of us who have been anticipating a deceleration in the growth rate of U.S. home prices will have to wait at least a month longer,' Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, said in a statement.
