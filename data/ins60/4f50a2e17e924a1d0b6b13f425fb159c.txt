This idyllic village from the Italian-speaking region of the Swiss Alps has had a headstart when it comes to becoming carbon neutral.

The country's Bavona Valley houses 12 hamlets. 11 of them have never been connected to the power grid.

Some homes have had solar panels since the 1980s, while other residents rely on gas canisters, candles and oil lamps instead of electricity.

"I see so much waste today including electricity, so many lights everywhere. But not here, because here everything is dark, there is not even a streetlight", says Bice Tonini, resident of the hamlet of Sonlerto.
