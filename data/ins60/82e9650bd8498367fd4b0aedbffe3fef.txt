Johnny Depp won his legal battle with ex Amber Heard following a sensational six week long trial in the US on Wednesday evening. A jury ruled in favour of the actor, 58, following weeks of testimony from Depp, Heard, friends of the pair, expert witnesses and even supermodel Kate Moss, a former partner of Depp. Depp was awarded compensatory damages of $10million (£8million) and a further $5million (£4million) in punitive damages. Now, Heard faces an $8million (£6,300million) payout. Amber will be forced to pay up $10 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages which was reduced from $5 million due to Virginia's cap on such awards.
