The Philadelphia 76ers have recently held brief conversations on the possibility of a rookie-scale contract extension for elite defensive guard Matisse Thybulle, league sources told Yahoo Sports.

Conversations have been with Thybulle's agent, Aaron Goodwin of Goodwin Sports.

The deadline to reach an agreement on a deal is 6 pm. ET Monday. If both sides fail to agree to terms by the deadline, Thybulle, 25, would become a restricted free agent at the end of the 2022-23 season.

The two-time NBA All-Defensive second-team performer has elevated himself to one of the league's premier defenders during his brief professional career.
