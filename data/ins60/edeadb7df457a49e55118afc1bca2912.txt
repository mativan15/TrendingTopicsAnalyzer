Institutions that work with children should be required by law to report suspicions of child sexual abuse, a landmark independent inquiry has concluded.The inquiry found crimes are often concealed from authorities, with allegations not recorded and victims "treated as if they were unworthy of protection" and blamed for the abuse.
One of the concerns raised by the inquiry is that many of the individuals who failed to report abuse to the police or social services may have failed to meet their professional or moral obligations, but did not break any laws in doing so.
