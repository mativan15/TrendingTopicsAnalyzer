By Kyle Morris Shares in Dewhurst Group PLC fell on Wednesday after it said that its administrative systems aren't currently fully operational after a cybersecurity incident on May 23, and that as a result it expects 2022 profitability to be materially below expectations. Shares in the company at 0728 GMT were down 140.00 pence, or 10%, at 1,250.00 pence. The U.K. maker of electrical components said the remediation process at its sites is under way and individual sites are likely to come back gradually.
