The Russian government is willing to consider allowing the use of cryptocurrency for international payments, Reuters reported Tuesday, and moving forward with that idea could help the country blunt the impact of Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. "In principle, we do not object to the use of cryptocurrency in international transactions," Ksenia Yudaeva, first deputy governor at the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, said in a Tuesday briefing with reporters, according to Reuters. The central bank had previously called for a ban on cryptocurrencies, and in December reportedly held talks with market players and experts about prohibiting cryptocurrency investment to limit financial stability risks.
