HYDERABAD: Confusion continues to cloud the Diwali date and government holiday with solar eclipse slated on October 25. Some almanacs have mentioned Diwali on October 25, while many astrologers and almanac writers asserted the festival of lights should be celebrated on October 24. Some astrologers even suggested the state government should change the holiday from October 25 to October 24 for the benefit of its employees." Naraka Chaturdasi falls on October 24 and Amavasya begins in the evening on the same day.
