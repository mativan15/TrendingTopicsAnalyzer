Oct. 20—A former IBC bank employee who pleaded guilty to embezzling thousands of dollars from her employer will not spend any time in jail, but she will be under supervised release for four years.

Itzel Arlete Vega was sentenced to time served and has also been ordered to spend her first 60 days in home detention with an electronic monitoring device to be determined by her probation officer, federal court documents reflect.

Vega appeared Thursday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr.
