A school board campaign event in Vero Beach, Florida, gets under way inside a church. Giorgio VIERA AFP Vero Beach (United States) (AFP) – A conservative group known as "Moms for Liberty" is triggering a minor earthquake in Florida school board elections, hoping the tremors will ripple across the entire United States. The group demands that often-sleepy school boards wake up and yank "problematic" books from schools, and empower parents to have more say in public education."I am on the right side of history," said Jacqueline Rosario, who is seeking re-election to a school board in Indian River County on Florida's east coast.
