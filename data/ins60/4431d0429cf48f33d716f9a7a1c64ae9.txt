RANGERS defender Calvin Bassey is a man in demand after a stellar season and talk regarding his future just won't go away.
With a host of Premier League clubs keeping tabs on the 22-year old and potential fees of around £25 million entering the discussion, Gers fans might feel they're right to be worried about losing one of their star men.

While chatter about his future is rife, it seems Bassey himself certainly isn't thinking about it.
