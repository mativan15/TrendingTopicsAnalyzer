BART, MTC Urge Residents and Visitors to Put Clipper on Their Phones
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- BART and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) encourage travelers to put a Clipper® card on their mobile phones because global supply chain issues have once again severely depleted the inventory of plastic cards. Clipper is available for mobile phones through either Apple Pay or Google Pay.
Clipper through at least the end of this year will waive the standard $3 new card fee for customers who choose either of the mobile options for their new cards.
