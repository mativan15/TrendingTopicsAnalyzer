AgenciesPCB chief Ramiz Raja (File Photo)A 'disappointed' Pakistan Cricket Board on Wednesday requested the Asian Cricket Council to convene an emergency meeting in the wake of BCCI secretary Jay Shah's statement that India won't travel to Pakistan for next year's Asia Cup. In its first official response to Shah's statement that India would like to play the continental tournament at a neutral venue and not tour Pakistan, the PCB said "such statements can spilt the Asian and international cricket communities" and can impact Pakistan's visit to India for the 2023 World Cup.
