Apex child rights body NCPCR has summoned global senior vice president and country head of Amazon India over alleged funding to All India Mission, an organisation involved in "unlawful practices". The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has warned of legal action if Amazon India country head Amit Agarwal fails to appear before it on November 1. The commission has alleged that All India Mission is being involved in unlawful practices. In a letter to Amazon India, the NCPCR said it had requested Amazon India to look into the matter and furnish certain details about All India Mission and other orphanages funded by the company.
