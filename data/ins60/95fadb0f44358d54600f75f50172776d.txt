The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee has announced Gilbert-based Footprint as the official "green" partner for Super Bowl LVII in Glendale.

Footprint, which has been on a mission to create a healthier planet by eliminating single-use plastics, will provide plant-based fiber products, such as plates, cups and utensils, as well as create educational opportunities to learn about the importance of eliminating single-use plastics at events in the months leading up to the Super Bowl.

'Partnering with the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee will showcase the state as a hub for innovation and how events like the Super Bowl can be done with sustainability at the forefront,' Troy Swope, Footprint's CEO and co-founder said in a statement.
