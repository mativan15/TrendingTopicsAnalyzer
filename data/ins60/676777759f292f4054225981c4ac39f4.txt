The last Howard Johnson's restaurant in America appears to be closed for good.  The location, in Lake George, New York, was the last vestige of a once-massive restaurant chain. But the eatery did not open for Memorial Day weekend, and a banner out front advertised that the building was available to lease, the local ABC affiliate reported.  
 The chain originated in Quincy, but spread from coast to coast after World War II. At one point, almost 1,000 iconic HoJo's orange rooftops dotted the country.
