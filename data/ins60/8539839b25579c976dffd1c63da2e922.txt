IF you're always chatting on Facebook Messenger, make sure your texts are encrypted.
Leaving them unencrypted puts them at greater risk of snooping – and it's so easy to avoid.

Facebook has built a way of encrypting chats directly into Messenger.
That means your texts are scrambled in transit, keeping out potential snoopers.
"End-to-end encryption adds extra security and protection to your messages and calls in a conversation so that only you and whoever you're talking to can see, hear or read them," said Facebook.
