'We need to be cheerleaders, not gatekeepers,' said UKTV's commissioning editor Sarah Asante, during a discussion at Mipcom on diversity and inclusion in the TV industry.

Everyone trying to get in has a story about ‘having to know someone, having to be the son of a CEO or the daughter of a manager.' That's true, but there is a good number of commissioners of my cohort, who have my focus on how to tell the best stories from the biggest range of people.
