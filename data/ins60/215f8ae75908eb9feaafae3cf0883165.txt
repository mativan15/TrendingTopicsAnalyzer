Common Name: Woolly monkeysScientific Name: LagothrixAverage Life Span In Captivity: 30 yearsSize: Up to 1.6 feet tallAn animal called a woolly monkey seems like it should live in the frozen north, not the sweltering Amazon Basin. But the thick coat of fur covering these large primates protects them from the sun, rain, and insect bites of their native habitats in the forests and cloud forests of Peru, Columbia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Brazil.Woolly monkeys were once considered four species: the gray, Columbian, silvery, and Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkeys.
