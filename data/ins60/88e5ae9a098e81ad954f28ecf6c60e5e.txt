NEW YORK — Stocks are falling on Wall Street Friday as investors consider the downside of the still-strong U.S. jobs market. The S&P 500 was 0.9% lower in morning trading after a report showed employers hired more workers last month than economists expected. While that's a good sign for the economy amid worries about a possible recession, many investors saw it keeping the Federal Reserve on its path to hiking interest rates aggressively. Such moves would slow the economy in hopes of ultimately knocking down high inflation, and the Fed risks causing a recession if it moves too quickly or too far.
