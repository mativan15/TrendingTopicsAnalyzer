Freelancing has afforded Courtney Allen the life of her wildest dreams: She's a business owner, can take her work anywhere, travels 10 weeks a year on average, and recently moved from Atlanta to Seoul, South Korea.Allen, 32, started freelancing in 2016 after a failed business attempt left her with $25,000 in credit-card debt. She previously worked at Cisco Systems as a presentation designer for senior executives, so she used her PowerPoint and graphic-design skills to branch off on her own.In 2017, she established her own agency, 16x9, which is named after the standard aspect ratio for presentations.
