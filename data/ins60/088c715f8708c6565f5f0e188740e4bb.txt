The Vertem Futurity Trophy Stakes over a mile at Doncaster is the final Group 1 race of the UK Flat season. Featuring some of the leading two-year-olds, it is also a pointer towards next year's Classics.
Eight runners have been declared for this year's renewal, including Auguste Rodin, who will be bidding to give his trainer Aidan O'Brien a record 11th success in the race. The Ballydoyle handler also saddles the recent Navan winner Salt Lake City.
John and Thady Gosden will be represented by Epictetus, while Andrew Balding, who won this race in 2014 and 2019, will be hoping for more success with Stormbuster.
