HSBC's new corporate perk allows 35,000 UK staff lease Teslas, and nearly 200 other models of electric vehicles.The news was first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed to Insider by the bank. Workers will be able to lease EVs from the bank for up to 48 months and receive tax benefits. They will then have the option to buy the car in full at the end of the contract, per the report. Banks are keen to improve their offers to employees amid a talent war with tech and other industries, which has forced them to boost pay, improve corporate culture, and heed calls to provide more flexible working.
