Dame Judi Dench has demanded a ‘factual disclaimer' be added to The Crown, as Netflix viewers prepare for the new series to launch.
The new series will focus on the affair between now King Charles III and newly appointed Queen Consort Camilla Parker Bowles, as well as the treatment of late Princess Diana.
Landing a long two years after season four, the highly-anticipated ten episodes are scheduled to arrive on Netflix on November 9.
Imelda Staunton will be taking over from Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II, while Jonny Lee Miller will be playing prime minister Sir John Major.
