The Dolphins' NBC game this weekend is a big deal, not only because the Sunday night games are considered the NFL's marquee package, but also because the Dolphins have been featured so infrequently over the years, a byproduct of making just one playoff appearance in the past 13 years.

The Dolphins have appeared just three times in NBC's 17 years as the Sunday night rights-holder.

Miami's most recent Sunday night game was in 2017, a home loss to the Raiders. The Dolphins have had only two others during the non-cable era of 'Sunday Night Football:' a loss against Pittsburgh in 2006 (NBC's first game after taking over the Sunday night package) and a 2010 loss to the Jets.
