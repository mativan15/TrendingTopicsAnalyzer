MEXICO CITY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Mexican "buy now, pay later" application Nelo has received a $100 million credit facility from U.S. private equity firm Victory Park Capital, which it will use to cushion its loan book and grow its business, the company said on Wednesday.The funding gives Nelo a boost in an increasingly crowded market, as other buy now, pay later platforms such as Kueski, Aplazo and Atrato vie to win over clients in Mexico, where credit penetration is low.Transactions made with buy now, pay later firms, through which consumers pay in often interest-free installments over weeks or months, surged during an e-commerce boom triggered by coronavirus lockdowns.
