Redbox Entertainment Inc. shares were roaring leading up to a merger deal with Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment Inc., and they've remained hot since the all-stock acquisition was announced in mid-May. That has one analyst urging caution. B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold downgraded shares of Redbox RDBX, +3.44% to sell from neutral Friday, writing that the stock's roughly 100%-plus rally since the deal announcement doesn't align with the terms of the acquisition. Chicken Soup for the Soul shares had dropped around 13% since the deal announcement as of the publication of his note.
