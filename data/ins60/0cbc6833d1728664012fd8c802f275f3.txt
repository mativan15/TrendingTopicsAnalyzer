The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) approved the early release of 11 convicts sentenced to life in 2008 for the gang rape of Bilkis Bano and murder of seven of her family members, the Gujarat government disclosed before the Supreme Court on Monday, also citing 'good behaviour' of the convicts a key reason to grant them remission. The affidavit submitted by the state government on Monday revealed that remission was granted in August despite objections from the trial court judge who convicted the 11 men, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which investigated and prosecuted the case in Mumbai following the 2004 apex court order of shifting the trial outside Gujarat.
