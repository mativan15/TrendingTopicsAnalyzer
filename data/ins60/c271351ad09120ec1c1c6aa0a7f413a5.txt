HOUSTON, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Many state law requires that a business files a "Doing Business As" name before they can trade, which can sometimes be a complex process. EFileDBA now cuts through the difficulty with its simple, online e-filing solution.

In most states, a company that wants to trade under an assumed or fictitious name must register with the Secretary of State or the county within which they wish to form the business. Sometimes, they'll need to post a notice in a local newspaper as well.
