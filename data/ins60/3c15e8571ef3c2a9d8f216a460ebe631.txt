YouTube is expanding access to its social shopping tools to more creators, the company told Insider.YouTube Shopping tools, first introduced in 2021, enable creators to tag products with shoppable links in and around their videos, live streams, and Shorts.Earlier this year, executives told Insider that 1,000 creators in five countries (the US, Brazil, Korea, India, and the UK) and across four content verticals (beauty, tech, hobbies, and automotive parts) were part of the YouTube Shopping beta. Roughly 20 brands were involved at the time.
