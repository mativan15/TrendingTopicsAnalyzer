Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.

Ethereum-based stablecoin protocol Beanstalk will kick off a fundraising campaign on June 6 to restore $77 million of liquidity lost from a governance exploit that drained $182 million from the project.

In April, an attacker bought a controlling stake of Beanstalk tokens, then used that position to exploit the governance structure, voting to send themself all of Beanstalk's funds.
