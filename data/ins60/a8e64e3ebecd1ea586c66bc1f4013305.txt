If the Tennessee Titans win approval for a new domed stadium, the $2.1 billion facility won't automatically bear the name of the team's current home.

Nissan sponsors Nashville's existing NFL stadium on the riverfront opposite downtown, in a sponsorship that began seven years ago. Nissan spokesman Brian Brockman confirmed to the Business Journal that the agreement applies only to the current stadium, and that a new stadium would require a new naming rights deal.

The ability to enter a new naming rights agreement, whether the Titans ultimately choose Nissan or another business, is one of the money-making opportunities the team would be poised to tap into — if Metro Council approves the proposal for a new stadium, which would be built on the parking lots between the current one and the downtown interstate loop.
