CNN —

The top Republican super PAC working to take back the Senate is withdrawing their final two weeks of ads in New Hampshire, according to a spokesman for the group, effectively giving up on Republican Senate nominee Don Bolduc's bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan.

The Senate Leadership Fund is cutting $5.6 million in ads they had planned to air in the state during the final two weeks, the spokesman said.

SLF is affiliated with Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and has been the largest TV and digital advertiser this fall in six of the 10 states deemed most likely to flip by CNN – Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.
