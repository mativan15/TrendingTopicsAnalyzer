The man stepping into the oversized shoes Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg will leave behind has kept a low profile during his nearly 15 years at the company and has barely any social media presence.
Javier Olivan, a 44-year-old native of Spain who helped spread Facebook's footprint overseas, was thrust into the spotlight after Sandberg shocked the tech world Wednesday by abruptly announcing her resignation following a 14-year run at Meta. 
Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg named Olivan, the company's Chief Growth Officer, to the prominent new role but acknowledged it will 'be different from what Sheryl has done' in recent years, in a post addressing the leadership shakeup.
