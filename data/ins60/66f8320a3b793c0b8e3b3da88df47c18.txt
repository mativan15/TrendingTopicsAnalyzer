OPINION:

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey are burdened by terribly stubborn inflation and national governments either too woke or unimaginatively conservative.

Historically, central banks have viewed inflation and unemployment through a Keynesian lens.

Aggregate demand fluctuates above and below the productive potential of the economy. The result is either too much inflation — defined by central bankers as more than 2% — or too much unemployment — generally because households and businesses are pulling back on spending.
