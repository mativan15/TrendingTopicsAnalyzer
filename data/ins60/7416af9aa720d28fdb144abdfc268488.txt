The Delhi High Court has stayed a trial court order allowing the presence of a lawyer at a visible but not audible distance during the interrogation of Delhi Minister Satyendar Jain, arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case.Justice Yogesh Khanna observed that when there is credible material to indicate real and live apprehension of a possible threat or coercion being employed at the time of recording of statement, such a direction may be passed, but since there is no apprehension raised in the present matter, the direction ought not to have been given as a matter of right.
