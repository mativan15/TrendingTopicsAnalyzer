A blockbuster trade with Utah meant the Wolves gave up five players, including three who were regulars in the rotation, opening up some prominent roster spots. Here's a look at veterans joining the team this season.

Rudy Gobert, 30

The Wolves sent Patrick Beverley, Jared Vanderbilt, Malik Beasley, Leandro Bolmaro and first-round pick Walker Kessler to the Jazz — along with first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029 and a 2026 first-round swap of picks — to get Gobert.
