Kelsey Anderson had no idea a quick trip to a Duck Donuts shop two years ago in Naples, Florida would change her life.'We bought a half-dozen, thinking that would last us a couple days,' Anderson said. 'My son and I literally ate those on the way to the beach. They were so good, and I wasn't expecting them to be that good.'On Friday, Anderson stood next to her friend and business partner, Felicia Osler, as the duo celebrated the grand opening of their own Duck Donuts franchise in Libertyville.Anderson vividly remembers how she eagerly texted Osler about the donut shop in Naples, telling her she needed to taste them.
