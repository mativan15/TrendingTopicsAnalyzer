A computer hacker who stole unreleased songs from British pop star Ed Sheeran and American rap artist Lil Uzi Vert has been sentenced to 18 months in prison, U.K. prosecutors said Friday. 
 Adrian Kwiatkowski, 23, of Ipswich in southern England, hacked the artists' cloud-based accounts and sold their songs on the dark web in exchange for cryptocurrency. City of London Police, which investigated the case, said Kwiatkowski made 131,000 pounds ($147,000) on the transactions. 'Kwiatkowski had complete disregard for the musicians' creativity and hard work producing original songs and the subsequent loss of earnings,' said Joanne Jakymec of the Crown Prosecution Service.
