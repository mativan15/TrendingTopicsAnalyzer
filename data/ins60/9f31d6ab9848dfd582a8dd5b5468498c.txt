Over the last few months, I have advised investors to avoid unprofitable growth companies as the era of profitless prosperity winds down. I believed there was substantial downside in WeWork (WE), GitLab (GTLB) and Guidewire (GWRE) even if they attained a reasonable profitability margin. Today, I offer a fundamental value perspective on fast-growing language company Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL). I find that it is not as overvalued as many other tech stocks in the market, especially if it can successfully increase its margins to the 10% level.
