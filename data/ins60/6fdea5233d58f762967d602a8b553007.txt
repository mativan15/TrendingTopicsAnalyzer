LONDON - British government debt rose to the highest level in almost 60 years last month and retail sales slumped, underscoring the scale of the economic challenges facing whoever replaces Prime Minister Liz Truss after her administration imploded under the weight of its failed financial plan. Public borrowing rose to 98 per cent of economic output in September as rampant inflation increased interest payments on what the government owed, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. That's higher than at any point since 1963, when Britain was still paying off debts accumulated during World War II.
