Moody's (MCO) and S&P Global (SPGI) both dropped after SPGI suspended guidance on weak debt issuance. The financial stock that fell the most during the past five sessions (ended June 3), was Rocket Companies (RKT), operator of Rocket Mortgage, which dropped 7.3%, continuing its downward trajectory that started even before interest rates rose.
