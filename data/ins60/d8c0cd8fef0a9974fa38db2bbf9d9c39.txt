Labour-run Wandsworth has won permission to run a pilot scheme for up to eight months, starting next week. If successful, the crackdown could be rolled out across the capital. Normally speeding offences are enforced by the Metropolitan Police using fixed cameras and mobile patrols. But it tends to concentrate on trunk roads and higher speeds — meaning 20mph limits in many residential areas go unenforced.Drivers caught by the council speed cameras will be sent a £130 penalty ticket but will escape the three points being added to their licence that normally results from a police caution.
