Three-time NBA All-Star wing Khris Middleton's offseason wrist surgery will prevent him from joining the Milwaukee Bucks for "the first few weeks of the regular season," per The Athletic's Shams Charania.

Middleton reportedly underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left wrist in early July, nearly two months after Milwaukee's season ended in the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
