Last week, two Gen Z protesters threw tomato soup on Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers painting in London's National Gallery and glued themselves to the wall it hung on. Both women, ages 20 and 21, who are members of the Just Stop Oil activist group, have since been charged with criminal damage. Their goal was to get people talking about environmental and climate issues. The group as a whole has called on the U.K. government to halt future licensing of fossil fuel exploration, development, and production.
