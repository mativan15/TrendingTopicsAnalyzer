Even as farmers celebrate the latest State government order that empowers local bodies to legally cull wild boars posing threat to life and crops, the local body heads appointed as honorary life wardens to grant permission are worried about meeting the huge expenses involved. At least ₹4,000 is now required for the disposal of the carcass of a shot animal by complying with the legal formalities stipulated by the Forest Department. Local bodies may not find it a viable exercise if more animals need to be culled.
