The stock market had a nice bounce last week, giving investors a bit of reassurance during a tough 2022. However, even after a three-day holiday, traders on Wall Street didn't seem to be in a good mood, leaving market indexes mixed heading into Tuesday's market open. As of 8 a.m. ET, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI 0.00%) were down 179 points to 32,979. S&P 500 (^GSPC 2.47%) futures had fallen 19 points to 4,137, but Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC 0.00%) futures managed to pick up a single point to reach 12,679.
