Wall Street Published by Reuters UK By William James and William Schomberg LONDON (Reuters) -New finance minister Jeremy Hunt promised to win back Britain's economic credibility by accounting for every penny of the government's tax and spending plans, while insisting that his boss Prime Minister Liz Truss remained in overall charge. Truss appointed Hunt on Friday in an attempt to rescue her leadership as confidence in her ability to run the country drained away within both her own Conservative Party and international financial markets.
