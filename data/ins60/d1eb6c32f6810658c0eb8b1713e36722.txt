New Delhi: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has a cult following and his disciples abide by every word he says. The market magnate calls investing a 'simple game' that financial advisors have convinced the public is harder than it really is. Taking a dig at wealth advisors at the annual general meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett said that if they told everybody what a simple game of investing was, 90 per cent of the income of the people that were speaking would disappear.

Buffett has always been a diehard admirer of simple investing and suggests people to look at passive funds or ETFs.
