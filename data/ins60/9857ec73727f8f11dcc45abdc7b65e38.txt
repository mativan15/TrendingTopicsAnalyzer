The last 24 chaotic hours of British prime minister Liz Truss's chaotic 44 days in Downing Street called to mind the manner in which former taoiseach Brian Cowen's shaky coalition was dismantled in early 2011.Cowen had decided that he would carry out a root-and-branch reshuffle of his government in an effort to inject energy and fresh thinking in advance of what was already going to be a difficult election.He sacked six of his long-standing ministers and replaced them with younger and less experienced TDs.
