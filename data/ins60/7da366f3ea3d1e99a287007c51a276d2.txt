A wall of heat greets those entering Auckland Zoo's newest exhibit, a steamy 28C to imitate the experience of wandering through a swamp forest – teeming with fish and crocodiles. The last puzzle piece in the zoo's South East Asia jungle track is complete, with the addition of a tropical dome to house its new Sunda gharial crocodiles, Malu and Sumpit. Along with the other sections – such as the high canopy (orangutans and siamans) and the lowlands (Sumatran tigers and Asian small-clawed otters) – the finished dome is the final renovation to the $62 million track.
