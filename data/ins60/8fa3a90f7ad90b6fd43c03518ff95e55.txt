By Mauro Orru Amazon.com Inc. said that it is suing the administrators of more than 11,000 websites and social media groups in the U.S. and Europe that it says are used to orchestrate fake reviews in exchange for money or free products. The Seattle-based tech giant said Thursday that it had filed 10 more lawsuits against fake review brokers in the U.S., its first criminal complaint in Italy and its first lawsuit in Spain. Amazon also sent warning letters to the administrators of five websites in Germany it said were directing users to a fake-reviews broker.
