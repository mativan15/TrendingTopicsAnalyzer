Meghan Markle has a lofty message to any future actresses who might play her onscreen: they must dig deep into her many layers.
'I hope that in preparing for that role, she finds the softness and the playfulness and the laughter,' Markle told Variety about any actors who might depict her on screen. 
'The silliness. I just hope she finds the dimensions. Also, she can call me!'
The Duchess of Sussex, 41, was an actor for years before she married Prince Harry in 2018, most famously starring in the USA legal drama 'Suits.
