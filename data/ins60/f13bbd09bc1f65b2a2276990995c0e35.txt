Michael Vi The last time Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) reported earnings the market reaction was egregious, with the stock plummeting over 33% in one day mainly due to a slowing revenue growth. Okta was once a market's darling, up almost 900% from the IPO price in 2017 but now down from those highs over 80%. What got me interested in the stock is the combination of negative market sentiment and near-term headwinds, which usually creates potential long-term opportunities. After looking into Okta, however, I don't believe that at today's price the stock offers a very positive risk-reward scenario.
