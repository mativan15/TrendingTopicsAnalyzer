Potential first-round pick Terquavion Smith on Tuesday told Jonathan Givony of ESPN that he will withdraw from the 2022 NBA draft and return to N.C. State next season.
Smith emerged as one of the top performers at the draft combine, recording 17 points during one scrimmage game. He received first-round grades from several teams following the showing given his explosiveness and ability as a scorer.
The decision to return to school is a bit surprising considering that he was highly touted entering the draft.
