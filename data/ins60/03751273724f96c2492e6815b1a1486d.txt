Today, Instagram announced a number of updates to protect users, creators, and public figures, protected from abuse and harassment when using the app. Now, whenever a user blocks someone, they'll not only have the ability to block any new accounts the individual creates, but any other accounts they currently have.  'We want to make it as hard as possible for someone you've blocked to contact you again,' the announcement reads.
