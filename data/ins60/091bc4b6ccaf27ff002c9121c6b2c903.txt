David Ramos/Getty Images News Verizon stock (NYSE:VZ) found its lowest point in nearly 12 years Friday morning, and looks to be heading lower, after the carrier posted meager subscriber numbers despite beating financial expectations with its third-quarter report. Verizon (VZ) was down 6.5% late Friday morning, adding on to a decline of 37% over the past six months. It's pacing toward its worst one-day fall since July 22 (when it fell 6.7%), and its lowest depth since November 2010. And the carrier produced better revenues and per-share profit than expected.
