PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Rain is welcoming NASCAR back to the Pacific Northwest — of course. NASCAR's Xfinity Series was set to debut Saturday at Portland International Raceway for a rare stand-alone event for the second-tier national series. It's the first NASCAR event in the region in 22 years, and falls on the same weekend as the premiere Cup Series debuts at St. Louis. For the Xfinity Series, its a chance to shine in a region starving for stock cars. 'I think it's cool for Xfinity to be away and be on our own, and be the premier series this weekend,' said Sheldon Creed, who was fastest in Friday morning practice.
