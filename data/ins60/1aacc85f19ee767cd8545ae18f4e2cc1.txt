Houston-based Baker Hughes Co. (Nasdaq: BKR) named a new CFO Oct. 19 as the company prepares for what it expects to be a volatile environment next year, Chairman and CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said during third-quarter earnings.

Nancy Buese, who has 15 years of public CFO experience and over 30 years in finance and leadership roles, will take over the CFO role on Nov. 2. She will replace Brian Worrell, who will move into a senior adviser role before leaving the company in the second quarter of 2023.

Buese previously served as executive vice president and CFO of Denver-based gold mining company Newmont Corp.
