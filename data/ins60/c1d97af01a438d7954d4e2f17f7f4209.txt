Three quests have been found in the game's files, each of which unlocks a Chrome Punk-themed reward. They are as follows:

Earn 10 account levels – Chromeseed back bling


Earn 25 account levels – Graveyard Rave loading screen
Earn 50 account levels – Chrome Punk skin

Note that account levels are not the same as the regular Battle Pass levels you see on the main menu. Your account level is the total amount of levels you've gained in every single Fortnite season. The phrasing of the quests is slightly unclear, whether 'earning' these levels means you need to gain 50 levels while the quest is active, or if you just need to have a level 50 (or better) account is unclear.
