It would make financial sense for Liverpool to sell Sadio Mane this summer rather than risking losing him for nothing next season, says former England international Karen Carney.She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club: "Taking my footballing hat off and thinking about it business-wise, I probably would sell him for £25m or £30m."If there is any club I would trust to use that money wisely it would be Liverpool. For that amount of money, I believe that Liverpool could find another absolute diamond.
