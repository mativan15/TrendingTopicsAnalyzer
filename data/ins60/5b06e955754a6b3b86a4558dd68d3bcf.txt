Three judges at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin have found former soldier Lisa Smith guilty of joining the ISIL (ISIS) armed group in Syria.
Smith, 40, wept in the dock as Judge Tony Hunt on Monday read the panel's decision, which was delivered after a nine-week trial.
The Muslim convert, who wore a hijab to court, pleaded not guilty to membership of the armed group between October 28, 2015 and December 1, 2019.
Judge Hunt said the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that she travelled to Syria 'with her eyes open' and pledged allegiance to the group, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
