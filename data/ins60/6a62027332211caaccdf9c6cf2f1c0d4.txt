Even after two muffed punts in three games, Bears rookie Velus Jones Jr. can't be ruled out for returns Monday night.

Bears special teams coordinator Richard Hightower has done the math.

It's part of the reason why Velus Jones Jr. is among the players who could be returning punts Monday night against New England for the Bears after he muffed two punts late in games.

Hightower wouldn't say who will do it yet, but indicated all the usual suspects were back fielding punts at practice, players who did it in training camp and preseason: Eddie Jackson, Josh Blackwell and Dante Pettit are joining Jones in practice.
