A new trailer for the long-awaited Final Fantasy XVI shows that it doesn't just share a classic fantasy setting with games like Final Fantasy I, II, III, and IX, but a similar plot as well. The trailer, though, titled Ambition, teases an expansion on those old plotlines as well.
FINAL FANTASY XVI 'AMBITION'
Final Fantasy 16 takes place in the land of Valisthea, which is shared by six uneasily peaceful factions: Rosaria, Sanbreque, Waloed, The Dhalmekian Republic, and The Iron Kingdom. Each of these kingdoms has taken plots of land near one of the six Mother Crystals of Valisthea.
