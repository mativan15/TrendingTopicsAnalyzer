brightstars/E+ via Getty Images The Gold Standard For BDCs I am sure I will ruffle a few feathers with this but I have long considered Main Street Capital (MAIN) as the gold standard for BDCs. The main problem with MAIN is that it is constantly trading at a significant premium to the value of its underlying assets. On May 5, 2022 (this represents the Q1-2022 earnings announcement), MAIN's net asset value (NAV) was $25.89 per share but the stock price came in at $39.71 which means that the stock was selling at a premium of 153% to the underlying value of its assets.
