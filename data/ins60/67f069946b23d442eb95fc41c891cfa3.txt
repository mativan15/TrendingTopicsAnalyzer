Commuters are facing a second day of traffic chaos on Tuesday as Just Stop Oil activists continue to dangle from the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at Dartford crossing.Activists Morgan Trowland and Marcus spent the night dangling from 275ft high masts at the northern end of the bridge in makeshift hammocks.Six miles of heavy traffic has already built on the vital commuter route with police officers so far making no attempts to bring the two eco-warriors down due to safety concerns, according to reports.
