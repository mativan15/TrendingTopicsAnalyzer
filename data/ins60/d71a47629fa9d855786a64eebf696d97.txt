Mortgage rates slip for a second week — how long will the break for homebuyers last?

U.S. mortgage rates have fallen for the second straight week, giving homebuyers a much-needed break amid the recent surge in the cost of financing.

Investors have shifted their focus from the beleaguered stock market to Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities, allowing mortgage rates to fall even as the Federal Reserve pushes the other way, says Joel Berner, senior economic research analyst with Realtor.com.
