Wharton Finance Professor Michael R. Roberts sees finance as a life skill. His mission to level the financial playing field for everyone has led him to develop an innovative student-focused curriculum that integrates personal and corporate finance concepts and promotes the exploration of how these concepts can be applied practically. This summer, hundreds of high school students enrolled in Wharton Global Youth's Essentials of Finance program will get the opportunity to experience Professor Roberts' approach to financial education.
