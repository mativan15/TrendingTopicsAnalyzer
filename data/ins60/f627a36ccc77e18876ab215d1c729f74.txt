Google is facing a series of anti-trust cases in India

Indian authorities have fined Google 13bn rupees ($161m; £144m) for using its Android platform to dominate the market.

The country's competition regulator has accused the tech giant of entering into "one-sided agreements" with smartphone makers to ensure the dominance of its apps.

It has ordered Google to "cease and desist" from such practices.

Google has not responded to the fine or the accusations yet.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in a statement on Thursday that Google was "abusing" the licensing of its Android operating system for a range of smartphones, web searches, browsing and video hosting services.
