It took less than an half-an-hour for the social media account of a publicity-hungry betting company to provide their own take on the news that Aston Villa will make an ambitious bid to try to tempt Mauricio Pochettino back to management in the Midlands.
On Twitter, Paddy Power posted a message that read: 'According to reports, Aston Villa are ready to ask Mauricio Pochettino if he fancies rejecting the chance to join them.'
Even the most ardent supporter of a claret and blue persuasion might have raised a smile and yet the subject of whether or not Pochettino should even consider Villa has so far split opinion with former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan claiming he would be 'bloody lucky' to manage the club.
