Officers blocked off the area near Austin at Pease and began loading boxes of material from the business at 1620 Austin St. into a truck. The effort went on for several hours, and what the agents were seeking wasn't disclosed. The company also has offices in Stafford and southwest Houston which were not open Wednesday.

In a statement, the FBI said, "Given the ongoing nature of the matter, we are not permitted to comment further."
