In a Tuesday decision, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that a group of 21 quality assurance testers at Blizzard Albany, formerly Vicarious Visions, could vote in a union election. Testers at Blizzard Albany argued in front of the board in August that they should be allowed to form a union on their own. Parent company Activision Blizzard countered that a broader number of workers — 88 employees at the Blizzard Albany studio working on Diablo games — should get to vote in the union.
