Running time: 107 minutes. Rated R (strong disturbing violent content and grisly images, graphic nudity and some language.) In theaters.


'Maybe' is right. His latest shocking movie begins with a mother suffocating her eight-year-old son using a pillow, and that turned out to be one of the evening's lighter scenes.
