JPMorgan Chase said it has become the only bank able to accept government deposits in all 50 U.S. states.

The move allows JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) to expand its banking services to new states and municipalities and comes after its consumer banking division launched an expansion effort in 2018 to increase its retail branch presence.

As of August, Chase had branches in all of the lower 48 states becoming the first national bank to have a retail presence in the contiguous United States.

Most states require or encourage banks to have a local branch presence to be eligible to receive or hold government deposits in the state, often described as a qualified public depository.
