By Reuters Published: 22:59 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 22:59 EDT, 19 October 2022 By Yimou Lee TAIPEI, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping would become a "sinner" of all Chinese people if he attacked Taiwan and would not win a war as he would face international sanctions and diplomatic isolation, Taiwan's top security official said on Thursday. China has ramped up military and political pressure against democratically governed Taiwan over the past two years as it seeks to assert its sovereignty claims, which the government in Taipei strongly rejects.
