It's been quite a month for John Ridgeway.

The defensive tackle woke up as a Dallas Cowboy for the first time the morning of May 1, having been drafted by the team in the fifth round just the day before. On May 7, he celebrated his 23rd birthday. On May 13, he signed his rookie contract with the organization and attended his first day of minicamp. May 24, his first day meeting the Cowboys veterans at Day One of OTAs.

And while there's no word on how Ridgeway spent his Memorial Day weekend to close out the month, there's a good chance he was following the example of so many others and hitting a holiday barbecue.
