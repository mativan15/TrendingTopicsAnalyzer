The roar of engines could be heard throughout the city of Kingston Saturday, as bikers hit the road, racing out to 'Ride for Dad', raising money and awareness for prostate cancer research. It's something David Bailey knows all about, having been diagnosed in 2017. He says his life changed on a cross-Canada motorcycle trip, using the very motorcycle he uses today. 'I was on a big trip out west, when I returned I thought, this isn't quite right,' he explains. He says he visited his doctor, and after a blood test, was told the news.
