Congress MP Karti Chidambaram has now approached the Delhi High Court with an anticipatory bail application in the Enforcement Directorate's money laundering case that is linked to the Central Bureau of Investigation's case in the bribes for visa probe.The fresh application comes a day after a Special CBI court in Delhi denied him anticipatory bail in the case noting that the ED's interrogation might be affected if he is armed with an anticipatory bail order.
