Markets regulator Sebi has barred Empiric Trade and its proprietor Niraj Thakur from the securities markets for providing advisory services without its authorisation. The watchdog issued a show cause notice to them in September 2021. The regulator found that Empiric Trade and Neeraj Thakur (noticees) were engaged in investment advisory services without obtaining a certificate of registration. 
The noticees have prima facie collected Rs 83.70 lakh during January-July 2019, Sebi said in an order on Monday.
