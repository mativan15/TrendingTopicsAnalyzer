Union Minister for Tourism, Culture and Development of Northeast G. Kishan Reddy, on Sunday, said it is upto the respective state governments to gather and update data on the births and deaths and 'there is no reason for the Centre to hush up the number of deaths during the COVID pandemic'.'In our federal system, it is the states which collect such data and the Centre only makes a consolidated number for the entire country. Since I was in the Home Ministry earlier, I can tell you the Centre does not have the power to increase or decrease mortality numbers of any state.
