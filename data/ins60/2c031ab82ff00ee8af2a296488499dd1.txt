Software stocks have taken a beating this year, but Goldman Sachs thinks there are some names in the space that can withstand a sharp economic downturn. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF ( IGV ) is down more than 36% year to date. As of Monday, it traded more than 40% below its 52-week high. Of the 118 component stocks making up the ETF, 42 are down at least 50% for 2022, and 78 are trading more than 40% below their 52-week highs. Those losses come as the Federal Reserve raises rates to fight inflationary pressures not seen in roughly 40 years.
