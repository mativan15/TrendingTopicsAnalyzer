New Delhi: Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) wants to start lending to other infrastructure companies including roads and ports with linkages to railway stations. "We have to ensure that our basic strength as a nil non-performing asset (NPA) company is upheld. To ensure that, we will continue our due diligence. The project evaluation and techno- commercial aspects will be strengthened," IRFC chairman and managing director Amitabh Banerjee told ET.

"At no point of time can we afford to compromise on the low cost and no-NPA features of IRFC," he added.
