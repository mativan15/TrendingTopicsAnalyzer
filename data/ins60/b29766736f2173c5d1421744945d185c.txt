Nets head coach Steve Nash said he's 'thrilled' to have sharpshooter Joe Harris back in the rotation after a bout with foot soreness on the same leg he underwent two ankle surgeries last season.

'It's been almost a year, and he's gone through a really horrible time that, you know, you wouldn't want to wish on any player, especially Joe with how hard he works and being in his prime and all that. So for me, it's great to have him in the lineup, and we hope he plays well.'

Harris played his first game since Nov.
