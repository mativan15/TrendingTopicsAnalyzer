IT spending will expand 5.1% in 2023 despite economic uncertainty, but CIOs and other C-level executives will view investments through an optimization lens and pursue digital initiatives with more caution. Those are some of the takeaways from a series of Gartner reports published this week during the market research firm's annual IT Symposium/Xpo event. The studies highlight the continued resilience of IT investment, underscoring the rise of digital businesses and their reliance on technology. They also point to the importance of optimization as businesses look to get the most out of previous IT expenditures, root out inefficiencies and scale operations without adding hard-to-find technical personnel.
