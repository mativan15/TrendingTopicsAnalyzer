WWE announced it would be moving Money in the Bank in Las Vegas, Nev. from the 65,000-seat Allegiant Stadium to the 17,000-seat MGM Grand Garden Arena. Fans who bought tickets to the July 2 event received an email notifying them of the change. CM Punk wasted little time trolling his former employer about moving to a smaller venue. The top AEW star, who will challenge Hangman Adam Page for the AEW World Heavyweight Championship this weekend at AEW Double or Nothing, took to his IG stories to mock WWE's announcement.
