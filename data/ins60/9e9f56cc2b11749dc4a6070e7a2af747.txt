By Reuters Published: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 12:35 EDT, 16 October 2022 San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa will miss Sunday's game at Atlanta due to a groin injury. Bosa joins two other defensive line starters, tackles Javon Kinlaw (knee) and Arik Armstead (foot, ankle), as being out for the Week 6 contest between the 49ers (3-2) and Falcons (2-3). Head coach Kyle Shanahan said earlier in the week he was "really hoping" Bosa would be available. Bosa missed practice Wednesday and Thursday before returning in a limited capacity on Friday.
