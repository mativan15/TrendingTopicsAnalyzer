Ronald Martinez/Getty Images News AT&T CEO John Stankey said Thursday that the telecommunication giant's better-than-expected quarterly results are part of a process of rehabbing the firm's relationship to Wall Street after the turmoil that surrounded its WarnerMedia acquisition and later spinoff. "We understand that we have to build back the confidence of investors and I think we are doing what we need to do every 90 days to make that happen," the head of AT&T (NYSE:T) told CNBC. Stankey's comments followed the release of Street-beating results for Q3.
