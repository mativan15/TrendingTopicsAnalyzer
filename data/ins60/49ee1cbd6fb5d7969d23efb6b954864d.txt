Auburn Basketball continues preparations for the upcoming season and has stumbled into a bit of a roadblock.
Head coach Bruce Pearl spoke with the media ahead of Tuesday's practice and shared that the team has had a recent struggle with the flu. He mentioned that three players were affected, which includes K.D. Johnson, Wendell Green, and Haston Alexander. Green has since returned, while Johnson and Alexander are expected to be out until later in the week.

Pearl also touched base on freshman guard Chance Westry, who recently had arthroscopic knee surgery alongside Pearl.
