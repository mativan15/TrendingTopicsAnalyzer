Wallace would be asset
on Pleasanton council

Pleasanton benefits by electing Dean Wallace for District 1 City Council.

Dean is open-minded, prudent and smart. Evidenced during the Candidates Forum, he was the one candidate that provided actionable items relative to the concerns of Pleasanton residents.

It is easy to state that you want to fix things. Dean steps up with ideas on how to fix things. Dean brings experienced leadership with a fresh perspective in that he is willing to challenge the status quo and initiate productive debate to assure that decisions are in the best interest of our city.
