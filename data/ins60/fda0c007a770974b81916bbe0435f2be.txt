VEEM Ltd (ASX:VEE) shareholders will doubtless be very grateful to see the share price up 31% in the last month. But that isn't much consolation to those who have suffered through the declines of the last year. Specifically, the stock price slipped by 51% in that time. So the bounce should be viewed in that context. It may be that the fall was an overreaction.

With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
