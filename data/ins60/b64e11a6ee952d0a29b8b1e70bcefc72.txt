4:32 PM ETGREEN BAY, Wis. -- It won't help the Packers this week, when they are short on receivers, but veteran Randall Cobb said Friday he expects to return in two to six weeks from the left ankle injury he initially feared was much worse."I felt something pop," Cobb said. "And I thought, 'This is the way it ends.' It's nice to have the good news and to know that I'll be able to come back."An emotional Cobb was carted to the locker room with a towel over his head after he suffered the injury Sunday in the loss to the New York Jets.
