Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said much of the aid increase will focus on mitigating climate change, which many view as an existential threat to low-lying Pacific islands.

SYDNEY—Australia plans to increase aid to Pacific island nations and invest more in security ties with those countries, as the U.S. and its allies seek to counter Chinese influence in the strategically important region.

The Australian government said it would increase official development assistance to the Pacific by 900 million Australian dollars, equivalent to roughly $565 million, over the next four years.
