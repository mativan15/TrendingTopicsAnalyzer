PTIUnion Minister for Commerce & Industry Piyush Goyal.There is a lot of interest among international companies, including in Britain, for defence manufacturing in India because the world sees the country as not only a big marketplace but also a safe place to work, Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said in London. The minister, who is on a two-day visit to the UK on his way back from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, told PTI during an India Global Forum (IGF) event on Thursday evening that the defence sector offers a natural potential investment opportunity in India because of the government's open policies.
