ARTICLE 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations begins: —‘The Members of the League recognize that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety.' When that clause was drafted, in the spring of 1919, it was generally agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that the competition in armaments, which had preceded the World War, had been one of the causes of that calamity. It was pointed out that the extent and efficiency of Germany's military preparations had created in the German people a war mind and a sense of their own invincibility which not only proved fatal in the event, but, in the years before the war, caused the rival group of Entente Powers to answer armament with armament, until it was commonly said that Europe had been turned into an armed camp, and that its peoples were groaning under the burden.
