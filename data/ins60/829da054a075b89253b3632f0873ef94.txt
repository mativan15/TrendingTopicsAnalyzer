George Frey/Getty Images News Generac Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) shares have been absolutely decimated and now barely trade above the $100 level. This represents a huge plunge from the 52-week high of just over $500 per share. As a maker of backup power systems, this company has been a big beneficiary of the housing boom and pandemic which fueled lots of spending as people stayed and worked from home. It's clear that the housing and stay-at-home boom is over, as well as the bull market in stocks.
