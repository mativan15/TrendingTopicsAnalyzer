ARMMY PICCA/iStock via Getty Images CS Disco (NYSE:LAW) is a legal tech company reshaping the legal services industry with its unique, cloud-native, AI-powered Ediscovery tool, extended by a growing number of other services. Disco reported convincing numbers for the 22Q1 quarter showing strong underlying fundamental momentum.

The long-term growth story is still intact, and due to the large recent correction in tech shares an even better buying opportunity emerged.
