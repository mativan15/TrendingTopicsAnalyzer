A freelance worker has shared the details of her impressive Pokémon collection, which includes but is not limited to plushies, food wrappers and special edition cars. 
Grace Caroline, 26, has spent the past 13 years amassing items, which are worth a staggering £42,000 in total.
She said: ‘I own one of the ten Pikachu VW Beetles which was used for promotional reasons back in the late 90s.
‘It cost about £6,350 ($8,000) but it wasn't in the best condition, so I've been trying to renovate it and get it into the best shape which has cost another £3,970 ($5,000) over the past few years.
