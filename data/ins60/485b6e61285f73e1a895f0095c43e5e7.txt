The State Medicinal Plants Board (SMPB) in association with the Chakkittappara panchayat is gearing up to promote the cultivation of medicinal herbs in about 150 acres of land with the support of nearly 200 farmers in the village. The labour force of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) will be used to plant the herbs in the identified areas, including 50 acres of land owned by the Plantation Corporation, in Chakkittappara. 'This is going to be a rewarding venture for the local farmers in the area as they will get a good subsidy from the SMPB and fair price for the ripe plants during the harvest.
