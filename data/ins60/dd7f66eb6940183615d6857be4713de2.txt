At $654.99, the Dell UltraSharp 27 4K USB-C Hub Monitor (U2723QE) is a bit pricey for a 27-inch productivity monitor, even one with UHD resolution. But the cash required buys you an exceptional display. The U2723QE offers a huge range of ports (even for a so-called USB hub or docking-station monitor), all the standard ergonomic features, a joystick-style menu controller, and a screen with a huge color gamut and a sky-high contrast ratio for an IPS panel. Its incorporation of LG's new IPS Black technology gets the credit for the last items, and it's one corker of a monitor: It earns an Editors' Choice award among office displays for discriminating eyes.
