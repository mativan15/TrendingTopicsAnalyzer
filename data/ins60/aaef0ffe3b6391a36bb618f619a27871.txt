(Bloomberg) -- UK opposition parties heaped pressure on the government to call a general election after Liz Truss said she was quitting as prime minister following just 44 days.Truss, who entered office through a leadership vote following the ousting of Boris Johnson earlier this year, is staying on as premier until the ruling Conservative Party picks a successor, which it aims to do by Oct. 28. That means the next leader will be the second in quick succession without a public mandate.Labour leader Keir Starmer said this was unacceptable and blasted the Conservatives in an emailed statement for 'shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people.
