Kassandra Jones has tried really hard to get rid of her student loan debt — including donating her eggs for money. Jones, 28, of New York City, is a freelance videographer specializing in public health communications and social media content strategy; she works primarily with nonprofit organizations.After earning a bachelor's degree in kinesiology and a master's in public health, Jones found herself with $165,000 in student loan debt. "I've probably wasted a year of my life … getting financial advice, going to workshops, researching on the internet, talking to people, applying for grants and scholarships to no avail and very little success," Jones told Fox News Digital.
