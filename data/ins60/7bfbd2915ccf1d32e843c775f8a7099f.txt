Surrey's embattled mayor delivered his state of the city address Wednesday morning. Doug McCallum touted his controversial municipal police force, a number of capital projects and federal funding secured for the Surrey-Langley Skytrain expansion. However, those achievements were largely overshadowed by his ongoing criminal trial. McCallum's address was filled with optimism, highlighting the rapid growth the city has seen. 'Despite the challenges from the COVID pandemic, council never strayed from the goals we set at the start of our mandate,' said McCallum in his speech at the Sheraton Guildford Hotel.
