CNN announced two new editorial initiatives on Wednesday, including a podcast for recently hired radio broadcaster Audie Cornish and the fleshing out of a team focused on covering guns in the United States.

Cornish, who the network hired away from NPR to host a show on the since-defunct paid subscriber streaming service CNN+, will debut a new show on CNN Audio dubbed 'The Assignment with Audie Cornish' next month.

Cornish's weekly show will 'convene conversations with everyday people at the center of debates that are rocking the culture with topics spanning the arts, education, politics, business, and sports – people living behind the headlines in the very heart of the zeitgeist,' the network said.
