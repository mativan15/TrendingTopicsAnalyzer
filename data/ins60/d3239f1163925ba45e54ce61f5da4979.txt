Potterheads are set to be spellbound by the arrival of a Harry Potter coin collection that will feature portraits of both Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III.
Four new coins will celebrate 25 years since the first book, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, was published in the UK.
Pictures of the first 50p, released today, depict JK Rowlings' wizarding world hero who first stole hearts back in 1997.
High demand is expected for the collection, which will be one of ‘a small number' that will see a change of royal portrait midway.
