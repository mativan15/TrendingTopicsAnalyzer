Season one of House of the Dragon may have wrapped Sunday night, but the talk about Westeros continues several times a week for the students taking the new College of Arts & Sciences history class Game of Thrones: Power and Politics in Pre-Modern Europe. The course challenges students to study the five main issues raised in author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, which HBO's eight-season Games of Thrones series was based on: succession, the role of the courtier, hurdles faced by female rulers, moral codes, and the challenges of administering justice.
