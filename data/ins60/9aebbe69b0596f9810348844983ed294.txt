edichenphoto/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesShares of AvalonBay (NYSE:AVB) fell last month amid growing inflation fears and a generally bellicose mood around the world. In April, AVB hit its all-time high and was trading at nearly $ 260 per share, which can be considered quite expensive even for a high-quality company like this REIT undoubtedly is. Less than a month later, however, the price dropped to $200, a 23% decline. Data by YChartsAs of this writing, AVB is trading at about $203 per share, and I believe the stock deserves a buy at that level.
