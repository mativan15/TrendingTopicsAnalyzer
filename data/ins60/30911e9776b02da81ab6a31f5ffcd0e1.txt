Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, with the abrupt reversal in the U.K. government's fiscal plans helping boost sentiment after weeks of turmoil.

By 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.1%, and U.K.'s FTSE 100 climbed 1.1%.

New British finance minister Jeremy Hunt on Monday scrapped almost all of Prime Minister Liz Truss's previously-announced tax and spending measures later Monday, reducing concerns about the size of the increased borrowing needed to fund the plans.
