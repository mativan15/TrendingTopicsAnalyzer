CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Guardians do not hit a lot of home runs but they are pests to opposing pitching staffs. They make a lot of contact and run the bases hard. So when they entered the bottom of the ninth inning on Saturday in Game 3 of this best-of-five American League division series trailing the Yankees by two runs, they did what they do best.

Facing the Yankees reliever Clarke Schmidt, Amed Rosario, the Guardians shortstop, smacked a one-out single with runners on the corners to bring his team within one run.
