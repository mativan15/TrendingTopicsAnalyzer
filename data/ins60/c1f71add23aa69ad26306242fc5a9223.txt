Key Points

Japan's imports grew more than 40% for a fifth straight month in September to hit the largest value on record, Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday, as a slump in the yen added to already high fuel import costs.
Persistent deficits will worsen Japan's terms of trade, causing a shift of domestic income to overseas and undermining Japanese purchasing power.
Once welcomed for making exports more competitive, the yen's excessive weakness is now seen hurting households and retailers by inflating already high prices of imported fuel and food.
