An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from a featured TechCrunch article, written by Christine Hall: Where the Olentangy and Scioto rivers come together lies the city of Columbus, Ohio, a bedrock town famously known as "Test City, USA," boasting demographics that mirrored the country's population, and the home of The Ohio State University. It is steadily becoming an emerging tech scene in the Midwest where startups are finding all the tools needed to develop burgeoning businesses. Venture capitalists injected over $3 billion into the city over the past 20 years, particularly in healthcare and insurance startups, according to Crunchbase data.
