Gotham Knights managed to be one of the few fall releases that did not get pushed to 2023 this year, but from the looks of the review scores currently rolling in, perhaps it needed a bit more time. With a few dozen reviews in from major outlets, Gotham Knights currently has a 70/100 on Metacritic. While that may sound 'average' based on the number alone, with the way game scoring works, that's actually not great, and the aggregated score includes some eye-poppingly negative reviews from major outlets.
