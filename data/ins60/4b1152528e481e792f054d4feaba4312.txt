'My friends don't like me when I get in journalist mode,' Ahmir Khalib Thompson, the multi-hyphenate professionally known as Questlove, admits with a sigh. It's a little after nine p.m. at the Wythe Hotel, and he's just screened the second season of his YouTube series with The Balvenie, Quest for Craft, which is apparently the best excuse yet that Questlove has found for getting curious about his talented friends and their creative processes. Last year's interviewees included Patti Smith and Malcolm Gladwell; this fall, the six-time Grammy winner is talking shop with Mark Ronson, Misty Copeland, Fran Lebowitz, and Kenan Thompson.
