Tony Brown paved his way into Clark Atlanta University, working hard when there were no scholarships. He progressed through the basketball refereeing ranks, finally becoming one of the league's top officials. And he continued to work towards helping others even in the last moments of his battle with pancreatic cancer. Brown received a Stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis in April 2021. Still, he was able to make a full recovery in time to begin working in the NBA replay centre the following season.
