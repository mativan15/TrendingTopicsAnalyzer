The Yankees entered the ALDS with an unsettled bullpen and plenty of question marks about how they would navigate the late innings.
Five games and five appearances later, Wandy Peralta has them feeling a whole lot better and ALCS-bound.
The veteran left-hander finished off a 5-1 win over the Guardians in Game 5 on Tuesday night with another scoreless ninth inning, part of a strong effort from the Yankees bullpen to cover the final four innings of the clincher.
Peralta finished the series — which included him throwing on three straight days for Games 2-4 — with six innings of work, giving up just two runs on four hits while striking out seven.
