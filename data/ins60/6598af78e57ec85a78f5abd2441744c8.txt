Sadio Mane has remarked that he will follow the will of the Senegalese people - and quit Liverpool.

Bayern Munich have been strongly linked with the winger as he prepares to enter the final year of his contract at Anfield.

Ahead of the Champions League final, Mane insisted he will deliver a definitive update after Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid.

Still yet to make such an announcement, the player gave a clear indication of his thoughts in a press conference for his national team on Friday.
