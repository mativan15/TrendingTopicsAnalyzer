The impact of the war in Ukraine and subsequent economic downturn on child poverty in eastern Europe and Central Asia, warns that ripple effects of the surge could result in a steep rise in school dropouts and infant mortality. Data from 22 countries across the region shows that children are bearing the heaviest burden of the economic crisis stemming from Russia's 24 February invasion of Ukraine. While they make up only 25 per cent of the population, they account for nearly 40 per cent of the additional 10.
