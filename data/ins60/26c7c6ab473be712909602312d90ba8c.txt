Observing that Khajaguda lake area has shrunk by one acre up to its Full Tank Level (FTL), the Telangana High Court directed the State government to furnish details of the precise area of the lake as per village ‘naksha'.A Bench of Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice C.V. Bhaskar Reddy, while hearing a PIL petition on alleged encroachment of Khajaguda lake area in the guise of a development project, passed this interim order.'On perusal of material papers, we found that the tank area up to the FTL has shrunk by one acre,' the Bench said.
