A string of recent targeted killings in Kashmir of non-local residents has struck fear in the hearts of many communities living and working in the Valley. Three tragic incidents – the murder of a Kashmiri Pandit fruit grower in Shopian last Saturday and the killing of two labourers from Uttar Pradesh, again in Shopian, in the late hours of Monday – added to the atmosphere of fear. Despite angry protests and repeated reassurances from the government, it is now fairly clear that a purely securitised response is not likely to yield satisfactory results.
