As discretionary funds get crunched, many travelers may cut trips or at least reduce their stay length. Another way they may look to reduce the trip cost while maintaining the travel is to stay at an Airbnb (ABNB 1.24%). I'm not talking about staying at a luxurious house with a private pool, but maybe in the basement or modest accommodation.
This catalyst may allow Airbnb to continue its growth trajectory, even if the economy dips into a recession. With 30 analysts' average price target of $140.43, implying an upside of about 25%, these Wall Street analysts may be thinking the same thing.
