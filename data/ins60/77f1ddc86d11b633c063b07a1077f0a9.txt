By Sabela Ojea Electric-vehicle startup Mullen Automotive Inc. said Friday that it named General Motors Co.'s former executive John Schwegman as its chief commercial officer to focus on commercial electric vehicles. Mr. Schwegman, who spent 35 years in GM and held several executive roles across the auto giant's operations, developed Chevrolet's core electric-vehicle prioritization and relaunched GM's previously retired medium-duty commercial fleet business, Mullen Automotive said. He will be in charge of growing the strategy of Mullen Automotive's electric light and medium duty trucks, and will oversee new enterprise and fleet sales opportunities across all Mullen-Bollinger commercial vehicle categories, the company said.
