TikTok is raising the minimum age from 16 years old to 18 years old to host a LIVE, the company announced on Monday.LIVE on TikTok is a tool in which users can livestream to their audiences. The age increase, which was instituted in order to "protect users," will go into effect on Nov. 23, but the company began testing the ability to restrict livestreams to by age in July.
"As we consider the breadth of our global audience, we already take a graduated approach to the features that our community can access based on their age; younger teens need to be aged 16 or older to access Direct Messaging and 18 or older to send virtual gifts or access monetization features," the company wrote in their blog post about the change.
