(RTTNews) - Shrugging off some somewhat sluggish movements early on in the session, the Switzerland stock market kept surging higher and higher on Monday as buying interest gathered momentum, and eventually ended the day's session on a buoyant note. A positive trend in other markets across Europe, and on Wall Street, aided sentiment. The benchmark SMI ended with a gain of 169.37 points or 1.64% at 10,498.71, around 40 points off the session's high of 10,538.32. All the components of the SMI index ended in positive territory, gaining between 1% and 4.
