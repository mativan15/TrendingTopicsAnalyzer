Transitioning just half of all datacenters to sustainable operating models could cut global energy costs by $7 billion, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang claims.
Building greener datacenters was a central theme of the company's nearly hour-long Computex keynote earlier this month, where Liang touted Supermicro's efforts to reduce carbon emissions through modular server design and encouraging liquid cooling.
'It's our responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of technology by using less power, reducing carbon footprint and e-waste,' he said.
