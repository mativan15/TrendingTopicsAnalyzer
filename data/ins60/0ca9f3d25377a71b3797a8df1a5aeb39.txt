A huge fire blazed at a notorious prison — where political prisoners and anti-government activists are kept — in the Iranian capital. Online videos and local media reported gunshots, as nationwide protests entered a fifth week. Iran's state-run IRNA reported that there were clashes between prisoners in one ward at Evin, and prison personnel, citing a senior security official. The official said prisoners had set fire to a warehouse full of prison uniforms, which caused the blaze. He said the "rioters" were separated from the other prisoners to de-escalate the conflict.
