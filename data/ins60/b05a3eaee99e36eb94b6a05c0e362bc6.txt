Transitioning from a business correspondent to a payments bank five years back, profit making Fino Payments Bank looks for a further upgrade to a small finance bank with internal discussions underway, bank's chief Rishi Gupta said. The bank will approach the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for a small finance bank licence at an appropriate time, Gupta, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Fino Payments Bank said. RBI guidelines stipulate that a payments bank more than five years old can apply for a licence for a small finance bank (SFB), Gupta said.
