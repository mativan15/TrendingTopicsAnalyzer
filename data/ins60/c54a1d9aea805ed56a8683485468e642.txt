New research from the Boyce Thompson Institute on the neurotransmitter serotonin, which carries messages between nerve cells and is thought to play a role in several mental health conditions, could ultimately lead to new therapeutics for anxiety and depression.
Frank Schroeder, BTI faculty member, is co-senior author of 'Parallel Pathways for Serotonin Biosynthesis and Metabolism in C. elegans,' which published Oct. 10 in Nature Chemical Biology. The first author is Jingfang Yu, a graduate student in Schroeder's lab.
