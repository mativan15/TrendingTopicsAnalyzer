The Aurora City Council could vote next week on a redevelopment deal between the city and Hollywood Casino that would move the casino from downtown onto the northeast side of Aurora.

The deal would include at least $300 million in investment by Penn Entertainment into a new casino resort on the west side of Farnsworth Avenue, just north of the interchange with Interstate 88, and another almost $60 million in bonds from the city.

Penn Entertainment would build a casino with 950 gaming positions and a Barstool Sportsbook.
