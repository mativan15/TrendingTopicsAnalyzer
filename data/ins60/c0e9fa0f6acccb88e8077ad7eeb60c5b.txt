It's golf season! For entrepreneurs, that means more meetings on the links rather than in the boardroom or on Zoom. That's great news unless you're dreading getting out on the course because you haven't mastered the game. Who has the time or money to spend on marked-up lessons? If you want to get better, what you really have to do is just practice, and there's a smart way to do that without rushing to the golf course after work every day.With the SLX MicroSim - Home Golf MicroSimulator, you can practice your golf game in your living room — rain or shine — whenever you'd like.
