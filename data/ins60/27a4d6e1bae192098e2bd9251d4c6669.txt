 The second volume in Bryan Caplan's series of his EconLog blog post collections asks How Evil Are Politicians? The libertarian Caplan's answer: very, though some people might be more inclined to use words like 'naive' or 'irresponsible.' Caplan, who holds himself and others to very high moral standards, is deliberate about his use of the word 'evil' for a volume subtitled Essays on Demagoguery and bearing a cover that brings George Orwell's 1984 to mind.
