Tech companies got their way in Texas on Tuesday.
The Supreme Court just blocked a controversial law that allows Texas residents and the attorney general to sue social media companies over their content-moderation decisions. The law, HB 20, prohibits tech platforms from removing or restricting content based on 'the viewpoint represented in the user's expression' and was designed with conservative claims of tech's liberal ideological bias in mind.
HB 20 passed in September but has had a rocky ride through the courts in the months that followed.
