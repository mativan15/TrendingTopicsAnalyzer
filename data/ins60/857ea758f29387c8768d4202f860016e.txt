Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra have auctioned off the trophy they won at the Song Contest for $900,000 (£700,000) to help the Ukrainian army during the war with Russia.
Oleh Psiuk, Ihor Didenchu, Vlad Kurochka, Vitalii Duzhyk, Tymofii Muzychuk and Oleksandr Slobodianyk auctioned off the glass microphone they won with their performance of Stefania in Turin earlier this month.
They raised a further $370,000 (£293,000) by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh wore during the performance.
