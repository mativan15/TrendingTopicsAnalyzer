The BJP Tuesday launched a scathing attack at the tribal council's ruling TIPRA Motha party, claiming that the latter was involved in corruption.
Speaking to reporters at the BJP state headquarters Tuesday evening, Tripura BJP vice president and Lok Sabha MP Rebati Tripura said the TIPRA Motha, which has been running the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTADC) since last year, has failed to deliver on its promises.
He said ample funds were provided to the tribal council but the ADC administration failed to utilise the funds and could not furnish utilisation certificates to the authorities concerned.
