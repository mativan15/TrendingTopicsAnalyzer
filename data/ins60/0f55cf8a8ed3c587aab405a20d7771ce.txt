The "Outnumbered" panelists called out The New York Times for "not doing their job" after former editorial page editor James Bennet blasted his ex-employer over the Tom Cotton op-ed fiasco that cost him his job.Bennet accused the newspaper and publisher AG Sulzberger of caring too much about appealing to its left-wing subscriber base, saying Sulzberger "set me on fire and threw me in the garbage and used my reverence for the institution against me."Bennet claimed he was "bewildered" by his treatment from the paper and other editors during the situation.
