With Daniel LippmanBUCKALEW SIGNS HUMANA: The former Senate health care policy staffer who helped craft legislation in the last Congress to end so-called surprise medical bills has added another major insurer to his client list. Newly filed lobbying disclosures show Humana retained Adam Buckalew of alb solutions back in April to work on 'health care payment policy, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D and other payer policy matters, as well as health care clinical services.'— Humana is part of an industry coalition that last week endorsed legislation that would increase oversight for and streamline the so-called prior authorization process for treatments and tests under Medicare Advantage Plans.
