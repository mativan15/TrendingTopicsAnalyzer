The Bank of England must take account of the crypto industry's competitiveness when it decides how to issue a central bank digital currency, fintech lobbyist Adam Jackson said on Wednesday to a committee of U.K. lawmakers that is set to consider new legislation for stablecoins.

Lawmakers were also warned of emerging fraud risks from coin swaps and blockchain bridges as they deliberate on the U.K.'s Financial Services and Markets Bill.

There's a 'question whether we could apply a competition objective to the Bank of England, when we think about things like central bank digital currency and how that's implemented,' Jackson, who is the director of policy at Innovate Finance, told lawmakers on the Committee considering the bill.
