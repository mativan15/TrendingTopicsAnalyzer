City Foundry STL will open a new entertainment experience in early November for guests to enjoy.

Sandbox VR is set to open Nov. 4 at City Foundry STL in Midtown for guests to experience a full-body virtual reality entertainment experience.

Sandbox VR is an immersive gaming experience that combines full-body motion capture and high-quality haptics (tactile feedback), immersing you right into the game.

"Opening in St. Louis and inside City Foundry STL is extremely exciting,' Steven Zhao, founder of Sandbox VR, said in a statement.
