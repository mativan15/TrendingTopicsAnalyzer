Since its founding in 2016, the Pure Pitch Rally competition has funded 48 area startups, and the event has evolved into an MBA-like boot camp for entrepreneurs, founder Karen Fenaroli said during Monday's event.

Entrepreneurs picked to pitch now have access to seven boot camps annually, covering topics such as branding, pitching, funding and tech development. This year, the startups also gained access to one year of free office space from Plexpod.

Monday's event held at Burns & McDonnell's Kansas City headquarters featured eight startups, all vying to gain the attention of the 'land sharks' – the local and national business leaders each writing $1,000 checks to the startup of their choice.
