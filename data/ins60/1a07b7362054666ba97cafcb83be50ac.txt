Attendance Allowance is a benefit which aims to help older Britons with health conditions stay independent in their own homes for as long as possible. People may be able to claim the support if they are over the state pension age and have a physical or mental disability or illness severe enough to make it hard for them to look after themselves. They do not need to have had a formal diagnosis for their condition to apply for the benefit.They also do not need to have a full-time carer to qualify, however, someone will have needed to have help for at least six months before claiming.
