Bim Xylem (NYSE:XYL) rose 4.1% on Tuesday after analysts at Cowen upgraded the water technology company to Outperform from Market Perform. The investment bank said an expansion of municipal budgets at least through next year and Xylem's backlog of orders for smart infrastructure will boost margins. The company's revenue has declined 5/5% this year because of supply-chain restraints, but orders have risen by about 7% and the backlog is up 60%. The company's customer base of utility companies and federal infrastructure spending should help Xylem weather any economic slowdown, according to Cowen.
