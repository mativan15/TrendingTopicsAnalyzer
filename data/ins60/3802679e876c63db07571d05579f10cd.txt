Popular streaming platform Netflix has announced 'Profile Transfer' feature to prevent password sharing that has been rolled out to all members globally. The "much requested" feature allows users to transfer their personalised recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games, and other preferences to a new account when they start their own membership, said the company. The users will receive a notification through email, as soon as the 'Profile Transfer' becomes accessible on their account.
