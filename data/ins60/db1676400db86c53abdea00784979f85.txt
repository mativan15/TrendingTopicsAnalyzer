The need for dental prosthetics is on the rise, with the global market projected to reach $9.71 billion by 2026.1 In the U.S. alone, approximately 178 million adults are missing at least one tooth and 40 million are edentulous (missing all teeth).2 Conventional methods to manufacture dental prosthetics involve sending digital or analog impressions to a lab with turnaround times averaging 3-4 weeks for some patients. With the advent of digital dentistry and 3D printing, first generation 3D printing technologies have enabled in-office manufacturing of dental prosthetics, but with significant limitations.
