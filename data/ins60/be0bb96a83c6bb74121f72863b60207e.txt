Over the last week and a half, the Chinese semiconductor industry's circumstances have taken a sharp turn for the worse.
The Biden administration announced on October 7 a sweeping set of export restrictions that prevent the export of certain chips and, more important, the sale of tools using certain technologies to Chinese chipmakers. The rules go well beyond those introduced during the Trump administration and are likely to keep Chinese companies several generations behind the leading edge.
The goal of the new rules is to 'protect our national security and prevent sensitive technologies with military applications from being acquired by the People's Republic of China's military, intelligence, and security services,' Alan Estevez, Undersecretary of Commerce for industry and security, said in a statement.
