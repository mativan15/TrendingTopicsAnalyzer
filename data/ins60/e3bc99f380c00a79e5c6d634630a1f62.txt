TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 -- the first in-person Disrupt in three years -- is in the books. And as always, we end it by crowning the winner of Startup Battlefield.

It began with 20: As seasoned TechCrunch readers will know, startups participating in the Startup Battlefield were hand-picked to compete in the event. During the first two days of Disrupt, the companies pitched before judges -- multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders -- for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Battlefield Cup.

After much deliberation, the TechCrunch editors pored over the judges' notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Advanced Ionics, AppMap, Intropic Materials, Minerva Lithium and Swap Robotics.
