After setting up your Individual Retirement Account (IRA), you will be working to achieve the best possible returns to ensure a comfortable retirement. However, there are limitations on what you can do. Certain transactions are prohibited and you must exercise caution.

To assist IRA holders, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides a list of prohibited transactions that retirement savers should avoid.
