Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you'd like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so hereI got this email from a contact in December of 2020.One interesting roll-up you or your readers might find interesting is Community Brands. Community Brands is the parent of a consolidation of software companies focused on serving non-profits and churches. Their religious unit is Ministry Brands (https://www.ministrybrands.com/our-brands/) and as you can see, they essentially keep the public facing products in place, but it's all owned by the same org.
