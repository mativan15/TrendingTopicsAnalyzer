University of Melbourne's Professor James McCaw, who led a team that provided epidemic analysis to the federal government, said during the pandemic it 'became clear we shouldn't have closed schools for as long as we did'.Loading'Once vaccination rates crept up and Delta was in circulation keeping schools open should have had a higher weighting in the decision-making process,' McCaw saidNSW Secondary Principals' Council president Craig Petersen said disadvantaged communities were the most significantly impacted by closures.
