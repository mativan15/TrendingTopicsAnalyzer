appledesign Life Sciences tool makers including Repligen (NASDAQ:RGEN) and Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE:BIO) are down in Wednesday trading after competitor Sartorius (OTCPK:SARTF) said it was seeing "a swift normalization of demand following two years influenced by strong special effects due to the pandemic." Sartorius (OTCPK:SARTF) reported Q3 2022 results in which revenue beat expectations.
