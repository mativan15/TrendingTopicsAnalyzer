The IRS has started sending letters to around nine million households nationwide reminding Americans who have not yet filed their tax returns this year that they could be eligible for $1,400 stimulus checks — or even $2,800 checks for married couples.
Americans who haven't yet claimed the third installment of stimulus payments that were sent out by virtue of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan can still do so — if they file a 2021 tax return.
The plan, one of the first major pieces of legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden, included rental assistance, tax rebates, vaccine distribution funds, and direct payments to Americans who were struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic.
