May 31—BELLAIRE — A woman previously sought on animal cruelty charges in separate cases spanning two states is facing five new felony charges in Antrim County.

Brooklynn Beck, 28, of Central Lake, appeared before an 86th District Court Magistrate, after five charges of killing and torturing animals were added to a single animal abuse charge.

Michael Patrick Turland, 43, with addresses in Central Lake and Kingman, Arizona is listed as a co-defendant.

Beck and Turland, a man officials previously identified as Beck's fiancé, are being investigated by law enforcement officers in Michigan and Arizona after more than 200 exotic animals were found deceased inside freezers on property the couple occupied, officials said.
