Meta will sell Giphy, the online gif database it bought in May 2020 for $400 million, the company said on Tuesday. It was given little choice in the matter, after being ordered by the UK competition watchdog to offload the company.Following a lengthy consultation process, the Competition and Markets Authority issued a final report on Meta's acquisition of Giphy on Tuesday, in which it said the purchase would limit access to gifs by other social media entities, making rival platforms less attractive to users.
