A milestone measure that would tap the brakes on the spread of cryptocurrency mining operations burning fossil fuels in New York has passed the state legislature. The bill approved early Friday by the state Senate would establish a two-year moratorium on new and renewed air permits for fossil fuel power plants used for energy-intensive 'proof-of-work' cryptomining. Proof-of-work is the blockchain-based algorithm used by bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies. The bill, touted by supporters as the first of its kind, now goes to Democratic Gov.
