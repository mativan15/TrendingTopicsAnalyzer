THE SEIZURE of his mobile phone, how it was unlocked without due procedure, and how 'drug chats' referring to a period in 2018 in Los Angeles were misinterpreted are the key factors at the heart of the Narcotics Control Bureau's clean chit for Aryan Khan in the Mumbai cruise raid case, according to the chargesheet filed by the NCB in a Mumbai court.
The other main reasons in the chargesheet include: no recovery of drugs from him, no medical test conducted to prove consumption, WhatsApp chats not leading to any drug transaction and no witness claiming that he consumed drugs.
