Sarah Herrlinger, the tech giant's senior director of accessibility policy and initiatives, said that by making devices more accessible for those with disabilities, Apple was ultimately making better products. Last week, the iPhone maker unveiled a suite of new accessibility tools which are being rolled out later this year.
