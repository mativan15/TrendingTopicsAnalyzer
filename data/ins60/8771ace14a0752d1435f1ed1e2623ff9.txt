summary

The exciting adventures of Filipino entertainer Luis Borromeo and the Javanese Miss Riboet, in vaudeville and Malay opera respectively, tell an important story of Southeast Asia's 1920s Jazz Age. During a time of political turmoil, Borromeo and Riboet were leading figures in the development of a localised hybrid urban popular culture. Exemplary of the pioneering cultural brokers of the time, these two artists were among the first of the region's local pop culture celebrities. Audiences seized on this popular culture—situated somewhere between high art and banal entertainment—to engage with the modern, to channel emancipatory activities, to articulate social critique and to propagate an inclusive nationalism with a distinct cosmopolitan flavour, without being radically anti-colonial.
