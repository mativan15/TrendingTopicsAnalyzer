Dame Judi Dench has hit out at The Crown, saying the hit Netflix drama has begun to verge on "crude sensationalism". The legendary actress, 87, has called for a disclaimed to be added to each episode, believing the "fictionalised drama" poses as a risk because "a significant number of viewers" will take its events as historical truth. Dame Judi added "wounding suggestions apparently contained in the new series" will prove "damaging" to the monarchy and cannot go unchallenged. The Bond icon's comments come after concerns voiced by former prime minister Sir John Major, about the content of The Crown's highly anticipated fifth series, which will launch on November 9.
