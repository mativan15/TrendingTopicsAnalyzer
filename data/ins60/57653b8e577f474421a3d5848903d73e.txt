Microsoft may have plans to build out its own Xbox storefront on mobile platforms, according to its recent filings.
Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard is currently under investigation by the UK's Competition and Market Authority (CMA). First spotted by The Verge, in Microsoft's filings, the company says that it wants to expand its gaming offerings on mobile, and that includes building a mobile storefront.
'The transaction will improve Microsoft's ability to create a next-generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard's content.
