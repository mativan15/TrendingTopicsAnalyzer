The Cleveland Guardians were down to their final strike, but the scrappy team got it done again.The Guardians scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the New York Yankees 6-5, and now lead the best-of-five series two games to one.Wandy Peralta retired the first five batters he faced, but after back-to-back bloop hits to put the winning run at the plate, Aaron Boone went with the rightly Clarke Schmidt. However, he allowed back-to-back singles to load the bases, cut the Yanks' lead to one, and put the tying and winning runs in scoring position.
