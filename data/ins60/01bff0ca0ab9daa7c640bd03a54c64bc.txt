Donald Trump and his sons had repeatedly asked for a new judge in NY's $250 million fraud lawsuit.

The current judge, state Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, once held Trump in contempt of court.

On Wednesday, Engoron's boss denied the Trumps' request to move the case.

Donald Trump and his two eldest sons on Wednesday lost what had been their escalating legal effort to switch judges in New York Attorney General Letitia James' $250 million fraud lawsuit.
