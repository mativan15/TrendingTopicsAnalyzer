Today (Oct. 21), Yungeen Ace unveils a new single titled 'Industry Invasion,' a melodic offering that sees the Floridian star rapping about his position in the streets:

'I'm too real that's why these f**k n**gas here can't feel me, I'm still in the streets, this dope still opened to kill me, money don't make me, n**ga, I already done ran through millions, f**k this rap s**t, I see my target, I'mma shoot through some civilians, this s**t an industry invasion, come from the trenches where it made me, man, these labels better not play me, they either gon' love me or hate me, I don't f**k wit none of these rappers, I'm surrounded with killers connected with trappers…'

'Industry Invasion' arrives some months after All On Me, a 17-song body of work with additional features from Kodak Black, Boosie Badazz, Baby23, Toosii, Spinabenz, and YBeezy.
