Farmers on Tuesday rejected the minimum Support Price (MSP) declared for wheat crop by the Centre saying that it was far below the enhanced input cost and the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan report.
On Tuesday, Centre announced Rs 2,125 per quintal MSP for wheat 2023-24.
Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda) General S Jagmohan Singh said that this hike is nothing when the cost of agricultural inputs has skyrocketed. 'As per the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee report, the MSP of wheat should have been as per C2+50% formula,' he said, adding that apart from this even the rates of other rabi crops, which can be a good alternative under the diversification policy, are not much attractive.
