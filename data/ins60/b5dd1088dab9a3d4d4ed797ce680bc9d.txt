Government officials in New Zealand will be required to cut back on jargon and 'complicated English words' in their public-facing messaging, under the Plain Language Bill passed by Parliament on Wednesday. It requires royal assent to take effect.The legislation defines plain language as 'clear, concise and well organized' language that is 'appropriate to the intended audience.' All reporting agencies will be required to appoint 'plain language officers' responsible for ensuring compliance and interfacing with the public.
