MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayende attacked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over her statement that Enforcement Directorate (ED) is not a political tool and is an independent agency saying that she is "misleading" the common people.While attacking the Finance Minister, she said, "This is a joke. She is misleading people through her statements in a foreign country.""ED is being misused the most in the states, where BJP doesn't have the government. Everyone can see this, but Nirmala Ji can't.
