TU IS Elevator Pitch My rating for Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited's (NASDAQ:KC) stock is a Hold. The focus of my prior June 21, 2022 update for Kingsoft Cloud was the company's "short-term headwinds." My attention turns to KC's financial outlook in the current article. The outlook for KC is murky. The good news is that Kingsoft Cloud's gross profit margins should expand in the future in tandem with the pivot away from the CDN or Content Delivery Network business. The bad news is that KC is expected to generate slower topline growth in the next two years, and the reduced scale of the CDN business could also have a negative impact on its long-term revenue growth prospects.
