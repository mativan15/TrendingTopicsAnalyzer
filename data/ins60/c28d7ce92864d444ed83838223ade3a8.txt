From its inception, Bit.Store focused on building a community when it entered a market entirely dominated by platforms that kept their users isolated from one another. The obvious question at the time was, "what if all these users had the opportunity to collaborate?" If millions of users could signal their sentiments and decisions, a public aggregate of that would be an extremely powerful tool for small investors.

Bit.Store began by designing social functions to allow investors to support one another and share knowledge, while safely and easily participating in the crypto investment market.
