LONDON — 
Britain's new Treasury chief Saturday acknowledged mistakes made by his predecessor and suggested that he may reverse much of Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss' tax-cutting plans in order to bring stability to the country after weeks of economic and political turbulence. 
Jeremy Hunt, who was brought in Friday to replace Kwasi Kwarteng as Treasury chief and restore order in Truss' administration, warned of "difficult decisions" to come. He said taxes could rise and public spending budgets would likely be squeezed further in the coming months.
