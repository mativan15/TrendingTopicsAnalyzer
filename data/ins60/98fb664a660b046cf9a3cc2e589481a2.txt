Fewer Torontonians voted in advance polls for this month's municipal election than did in 2018, despite having more days to vote, in what one political scientist is chalking up to an uncompetitive race.

Just 115,911 Toronto residents cast ballots between Oct. 7 and 14 — a 6.75 per cent decrease from four years ago, according to a news release from the city. Voters also had three more days to vote in advanced polls this year than they did in 2018.

'We're very lucky here. Voting is easy,' said John Beebe, founder of the Democratic Engagement Exchange at Toronto Metropolitan University.
