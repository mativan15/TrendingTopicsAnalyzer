Published: 01:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 01:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 Footy players have now joined in with climate crusaders who urged Fremantle to sever ties with their major sponsor, energy giant Woodside, but an AFL Hall of Fame legend has slammed them for doing so.Dockers stars Bailey Banfield, skipper Nat Fyfe, Alex Pearce and now-retired David Mundy are among those players to raise concerns about their club being sponsored by Australia's biggest exporter of natural gas. It comes off the back of 10 high-profile Fremantle fans who wrote a open letter to the club in which they urged the organisation to sever ties with Woodside, who has been in partnership with the club for almost 13 years.
