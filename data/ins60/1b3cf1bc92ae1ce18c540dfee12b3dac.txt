Jeremy Hunt has announced he is creating an economic advisory council to assist the government as it seeks to repair the damage caused by last month's mini-budget. The council's membership will include Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff to George Osborne when he was chancellor, and Karen Ward, who advised another former chancellor, Philip Hammond.
Announcing the measure in the Commons, the new chancellor said the group will provide "more independent expert advice" to ministers.Prime Minister Liz Truss was in the chamber for around half an hour as he spoke, after ducking an urgent question from Labour earlier.
