It's time to order your Cajun-Style Turkey.

Popeyes Louisiana Chicken is now taking pre-orders for their 'fan favorite Thanksgiving staple' ahead of the holiday season.

The fast-food New Orleans-style chicken chain is changing the way people can order their Cajun-Style Turkey, making it available to purchase online rather than having to call or visit local restaurants in year's past, which consumers can still do.

Pre-orders, which began on Oct. 18, can be made with this link. Shipments will begin on Oct.
