Croatian Donna Vekic said she was ‘freaking out' after the door of the helicopter she was traveling in to the Guadalajara Open in Mexico opened mid-flight.

The 26-year-old, runner-up in San Diego last week, arrived safely and made light work of her first-round opponent Laura Pigossi but her pre-match routine was hardly ideal.

'It was great, except the door opened mid-flight,' Vekic told reporters. 'It was actually my fault because when we were sitting at the beginning, it was so hot, so I opened the door a little bit to have some air.
