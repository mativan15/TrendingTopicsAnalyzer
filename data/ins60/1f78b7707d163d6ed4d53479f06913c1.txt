In an effort to fight misogyny and inculcate the values of gender equality among students at a young age, Snehitha, the gender helpdesk of Kudumbashree, has launched gender clubs, christened Genderclub@School, on a pilot basis in eight schools and five colleges in the district.This has been conceived as an extension of Snehitha@School, which was launched in five schools a couple of years back, but turned dormant since then as these educational institutions remained closed owing to the pandemic. While the gender clubs were formed when schools reopened in the middle of the academic year last November, no activities could be held.
