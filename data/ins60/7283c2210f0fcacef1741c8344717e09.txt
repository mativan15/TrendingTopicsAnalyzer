In light of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which runs throughout October, Google is building features directly into Google Assistant with the aim of encouraging people to test early and be well-equipped with relevant information. Revealed in a blog post by Google on Wednesday, these features will "help people take early steps to protect themselves against breast cancer". When interacting with Google Assistant, the smart device will now present U.S. users with information about breast cancer, such as "the critical importance of early detection and mammography", from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
