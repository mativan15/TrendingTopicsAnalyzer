Antonio Conte's side might have yet to wholly convince but can go top of the table tonight with a win at Old Trafford, though Erik ten Hag has pulled off some big results on home soil this season.Like Spurs, there is an argument to suggest United still haven't pulled up any trees but the fact remains they have beaten Arsenal and Liverpool at the Theatre of Dreams.Cristiano Ronaldo alone settled this fixture last season with a stunning hat-trick, though Spurs have improved an awful lot since.One of the biggest games English football has to offer, it should be quite the spectacle under the lights.
