After a two-year hiatus the Windsor Craft Beer Festival has returned to Willistead Park in Walkerville showcasing craft beer products from local breweries and abroad. The unique attraction is an opportunity for beer-lovers to sample special limited edition blends that are dynamic and one-of-a-kind creations. In addition, some of the best culinary arts from the area will round out a diverse offering of beverages and fine food. For Adriano Ciotoli, co-owner and founder of the festival, the community excitement for festival has been building.
