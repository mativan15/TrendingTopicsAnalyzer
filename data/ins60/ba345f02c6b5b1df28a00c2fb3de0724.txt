STOCKHOLM — The thieves strike along roads in rural Sweden, usually between midnight and 3 a.m. They employ blunt force, sometimes using a saw or driving over the cabinets that hold their targets: high-technology speed cameras.

After briefly stopping in September, the thefts have resumed, with the police investigating 160 cases in all. It can cost more than $22,000 to replace each camera and repair the damage.

The motivation for the thefts is a mystery. Could it be high-tech thieves grabbing high-hanging fruit? Or speedsters fed up with Big Brother nabbing them amid the solitude of country roads?

Perhaps the most intriguing theory has circulated in local news reports: that the cameras could be used in drones by Russia's equipment-strapped military in its war on Ukraine.
