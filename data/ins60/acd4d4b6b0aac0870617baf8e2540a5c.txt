Calls for Prime Minister Liz Truss to resign from her post in Downing Street are growing as more and more MPs voice their concern about the direction of the Government. Westminster has been plunged into crisis after Suella Braverman stood down from her position as Minister of the Home Office. Ms Truss' authority was further damaged after a vote on fracking was hijacked as a "confidence" vote in her, banning shale gas extracations despite the Government's plan to plough ahead with it. And on Wednesday evening, chaotic scenes involving members of the Conservative Party in Westminster emerged on social mediaIt all comes just a week after she sacked her choice Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng whose mini-budget sent the market and mortgage rates spiralling.
