The S&P 500 index has finally launched a strong, oversold rally. There is always the chance that this is the beginning of a new leg in a bull market for stocks, but that seems unlikely. In any case, we will follow the indicators without trying to make a 'guess.' Oversold rallies typically carry to a level slightly above the declining 20-day moving average. In the case of the S&P SPX, -0.37%, that MA is at about 4040 and has already been surpassed. SPX rallied into resistance at 4150 and seems to have stalled there for now.
