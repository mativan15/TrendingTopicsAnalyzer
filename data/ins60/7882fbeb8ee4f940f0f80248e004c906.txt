AgenciesTraders of interest rate futures are currently pricing in better than even odds of a year-end Fed's policy rate in the range of 2.75%-3%, a full two percentage points higher than it is today.Calling high inflation the Federal Reserve's "number one challenge," Vice Chair Lael Brainard on Thursday said she backs at least a couple more half percentage point interest rate hikes, with more on tap if price pressures fail to cool. "Market pricing for 50 basis points potentially in June and July, from the data we have in hand today, seems like a reasonable path," Brainard told CNBC.
