The U.S. economy added 390,000 jobs last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far exceeding the 328,000 new hires economists had predicted and signaling that the labor market is still hot despite fears of an impending recession.  May also showed promising signs for women's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. An estimated 397,000 women entered the labor force last month, bumping women's participation rate to 58.3%, just one percentage point below their pre-pandemic labor force participation rate, reports the National Women's Law Center.
