Few noticed that day last month when a Republican super PAC began running ads in the congressional district just north of New York City that is represented by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D), the head of the committee tasked with trying to keep his party's House majority despite strong Republican head winds.

Now, just over two weeks to Election Day, spending by that PAC has ballooned to $6 million and prompted one Democratic PAC to spend money to help Maloney, and another - which Maloney overseas - may jump in, too.
