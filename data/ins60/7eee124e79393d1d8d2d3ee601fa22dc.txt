PEORIA − Judge Kevin Lyons sentenced a Peoria man to 38 years in prison, saying the defendant threw his life away in the "parking lot of a gas station in Peoria."

Lyons was referring to Arenza Brown, 20. He was found guilty in September in the deadly shooting of Josh Perkins on May 9, 2021, at the MacArthur Shell gas station, 200 N. MacArthur Highway.

"What a shame," Lyons said.
