Two other New England spots made Money magazine's list as well.

For those looking to put down roots, Money magazine says Massachusetts boasts two of the best places to live in America.

The publication recently released a list of the 50 best places to live in the U.S., and Somerville ranked No. 7 while Milton ranked No. 17. The best place to live in America, according to the ranking, is Atlanta.

'In our annual ranking of the top places to live, we look at the things that matter most to people: economic opportunities, quality of life, diversity, and where the best futures lie,' Money magazine wrote.
