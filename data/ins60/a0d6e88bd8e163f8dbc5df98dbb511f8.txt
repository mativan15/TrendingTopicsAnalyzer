SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a 'super bad feeling' about the economy and needs to cut about 10 percent of jobs at the electric carmaker, he said in an email to executives seen by Reuters.The message, sent on Thursday and titled 'pause all hiring worldwide,' came two days after the billionaire told staff to return to the workplace or leave, and adds to a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders about the risks of recession.Tesla employed almost 100,000 people at the company and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021, according to its annual SEC filing.
