No tick is here to stay in curling. Canada has adopted the new rule the World Curling Federation tested at the women's and men's world championships earlier this year. The "no tick" rule will be played at the 2023 Canadian men's and women's championships and in the playdowns to get there. The tick shot as a strategy emerged from the implementation of free-guard zone. Stones in front of the rings, or guards, can't be removed from play in an end until five rocks are thrown. A well-executed tick shot pushes those guards to the wings, but keeps them in play while opening up access to the house.
