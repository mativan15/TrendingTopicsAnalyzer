By Adriano Marchese Stocks in Toronto were firmly lower mid-trading Friday, dragged by nearly all sectors. In the session, only the Canadian utilities sector showed gains, while consumer durables, tech services and producer manufacturing led the declines. BRP Inc. shares fell after the company said it continues to grapple with macroeconomic headwinds, which weighed on its first quarter and are expected to linger throughout the year. At midday, Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index was down 1.03% at 20816.
