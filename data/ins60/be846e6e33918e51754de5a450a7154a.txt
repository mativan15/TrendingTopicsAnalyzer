Newfoundland and Labrador's PC Opposition is questioning Andrew Furey's judgment over the premier's stay at a luxury lodge owned by the billionaire behind a controversial hydrogen plant proposal in western Newfoundland.

As first reported by the online news organization allNewfoundlandLabrador, Furey and his father — Senate Speaker George Furey — stayed at the Rifflin' Hitch Lodge as part of a posh fishing trip in July 2021.
