Decks were cleared for urban local body polls in Bihar, which were earlier scheduled in two phases on October 10 and October 20 but had to be cancelled, after the state government on Wednesday told the Patna high court that it was ready to form a dedicated commission in line with the Supreme Court order and go by its report for holding the elections with quota to other backward classes (OBCs) and extremely backward classes (EBCs).By evening, the government also notified the dedicated commission, with JD(U) leader Naveen Arya as its chairman, besides naming three other members.
