KPIs, or key performance indicators, measure how effectively a company is achieving key business goals. Right now all companies—whether they've been around for 100 years or are just emerging—are focusing on KPIs that reflect modern technologies. Legacy KPIs need to be revised by organizations that want to take advantage of new data, new technologies, and novel algorithms, according to Michael Schrage, a research fellow at the MIT Sloan School Initiative on the Digital Economy. During Fortune‘s Emerging CFO event on Wednesday, in partnership with Workday, Schrage discussed his assessments with Harmit Singh, EVP and CFO at Levi Strauss & Co.
