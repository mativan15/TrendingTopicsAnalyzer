Community AccessBy Renee DiNinoJun 1, 2022Wednesday, June 1, 2022 Connecticut residents are able to start applying for a tax rebate just for families. Any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child 18 years old or younger on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible. While not everyone was qualified to receive the rebate, the Department of Revenue Services estimated more than 300,000 households could meet eligibility. Those applicants may see that extra money relatively soon.
