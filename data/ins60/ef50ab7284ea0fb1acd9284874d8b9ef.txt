Digital asset custody provider Copper said its Swiss unit received approval to join the country's Financial Services Standard Association, a self-regulatory organization recognized by the Swiss regulator, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

The association, known by its German initials VQF, gives a stamp of approval to the London-based company's compliance with Switzerland's anti-money laundering laws, it said by email on Monday.
