Call it 'rebellious self-expression' if you like. But investors would probably come up with a fruitier phrase for Dr Martens' post-float share price performance.Listed at 370p in January last year for a £3.7 billion valuation, shares in the bootmaker were down to 182.9p by the middle of last month.
