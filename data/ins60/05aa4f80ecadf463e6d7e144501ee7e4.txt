A squad of officers conducted illegal searches and arrests in New Jersey as a pretext to rob residents out of cash, federal prosecutors say.

Now, a sergeant is facing decades in prison.

On May 26, a federal jury convicted Michael Cheff on one count of conspiracy to deprive persons of civil rights and one count of falsification of a police report, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey.

The 51 year-old was a sergeant with the Paterson Police Department in Paterson, New Jersey, a city about 20 miles northwest of New York City at the time of the case, court documents show.
