Donald Trump 's administration underplayed concerns around the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic and watered down reports laying out public health guidance in a bid to advance the former president's political goals, a new House report has revealed.

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on Monday published its latest report, drawing evidence from emails, documents and witness interviews to detail how Trump's White House sought to 'compromise the scientific integrity' of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
