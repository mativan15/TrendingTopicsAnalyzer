AgenciesBihar deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad YadavThe BJP on Saturday slammed JD(U) president Lalan Singh for using "highly objectionable and unparliamentary" words while alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 claimed to be from an extremely backward class though Gujarat has no EBC category. While Singh refused to apologise for the comments he had made on Friday, RJD leader and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav asserted that the JD(U) head did the right thing by attacking the PM directly.
