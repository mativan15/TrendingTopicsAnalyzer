AgenciesAlex Jones, the far-right American conspiracy theorist, was ordered by a Connecticut jury on October 12 to pay $965 million to the families of the eight Sandy Hook victims and an FBI agent for making false claims that the killing was a hoax. A Texas jury had earlier mandated Jones to pay about $50 million to the parents of a six-year-old boy slain in the shooting in a separate lawsuit in August for repeatedly lying about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which resulted in the deaths of twenty children and six adults.
