At the National Rifle Association's conference in Texas, a progressive delivered a passionate speech thanking the group's leaders for his many 'thoughts and prayers' – and not everyone got the joke.Despite numerous pleas to call the event off, the NRA held its annual meeting in Houston this past weekend, even as the state reels from a school shooting that left 21 dead in Uvalde. Somehow, Jason Selvig – who comprises one half of the prankster duo 'The Good Liars' – managed to crash the event.During a part of the conference when NRA members directly spoke to the group's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, Mr Selvig stepped up to the microphone.
