Streaming prices are going to keep increasing, according to one prominent media executive."Streaming pricing is going to go up," Paramount (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish warned during Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit, adding that consumers will likely absorb the cost increases since "streaming represents an extraordinary value in general for the consumer."Bakish highlighted the recent price hikes of competitors like Netflix (NFLX), which last boosted monthly prices in January, as well as Disney (DIS), which announced price increases across its various streaming properties in August.
