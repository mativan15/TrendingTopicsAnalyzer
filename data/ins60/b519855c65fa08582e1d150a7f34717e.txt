America is becoming a more diverse place. When final numbers were compiled from the 2020 U.S. Census, statistics showed all of the nation's population growth over the last decade came from people of color, as population counts from the nation's white majority saw a near double-digit decline.The nation's politics have become more diverse too, with today's 117th U.S. Congress considered the most racially and ethnically diverse in history—just as the five previous Congresses were.Despite all of this, some experts say both Republicans and Democrats are ignoring people of color.
