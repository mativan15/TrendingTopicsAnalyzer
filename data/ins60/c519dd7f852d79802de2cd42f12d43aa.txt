(RTTNews) - The Switzerland stock market closed on a firm note on Monday, in line with markets across the region, as an announcement of additional stimulus in China, and relaxations in coronavirus restrictions in Shanghai helped raise optimism about recovery in the world's second largest economy. Data showing an increase in Swiss non-farm payrolls in the first quarter contributed as well to market's rise. The benchmark SMI, which stayed positive right through the day's session, settled with a gain of 89.
