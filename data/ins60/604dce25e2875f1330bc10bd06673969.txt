For over 85 years, Chester Jefferies has made gloves fit for a Queen. But now, the company that once supplied the royal family is closing down, with its owner saying many young people lack the interest or patience to take on the 'old-fashioned craft'.Mark Pearce, who has worked at Chester Jefferies glove makers in Gillingham, Dorset, since he was 14, alongside his father who founded the company, predicted that the bespoke industry could cease to exist in Britain within 10 years.Pearce says despite spending 'thousands' on training young people, the amount of time it takes to become qualified enough to be a glove maker, and the low salary that apprentices usually receive, meant that most young people did not want to stay long in the field.
