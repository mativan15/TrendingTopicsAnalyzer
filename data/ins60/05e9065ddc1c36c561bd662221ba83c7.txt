Oct. 15—MORGANTOWN — It was sort of a subtle point made by Neal Brown late Thursday night, in the moments following West Virginia's 43-40 victory against Baylor.

He sort of threw it in there in between comments of Tony Mathis Jr. and Kaden Prather being the stars of the game and how the ball is just now beginning to bounce in the Mountaineers' favor.
