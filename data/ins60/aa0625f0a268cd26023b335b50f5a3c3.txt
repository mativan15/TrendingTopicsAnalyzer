(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Biden administration to weigh in on whether a Seattle ordinance requiring hotels to offer health insurance to low-wage workers is prohibited under the federal law regulating employee benefits.The court invited U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar to file a brief in a bid by the ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC), a business group, to revive its challenge to the 2019 law, which requires larger hotel operators to provide up to $1,375 a month in insurance benefits or direct payments to workers.
