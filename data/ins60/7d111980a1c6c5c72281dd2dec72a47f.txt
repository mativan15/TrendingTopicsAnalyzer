Douglas London, who was previously an operative within the CIA's Clandestine Service, believes Vladimir Putin did not appoint Surovikin on merit but because the Russian Air Force Commander lacks the connections within the military to launch a coup. Putin installed Surovikin, nicknamed "General Armageddon," to oversee Russian operations in Ukraine this month after a run of heavy defeats at the hands of Ukrainian forces in Kherson and Kharkiv.Mr London told CNN: "I don't think Putin makes any decision on a senior position without considering what does this do for me, what is the threat? What is the advantage?"I don't think merit is really primary in his deliberations.
