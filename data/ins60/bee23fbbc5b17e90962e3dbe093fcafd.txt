Naked Wines has made around 6% of its workforce redundant after a failed growth strategy forced a restructuring.The online retailer, which connects its subscribers with products from independent winemakers, said 30 staff had gone as it looked to create a "leaner and more focused organisation", saving around £18m.
Naked had spent big on marketing and wine inventory in a bid to accelerate growth and build on a surge in customer numbers and revenue during the COVID pandemic.Financial losses deteriorated when the cost failed to meet demand and shares have lost 85% of their value this year alone.
