Jyothi Yarraji on Monday created history by becoming the first Indian woman to clock a legal sub-13 second time in 100m hurdles while smashing her own record at the National Open Athletics Championships here on Monday.
The 23-year-old Yarraji, representing Railways, cruised to victory in 12.82 seconds and, with the wind gauge reading 0.9m/s, she could not be denied her national record timing a second time.
She had won the same event in the National Games in Gandhinagar in a time of 12.79 seconds but was supported by wind that exceeded the permissible limit.
