A new poll reveals that Americans lack confidence in the current state of democracy in the United States, just weeks before midterm elections.According to a survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 52% of U.S. adults said democracy is not working well, compared to just 10% who believe it is working "very well" or "extremely" well. The poll also showed that 67% are very or somewhat dissatisfied with how "things are going in the United States," although those numbers improved for questions about participants' feelings about their home states and communities.
