The Trudeau government is facing mounting pressure to act more urgently on its election promise to create a new $4.5-billion mental health transfer — a pledge that has stalled despite critical gaps in care that are contributing to Canada's ER crisis.
In an open letter to federal Mental Health and Addictions Minister Carolyn Bennett, 65 national health associations that represent and advocate for patients, physicians, nurses and mental health specialists are calling on Ottawa to immediately move forward with this platform pledge.
