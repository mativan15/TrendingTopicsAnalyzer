Edwin Tan/E+ via Getty Images Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) is a poster child for the group of stocks that benefited from the early pandemic boom but ultimately faced a reckoning over the past year with the shifting market cycle. Indeed, ZM rallied by as much as 800% at its peak during 2020 fueled by the trends in remote working and virtual learning, only to reverse nearly all gains with the ongoing "return to normal" forcing a reset of expectations. The stock is currently down about 40% year to date and a humbling 80% from its all-time high.
