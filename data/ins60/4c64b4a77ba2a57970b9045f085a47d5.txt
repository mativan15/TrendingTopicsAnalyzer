In holdover news for Friday, Paramount's PARA Smile held its own against the mighty Michael Myers. Parker Finn's buzzy breakout earned $3.73 million (-31%) on Friday for a likely $12.7 million (-31%) third-weekend gross. That will give it a jaw-dropping $71.5 million 17-day total. One more hold like this, and it's sure to pass $100 million domestic (a milestone Halloween Ends may not reach since both previous Blumhouse entries were uber-frontloaded).
