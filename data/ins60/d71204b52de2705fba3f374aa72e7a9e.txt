Katharine Hatch, Lake Bluff's village clerk, is taking on a new role as she has been appointed a village trustee.

Village President Regis Charlot announced at the Oct. 10 Village Board meeting that he had selected Hatch to fill the vacancy on the board created with last month's resignation of Trustee Kathryn 'Kate' Briand, who moved out of the village.

Hatch, 43, moved to Lake Bluff in 2013 and was elected village clerk last year, running unopposed. Now she will continue her village service as a trustee.
