ESTERO, Fla. (PRWEB) October 19, 2022 Bella T. Altura, who was born in Germany at the beginning of the Nazi era, has completed her new book 'The Construct of a Scientist: Secrets of a Marriage and Politics': a touching tribute to her husband's life and legacy.

It was her job in a clinical laboratory that brought her together with the subject of this book, her husband, Burt, who taught her how to enjoy life again.
