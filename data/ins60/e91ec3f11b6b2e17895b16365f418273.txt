A transgender woman has said she detransitioned as her children struggled with her identity.
Samantha Kane, from London, had her first gender reassignment surgery in her 30s, transitioning from male to female, before detransitioning twice.
Appearing on This Morning, Samantha spoke to hosts Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary about changing her gender three times.
According to charity Stonewall, most people who transition do so without any regrets and detransition does not in and of itself mean regret.
