The high-performance 1973 'S' came from the factory with a 2.4-litre, 141kW engine and the then-novel 'Type 915' transmission that offered a simplified shifting pattern. It had now-iconic 'deep-six' Fuchs wheels and a new front chin spoiler that reduced front-end lift so effectively that Porsche adopted it across the 911 line.It was expensive. According to RM Sotheby's, the 911 S had a base price of just over $10,000 (roughly R155,514 then and about $65,000 – roughly R1,010,848 – in today's money) before any additional options.
