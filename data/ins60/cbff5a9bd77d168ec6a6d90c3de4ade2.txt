Digital currency trading firm CrossTower continues to pursue a deal to buy the assets of bankrupt Voyager Digital Ltd. out of bankruptcy, a lawyer for CrossTower said at a court hearing Wednesday. "My client CrossTower remains fully invested in doing a transaction here," John Ashmead, CrossTower's lawyer, said at the bankruptcy court hearing before Judge Michael Wiles. Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX emerged as the winner last month in an auction for Voyager's assets. CrossTower participated in the auction, in which Voyager received multiple bids.
