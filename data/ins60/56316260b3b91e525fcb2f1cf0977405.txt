Many in public service have forgotten how good they have it at the expense of those who pay their wages. How many of us can hold the country to ransom if we don't get the pay rise we need to ease the cost of living squeeze this year?
It used to be that a decent pension made up for lower wages, yet average salaries in the public sector now trump those paid by private companies.
Public sector pensions also provide priceless peace of mind. Those who work for the Government or the NHS will never have to worry about fees, risk, or when the next stock market crash is coming.
