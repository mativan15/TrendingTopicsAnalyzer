Elon Musk asks interview candidates this math riddle — and it's leaving TikTokers stumped.

In Ashlee Vance's 2015 biography Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, the author alleged the billionaire always posed the complex problem during job interviews at SpaceX. Influencer @pinkpencilmath shared the question in a video.

'Can you get it?' @pinkpencilmath asked in the caption.
