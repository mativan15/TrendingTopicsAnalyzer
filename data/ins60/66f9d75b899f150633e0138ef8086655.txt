Rose Zhang enters this week's U.S. Women's Open at Pine Needles fresh off a victory sweep at the NCAA Championship and another impressive first: She's the first student-athlete to sign an NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) deal with Adidas.
Zhang called being the first to sign with Adidas both humbling and a dream.
The NIL scene in college golf varies wildly, but good friends Rachel Heck and Zhang have built an impressive portfolio of partnerships. Together they've won 12 college events over the past 18 months, including two NCAA individual titles.
