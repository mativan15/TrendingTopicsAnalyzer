India will strongly oppose continuation of moratorium on customs duties on e-commerce trade at the WTO's meeting in Geneva next month as it is adversely impacting the developing countries, an official said. The official said allowing the moratorium to lapse is important for developing nations to preserve policy space for their digital advancement, to regulate imports and generate revenue through customs duties. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) members have agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions since 1998 and the moratorium has been periodically extended at successive ministerial conferences (MC), which is the highest decision making body of the 164-member body.
