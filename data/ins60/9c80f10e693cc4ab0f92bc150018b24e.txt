Cardi B wailed as she watched a yacht sink before her very eyes while on holiday over the weekend.
The 29-year-old WAP rapper filmed the troubled boat as it plunged deeper and deeper into the water, while hilariously commentating on the scenes at hand.
‘What the f*ck? Oh my, it's sinking! Ya'll see this?' Cardi was heard yelling with her voice getting more flustered.
‘Oh my God, they can't do nothing? There ain't no big boat that could save it?' she continued.
