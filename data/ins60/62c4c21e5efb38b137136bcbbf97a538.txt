ROME —

Italian politician Giorgia Meloni, whose Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, said Friday that she and her allies have asked Italy's president to give her the mandate to form what would be the nation's first far-right-led government since the end of World War II.

Meloni and her campaign allies met for about 10 minutes with President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale presidential palace. She emerged to tell reporters that the right-wing coalition had unanimously indicated to Mattarella that she deserved the mandate to govern.
