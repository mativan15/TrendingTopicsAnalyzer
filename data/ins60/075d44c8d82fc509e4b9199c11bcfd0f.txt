This story is from the team at thespinoff.co.nz. A lot of thought has gone into the bottle of water that quietly appears on your table during your fancy restaurant dinner. 'It's minimalist, unassuming, in the background,' says general manager Rachael Armstrong. She's talking about Antipodes, the New Zealand water company approaching its 20-year anniversary. Their bottles are created out of recycled glass, made to order, and are shorter and stockier than others. That's by design: Antipodes doesn't want its products getting in the way of couples looking each other in the eyes over a romantic dinner.
