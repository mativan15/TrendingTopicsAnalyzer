Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a Monday address warned that there is a 'threat of famine' on a global scale due to Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports.
Zelensky said a Russian blockade on the Black Sea was preventing exports of grain from Ukraine, which along with Russia is one of the world's biggest producers of wheat.
'Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country,' said Zelensky.
