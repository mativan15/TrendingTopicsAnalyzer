Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) legislator Sudhakar Singh, who resigned as the agriculture minister of Bihar on October 2, has once again trained his guns against chief minister Nitish Kumar alleging that there is one 'master' in the state government and the rest are all mere 'rubber stamps'.'There is one malik (master) in the state government and the rest are Mukhtars (agents). They are all rubber stamps except some leaders of my party (RJD) who are good,' Singh, also the son of RJD state president Jagadanand Singh, alleged while addressing a rally on the occasion of his felicitation function organised by Kharwar tribal groups at Hata market in Kaimur district on Sunday afternoon.
