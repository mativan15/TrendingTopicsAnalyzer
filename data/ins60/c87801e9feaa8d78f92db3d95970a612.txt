A man is upset about the rising costs of his friend's wedding.

He asked Reddit's 'Wedding Shaming' forum to weigh in. The Reddit poster doesn't feel like the bride and groom are being considerate about the financial commitments necessary for the wedding. After the costs entered the thousands, he wasn't sure what he should do.

'My close friends are getting married,' he explained. 'It's my first wedding as an adult, as well as for a lot of other people attending. We're all in our early-mid 20s and just a couple of years out of college, so we're not swimming in cash.
