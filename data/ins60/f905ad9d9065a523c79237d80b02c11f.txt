The biggest political event of the year is happening this weekend — and it's not an election.
Beginning on October 16, some 2,300 delegates from around China will assemble in Tiananmen Square's Great Hall of the People for the Chinese Communist Party's week-long Party Congress. After much behind-the-scenes deliberations among party elites, the choices for China's top leadership for the next five years will be presented to the country.
