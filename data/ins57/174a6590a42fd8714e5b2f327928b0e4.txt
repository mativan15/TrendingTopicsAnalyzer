Never mind 'Sussudio.' This is just plain woo-woo.
Phil Collins' ex-wife Orianne Cevey allegedly paid $30,000 to a black magic expert in an alleged bid to gain control over the superstar, newly filed court papers reveal.
Franck Pala, Cevey's former head of security, said under oath that Cevey had planned to put 'some substances' — referring to a sort of 'black magic' potion — in Collins' wine.
According to documents seen by The Post, Cevey purportedly wired the money to a man in Colombia for his services.
