Joyfolie began as many companies do, with the simplest of intentions. Jessica Hernandez, CEO and founder of Joyfolie, didn't have any connections in the industry, but she knew her passion for art would be worth something. With no business background and only an idea of what it took to start up a company, Jessica built Joyfolie from scratch by perfecting each step along the way: Designing products Finding wholesale buyers who could carry them affordably online through sites like Etsy Creating website content such as product descriptions and blog posts, all while learning more about running shops as both the customer and business owner.
