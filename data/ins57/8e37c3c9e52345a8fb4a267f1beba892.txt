The six Congress MLAs who had kept away from the Taj Aravali resort in Udaipur  joined the rest of the ruling party's legislators there on Sunday, two days after the party's 'deadline'.The Congress has sequestered its legislators at the resort ahead of the June 10 Rajya Sabha elections. The about-turn of the six, including a minister, came following a meeting with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot late on Saturday. The MLAs were flown to Udaipur in a private aircraft. They were accompanied by Gehlot himself, and reached around 1 pm.
