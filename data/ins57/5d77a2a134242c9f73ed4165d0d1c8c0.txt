Whisky leaders have warned that Jeremy Hunt's decision to reverse the duty freeze on Scotch will undermine the industry's ability to create jobs.Mark Kent, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said that business could only work 'on the basis of certainty and stability' but these had been stripped from the industry after the new chancellor reversed the duty freeze announced by Kwasi Kwarteng little more than a fortnight ago.Alcohol duty will now rise in line with inflation in February, adding 7p to the price of a pint of beer.
