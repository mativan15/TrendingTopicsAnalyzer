The Ethiopian military has taken control of three towns from rebel forces in the war-torn northern Tigray region, the government said, amid growing alarm about the resurgent conflict pitting federal forces and their allies against Tigrayan rebels.
'The ENDF [Ethiopian National Defense Force] has taken control of the towns of Shire, Alamata and Korem without fighting in urban areas,' the government said in a statement on Tuesday, after the rebels said earlier that Shire had fallen.
Earlier, the Tigray Central Command said in a statement that Shire had fallen, adding that the rebels were in a 'life or death' struggle.
