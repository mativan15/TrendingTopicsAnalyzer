FuelCell Energy Inc (NASDAQ:FCEL) shares are trading lower by 5.19% to $2.94 Wednesday afternoon, possibly in sympathy with peer clean energy manufacturing company Plug Power, which reportedly cut its 2022 hydrogen production outlook and abandoned plans for two plants. What Happened? Per a report by BNN Bloomberg, Plug Power has reportedly abandoned plans for plants in Pennsylvania and Canada. BNN Bloomberg says Plug Power has also experienced permitting delays for another site in New York state.
