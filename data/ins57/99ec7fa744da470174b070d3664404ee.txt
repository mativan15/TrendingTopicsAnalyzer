The Nets won their second consecutive preseason game, this time in a 112-102 victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Target Center on Friday.

The preseason finale, however, wasn't about a win or loss result. It was about how the Nets looked on both ends of the floor before the games begin to count in the win-loss column.

The answer is a resounding 'great.'

The Nets jumped out to an 11-1 lead in the first quarter, leaving Wolves fans — who stand until their team scores their first point of the night — on their feet until Rudy Gobert hit a free throw three minutes and 15 seconds into the period.
