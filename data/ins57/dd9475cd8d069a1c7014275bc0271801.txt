People saved during the Holocaust by Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, offspring of survivors saved by Wallenberg, ambassadors of countries that have given honorary citizenship to Wallenberg, as well as ambassadors from other countries, along with representatives of human rights and Holocaust survivor organizations, were among the people who gathered at the residence of Swedish Ambassador Erik Ullenhag on Tuesday to honor Wallenberg's memory on the 110th anniversary of his birth.

Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat stationed in Budapest, is credited with having saved thousands of Jewish lives by issuing what was known as a Schutz Pass – protective passport – or as so many Hungarian Jews called it, a 'Wallenberg passport,' which saved them from being deported to Auschwitz.
