EDMONTON - The first United Conservative backbencher to publicly call for Premier Jason Kenney to quit says he is running to replace him.'The last couple of years people in Alberta have felt ignored,' Todd Loewen said in an interview Thursday, a day after announcing on social media that he had registered for the UCP leadership contest.'We need to have a change in leadership style moving ahead, a little bit more collaborative. I just thought I would put my money where my mouth is,' Loewen said.'I have complained a lot about politics in the past two years and it's now time to step forward and give Albertans choices.
