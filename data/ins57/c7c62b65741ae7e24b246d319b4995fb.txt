In a bid to boost religious tourism in Uttarakhand, the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given its nod to the development of a ropeway project between Sonprayag to Kedarnath shrine in Rudraprayag district. This project once completed will benefit thousands of pilgrims who visit the Kedernath shrine every year.
According to the officials the ropeway will significantly reduce the time taken by pilgrims to reach the Kedarnath shrine. At present, pilgrims have to trek 16 kms from Gaurikund to the shrine, which takes the whole day, while the ropeway will enable them to travel from Sonprayag to Kedarnath in just an hour.
