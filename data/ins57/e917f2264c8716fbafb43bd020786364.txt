A Cape Breton community has come together to help a senior who has gone nearly a month without power after post-tropical storm Fiona hit the region. As of Thursday, large trees were still covering Clarence Dawe's property, including three on his roof, and he was still waiting for power to be restored 27 days after it went out. The 77-year-old veteran from Sydney Mines, N.S., told CTV News on Thursday that he had reached out to his local councillor and MLA for help, but that none had arrived. However, that changed on Friday, when more than a dozen volunteers showed up at Dawe's home to clear the trees from his property.
