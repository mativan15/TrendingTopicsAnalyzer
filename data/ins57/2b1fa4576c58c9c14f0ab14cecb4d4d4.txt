PATNA: Bihar health minister and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday refused to take back the suspension of Dr. Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of Patna's Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), as confrontation seemed imminent between the Bihar government and the Indian Medical Association (IMA), which questioned the former for not suspending the bureaucratic head of the health department for the shortcomings in the state health sector.The IMA on Saturday had written separately to chief minister Nitish Kumar and governor Phagu Chauhan, seeking their intervention to revoke the suspension of Dr Singh, who was suspended on Friday for alleged administrative lapses in management of dengue patients at the hospital, without being given an opportunity to defend himself.
