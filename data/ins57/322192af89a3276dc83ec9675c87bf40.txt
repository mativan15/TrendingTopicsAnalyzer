(Bloomberg) -- Stocks, bonds and currencies from emerging economies stand to reap the rewards of a potential peak in the US dollar, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. An almost 3% slump in a key gauge of the greenback since a high point in mid-May suggests a rebound in developing markets, which tend to outperform the rest of the world in the months following a cyclical dollar peak, according to Caesar Maasry and Jolene Zhong.'Weak US dollar cycles tend to bode positively for emerging-market assets,' they wrote in a Thursday note to clients, pointing to attractiveness in the MSCI China Index and early-cycle emerging markets in Southeast Asia.
