The artwork depicts a bustling throng of people gathered at Burnden Park football stadium, former home of Bolton Wanderers.

It was among a series of paintings that went under the hammer at Christie's modern British and Irish art evening sale on Wednesday.

The sale of the artwork, organised by The Players Foundation, has been the subject of controversy previously, with the Mayor of Salford, Paul Dennett, saying the new owner of the painting must keep it 'free to access'.
