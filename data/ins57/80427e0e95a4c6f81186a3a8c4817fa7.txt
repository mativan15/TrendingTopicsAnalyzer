Premium Bonds are the savings account offered by National Savings & Investments (NS&I) and instead of earning interest, Britons with Premium Bonds are instead entered into a prize draw each month. For each £1 investment, a person will receive a unique Premium Bond number which is then put into the draw. If someone invests £100, then they receive 100 different Premium Bonds numbers. Last month, NS&I increased the prize fund rate from 1.40 percent to 2.20 percent. This increased the odds of winning from 24,500 to one to 24,000 to one.
