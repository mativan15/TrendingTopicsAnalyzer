Schroders (SDR.L) reported a drop in assets under management, with the UK fund manager saying that assets dropped to £752.4bn ($843.9bn) from £773.4bn in the three months through September.

The UK's largest standalone asset manager saw more than £20bn exit its Solutions business arm, which houses the firm's liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies.

LDI funds came under pressure since prices of UK bonds tumbled from the end of September.
