Getty Images | Gene Kim Dear Work It Out, I'm back in the office 3 days a week and have somehow forgotten how to dress myself in anything other than soft pants. Is now the moment to take the leap and become a "uniform person"? And if so, what should I add to my small "capsule" wardrobe? Or are uniforms dumb and limiting? Should I do one of those clothing rental services? Everything is overwhelming.Please help me figure out how to put as little thought into this as possible, yet look fashionable and like a boss.
