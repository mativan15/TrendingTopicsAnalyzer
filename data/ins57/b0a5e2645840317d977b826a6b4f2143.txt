A service disruption in Malaysia's eVisa portal leading to subsequent announcement of single-entry visas into the country has left Indians wanting to travel to the country fuming. The Malaysian High Commission in New Delhi announced on its social media last week that due to the service disruption of the eVisa portal, the single-entry visa into Malaysia will be temporarily processed by the visa section at the consulates in Chennai, Mumbai, or New Delhi.

This means that Indian citizens will now have to personally hand over the visa applications at the Malaysian consulates.
