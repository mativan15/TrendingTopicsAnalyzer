While you might measure how sweaty you are by the size of your pit stains, for avocado growers understanding how much water their trees are losing on a hot day can be a little harder to quantify. Thermal imaging and drones are calculating how much water trees are losing through transpirationThe technology helps farmers to know how much water to use for producing better, more sustainable fruitThe trial is one of 50 different projects being tested across the regionBut a trial of drone technology in Bundaberg, Queensland, is hoping to change that by mapping how much water orchards lose (or transpire, as it's known in plants).
