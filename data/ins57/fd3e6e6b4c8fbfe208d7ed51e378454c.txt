The latest official data on the state of the public finances and consumer spending makes for grim reading as the country awaits its next leader.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that public sector net borrowing came in at £20bn last month - £3bn more than economists had expected.

The report pointed to a record debt interest payment total of £7.7bn for the month of September - much of which could be attributed to rising inflation as payments are linked to the RPI measure.

Government spending increased by £5.
