Fears that the Fed will raise rates too high is what's keeping stock prices down, according to Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel, who predicted a big rally next year as policy won't be so tight much longer."I'm staying put," he said of his outlook for US stocks in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday. "I certainly wouldn't be surprised if a year, year and a half from now we're 20% to 30% higher. I think stocks are undervalued greatly in the long run."Siegel has flaunted a bullish stance on the market, even as other experts on Wall Street have sounded alarms for a recession and an imminent market crash.
