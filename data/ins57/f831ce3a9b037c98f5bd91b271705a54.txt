'People assume that younger investors are all the same; but they're not,' Leibowitz says. 'They all have different strategies, different needs and risk appetites,' he says.LoadingYoung investors are also climate-change aware and have an appetite for shares in companies that would likely benefit from countries' attempts to reduce carbon emissions.For example, lithium miners Core Lithium and Lake Resources are the two most traded Australia-listed shares on the Stake platform. Both have seen strong rises in their share prices this year.
