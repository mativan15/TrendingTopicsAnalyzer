In 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made a decision to step down as senior working royals. Their decision prompted a move to the US to begin a new life and to work to "become financially independent". Since their exit, the couple have received ongoing backlash and their popularity has plummeted. Following a new poll that has revealed their popularity has decreased, the pair have been warned by the Daily Mail's Consultant Editor Andrew Pierce to "start behaving like royals [again]" in order to win back the British public.
