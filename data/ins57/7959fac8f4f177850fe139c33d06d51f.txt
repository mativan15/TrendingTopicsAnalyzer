An Australian court has heard that Blockchain Capital – which operated the ACX crypto exchange that collapsed last year – used customer deposits to fund another part of its business instead of keeping the money on reserve, according to a Sydney Morning Herald report.

The company's former chief technology officer – who left the company in 2018 and is not accused of any wrongdoing – told liquidators he was instructed by Blockchain Global's co-founder to transfer bitcoin from customer accounts to other parts of the business.
