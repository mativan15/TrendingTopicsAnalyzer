By Gurdip Singh Singapore has set up an inter-agency task force to help businesses, research and educational institutions, which may be suppliers to critical information infrastructure operators, tackle the growing scourge of ransomware. Announcing this on Wednesday at the 7th annual Singapore International Cyber Week, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said ransomware is a threat common to all, and organisations with poor cyber-security practices are particularly vulnerable. "Ransomware criminals can be opportunistic and highly sophisticated," said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.
