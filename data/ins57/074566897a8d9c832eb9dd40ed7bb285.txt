With pandemic relief grants running out and enrollment falling faster than expected, the Minnesota State college and university system is preparing its largest ever state funding request for the upcoming biennium.

The system wants a $350 million increase in state support to pay for a tuition freeze, increased student services and financial aid, job-training improvements and increased core funding for the 26 colleges and seven universities.

Chancellor Devinder Malhotra said he's proposing such a 'bold and aggressive' request, not because he wants a piece of the state's huge budget surplus, but so that the system's campuses can continue to support the state's economy.
