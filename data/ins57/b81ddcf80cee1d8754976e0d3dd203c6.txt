In the first few minutes of Hulu's The Hair Tales, host Tracee Ellis Ross lays out her aims. 'My hope is that these conversations that we have create more space for belonging and self-actualization,' she says. 'It can feel like it's just a conversation about hair. But it's not. Especially not for Black women.' 'It never is,' her interview subject, Oprah Winfrey, agrees. And so it goes: Over six episodes, the docuseries invites Black women to discuss all things hair-related, from their individual memories to the decades or centuries of history leading up to them, to the idea of hair as a method of self-expression or a reflection of social change.
