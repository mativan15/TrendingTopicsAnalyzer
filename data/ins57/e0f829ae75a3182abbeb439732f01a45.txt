Nigerian opposition presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar told a local broadcaster in July that he amassed his wealth by running a private transportation business while employed as a public servant. Days ago, his rival Bola Tinubu claimed Abubakar told his interviewers he made his wealth from selling cars. This is partly incorrect; Abubakar admitted to owning a fleet of taxis during his time as a state employee, not selling cars. However, Tinubu's main point that Abubakar flouted regulations is correct.
