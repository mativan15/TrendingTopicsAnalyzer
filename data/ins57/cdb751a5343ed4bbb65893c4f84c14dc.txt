Swedish conservative Ulf Kristersson secured parliamentary backing as prime minister on Monday with the votes of his new three-way coalition and, for the first time, allies in the far-right populist Sweden Democrats (SD).With the support of 176 MPs to 173, the 58-year-old will be sworn in by King Carl XVI Gustaf on Tuesday morning and then inform the Riksdag parliament of his priorities of his centre-right administration.After an election dominated by asylum policy and soaring gangland shootings, the coalition agreement signed on Friday promises to 'limit the rights of asylum seekers as far as is legally possible' and deport foreign-national 'criminals' who have yet to be 'convicted of a crime'.
