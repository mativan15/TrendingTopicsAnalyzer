Britain's Prime Minister Liz Truss has shredded almost all of her three-week-old economic package amid another day of political humiliation as one of her most senior colleagues was forced to declare to parliament that she was not hiding 'under a desk'. Penny Mordaunt, a former Truss leadership rival who now serves as leader of the Commons, took questions in Truss' place on Monday (local time) and had to deny the charge from Labour MP Stella Creasy that the prime minister was 'cowering under her desk and asking for it all to go away'.
