Of the two undefeated teams remaining in the Big Ten, only one is in action this week in a slate that includes five conference games: Michigan (7-0) is on a bye, along with Illinois, Michigan State and Nebraska. Ohio State (6-0), steady at No. 2 in this week's AP poll, hosts Iowa (3-3, 1-2) with the Hawkeyes looking to pull off the upset. Elsewhere the Minnesota Gophers (4-2, 1-2) travel to No.16 Penn State (5-1, 2-1) and Wisconsin (3-4, 1-3) looks to bounce back from a 34-28 overtime loss to Michigan State in Week 7 when they take on Purdue (5-2, 3-1), who will sit atop the Big Ten West with a win.
