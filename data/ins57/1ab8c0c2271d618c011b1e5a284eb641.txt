Prime Minister Yair Lapid intends to amend the Nation-State Law if he is reelected as Prime Minister, he told Israel's Arabic language news outlets on Tuesday evening.

"I oppose the Nation-State law and I think it should be changed and a section of civil equality added to it. There were talks about this, that a section be added to the basic law: human dignity and freedom," said Lapid, adding that since the law was passed in 2018 he has been against it.

"At the time I was strongly opposed to the Nation-State Law and in the Knesset plenum I said 'the State will not humiliate its citizens.
