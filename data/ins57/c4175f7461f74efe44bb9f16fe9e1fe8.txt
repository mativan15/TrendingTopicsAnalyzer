Most of the employees of leading IT services companies in the country are looking out for more flexible job opportunities even as companies have started asking workers to return to office, a new survey shows. About 88% of employees in top IT companies are ready to quit their current jobs, according to the survey by staffing services firm CIEL HR Services. Out of them, around 46% – mostly working mothers and caregivers – are looking for work from home (WFH) opportunities as their current employers want them to return to offices, while another 46% are willing to leave for better paying jobs.
