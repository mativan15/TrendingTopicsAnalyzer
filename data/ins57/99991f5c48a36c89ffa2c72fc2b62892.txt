Two batches of Hindus from Pakistan's Sindh province reached Jodhpur this week, alleging persecution and discrimination in relief work following flash floods in that country. The migrants, who belong to the Bhil community and came from Sindh's Tando Allahyar district, expressed willingness to settle in India and said they don't want to go back. Chaturaram Bhil, who came with his wife and eight children, said the two batches had around 100 people from his community. Both groups came to India through the Attari-Wagah checkpost.
