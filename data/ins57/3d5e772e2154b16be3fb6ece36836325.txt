In the wake of this week's deadly school shooting in Texas, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has proposed using funds intended to combat the COVID-19 pandemic on efforts to reduce doors at schools.McCarthy made the remarks Thursday during an interview on Fox Business Channel's Fox Business Tonight. The California Republican pondered whether Salvador Ramos, the suspected shooter in Tuesday's elementary school massacre, could have been stopped from entering the school if it had fewer doors. He proposed using untapped COVID-19 funds to address mass shootings by redesigning school entrances.
