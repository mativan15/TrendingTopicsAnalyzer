Since 2020, the operation has grown so much that Isaac's parents bought a shed so they could store the hundreds of donated items. 'We'd always donated to food banks, and during the pandemic he would take food parcels into school which would be given to people in need,' said his mom Claire. 'Being the resilient little lad he is, he said ‘it's alright, we'll give them food at my house,'' said Claire.
