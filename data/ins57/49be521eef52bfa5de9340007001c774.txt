The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Wednesday directed OSB Developers to share the status of the construction of its project OSB Golf Heights in Sector 69.The DTCP also asked the developer to submit how much money it had so far received from its buyers and to look into why banks were refusing loans to allottees for the project. 'We have sought details of the buyers, payments made and other related issues. Also it has been decided that those buyers who have paid the developer only 5% of the money will be given 20 days to pay at least 20% more,' senior town planner Sanjeev Mann said.
