A week ago, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin said following his re-election as DMK president that he wakes up every day afraid that he will find one of his party leaders embroiled in a new controversy.
Stalin had a legitimate ground to make the statement as leaders such as A Raja, S Senthil Kumar, K Ponmudy, and KKSSR Ramachandran have made comments and remarks that have drawn the party into controversies that seemed avoidable. Now, joining the list of DMK leaders who have stirred up a new row is state Finance Minister Palanivel Thiagarajan, popularly known as PTR, whose outburst on Thursday revealed the faultlines in the party's Madurai city leadership.
