'Now we can start to reboot this competition and get fans back through the turnstiles and get fans engaged in the narratives, and that should be a little bit easier this season as we're not changing venues and dates sometimes at 24 hours notice, just because of COVID.'Since its inception in 2005, the A-League has boasted a string of marquee signings, the most notable being Dwight Yorke and Alessandro del Piero, both at Sydney FC. After an absence of high-profile visitors the past few years, Melbourne Victory will field former Manchester United and Portugal star Nani, while Brisbane Roar's team includes another striker with a Premier League pedigree, Charlie Austin.
