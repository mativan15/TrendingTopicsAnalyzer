The Warriors knew they could not afford to fall into an 0-2 hole at home in the NBA Finals, and their urgency and desperation was evident on the floor in Game 2.
Golden State pulled away from Boston in the second half and evened the series at one game apiece with a 107-88 win.
It was another third quarter explosion to set the Warriors up with a big lead entering the fourth, but the Celtics didn't have a lights-out shooting quarter in them again this time. Other than Jayson Tatum (28 points) and Jaylen Brown (17), the only Boston player with double-digit points was Derrick White with 12, while Golden State forced Boston to commit 18 turnovers.
