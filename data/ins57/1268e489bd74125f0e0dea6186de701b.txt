CLEVELAND — The Yankees acquired Harrison Bader mostly for his glove, but his bat would like a word.
For the second time in three games, Bader crushed a solo home run, though this time it was not enough as the Yankees fell to the Guardians in a crushing 6-5 walk-off loss in Game 3 of the ALDS on Saturday night at Progressive Field.
The Guardians had just cut the Yankees' lead to 4-3 in the bottom of the sixth inning when Bader walked to the plate with one out in the top of the seventh against Sam Hentges.
