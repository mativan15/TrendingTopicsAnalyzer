The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the provincial government with the assistance of mediator William Kaplan will start working together today with the goal of negotiating a new collective agreement for Ontario's 50,000 frontline education workers. Among other things, the union wants a yearly wage increase of $3.25/hour (11.7 per cent), early childhood educators in every kindergarten class, five additional paid days before the start of the school year, 30 minutes of paid daily prep time, an increase in overtime pay, and a $100 million investment in new job creation.
