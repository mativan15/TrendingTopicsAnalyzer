In a significant decision, Bhagwant Mann-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Punjab on Friday announced to revert to the old pension scheme (OPS) for state government employees. 'The cabinet has given in-principle approval to implement the OPS, regarding which details will be shared soon,' said chief minister (CM) Bhagwant Mann in a video message, while terming it a historical decision and the 'best Diwali gift' ever to the employees. Mann said AAP national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had asked him to deliver on the promises made before elections.
