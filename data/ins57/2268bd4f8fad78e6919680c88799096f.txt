The pound has rallied on Thursday as financial markets gave a 'damning' reaction to the announcement that Prime Minister Liz Truss is stepping down after just six weeks in the job.

Sterling shot up to 1.13 US dollars before the speech as markets anticipated that Ms Truss would resign, before paring back gains slightly to stand 0.4% higher at 1.126 US dollars after her statement.

Yields on gilts – or UK Government bonds – have also eased slightly in response to the Prime Minister's decision.

UK 30-year gilt yields, which fall as bond prices improve, fell back by 0.
