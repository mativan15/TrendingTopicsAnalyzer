It has been formalised in the rules of cricket as a run out but seems the debate over 'mankading' is not going to be over soon. The latest episode is from the fifth over of the third and final T20I between England and Australia at Canberra on Friday. Pacer Mitchell Starc was bowling to Dawid Malan with Jos Buttler - yes, again - at the non-striker's end.

While walking back to his mark after a delivery, the pacer indicated to Buttler that he was straying outside the crease at the non-striker's end and could be run out.
