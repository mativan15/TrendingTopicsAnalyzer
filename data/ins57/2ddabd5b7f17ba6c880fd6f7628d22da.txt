The No. 13 NC State Wolfpack (5-1, 1-1 ACC) and the No. 18 Syracuse Orange (5-0, 2-0) meet in a conference game at JMA Wireless Dome. Kickoff is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET (ACC Network). Below, we analyze Tipico Sportsbook‘s lines around the NC State vs. Syracuse odds, and make our expert college football picks and predictions.
The Wolfpack won 19-17 last week against Florida State in Raleigh, but the game came with a huge price tag. QB Devin Leary, voted the ACC Preseason Player of the Year, suffered a right shoulder injury, and he is out indefinitely.
