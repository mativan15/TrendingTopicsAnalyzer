May 31—After having hosted a successful Sunflower and Pickle Festival, The Cottage Farm Stand and Baking Company will celebrate the Strawberry with its inaugural Strawberry Festival next month.

"I just said, 'Hey, let's have a strawberry festival and try to promote local strawberries and ourselves," owner Marlene Knight said. "We kind of threw it out there, and it really has taken on a life of its own."

Located at 6869 Kentucky Highway 56, The Cottage opened two years ago, and in addition to selling a variety of breakfast and lunch items, customers can also pick up fresh local produce and classic canned treats like pickles, relish and beets.
