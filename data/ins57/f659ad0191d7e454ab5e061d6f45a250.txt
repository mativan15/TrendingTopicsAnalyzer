A revamped space in FedExForum is one of several new additions that the Memphis Grizzlies hope will be a slam dunk for basketball fans and other guests coming to the venue.

The Grizzlies recently unveiled the Big River Steel Edge, a new area on the terrace level of the arena. And the entire level is now known as Big River Steel Terrace.

Big River Steel is the subsidiary of U.S. Steel that operates a mill in northeastern Arkansas. A second plant is currently being built in Osceola. That $3 billion steel mill is slated to be completed in 2024.
