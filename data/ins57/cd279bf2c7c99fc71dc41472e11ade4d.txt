George Clooney looked like he was in paradise on the red carpet with co-star Julia Roberts and wife Amal Clooney.

The three were all smiles at the Los Angeles premiere of "Ticket to Paradise" on Oct. 17, where Clooney stopped to pose with the two women dressed in colorful, statement-making outfits.

George Clooney and longtime friend Roberts, who is married to Danny Moder, were pictured arm-in-arm as they posed for the camera.
