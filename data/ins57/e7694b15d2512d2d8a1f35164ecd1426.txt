By Chris Wack S&P Global Inc. shares hit a 52-week low Wednesday after the company said it is suspending financial guidance for the full year due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions negatively impacting expectations for gross domestic product growth and debt issuance volumes. The stock, which was down 3.2% lower to $338.30 at 10:37 a.m. ET, hit its 52-week low of $311.87 earlier in the session. Shares traded at a 52-week high of $484.21 on Dec. 16. S&P Global said it can't affirm its previously issued guidance and expects to reintroduce formal financial guidance in conjunction with its second-quarter earnings results.
