agnormark/iStock via Getty Images The Q1 Earnings Season for the Gold Miners Index (GDX) has ended, and while a few producers put up solid reports, Jaguar Mining (OTCQX:JAGGF) was not one of them. In fact, Jaguar's report was one of the ugliest sector-wide, with production down 8% year-over-year and costs up 29%. This has put a massive dent in margins despite easy year-over-year comps (weak H1 2021 gold price), and I would be amazed if Jaguar delivered into its cost guidance this year ($1,200/oz midpoint).
