Nadine Dorries is going to be guest presenting Piers Morgan's Uncensored TalkTV show, it's been announced.
In a statement, the Tory MP claimed that she prefers to ‘avoid TV these days'.
However, ahead of her appearance on the TalkTV programme on Monday October 24 and Tuesday October 25, she said that she's looking forward to the opportunity to front the programme during the ‘eventful' time currently going on in British politics, given Liz Truss' resignation after 44 days as Prime Minister.
The former Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ‘I try to avoid TV these days and I'm not one of the MPs you find running across to the cameras on the green or in and out of TV studios but I'm excited about TalkTV and the opportunity to do this during what could turn out to be one of the most eventful weeks we have ever known in British politics.
