ATHERTON — In the school's first new building project in nearly half a century, Menlo College has opened a new residence hall for about 300 students struggling to find affordable housing in one of the nation's most expensive areas.
The John Arrillaga Residence Hall — named after the Silicon Valley real estate titan who died earlier this year — will now be home for hundreds of bachelor's degree-seeking students on the college's leafy green, residential campus.
The dorm features double-occupancy rooms spread over three floors and includes lounges, study spaces, group collaboration rooms, and other entertainment features like a space for e-gaming, films and socializing.
