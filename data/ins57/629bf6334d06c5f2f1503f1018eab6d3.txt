Members of the European Union must be ready to block crypto mining, the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm responsible for introducing new legislation, said Tuesday as the region readies for an uncertain winter.

The EU is also developing an energy efficiency label for blockchains as the disruption of gas supplies from Russia leave some fearing high energy prices, blackouts and shortages.

'In case, there is a need for load shedding in the electricity systems, the [EU] Member States must also be ready to stop crypto-assets mining,' the commission said in a document published Tuesday.
