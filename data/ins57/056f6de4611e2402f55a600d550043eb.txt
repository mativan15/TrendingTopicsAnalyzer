Yikes. Bradley Roby tripped over himself covering a route against the Arizona Cardinals and had to be carted to the locker room, leaving the New Orleans Saints extremely shorthanded at cornerback — the team was already down Marshon Lattimore and Paulson Adebo due to injuries, announcing that Roby was questionable to return with an ankle injury.

It's really problematic. New Orleans only has three other cornerbacks dressed out in this game: rookie draft pick Alontae Taylor (who was just activated from injured reserve), Chris Harris Jr.
