BRAINTREE – The town council has approved Mayor Charles Kokoros' $180 million budget in full, but not without some words of warning about fast-approaching financial problems.

Kokoros said the 2022-23 budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 represents a 4.46% spending increase and is balanced based on conservative revenue estimates.

"It's the best budget we can have within the confines of our finances," the mayor said.
