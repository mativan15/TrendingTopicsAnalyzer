HOUSTON -- The Yankees' last, best chance to depart with a split of this American League Championship Series rocketed off Aaron Judge's bat in the eighth inning on Thursday. His opposite-field drive drew a gasp from the sellout crowd at Minute Maid Park, soaring like so many of the 62 home runs that the slugger launched during his regular-season chase for history.
Judge's teammates leaped toward the dugout's top step; this one would land in the seats, they seemed certain. But Judge felt the wind would keep it in, and soon after Kyle Tucker's spikes crunched into the warning track, the rest of the world knew for sure.
