CNN —

The Dallas Cowboys (4-1) and Philadelphia Eagles (5-0) face off in Week 6 with NFC East paramountcy on the line.

The Cowboys, against all odds, are riding a four-game win streak. The team's season began with a catastrophic season-opening loss to the Buccaneers, during which starting quarterback Dak Prescott sustained a thumb injury.

That injury turned out to require surgery, sidelining Prescott for multiple weeks and thrusting the reins into the hands of backup quarterback Cooper Rush.

Rush's experience at the helm was limited to one career professional start against the Minnesota Vikings back in 2021.
