Akhilesh Yadav is taking forward Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav's legacy, said the party chief's step-brother Prateek Yadav Wednesday as the family members immersed the veteran politician's ashes at Sangam, the confluence of three rivers. At Sangam, Akhilesh Yadav was accompanied by his uncle and Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party chief Shivpal Yadav and Prateek Yadav among others. The same ritual was performed in Haridwar two days ago. Mulayam Singh Yadav, a three-time chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and a former defence minister died at a private hospital in Gurugram on October 10 at the age of 82.
