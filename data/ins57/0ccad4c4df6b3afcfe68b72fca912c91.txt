Struggling Bundesliga side Schalke 04 have sacked coach Frank Kramer following a 5-1 defeat by Hoffenheim in the German Cup, the club announced on Wednesday.
Schalke are 17th in the league standings on six points from 10 games following a run of four straight defeats. Kramer took over Schalke in June after the club earned promotion back to the Bundesliga under interim coach Mike Bueskens. 'After achieving promotion last season, our goal for the new campaign was to remain in the Bundesliga,' sporting director Rouven Schroeder said in a statement.
