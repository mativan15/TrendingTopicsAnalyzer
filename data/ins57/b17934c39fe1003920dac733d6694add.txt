Co-organizer of Glastonbury Festival, Emily Eavis explained why the ticket prices of the festival are so high. Ticket sale will be going live in early November as announced by Emily on October 17. She further explains the reason for higher ticketing costs.Tickets in 2022 cost £280 with a £5 booking fee. When the show started, the tickets cost £265. However, inflation and the festival's cancellation led to a price hike. Emily Eavis took to social media and said they are trying hard to reduce the ticket prices, but the costs to run the show have increased due to the financial impact of Covid.
