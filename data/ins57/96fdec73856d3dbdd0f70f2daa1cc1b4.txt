Would you like to visit one of Hawaii's best live shows? Then I highly recommend the Rock-A-Hula show on Oahu, which is probably Waikiki's best-kept secret. In all my years of traveling to Hawaii, I never see it advertised or promoted, but it is so wonderfully entertaining that you've just got to give it a go. It even features two Kings – Elvis, The King, and The King of Pop, Michael Jackson. Yes, when you're on Oahu you must, must visit Pearl Harbor and Diamond Head, you must dine at Duke's on Waikiki, you must check out the North Shore surfing – and you absolutely must visit Rock-A-Hula.
