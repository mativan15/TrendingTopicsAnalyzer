Megan Thee Stallion teamed up with fashion powerhouse Mugler to serve looks in the music video for her scathing single, 'Plan B.'
The clip, released on Thursday (June 2), finds the Grammy winner stunning in Mugler's signature strappy looks, with the style in center stage against a black background as she fittingly raps, 'Mugler suit in my meeting / Wagyu steak when I'm eating / Making so much money, this n—- dumb if he's cheating.'
The rapper introduced her diss-heavy track, 'Plan B,' during Weekend One of her Coachella debut, and she officially released the track a week later.
