It's understandable if you feel frustrated when a stock you own sees a lower share price. But sometimes a share price fall can have more to do with market conditions than the performance of the specific business.

That's better than the market which declined 8.9% over the last year. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 11% in the last three years. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter.
