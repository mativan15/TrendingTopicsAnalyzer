Staff shortages have caused Stokes Lane Cafe's Samuel Dodd to have the 'worst' period in business – running the cafe only from Monday to Friday.

Mr Dodd discussed his struggles with the cafe business with Sky News host Chris Kenny.

'We've decided to close on weekends – there's nothing else we can do about it,' Mr Dodd said.
