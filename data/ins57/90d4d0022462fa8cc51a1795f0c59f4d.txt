A three-member bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday ratified the verdict of a division bench which had held that the managing committee of Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple has no authority to contribute temple funds to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF).
The full bench of Justices Anu Sivaraman, Shircy V and M R Anitha rejected the review petitions moved by the state government and the Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee (GDMC), challenging the division bench order of 2020.
The issue pertains to the GDMC decision to contribute Rs 5 crore to CMDRF in the wake of the devastating floods of 2018 in Kerala.
