The Federal Reserve's fight against inflation has veteran fund manager Mark Mobius warning that interest rates will soar to 9%.'If inflation is 8%, the playbook says you've got to raise rates higher than inflation, which means 9%,' the co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners told Bloomberg TV on Monday. While policy makers may not hike so aggressively should consumer prices soften, the 86-year-old investor said he doesn't see inflation receding 'anytime soon.'The forecast is likely a reference of the Taylor Rule, a model which suggests an optimal policy rate by weighing price pressures and the labor market.
