Liz Truss has 12 hours to turn around her crisis and chaos-hit premiership, a senior Tory MP said on Thursday.

North Dorset MP Simon Hoare, chairman of the Commons Northern Ireland Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme of the 'anger, despair and sadness' among his colleagues over the Government mayhem.

It comes after a major revolt on fracking on Wednesday night, the axing of Home Secretary Suella Braverman, and suspension of a senior No10 aide who allegedly briefed against former Cabinet minister Sajid Javid.
