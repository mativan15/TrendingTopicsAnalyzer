Introduced more than 150 years ago by the Britishers to police the hilly areas of Uttarakhand , the ' Patwari ' or revenue police system - where revenue officials play the role of policemen - is finally set to become history.The state government earlier this week decided to bring all the revenue police under the ambit of regular police in a phased manner.Revenue police operates in about 60% geographical part of the hill state.While it was a long-pending demand to replace the revenue police with regular police, the government swung into action only after the recent murder of a 19-year-old receptionist, Ankita Bhandari, at a resort near Rishikesh, which triggered an outrage.
