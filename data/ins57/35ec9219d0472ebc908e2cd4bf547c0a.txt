Americans have been hit with sky-high inflation in 2022, despite the fact that the annual rate did dip to 8.2 percent in September, compared to 8.3 percent in August.This high inflation rate many Americans are seeing has been driven by a variety of factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, experts say."Thanks to a strong job market and generous federal stimulus, consumers are in spending mode," Daniel Roccato, a clinical professor of finance at the University of San Diego, told Newsweek.
