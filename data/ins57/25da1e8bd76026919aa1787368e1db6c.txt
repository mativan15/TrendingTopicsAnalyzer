The impact of Covid-19 outbreak will have a long-lasting impact on rural Thailand, where 79% of the nation's poor live, according to the World Bank.

While Thailand made progress in reducing poverty from 58% in 1990 to 6.8% in 2020, the rate is now increasing mirroring a slowing economy, stagnating farm and business incomes and the Covid-19 crisis, the multilateral lender said in its report on Rural Income Diagnostic on Friday.
