Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday visited the Britannia Chowk to Outer Ring Road stretch, one of the 16 pilot stretches being revamped along the lines of European roads under the AAP government's streetscaping project, and said the work will be completed by September.
Expressing dissatisfaction over some of the developmental works done by the Public Works Department (PWD), he directed them to fill open spaces by planting more plants and shrubs on the central verge and along the footpaths so it looks beautiful and curbs dust pollution.
