Fabrizio Romano is reporting that 'nothing has been decided' by Man Utd regarding the future of their goalkeeper David De Gea.

The Spaniard's future at United remains unclear as his contract is due to expire at the end of this season.

Man Utd are in a decent position though as they have an option to automatically extend his deal by a further year.

United were linked with several goalkeepers during the summer as they looked to recruit a new backup to De Gea.
