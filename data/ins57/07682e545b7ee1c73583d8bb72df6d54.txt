By Australian Associated Press Published: 13:35 EDT, 2 June 2022 | Updated: 13:35 EDT, 2 June 2022 Star senior management inadequately reported to the company's board, which was not curious enough about the risk its Sydney casino violated anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, an inquiry has heard. "More care needed to be taken and more questions asked," Naomi Sharp SC said on Thursday. Ms Sharp is assisting the NSW gaming authority's inquiry, helmed by Adam Bell SC, into whether the Star's Sydney casino should keep its licence.
