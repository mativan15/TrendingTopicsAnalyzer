The Lifespan Workplace Treadmill TR5000-DT7+ Treadmill is the brand's top-of-the-range workplace machine. And, while at first glance it may not be too much of an upgrade from the more affordable TR1200, there are several subtle yet noticeable differences to be felt when testing the two models side by side. For example, the cheaper feeling plastic side rails of the TR1200 have been substituted for more hardy aluminum, the 2chp (continuous horsepower) motor has been leveled up to a more powerful 3chp one, and the outdated control console has been given a much-needed redesign.
