After a 14-year uphill battle, Mexican auteur Guillermo del Toro was finally able to share his dream project with an audience as 'Pinocchio' (officially titled 'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio') had its world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. Taking the stage before the premiere, del Toro spoke of his connection to the story: 'I saw the film as a kid and it's a film that bonded me with my mom for an entire life. It affected me because Pinocchio saw the world the way I saw it. I was a little bit enraged that people demand obedience from Pinocchio so I wanted to make a film about disobedience as a virtue, and to say that you shouldn't change to be loved.
