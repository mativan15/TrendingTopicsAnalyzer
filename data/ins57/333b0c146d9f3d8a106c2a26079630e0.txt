Tesla reportedly paid a consultancy firm to monitor employees' Facebook interactions when some workers wanted to form a union at the company's factory in Fremont, California.
CNBC cited invoices and 'other documents' that reportedly showed MWW PR monitored employees' discussions on the platform regarding the company's labor practices and a sexual harassment lawsuit. MWW PR reportedly tracked employees' conversations in a Tesla employee Facebook group from 2017 to 2018.
The PR firm monitored the social media platform 'for commentary on organizing efforts, and to conduct research specifically on organizers, going on to develop labor communication plans, media lists, and pitches based on their reconnaissance,' CNBC said.
