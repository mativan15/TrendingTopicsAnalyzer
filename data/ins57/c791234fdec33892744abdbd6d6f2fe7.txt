Amid the current crypto winter, I have called and chatted with participants in the digital assets industry and heard the same narratives scores of times:

More investors are interested in crypto than ever before.

Institutional interest in crypto continues to increase.

The tools and products to include digital assets into portfolios continue to proliferate.

Pending regulations will help create the kind of clarity that helps even more people become comfortable investing in crypto.

Yet the price of tokens like bitcoin and ether remain subdued – if there is all this momentum behind digital assets, it's not showing up in the kind of price increases that signal investor enthusiasm.
