While overall deal activity and capital deployed slowed in Alabama over the last 18 months, Birmingham was still represented among the top investors in the Southeast during that period.

When it comes to incubators and accelerators, Innovation Depot ranked seventh in the Southeast for the number of deals completed from 2017 to 2022 at 54 deals, according to The State of Startups in the Southeast 2022 report by Panoramic Ventures. It significantly increased its activity compared to last year. In the government-backed category, Alabama Launchpad ranked fifth in the Southeast at 36 deals.
