For the first time, officials in Uganda have introduced a 21-day lockdown in two of the country's districts in a bid to stem rising Ebola cases.
Since 15 October, bars, entertainment venues, markets and places of worship in Mubende and Kassanda in central Uganda have been forced to shut. Only goods lorries will be allowed in and out of the districts over the three weeks.
