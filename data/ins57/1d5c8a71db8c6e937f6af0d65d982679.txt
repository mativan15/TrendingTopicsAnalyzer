By Will Feuer Dexcom Inc. Tuesday said it isn't in active merger talks, sending the stock up more than 8% after news reports last week that the company was in talks to buy Insulet Corp. "It is generally our policy not to comment on rumors or speculation, however, in light of recent sustained media and market speculation as well as the upcoming American Diabetes Association conference, we wish to confirm that Dexcom is not in active discussions regarding a merger transaction at this time," the company said.
