Oct. 16—It's easy to shrug off voting.

Wary Mainers say it doesn't matter, that they don't have time, that nothing will change.

It's something that many candidates have heard repeatedly along the campaign trail, including Maine independent gubernatorial contender Sam Hunkler.

Hunkler said that "many people have given up hope that your vote counts" and simply "accepted the dysfunction in our political system as the status quo which will not change."

But political leaders and political scientists have a simple message for those who claim their votes don't matter: You're wrong.
