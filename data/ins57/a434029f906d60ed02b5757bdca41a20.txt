	SAG-AFTRA is urging Congress to pass the federal Crown Act, designed to prevent unfair workplace treatment of people of color based on hair style or texture. 

	In what it describes as a strongly-worded statement signed by dozens of performers including Kerry Washington, Zoë Kravitz, Rosario Dawson, Don Cheadle, Niecy Nash-Betts, the entertainment and media union says that discrimination based on hair style or texture 'is a destructive practice that has alienated and caused irreparable harm to Black Americans.
