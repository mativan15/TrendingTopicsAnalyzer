ASTON VILLA could try and make Thomas Tuchel their next manager if they sack Steven Gerrard, according to reports.
The former Rangers manager is under pressure at Villa Park after picking up just two wins from 10 games this season.

Fans chanted for Gerrard to be axed after Villa's 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest and booed him following Sunday's 2-0 home defeat to Chelsea.
There is growing speculation he could be sacked if he fails to pick up results against Fulham and Brentford this week.
