OTTAWA - The Business Council of Canada says it is concerned over the continued closure of the Nexus trusted-traveller program.

Business Council of Canada CEO Goldy Hyder says it is ‘deeply troubling' that the U.S. government has not reopened 13 Nexus enrolment centres, in a letter to David Cohen, the American ambassador to Canada, obtained by The Canadian Press.

The two countries are in dispute over a long-standing request by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency that its agents be afforded the same legal protections inside Nexus facilities in Canada that they currently have at ports of entry like airports and the Canada-U.
