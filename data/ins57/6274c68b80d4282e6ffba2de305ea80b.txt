After Ranveer Gulati (Anil Goutam) disappeared from EastEnders the official explanation for his disappearance was that he was in Mumbai. 
Viewers, of course, know that Ranveer is dead, killed by his son Ravi (Aaron Thiara) although Suki (Balvinder Sopal) still believes she's the one who ended Ranveer's life by hitting him over the head with a clock when he tried to rape her.
Kheerat (Jaz Singh Deol) soon became suspicious about what had happened to Ranveer when nobody seemed to really know his whereabouts.
