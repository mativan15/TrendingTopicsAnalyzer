The New York Yankees and Houston Astros meet in the American League Championship Series for the third time since 2017. It's their fourth meeting in the postseason in the last seven years (Houston won an 2015 AL wild-card game, too), and the series between the rivals is one of the hottest tickets ever.The average price for a ticket to the series on the secondary market, per TicketIQ, is $505, just five dollars shy of the record set by the Kansas City Royals-Toronto Blue Jays ALCS in 2015 (TicketIQ started tracking data in 2010).
