Russian forces in a "frenzied push" have seized half of the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk that is key to Moscow's efforts to quickly complete the capture of the industrial Donbas region, the mayor told The Associated Press on Tuesday. "The city is essentially being destroyed ruthlessly block by block," Oleksandr Striuk said. He said heavy street fighting continues and artillery bombardments threaten the lives of the estimated 13,000 civilians still sheltering in the ruined city that once was home to more than 100,000.
