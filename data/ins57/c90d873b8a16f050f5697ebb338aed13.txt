Overshadowed by newcomers and stars on the defensive side of the ball heading into the regular season was linebacker Drue Tranquill.

However, the man in the middle of the defense has flashed week in and out, most recently shining in the Chargers' victory over the Broncos on Monday night.

Tranquill continued to be a heady run-defender, but most of his money was made getting after quarterback Russell Wilson. On 11 pass-rush snaps, Tranquill amassed a team-high three pressures and two sacks.

'Consistency in performance, and I think production in that consistency,' Staley said on Tranquill.
