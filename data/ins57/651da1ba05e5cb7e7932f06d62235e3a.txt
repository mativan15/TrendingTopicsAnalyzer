A number of players in the Kiwis team will be playing for their future participation at the Rugby League World Cup in this weekend's test against Jamaica. Michael Maguire has rotated the squad that defeated Lebanon 34-12 last weekend, to give everyone available a run over the first two games of the tournament. However, Maguire wants to pick his strongest possible team for the final pool game, against Ireland, so that the combinations are bedded in for the knockout stage of the tournament. 'I'm definitely keen to start heading in that direction,' Maguire said.
