Gareth Bale has joined the Wales camp with manager Robert Page delighted that Real Madrid fans 'showed their class' to the five-time Champions League winner.

Bale became the first British player to win the Champions League on five occasions when Real beat Liverpool in Paris on Saturday.

The Wales captain was a non-playing substitute at the Stade de France, a symbol of how far his stock has fallen at Real during the final season of his nine-year stay in Spain.

Bale has been targeted by Real fans and the Madrid media in recent seasons amid claims that he has been more interested in playing golf and for Wales, rather than for the 14-time European champions.
