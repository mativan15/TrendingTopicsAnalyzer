Cockroach infestations, filthy food surfaces and poor food storage – some of the reasons why a handful of Auckland food shops were forced to close until problems were rectified. In the most recent list of D and E grade food outlets from Auckland Council, food inspectors identified seven eateries in the last two months with lower than usual hygiene standards, ranging from problems with pests to process control. Five of the shops were located in south Auckland, with two in east Auckland. According to Auckland Council, a food grade certificate gives customers assurance that food they buy is safe and suitable to eat.
