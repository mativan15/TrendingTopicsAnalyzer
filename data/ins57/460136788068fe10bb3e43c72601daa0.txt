By Australian Associated Press Published: 22:55 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 22:55 EDT, 16 October 2022 After numerous issues with defective foreign-made ferries and trams, NSW Labor says public transport infrastructure needs to be manufactured on home turf. NSW Labor Leader Chris Minns says investment in overseas manufactured ferries, trains and trams has led to delays and unforeseen repairs, cancelling out any savings made by purchasing stock offshore. "We're getting infrastructure that is cracked, or defective, or isn't working," Mr Minns told reporters on Monday.
