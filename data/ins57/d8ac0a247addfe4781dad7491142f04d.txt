Insteel Industries of Mount Airy was hurt by weakness in residential construction in its fourth quarter but ended its fiscal year with record revenue and earnings, the company reported Thursday.

For the quarter, net earnings were $24.3 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, down from $25.2 million, or $1.28 per share from a year earlier.

Results reflected widening spreads between selling prices and raw materials costs, the company said. It had increased average selling prices 26% from the prior-year quarter to recover rising costs.
