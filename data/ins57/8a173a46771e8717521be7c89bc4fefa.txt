Mortgage Rates Delays Conveyancing Housing Crisis

Home buyers are being forced to spend tens of thousands of pounds to prevent house purchases from collapsing as conveyancing delays spiral out of control.

Logistical hold-ups in the property market mean sales are dragging so long that buyers' mortgage offers are expiring before they can complete – and rates have climbed so fast that replacement loans are as much as triple the cost.

In one case, delays at Optima Legal, a conveyancing service, meant a buyer had to find a new mortgage deal that cost an extra £30,000 over the course of a five-year fixed-rate loan.
