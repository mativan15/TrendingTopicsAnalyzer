Halloween began way back when the ancient Celts decided to dress up and light bonfires in an attempt to shoo away the dead.

Over the centuries, All Hallows Eve has evolved into what has become a month-long celebration of alternate identities, haunted experiences and people trying to scare the dickens out of each other.

Which is how folklore gets mingled with fakelore.

Of course, there are real monsters in the world but, come Oct. 31, are your neighbors suddenly turning into psychopaths with schemes of putting razor blades in apples and poison in candy bars?

Not likely, at least not in these parts, according to snopes.
