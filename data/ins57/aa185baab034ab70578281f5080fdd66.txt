jaanalisette/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) shares slipped on Thursday after investment firm Barclays downgraded the communications software company, citing broader concerns about the digital economy. Analyst Ryan MacWilliams lowered his rating on Twilio (TWLO) shares to equal weight from overweight, noting that progress in its segment and engagement segments are likely to be "slower than expected." Additionally, the Application Programming Interface, or API, business could face "uncertainty" if international and small business segments are weaker than first believed.
