The government has wound up the 24-year-old Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) constituted to probe the wider conspiracy into the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, officials have said. MDMA was working under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and comprised officers from multiple central security agencies. The order to disband the agency was issued in May and the pending investigation has been handed over to a different unit of the CBI, the officials said. The agency was set up in 1998 for two years on the recommendation of MC Jain Commission and was given annual extensions, but it failed to achieve any major breakthrough.
