Half of the electricity generation capacity lost when fire closed an oil-fired power station in Co Kerry last month will not be restored in time to meet peak winter demand, the plant's owner has said.The loss through the winter of 120mw of capacity at Tarbert, enough to power some 50,000 homes, will add to strain on the national grid at a time of concern about the adequacy of energy supplies to meet increased demand.Constraints on the electricity network because of surging demand from economic growth and energy-hungry data centres have left the Government reliant on older fossil fuel power stations such as the Tarbert plant to keep the lights on.
