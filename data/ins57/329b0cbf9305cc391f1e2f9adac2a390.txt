Retired Navy Admiral Mike Franken was the only Iowa candidate for federal office to raise more than $1 million in the latest fundraising period, new financial disclosures show.

Franken is a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate. He faces former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer and physician and city councilor Glenn Hurst in the June 7 primary. The winner is expected to take on incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley in November.

During the nearly seven-week period that ended May 18, Franken reported raising $1,034,655 to the Federal Election Commission.
