OTTAWA — Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland has told her cabinet colleagues that if they want money for new programs in the next federal budget, they'll have to help pay for them with some cuts of their own.

The directive, contained in a letter obtained by the Star, comes as Freeland is making the rounds to manage expectations about how far the government can or will go to directly help Canadians grappling with inflation, and the repercussions of the rising interest rates intended to tackle it.

On Wednesday, she gave her second speech this week highlighting the same message: there are tough times ahead for the economy, and it would be 'misleading' to tell anyone otherwise.
