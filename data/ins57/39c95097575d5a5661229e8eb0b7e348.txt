During the summer, Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton was helping coach at his alma mater, Thousand Oaks High School.

So it was no surprise that players from the 8-0 Lancers decided to come out en force to support Singleton on Monday night when he came to town to face the Chargers at SoFi Stadium. The entire Lancers team, coaching staff and several parents attended the game.

All Singleton did was record an astounding 19 solo tackles in a loss to the Chargers. That ties for the second-most solo tackles in a single NFL game in history.
