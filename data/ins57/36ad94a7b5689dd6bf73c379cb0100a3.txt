Measure O will secure
Walnut Creek's future

Measure O is a proposed half-cent sales tax that will help preserve many important elements of our amazing quality of life in Walnut Creek, with half of the tax to be paid by visitors, not residents. It will include strict fiscal monitoring by an independent citizen's oversight committee and annual audits to ensure funds are spent properly.

Measure O is endorsed by a wide range of local organizations including the Walnut Creek Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Associations, Library Foundation, Civic Pride Foundation, as well as the Diablo Regional Arts Association and the East Bay Times.
