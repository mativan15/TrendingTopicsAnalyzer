U.S. stock futures hinted at modest gains for Thursday's open as third-quarter financial results from companies continued to barrel in against a backdrop of persisting growth concerns on Wall Street.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 150 points, or 0.5%. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were just above flat.

Shares of Tesla (TSLA) sank roughly 6% in early trade after the electric-vehicle maker posted results late Tuesday that disappointed Wall Street, beating on earnings per share estimate but falling short on quarterly revenue expectations.
