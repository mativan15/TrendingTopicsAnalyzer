Peter Crouch has been offered the lead role in a new sitcom, but as himself.
Writers for BBC One fundraiser Sports Relief have pitched the idea about a sitcom of the former England striker's exploits to him, and it would mark the star's acting debut if he accepts.
In his book How To Be An Ex-Footballer, the 41-year-old revealed: ‘I liked it.
‘A fake documentary, elements of both The Office and Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon's The Trip.
‘The scripts were excellent, written by James Kayler and Steve Lawrence who I'd worked with on Sport Relief.
