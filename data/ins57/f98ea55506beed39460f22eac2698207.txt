Dave Smith's name may be ubiquitous enough to look almost forgettable on the back of a synthesiser – at least next to the distinctive monikers of his peers such as Oberheim, Moog, Linn and Rossum – but it fits the portrait of Smith painted by those who knew him and his work: that of an unassuming yet brilliant innovator, a quiet kind of genius. He didn't just create iconic synthesisers, he united electronic instruments everywhere.This week's announcement of Smith's death at the age of 72 was met with messages of grief and appreciation by musicians and producers the world over.
