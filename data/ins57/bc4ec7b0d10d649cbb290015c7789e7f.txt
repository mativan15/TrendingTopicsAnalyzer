Oct. 20—Yuba Water Agency recently approved a loan that will help build a new forest biomass plant as well as a business center in the Yuba County foothills.

As a result of the approval, a third loan of $70,000 was granted to the Camptonville Community Partnership to purchase 100 additional acres of land adjacent to a property where it plans to build a three-megawatt forest biomass plant and business center, Yuba Water officials said.

Through efforts such as the Yuba Foothills Healthy Forest Project, Yuba Water has been involved with thinning out forests in the foothills to help prevent the spread and severity of wildfires.
