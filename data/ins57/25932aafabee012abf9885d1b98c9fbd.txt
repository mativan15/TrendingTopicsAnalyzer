Chick-fil-A is bringing new meaning to the common knock-knock joke, "Why did the chicken cross the road?" Soon enough, the answer could be, "Because you ordered it."

America's largest fried chicken empire will be testing new autonomous technology that utilizes robot delivery at two locations in Austin, Texas this summer. This means the chicken will now be crossing intersections without even the assistance of a delivery driver.

The robots will be able to work in different weather conditions and drive on the margin of the road or bike lane in order to avoid traffic and pedestrians, the company said of this innovation.
