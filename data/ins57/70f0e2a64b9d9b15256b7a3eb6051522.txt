Democrat Esiah Campos, a Navy corpsman and pension analyst with Teamsters Local 705, is squaring off against Republican Ed Liberman, a member of the Lake Villa School District 41 board, in a race for the open Lake County Board District 16 seat.

Liberman says he wants to cut down on partisanship on the board, while Campos says he is running to bring better representation to the residents of the district, which is made up mostly by Round Lake Beach, Round Lake, Round Lake Park and Round Lake Heights.
