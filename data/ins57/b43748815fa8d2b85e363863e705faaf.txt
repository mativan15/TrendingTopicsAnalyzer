Multiple Asian women have reportedly come forward to accuse a Chinese American cosplayer and her boyfriend of luring them into sexual relations through supposed opportunities for collaborative work. Cosplayer and influencer Kat Wong, who describes herself as 'just an Asian girl making silly content,' came under fire on Twitter last week after actor, director and host Gina Darling revealed that 'multiple women' have reached out to her with such allegations. 'Multiple women in the Asian community have reached out to me about @katkwo4tweets and her BF allegedly trying to trick them into having sexual relations with them under the guise of collaborating on cosplays, OF (OnlyFans) and modeling,' Darling tweeted.
