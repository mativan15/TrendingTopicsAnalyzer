European Union leaders have gathered in a new show of solidarity with Ukraine, but divisions over whether to target Russian oil in a new series of sanctions are exposing the limits of how far the bloc can go to help the war-torn country.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who will address the bloc's 27 leaders by video in the evening, has repeatedly demanded that the EU target Russia's lucrative energy sector and deprive Moscow of billions of dollars each day in supply payments.
But as they arrived at the summit on Monday, several leaders said there would not be an agreement on a Russian oil ban at the two-day meeting, adding that weeks of haggling were likely to continue.
