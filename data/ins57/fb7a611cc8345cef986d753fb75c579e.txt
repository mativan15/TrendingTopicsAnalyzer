If you thought Apple's latest iPhone was a little on the pricey side, that's nothing compared to one it released in 2007.
A first generation iPhone – the model originally revealed by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2007 – has just sold for an eye-watering amount at auction.
The gadget is still factory sealed in its original packaging and managed to sell for over 75 times its original £269 price tag.
How much did this OG smartphone end up going for?
The auction closed at a whopping $39,339 (£34,887).
