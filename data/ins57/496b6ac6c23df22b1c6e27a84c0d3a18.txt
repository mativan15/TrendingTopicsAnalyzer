Frank Lampard has dismissed Richarlison's claims that Everton lack ambition as the Tottenham star prepares to face his old club on Saturday.

Richarlison joined Spurs in a £60million deal last summer and in a recent interview revealed a reason for Everton exit was a perceived lack of ambition at Goodison Park.

'I was happy at Everton and I'm grateful for everything I learned there,' said the Brazilian. 'It's a big club with a lot of history. However, perhaps they're suffering with a lack of ambition nowadays.
