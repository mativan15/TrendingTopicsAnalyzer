BOSTON–The Philadelphia 76ers were unable to get off on the right foot in the 2022-23 season as they fell to the Boston Celtics 126-117 on the road. They just had a tough time overall being able to get into any sort of rhythm while the Celtics were able to get easy looks.
With that being said, it's opening night. It's one of 82 meaning there are 81 games left in the season and veteran PJ Tucker would like everybody to breathe and remember this fact.
'Nobody wins a championship the first game of the season,' Tucker laughed.
