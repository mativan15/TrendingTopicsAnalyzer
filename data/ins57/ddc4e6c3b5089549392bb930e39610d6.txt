Some passengers have been forced to rethink their journeys to Birmingham Airport after noticing a rise in parking charges at the site. Regular travellers reported being quoted "double" the price they usually pay to park for a week at BHX.NCP, which manages the airport's seven car parks, said demand for spaces was currently "very high" and chargers were regularly reviewed.
