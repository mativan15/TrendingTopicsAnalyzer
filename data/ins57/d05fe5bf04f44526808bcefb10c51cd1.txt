Many investors might have been pessimistic coming into this latest batch of bank earnings reports, but the first few were by and large pretty positive. JPMorgan Chase (JPM 1.66%), the largest bank in the U.S. by assets, reported earnings results for the third quarter that beat analyst estimates. The bank also reported a clean bill of health when it comes to credit quality, although things could still deteriorate in the future.
While activity in some business segments like investment banking remains depressed, other business lines are robust, which recently enabled JPMorgan to raise its revenue projections for the full year of 2022 and for 2023 as well.
