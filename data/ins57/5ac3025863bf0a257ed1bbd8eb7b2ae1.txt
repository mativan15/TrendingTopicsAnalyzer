gorodenkoff BTIG is bullish on Proterra (NASDAQ:PTRA) following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. The firm expects the legislation to accelerate electric vehicle adoption across the commercial EV market and increase demand for PTRA's e-transit bus. Crucially, analyst Gregory Lewis and team expect PTRA to ramp its battery manufacturing capacity to 3-4GWh/year over the next two years, which should benefit from the ~$10/kWh tax credit available through the IRA. Upcoming catalysts for Proterra (PTRA) identified by BTIG include the commissioning of the Greer, South Carolina facility , expansion of battery manufacturing capacity, offtake agreements with commercial auto OEMs, federal funding opportunities and tax credits, as well as the anticipated increase in commercial EV adoption.
