The Girl Scouts of Minnesota and Wisconsin River Valleys has received a record $4.2 million gift from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, becoming the latest Minnesota nonprofit to be surprised by an unexpected and unusually large grant from Scott, an author and ex-wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

In all, Scott gave the Girls Scouts a total of $84.5 million — the largest donation from a single individual in the organization's 110-year history. The Twin Cities-based Girl Scouts was among 29 local councils to receive donations from Scott, along with the Girls Scouts of the USA.
