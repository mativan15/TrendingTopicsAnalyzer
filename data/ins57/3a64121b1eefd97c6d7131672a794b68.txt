The Poona Guest House (PGH) in Budhwar Peth is closed on Mondays so that from early evening, the 87-year-old dining room can transform into a venue for music recitals, talks on books and other cultural activities. It was here that Kumar Gandharva, Bhimsen Joshi, Vasantrao Deshpande and Lata Mangeshkar, among others, used to perform at a time when they were young and unknown, and when seating at PGH was on the floor. 'To keep that heritage, we don't allow just about anybody to perform. We look for quality and dignity,' says Kishor Sarpotdar of PGH.
