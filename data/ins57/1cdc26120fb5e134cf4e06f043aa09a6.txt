Now that June has arrived, we're starting to see some seriously good EOFY sales. The best so far? This deal on the excellent Breville The Barista Express, which we rate as the best coffee machine in Australia.

This machine has an official retail price of AU$749, and a few stores have slashed the price down to AU$599 for EOFY. But if you head to The Good Guys, you can get it for just AU$539.10 (opens in new tab), which is a massive AU$209.90 off and lowest price we've seen it for this year.
