MUMBAI: A special court on Wednesday agreed to let dismissed police officer Sachin Vaze become an approver in the corruption case registered against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Vaze had approached the special court last week, seeking permission to turn approver and testify against 72-year-old Deskhmukh, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader. The CBI consented to Vaze's request to turn witness for the prosecution 'in order to unravel the truth and to prove the role and complicity of other accused persons in commission of offences.
