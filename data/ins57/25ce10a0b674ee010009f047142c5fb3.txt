DESPITE protests, a new 10-year planning blueprint for Brighton and Hove was voted through.

The City Plan Part Two sets out planning policies – for housing, commerce and the environment – intended to reflect local priorities in the years to 2030.

The most controversial aspects of the new plan involved the inclusion of green spaces on Brighton and Hove's 'urban fringe' as suitable for housing.

There are fears that more than 900 homes could be built on 16 sites on or near the edge of the South Downs.
