Stocks rallied this week as earnings season ramped up and is so far off to a better-than-expected start. With 20% of the S & P 500 having reported financials so far, sales results have thus far been 1.4% above expectations while earnings results are 5.4% above expectations, in aggregate. While the estimates have come down in recent weeks, it could signal that investors are becoming a bit too bearish in the near term. This could set us up for more upside should subsequent results also come in better than feared.
