One of the biggest myths surrounding Social Security is that everyone is entitled to a monthly benefit once they reach a certain age. In reality, Social Security benefits have to be earned.
Granted, there are ways to get around that, such as claiming a Social Security spousal benefit if you don't qualify for a benefit of your own. But outside of spousal and survivors' benefits, you can only collect Social Security if you earn enough money in your lifetime.
When you earn money, you pay taxes on that income to Social Security.
