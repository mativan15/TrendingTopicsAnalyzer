Published: 16:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 16:46 EDT, 20 October 2022 Women have revealed whether or not they would date a person that makes 10 times less money than them. Podcasters Simran Kaur and Sonya Gupthan from New Zealand, who host the show Girls That Invest, posed the question to their followers in an Instagram post attracting hundreds of replies. Some said they would as money doesn't matter in a relationship while many said it depends on the person's circumstances and career goals while others flat out refused to be with someone whose income is ten times smaller than their own.
