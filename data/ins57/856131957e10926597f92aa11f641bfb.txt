There was also an intimate connection.Etienne's godfather is former Knick center Marcus Camby and the relationship makes it feel like blood.'I call him ‘uncle,'' Etienne said. 'He's that close. If something happened to my parents, I would live with him.'On Wednesday, Etienne tried to impress the same coach, Tom Thibodeau, who once helped guide Camby to the NBA Finals as an assistant in 1999.The 22-year-old guard out of Wichita State was part of a group of six prospects to work out for the Knicks at the facility in Tarrytown, joining Fresno State's Orlando Robinson and Oklahoma's Jordan Goldwire, among others.
