Imagine toiling hard to make ends meet and suddenly one day a stranger offers you a lump sum of money with no strings attached. Three workers at Atlanta airport in the US had such an experience recently after an author and speaker, Carlos Whittaker, raised money for them through Instagram during a layover.
The workers Phyllis, Brandon and Josh were shocked when Whittaker told them he would give them $4,000 each. As Instagram users flooded Whittaker's account with donations, the next day he called the trio up to say they would get $35,000 each.
