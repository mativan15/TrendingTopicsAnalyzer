There's a way to do a windfall tax in a minimally damaging way, and this isn't it. The case for one, in the circumstances, is not unreasonable. Energy companies are sitting on vast, exceptional profits generated by geopolitical accident and the crazy way our regulations price electricity.

It has, of course, done the opposite, and announced an open-ended levy alongside few measures to encourage investment.
