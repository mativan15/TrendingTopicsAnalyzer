 After losing around $140 million in fiscal year 2020, Pitt's endowment bounced back and shot up during 2020-21 — gaining more than $1.4 billion and ending at $5.68 billion, according to the University's annual IRS 990 form.
 The office of Pitt's chief financial officer said that market gains were the primary reason for the increase in the value of the endowment. 
 Investment income doubled from $59.07 million in FY20 to $118.38 million in FY21. Tuition, which remained the same from 2020 to 2021, brought in slightly less income — $864.
