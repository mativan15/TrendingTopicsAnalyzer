The drone was reportedly on a mission to gain intel on Russian forces and facilities as it flew over the Black Sea. But a source told RIA Novosti that the mission was made 'meaningless' after 'interference with the radio technical sensors' was able to preventthe NATO device from working. The agency said: 'Russian electronic warfare systems suppressed a NATO strategic drone over the Black Sea, which approached the coast of Crimea.'Potentially, the device tried to conduct reconnaissance of Russian facilities and forces in the interests of the Ukrainian troops.
