Ke Huy Quan was a child when 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' made him a star in 1984. While he fondly remembers starring opposite Harrison Ford, he wasn't sure whether Ford would recognize him at this year's D23 Expo — only for Ford to give him a warm embrace.

Quan took a decadeslong hiatus from acting until this year's ' Everything Everywhere All at Once ' spurred a comeback. He attended September's Disney fan event to announce he was joining Marvel 's ' Loki ' series when somebody told him Ford was there, too, Entertainment Weekly reported.
