With rising fears that we're headed for a period of stagflation — high inflation coupled with slowing growth — Deutsche Bank looked back to the 1970s for a historical guide of what might work in this economic environment. The firm found that commodities might be the safest bet. "Equities generally saw losses in real terms in the 1970s, but energy was the best place to be on a sectoral basis," the firm said this week in a note to clients. Analysts led by Henry Allen said that oil and agricultural goods were among the best places to invest during the 1970s, a decade plagued by stagflation.
