US stocks ended higher Tuesday after the major indexes gave up steep early gains in a volatile trading session. The Dow opened more than 600 points higher then closed with about half that, while the Nasdaq started 2.7% higher and finished up less than 1%. Still, the rally added to a hefty advance on Monday.Strong earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson helped boost investor confidence despite worries of more rate hikes from the central bank to combat inflation. Meanwhile, earnings season will continue after the close, when Netflix will report.
