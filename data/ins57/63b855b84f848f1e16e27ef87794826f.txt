Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:SRC) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 26%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 25% in the last year. Even worse, it's down 15% in about a month, which isn't fun at all.
