In April, Raghu (21) left his home in Gujarat's Kutch to earn a living in Delhi as his family was under financial strain — his father had lost his job due to the Covid-induced lockdown, his mother was forcibly discharged from a hospital as the family couldn't pay for her diabetes treatment. Unable to find a suitable job and having exhausted his savings, he took to living outside a gurdwara in South Delhi in May.
Raghu was then approached by a man, who asked him to donate his kidney for Rs 3 lakh, but he refused.
