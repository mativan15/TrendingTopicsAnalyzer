RiverNorthPhotography/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesAfter giving a Buy recommendation to Stellantis (STLA) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY), I have been asked to also cover Mercedes-Benz Group (OTCPK:DDAIF)—which I will do with great pleasure. The argument for Mercedes-Benz is very similar to the argument made for other automakers: the company appears materially undervalued based on accounting fundamentals. But Mercedes-Benz requires investors to pay an industry premium since the company offers a slight advantage: As Mercedes is increasingly focusing on the luxury auto segment, the company's margins are more defensible and earnings power less reliant on volume.
