The nature of investing is that you win some, and you lose some. Anyone who held Trean Insurance Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TIG) over the last year knows what a loser feels like. To wit the share price is down 67% in that time. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Trean Insurance Group because we don't have a long term history to look at. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 37% in the last three months.

It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two.
