As the pandemic hit in early 2020, airlines cut back staff, current pilots retired, and fewer new pilots started their training . Those shortages have now left carriers scrambling to keep up with rebounding travel demand, and driven smaller airlines to merge with or buy rivals to make the most of a pared-back staff and surging customer base. Both JetBlue (JBLU 2.83%) and Frontier (ULCC 0.59%) are bidding hard for Spirit Airlines (SAVE 3.99%) in this mad dash for consolidation. This battle between midsize carriers stands to make either of the bidders stronger and more secure in the future -- but now just might be the right time to get in on shares of Spirit before a winner emerges.
