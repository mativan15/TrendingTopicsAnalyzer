The government on Wednesday said that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) will continue to avail all non-tax benefits in their respective categories post re-classification for three years, in a major relief for the sector. The MSME ministry notified that in case of re-classification in terms of investment in plant and machinery or equipment or turnover or both, and consequent re-classification, an enterprise shall continue to avail of all non-tax benefits of the category it was in before the re-classification for three years from the date of the such upward change.
