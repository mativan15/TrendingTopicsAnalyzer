"I'm calling to ask that you please come to Commissioners Court today for the special meeting. We have a discussion-only meeting, no vote can be taken today, this was done at your behest, so when you get this message today, I would hope that you will come to Commissioners Court to attend the meeting that you specifically requested," said Garcia.

Garcia's call was the latest plea in an ongoing dispute over the Democratic-controlled court's proposed annual budget, which has sparked a string of no-shows from the body's conservative members and public displays of opposition from Harris County law enforcement.
