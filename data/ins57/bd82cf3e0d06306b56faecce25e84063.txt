Garrett was all over the backfield all game and was credited with eight pressures on the day. This gives him 28 on the season, putting him fourth in the NFL while missing a game, and just three pressures behind Nick Bosa and Micah Parsons. Finishing the game with two sacks, Garrett now has five on the season, putting him just a sack and a half out from the league leader in just five games.
Perhaps I am wrong here, but consistent 15+ sack seasons are considered elite production. And as Garrett is coming off of a 16-sack season, he is on pace for 16 more in 2022.
