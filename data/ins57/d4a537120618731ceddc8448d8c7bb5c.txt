If you received a parking violation within the last 8 months in Seattle, you may get some money back. The City of Seattle announced Wednesday (June 1) that approximately 200,000 parking tickets will be either refunded or voided. Officials say this applies to tickets issued between September 1, 2021, and April 5, 2022, through a third-party administrator. Those who haven't paid their tickets, which is 100,000 people, will have their parking tickets scrubbed from the system, effective immediately. The other 100,000 people will get refunds starting next week if they already paid off their tickets.
