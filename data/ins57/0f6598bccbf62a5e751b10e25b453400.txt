With Marinakis restricted on transfer spending by the Football League's profit and sustainability rules, Forest are expected to be one of the most active clubs this summer if promotion is secured.
Funds will be made available, and the preparations for either scenario - Premier League or Championship - have been in place for months.
Plans to build a new stand at the City Ground are also accelerating, while the recent installation of hi-tech cameras at Forest's training base, to monitor training both for the squad and individually, are regarded as a major step forward.
