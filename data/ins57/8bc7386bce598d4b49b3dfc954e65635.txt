Meghan Markle is opening up about why she decided to quit the NBC game show Deal or No Deal. During the most recent episode of the Duchess of Sussex's Archetypes podcast released Tuesday, she spoke about her 34-episode stint that began in 2006 on the Howie Mandel-hosted series. Deal or No Deal involved contestants being presented with 26 briefcases, each held by a different identically dressed female model, and trying to guess which held the most money. Markle — who, up until that point had landed small roles on shows including General Hospital — recalled feeling grateful that Deal or No Deal helped her pay her bills while she continued to pursue an acting career, and she called the show a 'fascinating' experience.
