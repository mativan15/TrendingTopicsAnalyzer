Airline stocks started Wednesday on an up note, fueled by positive commentary from Delta Air Lines (DAL -4.17%). But a grim forecast from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon gave rise to fresh recession fears, causing shares of Delta, American Airlines Group (AAL -2.88%), United Airlines Holdings (UAL -3.82%), and JetBlue Airways (JBLU -3.31%) to all trade down 5% or more.
So what
As we've noted before, airline stocks are stuck in a holding pattern right now. Strong demand and pricing power is leading to higher-than-expected revenue growth throughout the industry, but that is being offset by higher costs.
