Aaron Rodgers may prefer to keep his personal life private, but he's certainly had some high-profile romances.
 
Since his football career as a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers put him in the spotlight, Rodgers has found love with stars like Olivia Munn and Danica Patrick. Most recently, Rodgers surprised fans when he announced his engagement to Shailene Woodley in 2021 — although the relationship didn't end up lasting through 2022.
 
As of now, Rodgers is on a journey of self-love, which he believes to be one of the "core tenets" of mental health.
