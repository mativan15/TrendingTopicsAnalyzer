Ukraine's national baseball team is visiting New York City for a series of charity games against local teams. The two-day event, which started on Friday, is organized by a minor league affiliate of the New York Mets and other groups to support Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. On the first day, the Ukrainian team faced the New York Police Department team. Spectators cheered on and applauded the Ukrainian players. The games are free, but organizers are asking for donations. The proceeds will be used to help rebuild children's sports facilities that were destroyed in Russian attacks.
