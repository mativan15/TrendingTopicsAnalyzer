Technology stocks have plummeted toward multiyear lows in recent months as investors search for stable, reliable earnings. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sits 25.2% off its highs, and the index has suffered its worst start to a year on record. As tech stocks have tumbled, investors believe there are some values to be had in select areas while other parts of the industry will remain broken for a while. Many megacap names like Alphabet and Amazon have fallen 20% to 30% or more so far this year. Snap' s profit warning cratered its stock and chopped more than 40% off its value on Tuesday, carrying shares of tech stocks down with it.
