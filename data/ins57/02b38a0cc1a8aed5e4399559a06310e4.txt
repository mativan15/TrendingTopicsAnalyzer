Earlier this month a video emerged of Aubameyang criticising Arteta's management at Arsenal in which he claimed the Spaniard did not know how to handle ‘big players'.
During their final few months together at Arsenal, Arteta stripped Aubameyang of the captaincy following several disciplinary breaches.
Arsenal subsequently agreed to terminate Aubameyang's contract, which paved the way for the striker's move to Barcelona in the closing stages of the January transfer window.
