Jesse Marsch believes Mikel Arteta is the most underrated manager in the Premier League and believes Arsenal can win the title. The Gunners are currently top of the Premier League after winning eight of their first nine fixtures, sitting one point clear of champions Manchester City. Arteta's side will look to continue their good run against Marsch's Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday afternoon. Leeds, meanwhile, will be keen to pull off a shock victory against Arsenal. They've picked up nine points from their first eight games to sit in 14th, which leaves them in danger of being sucked into a relegation battle if they don't continue to consistently earn points.
