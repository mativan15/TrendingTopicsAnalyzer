DebbiSmirnoff/E+ via Getty Images Pactiv Evergreen Inc. (NASDAQ:PTVE) is a leading manufacturer of food packaging products. It IPO'd in late 2020. Although the company has shown improving financial results in recent quarters, I am concerned that recent outperformance has come from price increases at the expense of volume declines. Furthermore, the company has a heavy debt burden, with more than half paying floating rate interest. I think this is a stock that investors should avoid in the current rate-hiking environment.
