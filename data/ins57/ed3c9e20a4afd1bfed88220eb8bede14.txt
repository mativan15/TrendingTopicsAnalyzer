The Ministry of Defence should fix or scrap its troubled Ajax armoured vehicle programme this year, or risk compromising national security, an influential parliamentary committee has warned.The Ajax programme, intended to provide a state-of-the-art reconnaissance vehicle for the Army, has already been running for 12 years and cost £3.2 billion but has so far failed to deliver a single deployable vehicle.Originally intended to enter service in 2017, Ajax has been repeatedly delayed due to what the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has described as 'a litany of failures' including noise and vibration problems that injured soldiers testing the vehicles.
