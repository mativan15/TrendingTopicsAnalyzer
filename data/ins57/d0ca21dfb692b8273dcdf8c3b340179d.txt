New York CNN Business —

Tesla posted a solid quarter of earnings and record revenue, but now says it will fall short of its target for a 50% growth in the number of cars it sells this year.

As recently as July it said it was still aiming for a target of a 50% growth from the 936,000 cars it delivered in 2021. But with two quarters of disappointing deliveries caused by supply chain issues and Covid-related shutdowns in China, it would have been a reach to hit that goal for 2022.

The company had previously reported it delivered 344,000 cars in the third quarter, a record for the company, and up 42% from a year ago.
