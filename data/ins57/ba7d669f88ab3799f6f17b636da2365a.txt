UPDATE: Here's a look at the Tennessee Titans' updated cap space now that the Julio Jones release is official.

The Tennessee Titans will see some salary cap relief this week, as the majority of the money that was to be allocated to wide receiver Julio Jones will come off the books.

Jones was designated as a post-June 1 release, which means $9.5 million of his 2022 salary will come off the books, leaving Tennessee with a $2.8 million dead-cap charge.

There was a ton of hype surrounding Jones in his first season, but he never met those expectations thanks to injury and his making a minimal impact when healthy, leading to his release.
