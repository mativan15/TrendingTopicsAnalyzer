Published: 13:41 EDT, 3 June 2022 | Updated: 13:41 EDT, 3 June 2022 Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter appears to be moving slowly forward despite his tweet that the deal is on hold. Advocacy groups on Friday launched a campaign to stop Elon Musk from buying Twitter as the proposed purchase cleared review by US antitrust authorities. Twitter said that the deal for Musk to acquire the company was a step closer to being sealed with the passing of a deadline for it to be challenged under a US antitrust law.
