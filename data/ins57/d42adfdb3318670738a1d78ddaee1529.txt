Concern is mounting for an estimated 320,000-plus pensioner households in England who still paying off their homes. New polling shows that nearly eight out of 10 pensioners say they will blame the Government if their mortgage bills increase.


The English Housing Survey estimated that in 2020-21 there were around 5.1million owner-occupier households where the head of household was over 65 years old – and 320,000 pensioner households still had a mortgage.
In the latest sign that Prime Minister Liz Truss will face trouble at the ballot box if mortgage costs are pushed up, pollsters Savanta ComRes found that 78 percent of people aged 65-plus said 'the Government's budget will be to blame if mortgage bills increase in the coming months.
