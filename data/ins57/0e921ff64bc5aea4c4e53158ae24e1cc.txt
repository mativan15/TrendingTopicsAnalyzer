Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with inaction on the letter sent to him by a contractors association accusing the BJP government in Karnataka of charging 40 per cent commission on public work. Addressing a public meeting in Ballari as Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra completed 1,000 km, Siddaramaiah said the association president Kempanna wrote a letter to Modi a year ago stating that the BJP government has been demanding the commission.
