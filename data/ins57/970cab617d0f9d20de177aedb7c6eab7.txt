The Government Girls' Lower Primary School, Ernakulam, shares a bond of love and care with street vendors that dates back to nearly a decade.Despite being one of the most maligned communities, the street vendors have been unfailingly performing the noble act of donating school accessories to students from underprivileged backgrounds at the start of each academic year.'We have students from all classes, including from very poor backgrounds in various colonies in and around the city. The street vendors have been coming to their aid during school openings by distributing everything from notebooks and bags to pencil boxes.
