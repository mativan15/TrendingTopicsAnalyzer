Parents and relatives of children who survived a devastating school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday are turning to GoFundMe to raise money for trauma therapy and other medical expenses.In the aftermath of the attack, which left 19 children and two teachers dead, children have described the anguish they experienced when 18-year-old gunman Salvador Ramos entered their classroom at Robb Elementary School and began opening fire on their friends and instructors.Some students recounted playing dead and smearing themselves in blood in order to survive the hour-long massacre, while others described hiding in silence and muting their sobs as the carnage unfolded.
