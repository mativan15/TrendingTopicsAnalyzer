Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) celebrates winning a stage at the Tour de France

The final World Rankings are now official, with the UCI publishing the team standings for the 2022 season to complete the 2020-2022 Team Rankings. What has been suspected for several weeks now can be confirmed: Alpecin-Deceuninck and Arkéa-Samsic have satisfied the sporting criteria towards their aim of joining the 2023-2025 UCI WorldTour, while Lotto Soudal and Israel-Premier Tech have not.

All teams still must meet the other criteria in terms of finances, administration, ethics and organisation, and the UCI's final decisions to award the WorldTour licences for the next three seasons will be made later this year.
