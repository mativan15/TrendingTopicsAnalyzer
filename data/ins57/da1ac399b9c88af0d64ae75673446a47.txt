There was nothing political about OPEC cutting its production quota or the United Arab Emirates' support of that decision, according to the UAE energy minister.The oil cartel based its decision on entirely on market fundamentals and not politics, Suhail Al Mazrouei said at a press briefing on Tuesday."UAE supported the technical decision of OPEC on the technical merits of that decision. And there is nothing political about that," he said.Saudi Arabia's energy minister has also previously hinted a production cut was needed to address dysfunction in energy markets.
