Kanye West has apparently reached an agreement to buy the social media platform Parler. The current owner Parlement Technologies said it had reached an agreement in principle to sell the "pioneering un-cancelable free speech platform" to the rapper. The social media site only returned to the Google Play Store last month, having been removed for allowing posts that seek "to incite ongoing violence in the US" - after the Capitol riots in January last year.The founders of BioNTech, who helped to develop one of the key covid vaccines with Pfizer have said cancer vaccines could be accessible for patients by 2030.
