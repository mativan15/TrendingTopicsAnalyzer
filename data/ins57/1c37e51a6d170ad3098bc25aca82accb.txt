WELLINGTON, New Zealand — China's foreign minister was due to visit the remote Pacific nation of Kiribati on Friday where the future of a vast fishing ground is at stake. The four-hour visit by Wang Yi was his second stop on an eight-nation tour that comes amid growing concerns about Beijing's military and financial ambitions in the South Pacific region. Kiribati closed its borders this year as it tries to stamp out an outbreak of COVID-19. But its government made a rare exception to allow Wang and his 20-strong delegation into the country for face-to-face discussions.
