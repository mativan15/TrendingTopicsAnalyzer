Last April, Google launched Grow with Google Career Readiness for Reentry, a program created in partnership with nonprofits to offer job readiness and digital skills training for formerly incarcerated individuals. As a part of an expansion, Google today announced that it'll invest just over $8 million in organizations helping "justice-impacted" individuals, including the formerly incarcerated, enter the workforce.

Continuing its work with nonprofits including The Last Mile, Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO), Defy Ventures, Fortune Society and The Ladies of Hope Ministries, Google says that $4 million of the new roughly $8 million it's investing will go toward Grow with Google Career Skills, aiming to help people impacted by the justice system develop career specializations.
