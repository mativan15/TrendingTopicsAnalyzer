British Columbia's ombudsperson has sharply criticized the provincial government for failing to transfer federal funds to the caregivers of a disabled Indigenous girl.
In a report published Tuesday, Jay Chalke found the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) acted 'unjustly' when it did not provide the Child Disability Benefit to 'the Taylors' — grandparents who were caring for their eligible granddaughter, 'Jesse.'Instead, the funds went into the government's general revenues coffer, said Chalke, and even though it became aware of the problem in 2019, the province took more than two years to remedy it.
