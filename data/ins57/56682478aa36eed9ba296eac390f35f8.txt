England boss Gareth Southgate should not take James Maddison to the World Cup, according to former Three Lions manager Sven Goran Eriksson, with the Swede suggesting he should take Liverpool duo Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez instead. The Leicester star has been on excellent form recently - but has not made an appearance for the national team since 2019 despite many fans and pundits demanding he receives a call-up. Maddison has enjoyed a good start to the Premier League campaign despite his own personal form not being replicated by his team mates.
