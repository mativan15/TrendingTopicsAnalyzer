By Reuters Published: 15:32 EDT, 31 May 2022 | Updated: 15:32 EDT, 31 May 2022 Alabama coach Nick Saban again tried to defuse a dustup of his own creation with Texas A&M coach Jimbo Fisher, saying Tuesday at the SEC spring meetings that, "I didn't really say anybody did anything wrong," and that he has "no problem" with Fisher. Saban again said that he regrets naming specific institutions two weeks ago at a fundraising event when he used Texas A&M and Jackson State as examples of how NIL money is being used improperly in recruiting.
