gorodenkoff/iStock via Getty Images Investment Summary With a total shareholder return of just 2.3% over the past 12 months to date, we can't help but question if Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:NYSE:EW) is ready to bounce off its yearly lows. At one point in April the stock price had surged to $128, clipping a tidy gain relative to benchmarks like the S&P 500 (SPX). Alas, the stock has since underperformed over the past two months. We are long EW shares as the company presents with the economic pillars to form a robust investment case in the current macroeconomic regime.
