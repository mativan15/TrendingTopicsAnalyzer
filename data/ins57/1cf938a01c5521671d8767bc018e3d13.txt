Amid a flood of Diwali stock picks ahead of the big festival, value investor and smallcase manager 
Jiten Parmar 
says he has never believed in Diwali picks. 'There are so many Diwali picks floating around. Investors get confused. We believe in value investing and the day we find value in a stock, it's Diwali for us. We keep looking for ideas and keep calibrating our investments on periodic intervals. Investing is a continuous process, not a batch process,' says the co-founder of 
Aurum Capital 
in an interview with ETMarkets.
