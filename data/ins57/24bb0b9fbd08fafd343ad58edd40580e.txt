Tarting it around?' exclaims Gareth Malone, the choirmaster most famous for his Military Wives Choir and the Great British Home Chorus during the pandemic, and his involvement in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert among many other things. 
‘I don't think I've ever used the expression 'tarting'. That's your word…' 
I've just suggested that what with the new tour, Sing-Along-A-Gareth, and recent stints on Masterchef and The Masked Dancer, he's been, you know, putting it about a bit.
He's actually right this minute taking time out from practising instrumental parts – guitar, keyboards, ukulele, Irish whistle – and memorising lyrics for a show that features other singers, a pianist and a percussionist and lots of trying to persuade the audience to join in… 
‘There will be little bits to do in each song if they want to, but if they don't, that's fine,' he says.
