An Australian weather presenter has described the 'sickening' moment he witnessed three men looting houses in Melbourne, which residents had fled during the floods.
Tim Davies arrived in Maribyrnong, northwest of the CBD, to film live coverage on Monday morning when he saw the men 'obviously up to no good'.
It is alleged they fled Burton Crescent when they saw the cameras.
'I just knew straight away something wasn't quite right with these guys and they had their faces covered with Covid masks and hoodies on,' Davies told Today.
