Galeanu Mihai/iStock via Getty Images MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) delivered very strong results. Not only do we see total customers increasing by 31% y/y, but given the strong revenue growth in the quarter, MongoDB upwards revises its full-year revenue estimate and expects to grow by 36% y/y. Arguably, the most interesting aspect of the quarter is that MongoDB is now eyeing up a path towards non-GAAP breakeven. I argue that paying 14x sales for a business with such solid near-term prospects makes a lot of sense.
