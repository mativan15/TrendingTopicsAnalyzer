Nets sharpshooter Joe Harris is pushing for a return soon from a recent bout with soreness in his surgically repaired left foot, but he also expects to be 'at a little bit of a limited capacity' when he does make his season debut.

The Nets ruled Harris — who has recently recovered from two procedures on his left ankle — out for Wednesday's season-opener against the New Orleans Pelicans, with head coach Steve Nash explaining the starting forward 'is turning a corner' in getting through his foot soreness, but that there 'wasn't enough time' to get to a safe place before the first game of the season.
