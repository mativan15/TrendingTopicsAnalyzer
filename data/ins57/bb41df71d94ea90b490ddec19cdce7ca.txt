By Adriano Marchese Canadian insurer and financial services provider Manulife Financial Corp. cautioned its shareholders that a mini-tender offer by Obatan LLC at $12 a share is below market price. Manulife said the offer to purchase up to 500,000 of its shares by Obatan represents around 0.026% of the company's common shares outstanding. Mini-tender offers seek to acquire less that 5% of a company's outstanding shares, which avoids disclosure and procedural requirements applicable to most bids under Canadian and U.
