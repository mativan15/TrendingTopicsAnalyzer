A diverse collection of students with big ideas will split about $95,000 in prize money after competing in T-Mobile's Changemaker Challenge. $5-10K may not sound like a lot to companies pulling in tens of millions, but for a kid just starting out, it could be the difference between pursuing and abandoning a passion project.
The contest is nationwide, asking young folks age 13-18 to submit their project, company, or however they like to define it, and five each in three categories are awarded $5,000.
