Westpac is getting back into the Reserve Bank's good books after it failed to manage its risks to the regulator's satisfaction. A report released by the Reserve Bank Te Pūtea Matua, which regulates banks, said Westpac was 'moving in the right direction' in building a proactive risk culture around its liquidity. Liquidity is the amount of money available to a business to meet its obligations, but in March 2021 the Reserve Bank ordered Westpac to commission an independent report after finding the bank was in breach of its liquidity policies.
