India's first solar-powered village is setting an example of 'reconciliation between humankind and planet' according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

The UN chief visited Modhera in Gujarat, India yesterday as part of a three-day trip to the country. A solar power project commissioned in 2021 has provided its thousands of residents with more than enough renewable energy to power their homes.

It cost a total of €8.3 million with half paid by the Government of Gujarat and half by the Government of India.
