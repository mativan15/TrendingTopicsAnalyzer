We've seen rollable phones before, but Lenovo's Motorola rollable phone concept is an entirely different take on the idea. Showcased at Lenovo's Tech World 22 virtual event, the concept device rolls out vertically, extending from a very compact smartphone into a phone that's about the same size as any modern phone. In a video posted by Lenovo, we see that the content on the phone, such as a YouTube video, can dynamically adapt to the phone's size.
