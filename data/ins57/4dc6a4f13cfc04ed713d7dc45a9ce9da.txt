There were both some good and questionable moves made by the Jacksonville Jaguars organization this offseason, but most would agree that the team is better. They especially acquired a lot of solid defensive talent, signing names like Foley Fatukasi, Arden Key, Darious Williams, and Foyesade Oluokun in free agency, then using five of seven draft picks on defensive talent.
That's not to say the offense was overlooked, though. The Jags gave receivers Christian Kirk and Zay Jones starter caliber money and signed a pass-catching threat at tight end in Evan Engram.
