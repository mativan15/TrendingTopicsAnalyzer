Elliot Page has opened up about some of the darker days of navigating fame as a closeted actor.

Page, who came out as transgender in 2020, penned an essay for Esquire published Wednesday recalling his childhood, transition, and career. When Diablo Cody's Oscar-winning 2007 romance drama Juno became a runaway hit and introduced the world to Page, the actor "wasn't okay."

"I was closeted, dressed in heels and the whole look — I wasn't okay, and I didn't know how to talk about that with anyone," Page writes.
