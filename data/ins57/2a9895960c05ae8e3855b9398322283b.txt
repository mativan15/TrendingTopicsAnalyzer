Liz Truss and Sir Keir Starmer united in tribute to Conservative MP Sir David Amess on the anniversary of his death.
Sir David, a longtime lawmaker of nearly 40 years, was killed in full view of his constituents in the seaside town of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October 15.
Ali Harbi Ali was handed a whole-life jail sentence in April for murdering the Southend West MP.
One year after his death, politicians from across the political divide paid their respects to Sir David.
The prime minister this morning tweeted: ‘On the anniversary of Sir David Amess' death, we cherish his memory and remember his enormous contribution to politics, to the people of Southend and to the country.
