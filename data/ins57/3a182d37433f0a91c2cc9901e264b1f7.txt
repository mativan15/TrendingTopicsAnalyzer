(Bloomberg) -- Russian forces have gained momentum in their push to capture Ukraine's Donbas region and hold the initiative 100 days since President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion, according to the UK Defense Ministry. The European Union approved the bloc's sixth sanctions package against Russia, including a partial ban on crude imports, while OPEC+ kept Russia at the cartel's center even as it agreed to increase oil supplies over the summer.The US added new entities based in Russia and Belarus to a list that restricts them from doing business with American firms, and introduced sanctions targeting yachts it says are linked to Putin and some of his wealthy supporters.
