President Biden announced new sanctions Thursday targeting both influential Russians and Russian President Vladimir Putin's yachts on the 99th day of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine — but still missing from the list are two oligarchs connected to first son Hunter Biden.
The slow rollout of sanctions comes despite Biden threatening 'swift and severe' action ahead of the invasion.
New US-targeted individuals include the oligarch Alexey Mordashov, Putin-linked money manager Sergei Roldugin, billionaire God Nisanov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria  Zakharova.
