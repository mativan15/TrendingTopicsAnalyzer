Kenya's energy production company KenGen wants to offer bitcoin mining companies its surplus geothermal power to help them meet their energy needs.KenGen, which generates most of its power from renewables, said miners have been reaching out about buying its energy. The company has not provided any more details, but given there are no bitcoin mining firms in Africa, those that approached it are believed to be from the US and Europe.The plan is to have miners set up in an energy park at the company's main geothermal power station in Olkaria, Naivasha, 123 km from the capital Nairobi.
