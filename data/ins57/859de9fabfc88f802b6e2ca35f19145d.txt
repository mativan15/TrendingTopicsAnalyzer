The Small Business Administration is looking to overhaul its Small Business Investment Company program — the latest in a series of lending reforms at the agency aimed at expanding access to capital.

The SBIC program issues debt to venture capitalists, private equity funds and other investment vehicles that invest in American small businesses that have the ability to scale and grow.

The SBIC program portfolio contains $37 billion in committed and invested capital and, in the past year, 299 SBICs invested in over 1,500 companies, which created and sustained over 103,000 jobs, according to the SBA.
