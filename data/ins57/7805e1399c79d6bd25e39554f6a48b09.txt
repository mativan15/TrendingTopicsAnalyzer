The Board of Regents has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a class-action lawsuit with current and former University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics employees, according to a Friday court filing.

The healthcare system and about 11,000 workers have been engaged in a legal fight since 2019, when employees alleged that managers didn't pay overtime, bonuses or accrued leave as quickly as state and federal laws require.
