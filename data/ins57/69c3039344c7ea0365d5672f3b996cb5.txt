(RTTNews) - China's service sector logged another marked contraction in May due to measures taken to contain the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, survey results from S&P Global showed on Monday. The Caixin services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 41.4 in May from a 26-month low of 36.2 in April. But a score below 50.0 indicates contraction in the sector. The pace of reduction was the second-sharpest seen since February 2020, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. New business dropped for the fourth consecutive month in May.
