ROME (Reuters) - An Italian ministry said on Tuesday it would remove from its walls a photo of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, after its recent display sparked complaints from trade unions and a former minister.

Mussolini's legacy is in the spotlight as Italy prepares to install its most right-wing government since World War II, led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party whose roots go back to the post-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI).

The Mussolini portrait will be taken down "to avoid polemics and manipulations," the industry ministry said in a statement.
