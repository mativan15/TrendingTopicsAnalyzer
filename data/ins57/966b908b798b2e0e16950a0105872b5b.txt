STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The amount of money invested in private cloud-computing companies in Europe, Israel and the United States dropped 42% in the third quarter of 2022, indicating an industry in the midst of a "reset", showed a report from venture capital firm Accel.

While 51 cloud software developers raised funds at valuations of over $1 billion in the first quarter of 2022, only three did so in the third quarter, Accel's 2022 Euroscape report showed.

The valuation of publicly listed cloud companies has also dropped to $1.
