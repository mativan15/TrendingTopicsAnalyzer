Tory MPs have been reacting to comments from Charles Walker, who said there is "no coming back" for the party after a chaotic vote on fracking tonight. In an interview with BBC News, a visibly emotional Walker said he was livid and out of patience with his party. In a tweet, Maria Caulfield, MP for Lewes, said: "Tonight we are all Charles Walker."Former minister Johnny Mercer said, alongside an expletive, that Walker had "nailed it". However, former culture secretary Nadine Dorries urged Walker to back Liz Truss because "he helped to put her where she is".
