Ex- Japan international striker Masato Kudo has tragically died at the tender age of 32 years old following brain surgery, as confirmed by his club Tegevajaro Miyazaki. Kudo also previously donned the shirts of Kashiwa Reysol, Canadian outfit Vancouver Whitecaps and Australian side Brisbane Roar, was diagnosed with hydrocephalus, which is a buildup of fluid in the ventricles in the brain. He was hospitalised on Oct. 3 after falling ill a day earlier and sadly died over a fortnight later. The forward was a fan favourite at Kashiwa Reysol, given he played a starring role in the club's memorable run to the semi-final of the 2013 Asian Champions League by scoring six goals in 12 games over the course of the tournament.
