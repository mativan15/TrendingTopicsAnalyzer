Published: 01:54 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 01:54 EDT, 19 October 2022 Two rested teams resume Atlantic Coast Conference play as No. 13 Wake Forest and Boston College come off their bye weeks to meet on Saturday afternoon in Winston-Salem, N.C. Neither side has played since Oct. 8 when Wake Forest (5-1, 1-1 ACC) beat Army 45-10 while Clemson used three second-half touchdowns to pull away from Boston College (2-4, 1-3) for a 31-3 win. A Saturday win would mark Wake Forest's 12th straight during the month of October and give it three straight against Boston College for the first time in series history.
