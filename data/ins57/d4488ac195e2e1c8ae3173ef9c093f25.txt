PARIS — The message has been hardly subtle: The grandeur of the Games is coming back.

Organizers of the 2024 Paris Summer Games this week loaded journalists from around the world on buses for a first peek at the progress of Olympics sites, part of the long run-up to the Games, still 20 months away. One of the first stops: the Eiffel Tower, on a dazzlingly sunny autumn day, to see the spot near the foot of the monument where the temporary beach volleyball venue will be built.

From there, the whirlwind tour continued, from a new aquatics center that will not host swimming to the famed clay courts of Roland Garros, which will host not only tennis but boxing, too.
