Published: 20:21 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 20:21 EDT, 17 October 2022 As groundbreaking innovations in cancer treatment go, it may not sound very high-tech, but a chair that allows patients to sit upright during radiotherapy could transform care for thousands.The chair, which has a high-back seat with no arms, was developed by Surrey-based firm Leo Cancer Care to replace the current system, where the patient lies flat to have radiotherapy.Sitting upright can mean reduced side-effects, because being vertical during treatment reduces the risk of healthy organs being damaged by it.
