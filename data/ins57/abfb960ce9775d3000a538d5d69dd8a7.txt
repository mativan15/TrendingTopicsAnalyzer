Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News Against a broadly higher stock market Monday morning, Fox has tumbled near a two-year low - (NASDAQ:FOX) -5.8%, (NASDAQ:FOXA) -7% - after the company and News Corp. ((NASDAQ:NWS) +6.1%, (NASDAQ:NWSA) +6.7%) confirmed they were looking at recombining after nearly a decade as separate companies. The current News Corp. (parent of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, among ownership of other news organizations and publisher HarperCollins) and Fox (owner of the Fox broadcast network, Fox News, Fox Business and Tubi streaming) were split up in 2013, as a stock transaction with what was then Twenty-First Century Fox.
