Cricket has regained its footing on television after a worrying drop in viewership during the Indian Premier League (IPL), with Asia Cup and India's bilaterals with Australia and South Africa keeping fans glued. According to BARC data, both Asia Cup 2022 and the Australia tour had 13% more viewers than similar series in the past, while the South Africa series had 30% more viewers than when the two teams played in June 2022.

Fatigue had set in after three seasons of IPL were squeezed in between 2020 and 2022, experts said.
