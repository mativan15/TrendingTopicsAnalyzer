Shares of fintech lending platform Upstart Holdings (UPST -4.57%) were falling in today's trading, down 5% as of 12:09 p.m. ET.
There wasn't any company-specific news today, but the decline was likely attributable to two other factors: increased loan loss reserves taken at other large banks during this earnings season, as well as the continued rise in Treasury bond yields. So what
Upstart was likely falling in sympathy with bank stock peers that reported third-quarter earnings today, including Silicon Valley Bank and American Express.
