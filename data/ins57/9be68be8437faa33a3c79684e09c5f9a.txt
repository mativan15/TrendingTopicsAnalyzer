May 31—Charles Skold, the former chair of the Portland Democratic City Committee, and Susanne Robins, a curriculum designer with elected experience in California, are vying for the Democratic nomination for House District 119 representing part of Portland.

The seat, which is in a heavily Democratic district, is held by Democrat Mike Sylvester, who is not seeking re-election.

Robins, 62, said her experience, which includes various jobs in education and serving as a school board member and on a chamber of commerce board in California, will allow her to be an effective legislator.
