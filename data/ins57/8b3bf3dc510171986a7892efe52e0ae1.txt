This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dana Bull, a 33-year-old realtor and real-estate investor who leases and rents out 24 units across eight properties in Massachusetts. Rents in these units average about $1,800 a month, which totals about $518,000 a year in revenue before expenses. Bull declined to give her overall revenue. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I have a 24-unit rental portfolio in Massachusetts.It's been a couple of years since I managed my own properties day-to-day; I have a property manager who handles that now.
