Every now and then a brand releases a product that's so popular, retailers just can't seem to keep it in stock. Think of items like the Dyson Airwrap or the PS5. Stanley's Adventure Quencher Travel Tumbler is the latest item we've come across with a similar cult following. It sells out every time a new batch is released, and there are always thousands of people on the waitlist for the next drop. But the wait is over—right now, you can find the Stanley tumbler in stock on the brand's site. It's been almost completely sold out since mid-April, so this is a pretty big deal.
