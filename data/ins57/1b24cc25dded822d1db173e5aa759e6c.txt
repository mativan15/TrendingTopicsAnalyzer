NEW DELHI - India's capital market regulator approved the government's proposal to convert dues of over $1.92 billion by telecom operator to equity, two senior government officials said on Thursday. Last year, India had approved a rescue package for debt-strapped telecom companies that allowed them to convert interest on deferred adjusted gross revenue owed to the government into equity. Among the country's three major telecom players, including and ' Jio, the government package was seen as a bailout for Vodafone Idea, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.
