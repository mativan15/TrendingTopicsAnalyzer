Alex Martins and his team at the Orlando Magic are just days away from the start of the new NBA season.

On Oct. 19, the Orlando Magic play the Detroit Pistons in an away game. The team's first regular season home game back in the City Beautiful is on Oct. 22 against the Boston Celtics.

Meanwhile, Martins, the CEO of the pro basketball team, is coming off a busy offseason of growth for the team.

The team opened its newest downtown Orlando training facility earlier this year. The new 130,000-square-foot, $70 million AdventHealth Training Center complex at South Division Avenue and West Central Boulevard adds to the team's investment in downtown.
