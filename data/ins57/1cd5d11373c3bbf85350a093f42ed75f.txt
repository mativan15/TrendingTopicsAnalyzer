Pittsburgh police plan to post additional uniformed police officers on East Carson Street to help crack down on violence happening on the South Side; residents and business owners we spoke with say it is a welcomed addition.

'On Fridays and Saturdays, I try to stay far away (from East Carson),' said Christina, a South Side resident.

Residents who spoke to Channel 11 News said the violence is erupting every weekend, and it keeps them far away from the restaurants and bars on East Carson Street.

'Chaos, as soon as the sun starts to set, people are standing on cars as they are driving down the road,' said Christina.
