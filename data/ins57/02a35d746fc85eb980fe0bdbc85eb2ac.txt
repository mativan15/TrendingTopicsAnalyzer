One of the largest technology deals in the region will create multimillionaires, both locally and across the country.

Clearwater-based cybersecurity company KnowBe4 announced last week it accepted a $4.6 billion take-private deal from Austin, Texas-based Vista Capital Partners. Each shareholder will receive $24.90, up from the $16 per share KnowBe4 debuted on its April opening on the Nasdaq.

The Tampa Bay Business Journal reviewed KnowBe4 and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, compiling the biggest stockholders — and those standing to gain the most post-sale.
