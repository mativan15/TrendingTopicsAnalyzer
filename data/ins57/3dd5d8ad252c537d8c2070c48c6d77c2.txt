Good morning. Labor has reached the magic number of 76 seats with a win in the Melbourne electorate of Macnamara. The victory gives it majority government despite voters embracing independents and a record non-major party vote.Australians are comfortable with the substantial increase in the number of independents in the new parliament where Labor has now secured a majority, according to the first Guardian Essential poll since the federal election. Two-thirds of respondents said an expanded crossbench would be positive because a wider range of views could be represented, and only 36% expressed concern about the potential for instability or delay in decision-making.
