Oct. 19—OXFORD — In the last 15 years of college football, everybody wants their own Nick Saban.

They want a guarantee, or as close as you can get to knowing that, on almost every Saturday, your team wins.

Because that's how you grow, how you thrive and how you become the business that Alabama football has become.

Texas tried to hire Nick Saban.

Others have made splashy hires with hopes they could create their version of Nick Saban.

One of these is LSU, a team playing much better under former Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly than it did on opening night.
