The following is a lightly edited transcript of remarks made by Samantha Fillmore during a Newsweek episode of The Debate about free speech on the internet. You can listen to the podcast here:
Tech has this propensity to want to eat their cake, and have it too. Tech is currently insulated from liability through Section 230, claiming that they are simply a bulletin board or a conduit for speech, and that they are not akin to a publisher, or a radio station, or a television station. All of those entities exist as publishers and editors, and tech [companies have] always maintained that they exist outside of that realm.
