AUCKLAND, New Zealand - Hooker Emily Tuttosi scored two tries to help Canada defeat Italy 22-12 on Saturday for a second straight win and a berth in the quarterfinals at the Women's Rugby World Cup.

After conceding a try in the first minute, the Canadians scored 22 consecutive points for a second straight bonus point win (for four tries scored in a game). Tuttosi, usually found at the back of Canada's powerful driving maul, has five tries in two games at the tournament.

Third-ranked Canada (2-0-0) tops Pool B with 10 points, ahead of No.
