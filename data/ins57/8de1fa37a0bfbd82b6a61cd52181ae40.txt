Simon Cowell is launching a new music project in conjunction with TikTok that he claims will help new artists get noticed on the platform.

The StemDrop initiative is pitched as an incubator for new talent, giving aspiring artists a way to showcase their skills in a 'competitive' industry.

StemDrop will work by releasing music on Tiktok made by prominent industry figures. As soon as the track is released, the TikTok community will then be able to access the stems for the record so they can create, record and share it.
