Warning: This post contains major spoilers for Black Adam and the future of the DC Extended Universe.

Talk about a super surprise for DC Extended Universe fans. A mid-credits scene featured in Dwayne Johnson's maiden flight as anti-hero Black Adam officially brings back the big blue boy scout who laid the foundation for the current DCEU nearly a decade ago. Henry Cavill's last son of Krypton comes face-to-face with Johnson's champion of Kahndaq in the minute-long sequence, which sets the stage for not only a long-awaited standalone sequel to 2013's Man of Steel, but also a big-screen bout between Superman and Black Adam.
