Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte had doubts that fielding three strikers in Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Richarlison could disrupt the Premier League club's balance but was happy to be proven wrong by the trio's selflessness.Kane, Son and Richarlison have scored a combined 16 goals across all competitions this season for Spurs, who are third in the league on 20 points after nine matches, four points off leader Arsenal.Conte, who has picked the three forwards in six of Spurs' last eight games, said their contributions in front of goal were valuable but also highlighted their willingness to help defensively.
