Fonejacker will return to screens tonight, October 21, for just one night on Channel 4. The popular Channel 4 series, in which Iranian actor and comedian Kayvan Novak plays a variety of personalities and carries out a series of prank calls, was discontinued in 2008. Novak will now appear as Terry Tibbs in the Ben Elton-hosted reboot of Friday Night Live.

Tonight at 9 p.m., Channel 4 will celebrate its 40th anniversary with a special programme that includes music from Self Esteem and appearances by Julian Clary, Jo Brand, and Harry Enfield.
