Joe Biden has said the US would not supply Ukraine with rockets that could reach into Russia, in attempt to ease tensions with Moscow over the potential deployment of long-range missiles with a range of about 185 miles.The White House has been weighing up pleas from Ukraine – which is losing ground in the battle for Donbas – for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to offset Moscow's increasingly effective use of long-range artillery, amid Russian warnings that doing so would cross a red line.'We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,' Biden told reporters on Monday after arriving back at the White House after a weekend in Delaware.
