SAN FRANCISCO (PRWEB) May 27, 2022 Research shows that children with college savings between $1 and $500 are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate, but many Americans can't make or save enough to comfortably invest in their kids' education. That struggle is what led Backer to build a social savings platform that democratizes access to 529 plans, the double-tax-advantaged savings vehicle long utilized by wealthier Americans to lessen the burden of saving for college.
