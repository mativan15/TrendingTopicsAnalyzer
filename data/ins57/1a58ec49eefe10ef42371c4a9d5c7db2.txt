MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Steven Gerrard had only just finished telling interviewers he would fight on at Aston Villa when the announcement came.

'Aston Villa Football Club can confirm that head coach Steven Gerrard has left the club with immediate effect,' the club said in a statement Thursday. 'We would like to thank Steven for his hard work and commitment and wish him well for the future.'

It felt particularly cruel that Gerrard would be thrust in front of the cameras to defend his position if, as appears, his fate had already been sealed by a 3-0 loss to Fulham minutes earlier.
