The disproportionate assets case filed against AAP leader Satyendar Jain by the CBI has been transferred to a new judge following apprehension of bias expressed by the previous judge hearing the matter.
The CBI matter was at the stage of framing of charges and arguments had been addressed by both sides before Special Judge Geetanjli Goel. However, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) moved a transfer of proceedings application from her court and the case is now being heard by Special Judge Vikas Dhull.
