OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will almost certainly go ahead with its second consecutive half-point interest rate hike on Wednesday, as it scrambles to tame runaway inflation before price increases become self-fulfilling. The big mystery is what happens next.

All 30 economists surveyed by Reuters expect the central bank will hike its policy rate to 1.5% from 1.0% in a decision at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). That will follow April's 50-basis-point move, the first such increase in more than two decades.
