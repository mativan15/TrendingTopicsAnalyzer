The United States has charged seven Chinese nationals it accuses of waging a surveillance and harassment campaign against a US resident and his family as part of a bid by Beijing to forcibly repatriate one of them back to China.The eight-count indictment, unsealed on Thursday in a US district court in Brooklyn, New York, is the latest case by the justice department targeting China's global overseas campaign, known as 'Operation Fox Hunt'.'As alleged, the defendants engaged in a unilateral and uncoordinated law enforcement action on US soil on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, in an effort to cause the forced repatriation of a US resident to China,' said Breon Peace, United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
