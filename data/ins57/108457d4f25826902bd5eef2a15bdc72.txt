The committee set up by the government to examine reports potentially linking the death of 66 children in The Gambia to four made-in-India cough syrups has observed that the clinical information shared by the World Health Organization so far is inadequate to determine the aetiology.
This was conveyed to the WHO by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) V G Somani on Saturday.
Rutendo Kuwana from the WHO on October 13 had written to the DCGI seeking to know the progress with the investigation of the manufacturer of the four cough syrups — the Sonipat-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals.
