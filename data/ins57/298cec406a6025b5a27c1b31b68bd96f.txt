Multiple insiders are convinced that Bungie is bringing back Marathon, the first person shooter it made before Halo.
The Mac can't claim to play host to many classic exclusives, in fact probably the only one there's ever been is the Marathon series, which until relatively recently was only ever available on Apple's personal computer.
Its qualities are hard to appreciate today, 28 years after the original's release, but it was originally a groundbreaking first person shooter series and so similar in style to Halo that the two games even share some elements of the same lore (specifically in regards to AI ‘rampancy').
