The Union Cabinet announced the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat and other Rabi (winter) crops for the 2023-24 Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) on Tuesday. For wheat, the most important Rabi crop from the viewpoint of procurement, the MSP has been increased from ₹2015 per quintal (100 kg) to ₹2125, an increase of 5.5%. The latest hike in MSP for wheat is higher than what it was last year when it was increased by just 2%. In fact, the latest hike in wheat MSP is the highest since the 6.1% increase in the 2019-20 RMS (it was announced in 2018, the year before the 2019 elections).
