Grandbrothers/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Outlook Therapeutics (NASDAQ:OTLK) stock fell ~38% premarket May 31 after the company said it voluntarily withdrew an application seeking approval ONS-5010/Lytenava to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Iselin, N.J.-based Outlook said the FDA had requested additional information in order to complete the filing of its biologics license application (BLA) for ONS-5010 (bevacizumab-vikg), which it intends to brand as Lytenava for wet AMD, a chronic eye disorder that causes blurred vision or a blind spot in the visual field.
