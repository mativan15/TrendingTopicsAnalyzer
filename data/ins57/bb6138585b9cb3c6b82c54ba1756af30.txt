England made a nonsense of the underdogs tag as they brushed off the challenge of star-studded Samoa to make a winning start to their World Cup campaign.Former Huddersfield winger Dom Young justified his selection ahead of England's all-time record try-scorer Ryan Hall by scoring twice in the first half as Shaun Wane's men romped to a 60-6 victory in front of a 43,119 crowd at St James' Park.A technical fault which forced the Kaiser Chiefs to cut short the pre-match entertainment was quickly forgotten as England made a fast start, racing into an 18-0 lead inside half an hour from which they never looked back.
