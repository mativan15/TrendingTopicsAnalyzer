K R Ushakumari went to school when it was reopened after the annual summer vacation last week, just like she did in the last two decades. But, things were not all the same for her this time because instead of books, duster and chalk, she was armed with a broomstick, floor scrubber and mop at the new school and the esteemed tag of a 'teacher', which she had been cherishing as a treasure all these years, was lost forever. After 20 long years of service of teaching in an uphill tribal school in remote Kunnathumala in the district, the woman is not a teacher now but a part-time sweeper at a government school in state capital Thiruvananthapuram.
