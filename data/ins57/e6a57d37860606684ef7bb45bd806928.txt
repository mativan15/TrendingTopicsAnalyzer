Soldier Field has added a cloud-based parking system that it hopes will improve the fan experience before they even get to the stadium.

Soldier Field is working with parking tech company Amano McGann and has installed Amano One — a parking access and revenue control system — in an attempt to simplify and speed up the parking process.

Soldier Field first partnered with Roseville, Minnesota-based Amano last year before adding Amano One for this season.

Similar to accessing a digital menu at a restaurant, parkers have to point their smartphone camera at the barcode on their tickets to access Amano One.
