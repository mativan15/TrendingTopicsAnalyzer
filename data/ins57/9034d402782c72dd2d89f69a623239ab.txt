Russian stocks are "essentially worthless" despite the perceived value they hold on the Moscow stock exchange, MSCI said in a note on Thursday.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Moscow Exchange plunged by as much as 44% before recovering a chunk of those losses. A combination of economic sanctions and reduced trading have crippled the Russian economy, though sky-high gas prices have helped Russia's oil exports business.Still, Russian stocks are likely not worth their perceived values on the Moscow exchange, MSCI said, pointing to current pricing in the credit default swaps market.
