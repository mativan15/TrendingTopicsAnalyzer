: Farmers in several districts of Haryana are facing shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser which is likely to hamper the sowing of mustard crop. Farmers in Mahendergarh, Rewari, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Hisar and some other parts of the state are struggling to get the DAP, which is the much-preferred fertiliser for mustard and wheat as it contains nitrogen and phosphorus which are the primary nutrients for the crops. One bag per acre is needed in wheat sowing and half is required per acre for mustard.
