Taipei: In a first such move, Apple is reportedly planning to shift some iPad production out of China to Vietnam amid Covid-lockdowns in and around Shanghai, media reports said on Wednesday.According to a report in Nikkei Asia, the iPhone maker has asked multiple component suppliers to build up their inventories to meet future shortages and supply chain issues."The iPad will become the second major line of Apple products made in the Southeast Asian country, following the AirPods earbud series," said the report.
