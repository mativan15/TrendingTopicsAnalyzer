Kari Lake is this campaign season's breakout star.
The 'Stop the Steal' die-hard and political novice who is running for governor of Arizona looked like a no-hoper, but now has to be favored to win in November.
Lake is a new politician who is reminder of the oldest of conventional political adages: Candidate quality matters. The exceptionally poised former news anchor is a stand-out performer on the campaign trail.
She is in a line of women champions of a grassroots, right-wing populism that runs from Phyllis Schlafly to Sarah Palin to Marjorie Taylor Greene, spanning the 1950s to today.
