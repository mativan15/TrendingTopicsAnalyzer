Published: 16:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 | Updated: 16:10 EDT, 20 October 2022 Chris Jans is just seven months removed from coaching in the NCAA Tournament, a memorable experience he wants Mississippi State to feel. Fulfilling that goal depends on how well the Bulldogs adapt and execute their new coach´s philosophy. Jans takes over a MSU program seeking to move up from the three NIT appearances it had recently become accustomed to the past five years, including last spring. He believes the Bulldogs (18-16, 8-10 Southeastern Conference) can be competitive but is also mindful that transition is a process.
