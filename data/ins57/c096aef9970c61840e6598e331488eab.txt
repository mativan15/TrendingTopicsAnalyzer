(RTTNews) - The Swiss stock market on Friday wrote a finish to the two-day slide in which it had slumped more than 240 points or 2.1 percent. The SMI opened modestly higher on and saw peaks and valleys throughout the session but always remained in positive territory. The gains were in line with the rest of Europe as bourses in Germany and France posted solid gains, while the market in London were closed for its Spring Bank holiday. The European markets continue to balance slowing economic growth and record high inflation against the outlook for interest rates ahead of the European Central Bank's meeting next week.
