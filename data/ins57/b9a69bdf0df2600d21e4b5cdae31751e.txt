Global stock valuations have dropped to pre-pandemic levels, with the S&P 500 recently dipping into a bear market . However, investors need to be careful about interpreting current so-called fair valuations as a purchase signal as there are downside risks from inflation and weak earnings, Barclays says. The S&P 500 forward price/earnings ratio is at 17.5x compared with 19.0x at end of 2019 and a median of 17.2x from 2014 to 2019, the investment bank said in a note published Wednesday. The benchmark's forward p/e peak was 24.
