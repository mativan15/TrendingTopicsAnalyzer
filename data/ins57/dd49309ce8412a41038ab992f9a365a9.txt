Sony has been expanding the PlayStation brand to the PC over the last few years and has found tons of success with ports of Horizon: Zero Dawn, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man. The latest to join PlayStation's growing PC pantheon is from one of its most popular franchises: the recent remaster of Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection ($49.99) that first arrived on the PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Although it doesn't get quite the same facelift as the remake of The Last of Us Part I, Uncharted: A Thief's End and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy both receive a healthy dose of optimization, including support for ultrawide monitors, 4K resolution, AMD FS2 2 and Nvidia DLSS, and even some PS5 additions like DualSense Controller support.
