(Bloomberg) -- Most geothermal power today comes from natural geysers or drilling operations that plunge a few miles down to harness heat from buried rock. Quaise Energy, a startup based in Boston, is taking a third approach: digging deeper—and using more heat—than any company has before. To do so, it's refashioning a millimeter-wave drilling technique from nuclear fusion experiments.Carlos Araque, Quaise's chief executive officer, likens it to 'a big cousin of the microwave in your kitchen'—only with 1,000 times more power.
