Up-to-date information on FDA's actions on complex generics Generally, complex generics are products that have complex active ingredients, formulations, dosage forms, or routes of administration, or are complex drug-device combination products. Generics of complex brand name drugs (i.e., reference listed drugs) can be more difficult to develop. As such, a complex drug may be less likely to have an available generic. To help patients access important medical treatments, FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research works to better understand the scientific issues impacting complex generic development and assessment.
