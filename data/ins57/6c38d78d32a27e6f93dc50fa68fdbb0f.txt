The Miami Dolphins are listed as second-favorite team to land star running back Christian McCaffrey

We're now a little less than two weeks away from the NFL trading deadline, which means the Miami Dolphins have to get busy.

They need to trade for an offensive lineman, they need to trade for a cornerback, they need to trade for a running back, they need to trade for ... somebody, right?

At 3-3 and on a three-game losing streak, it's obvious the Dolphins could use some help and it shouldn't be that difficult for them to pull off a trade, especially when they have a tradeable asset like Mike Gesicki they can offer in return.
