The Coercive Acts (called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists) included a new Quartering Act that provided arrangements for housing British troops in American dwellings. It revived the anger that colonists had felt regarding the earlier Quartering Act (1765), which had been allowed to expire in 1770. The new Quartering Act, which Parliament passed on June 2, 1774, gave colonial governors the right to requisition unoccupied buildings to house British troops. It applied to all of British America.
