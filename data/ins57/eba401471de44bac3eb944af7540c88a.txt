Oct. 17—The Scranton police department is accepting donations for its annual coat drive aimed at helping Scranton School District children who need them.

Donations of money, coats and sweaters will be given to children in need at South Scranton Intermediate School, West Scranton Intermediate School and Northeast Intermediate School, said coordinator Melissa McCafferty.

She hopes to raise enough to provide about $2,000 for each school.

"It all depends on what they need," said McCafferty, who has been in charge of the coat drive for 16 years.
