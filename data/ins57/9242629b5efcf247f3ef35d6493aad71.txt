Marseille president Pablo Longoria insists his club will not attempt to sign Cristiano Ronaldo to partner ex-Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez amid his Manchester United fallout. Ronaldo may have already played his last match for the Red Devils after leaving the substitute's bench before the end of Wednesday's Premier League clash with Tottenham and storming out of Old Trafford.Ronaldo pushed for a move away from United during the summer after his side failed to qualify for this season's Champions League.
