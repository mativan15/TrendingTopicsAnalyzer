Zuckerberg is trying to put WhatsApp above Apple's iMessage on interoperability and privacy.

He said the Facebook-owned app is actually "far more private and secure" than Apple's.

Apple's recent privacy changes proved a major hit to Facebook's ad-based business.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg slammed Apple's iMessage on Monday, criticizing the lack of interoperability between iPhones and Android devices.

He posted a photo of a billboard ad from Facebook that jokes about iMessage limitations that make Android messages show up in green bubbles, while iPhone texts appear in blue bubbles.
