Westford, USA, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Webtoons are episodic comics or graphic novels created on the web and typically consumed in short bursts in the global webtoons market. They offer a fast-paced, visual storytelling experience with a shorter timeline than traditional comics. This makes them perfect for mobile devices and other on-the-go platforms. There are several reasons why the webtoons market is growing rapidly. First, they offer an engaging and convenient way to read comics. Second, they are especially popular in countries where there is not a large number of dedicated comics book stores or readership.
