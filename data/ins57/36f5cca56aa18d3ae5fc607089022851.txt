Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News These are far from dream times for homebuilders like Dream Finders Home (NASDAQ:DFH) as a cocktail of a tight labor market, huge (material) inflation and rapidly rising interest (and thus mortgage) rates creates severe headwinds. In October of last year, I concluded that I was finding value in homes with Dream Finders as its shares had seen a big reversal from the summer, while earnings power was still very solid and the Ukraine crisis was not on the radar yet. The cyclicality of the housing market prevented me to get involved in size at the same time as well.
