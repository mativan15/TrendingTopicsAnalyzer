Wasps netball players could be left financially "broken" by the club's demise and have nowhere else to play next season, says captain Josie Huckle.
The leading consortium to buy Wasps pulled out of their bid on Tuesday, in a devastating blow to the crisis club, which went into administration on Monday.
Huckle, who has played for Wasps since the netball franchise was founded by the club back in 2016, told Telegraph Sport that she and her team-mates were "blindsided" on Monday when they found out that they were among 167 employees who had lost their jobs.
