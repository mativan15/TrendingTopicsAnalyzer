The Chairman, National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) , Eno Q. Tuccu questioned as to how come there will be a solution to Naga political issues without a separate flag and constitution.He said, "What belongs to us that defines our political identity can never be compromised for the sweet morsel in the name of Naga political settlement."NSCN-IM had an emergency National Assembly. The outfit stated the meeting was held amidst tense moments and spontaneous upsurge of emotion as the issue to be decided matters the Naga people's political struggle of seven decades that is yet to be decided as the ongoing Indo-Naga political dialogue is in deadlock on the core issue of flag and constitution.
