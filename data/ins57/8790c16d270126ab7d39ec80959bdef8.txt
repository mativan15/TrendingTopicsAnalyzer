As the Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots are now just about an hour from kickoff, the Cleveland Browns have announced seven inactives for the game. The most notable among them are starters Denzel Ward and Jadeveon Clowney, who were ruled out earlier this week. Active for the first time, however, is sixth round rookie wide receiver Michael Woods II.

The other inactives listed by the Browns include offensive linemen Joe Haeg, Drew Forbes, and Chris Hubbard, hybrid player Demetric Felton (who has lost return responsibilities to Chester Rogers), and second-year quarterback Kellen Mond.
