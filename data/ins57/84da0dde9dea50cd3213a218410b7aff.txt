kmatija STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) is set to be taken private, raising the question of whether the stock is worth holding until the close of that transaction, and which stocks can fill the void. While STOR remains a well-run company, it may not make sense to continue owning the stock given its relative premium to peers. I discuss three worthy candidates to replace STOR in a dividend portfolio with yields ranging from 7% to 10%. The rising interest rate environment has led to great volatility and high pessimism, but dividend investors likely welcome the high yield opportunities.
