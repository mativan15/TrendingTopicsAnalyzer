Steve Whitney, who was raised in San Jose and graduated from Saratoga High School and Santa Clara University, has built a career as a producer helping to turn compelling stories into movies. His credits include 'Girl, Interrupted' with Angelina Jolie, the remake of 'The Amityville Horror' with Ryan Reynolds or 'A Wing and a Prayer,' a 2015 documentary about pilot Al Schwimmer and a covert effort to smuggle fighter planes and other weapons to Israel in 1948.
Now his own story has turned into a real-life medical drama, with Whitney fighting for his life — for a second time.
