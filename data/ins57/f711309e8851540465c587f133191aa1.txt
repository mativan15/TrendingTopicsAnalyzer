STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Now that Spencer Jones and his Stanford supporting cast have emerged as capable scorers at every spot of the court, the Cardinal are counting on being a more versatile offensive team that can regularly push the pace in transition.

This unselfish bunch relies on moving the ball and making one more pass to open things up and put pressure on the defense in coach Jerod Haase's seventh year.

'I do think we will have more variety to our offense and as a group we need to limit our turnovers and make easy plays over and over,' Haase said.
