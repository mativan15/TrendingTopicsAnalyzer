India's GDP growth for the fourth quarter of FY22 will be released today. India's economy likely slowed in the fourth quarter and is expected to grow between 3.5-5.5 percent, economists predict. Here are five indicators one should keep an eye out for. As per , in CY21, nominal private consumption expenditure (PCE) grew 16.8% (after contracting 3% in CY20) and real PCE grew 9.1% (after contracting 7.3% in CY20). Private consumption saw a 7% expansion on an annual basis in the Q3FY22 reading. Analysts have attributed faster growth in passenger traffic, petrol sales, and personal credit for the strength seen in private consumption.
