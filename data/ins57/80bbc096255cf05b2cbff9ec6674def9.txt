On the opening play of the fourth quarter Monday night in Los Angeles, Denver rookie cornerback Damarri Mathis saw Rams' receiver DeAndre Carter cut in at the first-down marker, then back toward the sideline.
Mathis broke toward the ball, dove to reach around Carter and knocked the pass to the ground on fourth-and-2 at the Broncos' 29-yard line.
Fellow cornerback Pat Surtain II arrived at his teammate first. Then Bradley Chubb got in on the celebration, as did Alex Singleton and Baron Browning as Mathis flexed.
