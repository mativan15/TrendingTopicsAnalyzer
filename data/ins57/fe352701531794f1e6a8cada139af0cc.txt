Democratic Rep. Katie Porter and Republican former Assemblyman Scott Baugh are vying to represent the 47th Congressional District, a coastal swath of Orange County that extends from Laguna Beach to Seal Beach and inland to Costa Mesa and Irvine.

The race is one of 10 key California contests in the Nov. 8 midterm election that could determine the balance of power in the House of Representatives.

Porter and Baugh both oppose oil drilling off the California coast and support expanding state and local tax deductions on federal returns.
