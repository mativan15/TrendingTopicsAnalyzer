We are now a few weeks into the TV season, so how about we take stock of broadcast-TV's freshman class performance to date?

Thus far, looking at the very basic, Live+Same Day numbers, CBS' East New York and NBC's Quantum Leap shared the title of the fall's highest-rated series launch, each netting a 0.5 in the coveted 18-49 demo.

CBS' Fire Country, meanwhile, delivered the largest audience for any freshman debut, with 5.9 million total viewers.

But of the 11 new broadcast shows that thus far have registered on the Live+7 playback table, which are enjoying the most bodacious bumps, either in their adjusted total or as a percentage gain in their preliminary numbers?

TVLine has ranked below the 11 network shows that have charted thus far, with anywhere from one to three eligible episodes through the week of Oct.
