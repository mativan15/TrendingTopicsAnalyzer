New Delhi: Despite a minor correction in Nifty50 from its peak, more than half a dozen index constituents are trading at a steep discount from their 52-week highs. The stocks will need to rally up to 100 per cent to regain their latest peaks. The list of bluechips include stocks from troubled sectors including information technology, metals, oil marketers and pharmaceuticals, which have dropped about 34-50 per cent from their respective latest peaks. IT stocks have been pressurised on the back of compressed margins and falling deals, whereas metal stocks have been struggling for the demand from global giants.
