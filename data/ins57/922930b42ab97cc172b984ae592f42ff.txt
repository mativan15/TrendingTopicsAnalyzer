MIAMI — Fifty years ago, members of the 1972 Dolphins team lifted fiery coach Don Shula onto their shoulders for a victory lap out of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, celebrating not just a Super Bowl victory over Washington, but an emphatic exclamation point on the NFL's only perfect season.

Not that the Dolphins ever spoke of perfection. Mere mention of the word felt taboo.

'I can't imagine somebody whispering to somebody and Coach Shula happening to overhear the fact that, ‘Hey, guess what! We're 11-0,'' said starting offensive tackle Doug Crusan.
