Liz Truss will try to save her premiership this week, with her fate hinging on the mood of the market and her own backbench MPs.All eyes will be on the market reaction on Monday morning, after the Prime Minister appointed Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor and effectively ditched her economic agenda in a bid to restore credibility to her ailing administration.Yet those efforts could come to nought this week if Tory MPs decide that a change of leader is required, with three members of Ms Truss's parliamentary party already breaking ranks to call on her to go.
