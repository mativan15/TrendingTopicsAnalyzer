Jun. 3—A Frederick County Board of Education candidate said she checked out all of the books from an LGBT pride month display at the Brunswick Public Library to make the library a "safe place for children."

Heather Fletcher checked out the roughly 20 books on Tuesday so that other patrons would not be able to read them, she told the News-Post on Thursday. She said she also took a cup of pins with pronouns — often used as a sign of gender identity — printed on them.

Fletcher said she was "disturbed" by the display and worried it would prompt "age-inappropriate" questions from young children.
