BERLIN (AP) — Borussia Dortmund advanced to the third round of the German Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 win at second-division club Hannover.The 17-year-old Youssoufa Moukoko forced an own goal from Bright Arrey-Mbi in the 11th minute and 19-year-old Jude Bellingham sealed the win with a penalty in 71st.Dortmund was looking for a confidence-building performance after just two wins from its previous eight games across all competitions — the nature of the team's 2-0 loss at Union Berlin on Sunday was still smarting — but it was far from convincing in Hannover.
