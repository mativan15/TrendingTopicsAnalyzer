Nourish Ingredients, a food tech company that creates animal-free fats using synthetic biology, secured $28.6 million in Series A funding, led by Horizons Ventures and supported by Main Sequence Ventures and Hostplus.

We previously profiled the Australian company in 2021 when it raised $11 million. It is one of the few companies in the food tech sector focused on developing the fats and oils that make alternative proteins have better smell, taste and cooking capabilities than traditional meat.

Creating that flavor parity has been one of the lingering challenges for alternative protein makers, James Petrie, co-founder and CEO at Nourish Ingredients, told TechCrunch.
