People in work are skipping meals, as a survey reveals one in seven people go hungry daily during the cost of living crisis.

The poll of 10,000 adults shows that one in seven people (14 per cent) across the UK are either skipping meals or going without food at certain times. However, across 47 parliamentary constituencies this number rises to one in five, or 20 per cent, and above.

The survey also found that the proportion of people across the UK skipping meals is the same for people in work and people out of work - both at 14 per cent.
