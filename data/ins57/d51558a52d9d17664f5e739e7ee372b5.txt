"It's very apparent that there is an effort beyond Harris County to do everything possible to try to stem the tide of Democrats winning elections in major Texas counties, " Commissioner Adrian Garcia said prior to Tuesday's meeting.

The Precint 2 commissioner said he is confident that the effort to push Cagle and Ramsey to skip meetings comes from higher-level power brokers within the Texas GOP, and that it "may well come from beyond" the state-level party infrastructure.

"I don't know how high up the food chain it goes," Garcia said.
