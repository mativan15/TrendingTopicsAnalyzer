CLEVELAND — Baseball had a memorable day and night Saturday, an NCAA Tournament kind of day and night. For a sport often criticized for its glacial pace and lack of ball-in-play action, it sure did produce an awful lot of thrilling sudden-death scenes from one end of the country to the other.
In Philadelphia, the 87-win Phillies upset the 101-win Braves in four. In Seattle, the Astros homered in the 18th inning to break a scoreless tie, survive a marathon, and sweep the Mariners. In Cleveland, the offensively challenged Guardians scored three Game 3 runs in the ninth to land the mighty Yankees on the doorstep of disaster.
