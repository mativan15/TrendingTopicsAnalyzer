WASHINGTON – Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Ryan take the stage Monday at 7 p.m. ET for an hour-long debate in a tight race that could decide which party wins control of the U.S. Senate.The two meet in Youngstown just a week after a first debate in which they clashed over abortion, inflation, Ryan's support of President Joe Biden, and Vance's support of former President Donald Trump.The debate kicks off only three hours after a new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network poll poll showed the race remains a statistical tie with Vance up 47.
