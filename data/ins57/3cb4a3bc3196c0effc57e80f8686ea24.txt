The one time I was approached by the police for 'possession' was during my student days at Oxford. Wild thing that I was, I'd bought some milk and cornflakes and happened to be strolling past the Examination Schools when, out of nowhere, a copper sprang out and eyed my bag. 'I'll be taking those', he said. The university authorities had begun to clamp down on the tradition of 'trashing' – smothering exam finalists in champagne and confetti-like substances – and I looked suspicious.
That was over a decade ago.
