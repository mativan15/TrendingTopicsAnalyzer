Chris Beard and the Texas Longhorns received positive news on Tuesday that forward Dylan Disu will return for another year.
CBS Sports college basketball insider Jon Rothstein reported that Disu plans to withdraw his name from the 2022 NBA draft and return to school with hopes of improving his draft stock.
Disu transferred to Texas last April after two seasons with Vanderbilt. The big man received limited playing time with the Longhorns last season, averaging 10.9 minutes per game after recovering from a knee injury suffered during his sophomore season.
