Kanye West's public turmoil continued Friday, when Business of Fashion reported that "Balenciaga has officially ended its relationship with Ye, [formerly known as Kanye West]."

The luxury fashion brand made the decision after "his controversial appearance on the podcast Drink Champs released last week, where he falsely claimed that George Floyd wasn't murdered but killed by fentanyl and made even more antisemitic remarks," Rolling Stone notes.

BoF says Kering, Balenciaga's parent company, also didn't have "any plans for future projects related to this artist.
