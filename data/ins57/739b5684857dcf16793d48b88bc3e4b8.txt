Seattle on Tuesday passed a first-of-its-kind, worker-backed minimum-wage ordinance for many of its 40,000 gig workers. The nine-member city council voted unanimously to approve the so-called PayUp policy, which will affect companies that provide on-demand delivery such as DoorDash Inc. DASH, -1.51%, Instacart, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +4.40% (Amazon Flex), Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -1.99% (Uber Eats) and others. The measure now goes to Mayor Bruce Harrell, who plans to sign it. 'Gig workers deserve a fair shake and a fair wage,' the mayor said in an emailed statement.
