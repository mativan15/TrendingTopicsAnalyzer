Oct. 15—NORTON, Va. — Governor Glenn Youngkin said Friday he will propose $10 million in the upcoming budget to create the Virginia Power Innovation Fund for research and development of innovative energy technologies, including nuclear power. The Republican governor made the announcement at a reclaimed mine site in Norton, which he said was selected as "an example" of a possible location for a proposed Small Modular Nuclear Reactor project in Southwest Virginia.

Youngkin said of the $10 million, $5 million will be used to advance the small nuclear reactor vision for Southwest Virginia.
