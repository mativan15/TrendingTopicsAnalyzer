It wasn't long ago when Edmonton's Royal Canadian Legion Kingsway Branch #175 was at risk of closing for good.
The pandemic, overdue bills and looming repairs meant the community hub was in dire need of help.Now, there are sighs of relief.'It was just like a whole weight came off my shoulders and I can start relaxing now,' said Ron Wills, financial chairman and past president of Kingsway Legion Branch #175.At a committee meeting this week, Wills asked for a reduction in property taxes, saying the legion's 2020 bill was assessed at an old rate.
