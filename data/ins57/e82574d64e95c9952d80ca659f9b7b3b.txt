Despite regular jibes about Chelsea's rubles, there was never a feeling that their players, fans or executives gave a damn. Quite the opposite.
Chelsea stood tall, broadened their shoulders and basically said, 'Yes. We've got all this money now. It's our time. So what?'
I can remember Chelsea fans waving £10 notes at us, revelling in their newly acquired status. That is the natural reaction of a football supporter who - prior to then - saw no hope of winning the league title or Champions League.
I feel similarly about Newcastle fans and would prefer them to follow Chelsea's lead in cherishing their change of circumstance, not to go on the defensive about being so rich.
