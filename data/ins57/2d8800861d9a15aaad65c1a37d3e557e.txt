Erick All has been out for the past three games for Michigan due to an undisclosed injury. It was All who stunned the Penn State defense with a late fourth-quarter touchdown to help Michigan escape Happy Valley with a win last season.
Michigan's depth on defense is also dinged with linebacker Nikhai Hill-Green is out indefinitely with a lower-body injury. Hill-Green was one of Michigan's top returning tacklers from a season ago.
Michigan wide receiver Roman Wilson, the team's third-leading receiver,  sat out last weekend against Indiana with an undisclosed injury.
