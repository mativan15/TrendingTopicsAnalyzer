I can never tell if I have curly hair or not. I'm half Portuguese so my mom has curly hair but my brother and sister don't. My hair usually air dries super poofy and most of the time wavy but I literally never air dry it, I blowdry it once a week. This is my hair about 80% dry, air dried. I did have a hood on like from my hoodie but my hair usually dried like this anyways. I've tried the curly girl method before, I've tried to use leave in conditioner and scrunch the curls, and let it air dry, use a t shirt to dry your hair, etc.
