Girl's Day singer Lee Hye-ri is back on screens in the fantasy-tinged May I Help You , a frothy mix of romantic comedy and heart-warming drama. Co-starring alongside her is fellow K-pop singer Lee Jun-young of the group U-Kiss, in one of his biggest roles yet. With her bubbly charm, Lee plays the lead character Baek Dong-joo, a young woman who starts working as a funeral director, only to discover that she has the ability to commune with the dead. Her first departed client was a young boy and, although her natural reflex was to run away in fright, she soon discovered that ignoring these new ghosts causes her to get into freak accidents, such as getting knocked out by a home run baseball outside a stadium, or tumbling down a flight of stairs outside a church.
