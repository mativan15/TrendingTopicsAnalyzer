Cheryl Burke is probably not returning to the Dancing with the Stars floor — at least not as a pro.

"A lot of people have asked me if this is my last season," the longtime cast member told Entertainment Tonight. "The answer to that question is likely yes, this is my last season, as a dancer that is."

Burke, 38, later clarified she'd like to step into a judging or hosting role for the series — though she noted she's not trying to take jobs away from the current judges and two hosts Tyra Banks and Alfanso Ribeiro.
