Bummed that you missed out on Prime Day savings last week? Well, you didn't! You can still get that TV or those AirPods at Prime Day prices because it seems someone at Amazon forgot to turn off the sales! Or perhaps they're just feeling generous — we see that some prices dropped even lower! In any case, it's not too late to load up that virtual cart with savings.
