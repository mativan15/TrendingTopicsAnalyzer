BHUBANESWAR: In order to meet the Union health ministry's Indian Public Health Standard ( IPHS ) 2022 norms, the state government plans to add around 13,000 beds across hospitals in a phased manner.A key recommendation of IPHS 2022 is to increase the number of hospital beds to at least one per 1,000 population in every district as an ‘essential' norm. Two beds per 1,000 population is a ‘desirable' target, which the states should aspire to achieve.Odisha currently has around 32,000 hospital beds and needs to increase it to above 45,000.
