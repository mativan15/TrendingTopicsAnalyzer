MarekUsz Credit Suisse Group (NYSE:CS) has started marketing for sale the U.S. operations of its asset management business, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people familiar with the business. The business, which includes a platform for buying and selling collateralized loan obligations is expected to attract interest from private equity firms, they said. Still, Credit Suisse (CS) hasn't made a final decision and may decide to hold onto the unit. The news comes as the Swiss lender is poised to unveil later this month a comprehensive restructuring that seeks to simplify the bank's organization and reduce its capital requirements.
