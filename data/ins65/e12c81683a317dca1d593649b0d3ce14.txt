Bruce Willis is enjoying his family in retirement, a video shared Sunday by his wife shows.

The actor, who stepped away from Hollywood this year after being diagnosed with the language disorder aphasia, is seen kissing wife Emma Heming Willis, dancing and playing with their young daughters, and spending time outdoors in the new footage.

'We don't believe in perfection over here but #oursummer2022 was pretty close to it. In fact it was magic,' Heming Willis captioned an Instagram post.

The clips offer a glimpse into Willis' life nearly seven months after his family announced his retirement following more than four decades in the entertainment industry.
