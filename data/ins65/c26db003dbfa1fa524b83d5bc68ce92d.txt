Liz Truss's approval rating has crashed to the lowest level recorded by a leading pollster since it began tracking UK governments' popularity more than a decade ago. 
Nine in 10 Britons said that No10 is handling the economy badly, with the Tories facing ‘electoral wipeout' if a General Election was held tomorrow, according to YouGov. 
A similar number said that they disapproved of the way the government is handling inflation, which has reached a 40-year high according to official figures released today.
