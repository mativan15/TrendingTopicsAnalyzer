Survey of more than 1,000 retirement plan participants and 100 large plan sponsors uncover concerns about generating long-term retirement income and considerations for bridging the income gap
ATLANTA, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco today released findings from a new study exploring employee (plan participant) and employer (plan sponsor) preferences for generating long-term retirement income. The annual 2022 defined contribution (DC) research, "Show Me the Income," reveals that while most employees are relying on 401(k) savings to be their largest source of retirement income – surpassing Social Security, their personal savings and investments – only a small portion of those employees are confident in their ability to generate a retirement income strategy on their own, with the majority worried they will run out of money in retirement.
