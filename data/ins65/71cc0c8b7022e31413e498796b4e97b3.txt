FRESNO –– San Jose State coach Brent Brennan didn't sugarcoat his feelings about losing to Fresno State, an 8 1/2-point underdog playing without its star quarterback Jake Haener.
'I feel awful and disappointed,' Brennan said after Saturday night's 17-10 loss. 'I let our team down. I let our school down. We didn't play our best football. It's disappointing.'
The loss was, indeed, disappointing. The Valley Cup was on the line and SJSU hadn't won a game in Fresno since 2016. Most importantly, the Spartans (4-2) were no-shows on offense.
