Americans are vastly underestimating the amount of money they need in retirement for healthcare costs.

The average estimate from folks in a recent Fidelity survey was just $41,000. In fact, Americans will spend nearly eight times that amount in their golden years, according to the new Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate, which forecast a retired opposite sex couple age 65 in 2022 may need an average of $315,000 saved (after tax) to cover health care expenses in retirement.

Fidelity's estimate is up 5% from 2021 ($300,000) and has nearly doubled from its original $160,000 in 2002.
