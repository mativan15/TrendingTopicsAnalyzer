The right wing slot on the Rangers' first line has been a revolving door in recent years. Last year alone, the Blueshirts had stretches where Alexis Lafreniere, Barclay Goodrow, Artemi Panarin and Kaapo Kakko all played there before settling on Frank Vatrano down the stretch, a combination they kept into the postseason. Go further down the page and you will see short stretches where Dryden Hunt, Sammy Blais and Julian Gauthier got turns up top as well. 
There was not an obvious candidate to play there heading into this season, and it was not clear how long Kakko would stick when coach Gerard Gallant put him there to start the year.
