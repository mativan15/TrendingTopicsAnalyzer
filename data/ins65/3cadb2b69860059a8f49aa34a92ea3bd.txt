WhatsApp is one of the most popular apps throughout the world, and many of us use it on a regular basis. For many years, iPad users have demanded WhatsApp release a separate app that can function well on iPad devices. But the company has not launched any app linked to this request. In the past, the company was seen working and testing an iPad app, but it never made it out to the market as it was never finalized. Now, WhatsApp is working on a Multi-device 2.0, which will have the ability to support the iPad.
