Madison Mayor Mary Hawkins-Butler said that next week she will reveal a set of more than a half dozen historical markers that have recently been placed throughout the city of 25,000.

The markers are part of a larger aim of telling Madison's story to residents as well as visitors.

Seven markers will be revealed next week, with two more coming at a time yet to be determined.

Historical markers will be unveiled throughout Madison next week.

'It will be special,' Hawkins Butler said.

The markers come on the heels of the city building an arch with the message 'Historic Madison' atop the ornate iron and brick structure.
