ESPN's Chris Russo this week went off about gun laws and politicians on ESPN's 'First Take'. Responding to Coach Steve Kerr's plea to 'do something' after 18-year-old Salvador Ramos opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, Russo echoed the points made by the Warriors' head coach. Russo brought up Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Sen. Ted Cruz and a local representative, who recently voted against gun control measures in March. 'They voted no on it, and then Abbott gives this speech about how they're heartbroken,' Russo said.
