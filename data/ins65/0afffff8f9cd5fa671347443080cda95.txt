The two groups signed a preliminary agreement late on Sunday and daily Il Messaggero reported on Tuesday that state lender CDP would hold the lion's share of the combined network, a project which has been mooted for years. CDP, which already has a stake in both businesses, is set to hold a 70-77% stake of the combined broadband network, the report said.
