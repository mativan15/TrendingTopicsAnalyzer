Bakery chain Greggs is giving out a free bake or sausage roll for new members.
All pastry-lovers have to do is sign up to their app, get the offer code and show it when you pay.
Similarly, Pizza Express is putting on a two-for-one offer on dine-in meals when you download their free app, check into the restaurant where you are eating and click the offer.
