As landowners continue to voice their concerns about Summit Carbon Solutions' proposed carbon sequestration pipeline, another such project is inching forward in progress.

Texas-based Navigator CO2 Ventures is also seeking to construct a carbon sequestration pipeline, dubbed the Heartland Greenway, through the region. That pipeline would run through South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois. It would collect carbon dioxide from several ethanol and fertilizer plants before pumping it underground to the Mount Simon Sandstone formation in central Illinois.
