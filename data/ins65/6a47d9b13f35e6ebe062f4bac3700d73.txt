After 36 years, the sequel to the Tom Cruise movie classic 'Top Gun' is a critical and commercial success, earning $248 million at the global box office on its opening weekend. In Taiwan, it's also being celebrated for another reason: not pandering to China. In 2019, the trailer for 'Top Gun: Maverick' showed Cruise's character, U.S. Navy pilot Pete Mitchell, in the same bomber jacket he wore in the original film. But two of its flag patches — representing Japan and the Republic of China, the official name for Taiwan — appeared to have been replaced by other emblems.
