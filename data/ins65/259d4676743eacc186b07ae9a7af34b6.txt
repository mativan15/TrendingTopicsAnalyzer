Name a 21st-century frontman more iconic than Alex Turner. We'll wait. It's 18 years — a whole teenage lifetime — since the world first tuned into the Arctic Monkeys and dropped its collective jaw. The Libertines were imploding, the pound was 1.78 to the dollar, Tony Blair's New Labour had nine years on the clock and, as the band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, hit the HMV shelves, Sheffield's Turner, just 19, was immediately hailed as the post-punk 'voice of a generation' by everyone from NME to the FT.
