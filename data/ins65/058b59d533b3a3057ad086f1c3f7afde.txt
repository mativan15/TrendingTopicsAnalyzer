The popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has plummeted in 2022, particularly among their most fervent supporters — millennial investors — according to a recent Bankrate survey.

Americans of all ages have seen their comfort level with cryptocurrency sink sharply over the last year, as these digital currencies have plunged in value at a dizzying pace.

Overall, the number of Americans who said they were "very comfortable" or "somewhat comfortable" with cryptocurrencies in 2022 plummeted by more than 39% from 2021.
