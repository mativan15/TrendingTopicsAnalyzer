At 18 years of age, Cadet Kartik Sharma of National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakvasla, was left quadriplegic after an accident while doing a ‘dive roll' in physical training exercise in February 2016.
The young boy, who had joined the academy just eight months ago, was left with 100% disability and spent over five years in Military Hospital Kirkee, near Pune, before finally being discharged and brought to his hometown in Ghumarwin of Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh.
