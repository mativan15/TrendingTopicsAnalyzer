Two frontrunners touted as successors to Liz Truss have said they are not interested in becoming prime minister. Both Ben Wallace and Jeremy Hunt had seen as potential replacements for the embattled Ms Truss. But Mr Wallace has said he wants to remain as Defence Secretary and pleaded with Tory colleagues to "stop playing political parlour games".Meanwhile, Mr Hunt said he denied he had ambitions for the top job, saying he, his wife and his children had ruled it out.
