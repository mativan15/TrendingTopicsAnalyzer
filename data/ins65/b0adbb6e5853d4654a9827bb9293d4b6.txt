It was rather a shocker to read that James C. Ho, a judge on the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, is boycotting Yale Law School. Ho reportedly told a Sept. 29 gathering of the conservative Federalist Society that he would 'no longer hire law clerks from Yale Law School.' Not only that, but he also urged other judges to boycott Yale graduates. The Fifth Circuit is notoriously conservative, but this was a step beyond the pale for that rightwing bastion.

For those who may not know, state and federal court appellate judges often have one to four law clerks, usually recent law school graduates, who assist with all aspects of the appeal process — reviewing the record, researching the issues, drafting memos for oral argument and assisting in the drafting of opinions.
