Our good friend Luke Easterling dropped his latest mock draft for 2023, because as we've already seen, it's never too early to think about next year's draft.
And he takes a very interesting route with the Cincinnati Bengals.
Easterling gives the Bengals one of the more intriguing and talented receivers in this upcoming class in reigning Biletnekoff Award winner Jordan Addison of USC with the 21st pick (order based on Super Bowl odds).
Value over need here for the Bengals, who give Joe Burrow yet another dynamic weapon.
