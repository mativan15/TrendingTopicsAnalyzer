The Sonos Ray is the cheapest soundbar in Sonos' range, cutting a big portion of the price of the Sonos Beam in exchange for losing some features, and to fit in an even smaller and more room-friendly frame.Sonos says that it's designed for the nine out of 10 people in the world who are still using their TV's built-in speakers, so for this Sonos Ray review that's how we mostly tested it – not as a replacement for a giant soundbar under a brand-new 65-inch TV, but with a 50-inch secondary TV that's several years old.
