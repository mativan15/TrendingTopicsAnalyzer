Wide receivers Kenny Golladay and Kadarius Toney have been non-factors on the field for the Giants this season and it doesn't look like that's going to be changing this week.

Golladay (knee) and Toney (hamstring) remained out of practice on Wednesday. Both players have missed the last two games and Toney has been out for four straight weeks overall, but, as mentioned, they weren't doing much to help the team when they were active.
