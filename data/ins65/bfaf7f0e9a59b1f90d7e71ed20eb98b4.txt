Hollywood star Anna May Wong will become the first Asian American to appear on US currency.
She is the fifth woman unveiled as part of new series featuring trailblazing women on US quarters, and her coin will enter circulation on Monday.
The Golden Age actress, who was prominent on cinema screens in the 1920s and 30s, is considered the first Chinese-American film star.
The other side of the quarter features first US President George Washington, with Wong the fifth pioneering female included in the initiative.
