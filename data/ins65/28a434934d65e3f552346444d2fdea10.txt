Staff at the constituency office of Member of Parliament (MP) Dan Vandal are in for a surprise Monday when they come in to work to find its windows covered with posters. It's part of a national protest action organized by the Migrant Rights Network which took place at MP constituency offices across Canada. Winnipeg organizer Michael Hewlett said it's about regularization, which is the process of giving people with temporary immigration status the same rights as permanent residents. He said it's been 10 months since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to implement regularization in Canada, but it hasn't happened yet.
