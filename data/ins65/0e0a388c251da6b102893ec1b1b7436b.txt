When audiences and artists reunited in stadiums and venues in 2021, few of the big acts performed Kansas City: Only three of the year's 20 highest-grossing concert tours made a stop here — and none in the top 10 did.

Music industry data archive Pollstar 's Top 200 North America shows of 2021 revealed that only Alanis Morissette, James Taylor and Garth Brooks performed in the metro. Brooks' stadium tour stopped at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium; Morissette and Taylor performed at T-Mobile Center in Downtown.
