	The woman who has voiced Bayonetta through two editions of the video game is claiming on social media that she's being stabbed in the back when it comes to her fee for part three.

TMZ is reporting actress Hellena Taylor is accusing the producers of Bayonetta 3 of offering her just $4,000 to reprise the character's voice. She turned down the offer, which she deemed inadequate, given her acting resume and her credentials voicing the character in prior editions. 

	Taylor was so insulted, she claimed to be breaking a non-disclosure agreement to speak out.
