The idea of restoration and protection of the earth's environment instantly elicits mental images of tree planting. The greener the environment, the healthier it must be. This is also in line with the commitment by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change of the Indian government, at the United Nations (UN) Biodiversity Summit in 2020. Here, India promised to bring 26 million hectares of degraded land under restoration efforts by 2030. This commitment comes across as a benevolent social promise when one imagines rural communities planting saplings on barren lands and converting them to lush green forests.
