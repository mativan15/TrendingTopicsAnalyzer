Antiques Roadshow can be entertaining, educational and on certain occasions, like Monday night, it can be down right joyous. The first collector featured on the episode was Vie Carlson, and she was hoping for a valuation of a letter written by Frank Sinatra in 1976.

Sinatra wrote the letter to Chicago journalist Mike Ryoko after he penned an unflattering op-ed about the famous singer in the Daily News. Among other things, Royko accused Sinatra of commandeering the Chicago police force as his own personal security detail.
