Sven Botman is well aware of the interest in him from Newcastle United and AC Milan and says he is ‘looking forward to a new step' in his career.
The 22-year-old centre-back has caught the eye at Lille since joining from Ajax in 2020, making 79 appearances for the French side over the last two seasons.
The imposing, 6'5″ defender is yet to be capped by Netherlands and has not quite caught the attention of the biggest clubs in Europe, but Newcastle and AC Milan are keen to get hold of him.
The Dutchman confirms that those two clubs are interested, and while he is keen to climb the next rung up the ladder, he sounds in no rush to jump at the first offer he receives.
