St Mirren failed to win at home for the first time in five games but in truth they were fortunate to claim even a first draw of the season. Kilmarnock did at least break their own sequence of five successive league away defeats but left Paisley last night wondering just how it hadn't been a victory.The short answer was Trevor Carson. The St Mirren goalkeeper wasn't worked unduly in a flat first period but earned his corn in the second half with a number of crucial saves, although Kilmarnock will feel they should have taken at least one of the chances that spang up in one-on-one situations.
