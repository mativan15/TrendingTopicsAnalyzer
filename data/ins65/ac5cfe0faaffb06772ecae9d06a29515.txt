LUDHIANA: Cheaper than the cheapest Jio phone, illegal guns have reached the hands of robbers, carjackers, gangs, score settlers, and the boys who aspire to be tomorrow's mafia dons. On May 30, the Division Number 1 police arrested 18-year-old Rajan Kumar of the city's Lohara area with a Saharanpur-made gun he had bought for Rs 2,500.A gun licence is now difficult to get but the supply chain of countrymade firearms is hard to break. Ten firings were reported here in May, and in six of those, illegal arms smuggled from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were used.
