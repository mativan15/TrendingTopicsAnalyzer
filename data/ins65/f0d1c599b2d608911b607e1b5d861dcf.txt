REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/FilesLONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The mood among Britain's beleaguered retail and hospitality industries darkened on Monday on fears new finance minister Jeremy Hunt's move to rein in a vast energy subsidy plan and reverse planned tax cuts would further dent demand.A two-year energy support scheme for households and businesses, expected to cost more than 100 billion pounds ($113 billion), will now end in April and be replaced by a more targeted scheme that will "cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned", Hunt said.
