Kim Kardashian has been serving soccer mum as she took son Saint to his game this week.
The mum-of-four placed an arm on her son's back as the pair of them headed to the match in LA, with Saint looking adorable in his kit.
Kim, who rocked an oversized jacket and shade and clutched a huge water bottle (no chance of dehydration here) took a seat on a camping chair and watched intently as Saint played.
The Kardashians star has four children, North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm, who she shares with ex Kanye West.
