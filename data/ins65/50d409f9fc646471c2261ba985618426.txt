Former President Donald Trump Friday argued the United States should make it easier to confine 'deranged' people and eliminate gun-free school zones after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers this week at a Texas school.
'Clearly, we need to make it far easier to confine the violent and mentally deranged into mental institutions,' Trump said in a speech at a convention in Houston of the National Rifle Association, a gun rights advocacy group.
Tuesday's fatal shooting of 19 pupils and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, by an 18-year-old gunman equipped with an AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle again focused attention on the NRA, a major donor to Congress members, mostly Republicans.
