There are several dominoes that are expected to fall within the next few months that will have a significant impact on the 2023 recruiting trail.
One being five-star quarterback Arch Manning, who is expected to attract numerous other highly rated prospects to the school of his choosing.
Some Big 12 programs have already gotten off to a hot start for the 2023 recruiting cycle, primarily Texas Tech with 20 total commits up to this point. Baylor is next in line with 10 commits of their own.
Kansas is the only program who has yet to secure a commitment for the 2023 class.
