Password manager software helps users store and organize password information. A password manager typically stores users' passwords in an encrypted database, which authorized users can unlock with a master password or key. Many password managers also offer additional features, such as randomized password generation, password sharing, and two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
While password manager software can be extremely helpful in managing the complexities of individual and group passwords, it is crucial to choose a reputable program that meets organizational needs.
