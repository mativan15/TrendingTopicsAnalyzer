Brett_Hondow Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Q3 earnings came in a hair higher than consensus as the bank benefited from loan growth, margin expansion, and continued solid asset quality, the company said Tuesday. As with other banks, Truist's (TFC) net interest income grew as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates and capital markets-related businesses and investments suffered as many markets weakened. "Overall financial results were mixed, however, as the challenging market environment impacted our capital markets related revenue," said Chairman and CEO Bill Rogers.
