Fans of K-pop band BTS were left heartbroken on Monday when it was announced the group's members were set to serve in the South Korean military, meaning no new tours or music for several years.

However, the seven members' conscription—which Seoul allowed them to defer in 2020—could also come with an economic cost.

Since releasing its first album nine years ago, the Grammy-nominated boy band—comprising members RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook—has proven its value as an economic powerhouse as well as a triumph of the entertainment industry.
