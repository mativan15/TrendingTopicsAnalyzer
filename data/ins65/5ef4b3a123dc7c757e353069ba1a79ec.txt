October 18, 2022 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: RDFN) — As home prices fall fastest in cities and mortgage rates rise, the value of a square foot in the suburbs has caught up with that of urban centers. That's according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage, which found that space in suburban homes was worth more than space in urban homes in September for the first time since Redfin started tracking this data in 2018.
