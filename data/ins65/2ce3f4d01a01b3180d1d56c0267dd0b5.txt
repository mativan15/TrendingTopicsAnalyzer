Oct. 21—The Buchanan County Presiding Commissioner seat is open after Lee Sawyer announced his retirement, and two candidates are vying for the job.

Andrew Gibson and Scott Nelson will face each other at the polls on Nov. 8.

Nelson is representing the Republican party after beating Al Purcell in the August primary. His top priority is public safety. Like many law enforcement agencies across the country, the Buchanan County Sheriff's Office is having a hard time finding qualified candidates.

"Their percentages are down as far as full staffing," Nelson said.
