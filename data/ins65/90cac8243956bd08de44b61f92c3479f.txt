What do you think is the primary role of government? The role of the school board is: #1. Setting the district's strategy and mission by representing the wishes of the parents and our community. #2. Supporting, hiring and holding accountable administrators that will execute that strategy and mission. #3. Financial stewardship – a commitment to ethical and prudent financial decision-making

What would your top priorities be if elected? 1. Academic Achievement & Accountability – A data driven focus on the programs & strategies that restore Mahtomedi as the benchmark of educational excellence.
