China is planning to annex Taiwan 'on a much faster timeline' than earlier believed, said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned that the country could use force to hasten the reunification process if 'peaceful means' don't work out.'If peaceful means didn't work, then it would employ coercive means – and possibly, if coercive means don't work, maybe forceful means – to achieve its objectives,' Mr Blinken said during an event at Standford University in California.
