Former National Party leader Simon Bridges will chair a new road carriers advisory group. John Baillie, chair of National Road Carriers, said Bridges would be chair of a new transport and logistics advisory group. It was created to offer a platform to discuss the industry's issues. 'Simon brings significant business, economic and transport experience to the role having been both the Minster for Transport and the Minister for Economic Development. His knowledge of the inner workings of Government and his background as a lawyer mean he has the ability run both a political and business lens over many of the issues the industry is facing,' Baillie said.
