A secured conference discussed the US Army's deadly threats from enemy drones. In a recent meeting with senior U.S. military officials, Sgt. Mickey Reeve gave a solution to the four-star general in charge of US Central Command about fixing an army issue. Many senior military officials and tech executives flanked him, but Gen. Kurilla was interested in hearing him. Sgt. Reeve is a 24-year-old infantryman in the Massachusetts Army National Guard. He was stationed at the Prince Sultan Air Base in 2021 and allocated to the Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems team.
