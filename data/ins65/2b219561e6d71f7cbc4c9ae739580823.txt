A nonprofit advocacy group says a researcher's avatar was raped in the metaverse.

Other Meta users have also said they were sexually harassed or abused on the metaverse.

Meta investors wanted a report on the harm metaverse users faced, but shareholders rejected the idea.

A researcher entered the metaverse, wanting to study users' behavior on Meta's social-networking platform Horizon World. But within an hour of her donning her Oculus virtual reality (VR) headset, she says she was raped in the virtual space.
