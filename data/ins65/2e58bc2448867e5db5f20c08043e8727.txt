European stocks climbed on Thursday for the first day in three, led by cyclical stocks including consumer and auto companies. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.6 per cent, reversing some of the previous session's losses. Trading volumes were thin, with the UK market closed for Queen Elizabeth's platinum jubilee. Investors were closely watching oil prices after delegates said Opec+ agreed on bigger increases in production for July and August. Markets in the region have been under pressure on worries that high inflation may lead to the European Central Bank acting more aggressively to raise interest rates, which could hurt the economy.
