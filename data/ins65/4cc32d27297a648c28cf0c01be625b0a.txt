By Clarence Leong Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.'s third-quarter profit fell 30%, as sluggish trading activities weighed on its revenue. The exchange operator on Wednesday posted net profit of 2.26 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$287.9 million) for the quarter, compared with HK$3.25 billion in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped 23% to HK$3.94 billion, weighed by declines in trading and clearing fees, it said. The headline average daily turnover fell 41% to HK$97.6 billion. Hong Kong's initial-public-offering market showed a recovery from earlier this year, the company said.
