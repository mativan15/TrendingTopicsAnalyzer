The Miami Hurricanes are one of only two teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference without a designated special teams coordinator on their on-field staff, and the unconventional approach has been a major success for Miami so far.

Last year, the Hurricanes were very solid on special teams, ranking 27th in the nation, according to ESPN's SP+. This year, they have been even better, all the way up to No. 18 with half the season done.

'We've had some really good moments,' coach Mario Cristobal said.
