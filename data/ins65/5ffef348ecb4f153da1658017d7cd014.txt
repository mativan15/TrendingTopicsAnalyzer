Linklaters advised Vodafone on the contribution of its German fibre business to a joint venture with Altice Group. Through the resulting largest fibre-optic alliance in Germany, the expansion of the fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany is to be further advanced and up to 7 million homes are to be deployed with fibre connections (FTTH) over a period of six years. During the expansion phase, up to € 7 billion are to be invested. Operational activities are expected to start in spring 2023 after receipt of regulatory clearances.
