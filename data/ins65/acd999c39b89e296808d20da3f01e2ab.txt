Commercial EV company Arrival is restructuring its business for the second time in six months as it tries to squeeze the most out of its remaining capital.
The company said in a regulatory filing posted Thursday that it is shifting its focus towards the to the United States and away from the UK market, where it is headquartered and the first EV vans were supposed to be delivered.
Arrival, which went from stealthy electric vehicle startup to a publicly traded company via a SPAC merger, said it will now put the bulk of its remaining resources towards producing a 'family of van products' for the U.
