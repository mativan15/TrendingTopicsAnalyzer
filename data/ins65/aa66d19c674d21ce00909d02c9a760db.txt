In February this year, cooks and food writers Olia Hercules and Alissa Timoshkina met up at a protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They immediately decided to do something to help. By encouraging bake sales, supper clubs and donations from restaurants they've gathered support from both the public and the food industry, raising a huge amount of money for charities, including Unicef. #CookForUkraine won the Editor's Award at the OFM Award 2022
