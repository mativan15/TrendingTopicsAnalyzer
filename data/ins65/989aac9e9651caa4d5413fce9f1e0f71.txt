There truly was not a dry eye in a household across the country following Jayde Adams and Karen Hauer's American smooth on Strictly Come Dancing this week.
The comedian had fans cheering at their TVs last Saturday with a fierce body-positive Flashdance cha cha cha.
But there was a change of pace for week four as she danced to Bette Midler classic, Wind Beneath My Wings, which she dedicated to her sister, who died 11 years ago.
Jenna Adams previously suffered a seizure out of the blue, leading to doctors discovering a tumour in her brain.
