Rishi Sunak has insisted his £15bn cost-of-living support package will have only a 'minimal' impact on inflation, raising prices by less than 1 per cent.The chancellor denied backbench Tory complaints that his measures – which also included a £5bn windfall tax on energy companies – were un-Conservative.Leading economic thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies today said that the package set out on Thursday was 'something that Gordon Brown could be proud of'.And economists warned that the massive handout, designed to relieve the burden on households of fast-rising energy costs, will inevitably force inflation up and result in increases in mortgage interest rates.
