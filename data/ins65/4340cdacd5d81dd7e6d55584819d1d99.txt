Fallout: New Vegas developer Obsidian isn't working on a new Fallout game currently - but its CEO Feargus Urquhart says "there's not a question" about doing one if he was asked.Speaking to DualShockers, Urquhart said his studio would unquestionably work on a new Fallout game if the opportunity arose, though he doesn't know if Bethesda would ever ask it to."If we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it. There's not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it's just: Will the opportunity arise?," Urquhart said.
