Inclusive Capital Partners, the American investment group, launched an attack on the performance of the London-listed developer Countryside as it took a £1.47 billion takeover bid direct to shareholders.The San Francisco-based investor, which already owns 9.2 per cent of the company, made its proposed 295p-a-share offer public today, going over the heads of the board, which has rejected two previous confidential bids tabled since March.'The In-Cap team believes that Countryside shareholders deserve the opportunity to decide on the merits of any offer,' it said in a stock exchange statement.
