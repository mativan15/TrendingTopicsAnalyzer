AzmanJaka While shares of Waste Management (NYSE:WM) have held in relatively well over the past year, shares have taken a hit over the past two months as concerns around the recycling unit have grown. However, WM's diversified business and strong pricing power make it a long-term winner. I am reminded that Warren Buffett once said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' Waste Management is a 'wonderful company' in my view, and pullbacks like this offer an opportunity to add to positions.
