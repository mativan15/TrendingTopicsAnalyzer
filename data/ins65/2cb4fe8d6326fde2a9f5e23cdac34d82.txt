It is an institution that Mahatma Gandhi established in 1920. Now, Gujarat Vidyapith's decision to give the chancellorship to Governor Acharya Devvrat has sparked a row, with critics questioning the move to hand over the position to a 'non-Gandhian' for the first time. On October 11, Devvrat, 63, accepted the offer. He opens up about the controversy and his passion for natural farming, cow-rearing, and more in an exclusive interview to The Indian Express.
