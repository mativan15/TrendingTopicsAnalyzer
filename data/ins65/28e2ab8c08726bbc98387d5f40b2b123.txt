Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo called Bank of America his number one pick for a "favorable bank investment." Mayo reiterated his overweight rating on the stock, saying in a late Tuesday note that Bank of America's stock price is promising even after pricing in a recession. Bank of America shares are down nearly 26% from their 52-week high. "We reiterate our Overweight rating on BAC and see a favorable reward-to-risk scenario of at least 3-to-1 and a weighted average return for the stock of up 40%, assuming a one-third chance of recession," Mayo said.
