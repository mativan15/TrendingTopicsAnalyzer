The government lifted the ban on fracking in England last month

Three Tory MPs look set to defy the government on fracking, after it declared a vote on banning shale gas extraction a "confidence motion".

Labour wants to use a vote in Parliament to force the introduction of a draft law to ban fracking.

The government has ordered Tory MPs to support its policy, or face expulsion from the parliamentary party.

Ahead of the showdown, three Tory MPs signalled they could not "vote tonight to support fracking".
