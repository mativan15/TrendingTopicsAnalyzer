"Traditional approaches to security strategies may miss key risk scenarios that critical assets face in high-risk jurisdictions," says Michel Hébert, research director of security and privacy at Info-Tech Research Group. "These include high-risk travel, heightened insider threats, advanced persistent threats, and complex compliance environments.
