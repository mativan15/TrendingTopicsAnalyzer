Sandra Bruff was reduced to tears after realizing the Pavilion Food Bank's fridges and freezers would need to be emptied after seven days without power. Last Thursday, she and a team of four others got rid of spoiled or rotting milk, meat, eggs and produce at the Greenboro-neighbourhood food bank. "We had nothing left in the fridges and freezers," said Bruff, who chairs its board of directors. "Absolutely nothing. We had to throw everything out."  Like many Ottawa neighbourhoods, Greenboro lost power for several days following the derecho storm that struck the city and other parts of Ontario and Quebec on May 21.
