The last three weeks had to be an evaluation and film study nightmare for the Oklahoma Sooners. There were injuries, bad technique, and missed assignments on both sides of the ball. They needed a decent performance against a tough Kansas team, and they delivered on Saturday.

The result was far from dominant unless you look at the offense's performance alone but what transpired was a team desperate for a win that played hard and didn't let up.

As we do at Sooners Wire, we took time to grade each unit for their performance in Oklahoma's 52-42 win.
