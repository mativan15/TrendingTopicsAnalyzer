The Bank of Canada is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday, a move designed to rein in inflation, running at its highest level in decades.There's a virtually unanimous view among economists that the bank will move its benchmark lending rate to 1.5 per cent on Wednesday, the second such hike in a row and a crystal clear signal that the pandemic-induced era of cheap money has come to an end.While that's bad news for anyone who owes money or wants to borrow some, it's not hard to see why the bank feels compelled to act.
