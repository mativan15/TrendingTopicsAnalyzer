Over the summer, when Anthony Davis was working on his body, mind and psyche after yet another injury-marred campaign with the Lakers, a member of his camp expressed something dire.

'Yo, AD, we gonna get our asses run out of L.A. if we don't get it right this year.'

If nothing else, Davis has a sense of humor, is kind and even-keeled.

He laughed when asked if he recalled that comment.

'Man, we talked about so much that I don't even remember, to be honest,' a smiling Davis said.

What Davis does know is that the Lakers' faithful wants to see him on the court much more than the 40 games he played last season.
