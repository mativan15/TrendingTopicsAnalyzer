According to a report by Jeremy Fowler at ESPN, the Seahawks have made cornerback Sidney Jones available for a trade.
Jones (6-foot-0, 181 pounds) performed well above expectation last season, only allowing two touchdowns in coverage and an 84.3 passer rating. However, he's fallen out of the rotation this year thanks to the ascendance of veteran Mike Jackson – who has taken his spot at left cornerback – as well as standout rookies Tariq Woolen and Coby Bryant. So far, Jones has only appeared in three games and played 45 defensive snaps.
