Clive Hamilton personifies the Australian progressive 'public intellectual'. He's a prolific author of opinion articles and books, concerned 'to make a difference in the world' by persuading people to engage with 'powerful ideas'.

His memoir describes almost 40 years of activism. The tone is often confessional: he admits to an introvert's terror at electioneering and a white progressive's anxiety about what to say to Indigenous people. Despite this, Provocateur is most of all a narrative of 'ideas in action', embodied by one individual.
