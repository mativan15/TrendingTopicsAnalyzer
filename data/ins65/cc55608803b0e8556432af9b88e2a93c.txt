More Americans are expected to travel for the Memorial Day weekend than last year despite record-high gasoline prices, costlier airfares, higher hotel rates and a wave of coronavirus infections – the result of pent-up demand outstripping health concerns and escalating prices, industry experts say. Surveys show that gas prices averaging up to $6 per gallon in some parts of the country and $4.60 nationwide – a 50% jump from a year ago – have prompted some travelers to stick closer to home. However, many will seek less expensive hotels or cut back on entertainment and eating out to afford a getaway, experts say.
