The Minnesota Vikings made three roster moves on Tuesday, including releasing wide receiver Blake Proehl who was entering the third week of his practice window coming off the Physically Unable to Perform list. What was intriguing was that the Vikings didn't immediately fill Proehl's roster spot.
On Wednesday afternoon, they did just that by signing outside linebacker Benton Whitley to the active roster.
