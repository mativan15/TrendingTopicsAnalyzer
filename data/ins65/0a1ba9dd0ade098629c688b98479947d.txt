The Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by the Andhra Pradesh government in the Supreme Court about one month ago against the Andhra Pradesh High Court verdict on the proposed three capitals has been assigned a number, and is likely to be heard in the first or second week of November.Citing its inability to implement the High Court order to develop Amaravati as the sole capital of Andhra Pradesh in the stipulated time frame, the State government had approached the Apex court for imposition of a stay on it.
