Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged his nation will prevail in its fight to develop strategically important tech, underscoring Beijing's concern over a U.S. campaign to separate it from cutting-edge chip capabilities.

'We will focus on national strategic needs, gather strength to carry out indigenous and leading scientific and technological research, and resolutely win the battle in key core technologies,' Xi said in a speech Sunday at the opening of the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress in Beijing.
