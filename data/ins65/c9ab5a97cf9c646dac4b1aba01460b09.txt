Half of parents believe that toys are some of the best teachers their kids will have (52%), according to new research.
A survey looked at how 2,000 parents value their child's toys' ability to educate them and found that on average, people think that it's important to start educating kids about issues in the world at seven years old.
Even in the age of tech, the average child has 26 toys and more than a third of parents said their child continues to ask for new ones at least once a week (36%).
Many parents may not mind, though, since 79% agree that play is a form of self-care for kids, and another 65% said toys these days actually help teach kids about the world.
