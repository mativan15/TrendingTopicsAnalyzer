The 'deadline' for the Karnataka government to include Panchamasali community into the 2A reservation category of state's other backward classes (OBC) was over, said Kudalasangama-based mutt seer Basavajaya Mrutyunjaya Swami on Friday, as he threatened that 2.5 million members of the caste group will now show their power by laying siege to the state's assembly on December 12. Addressing a convention of the community at Hukkeri town in Belagavi district, the Panchamasali seer said the long-pending and much-pleaded struggle to get the caste group included into the 2A reservation category has reached its final stage.
