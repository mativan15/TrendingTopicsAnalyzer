Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan has this week announced plans to host an international donors' conference to help it recover from catastrophic floods that caused widespread devastation and major financial losses this summer.
The United Nations and France have also offered to hold a donors' conference to generate funds for the country, which is among the most climate-vulnerable nations despite contributing less than one percent to global carbon emissions.
But many analysts believe that a globally faltering economy, a rising energy crisis and Western questions over Pakistan's geopolitical alliances mean providing much-needed funding will remain a stark challenge.
