Dame Deborah James has clarified that the comment she made about not dying over Jubilee weekend as her thunder would be stolen by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry was ‘a joke'.
The You Me And The Big C podcast host and campaigner revealed last month that she is receiving end-of-life care at her family home in Surrey.
She was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer in 2016 and began documenting her journey with treatments on social media, which led to a huge following.
The 40-year-old, who was honoured with her damehood at home, personally, from Prince William last month, had previously quipped that she was ‘determined not to die' over the Bank Holiday weekend as she didn't ‘want Meghan stealing my thunder'.
