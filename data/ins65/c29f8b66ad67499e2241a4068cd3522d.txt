Thousands of victims of the infected blood scandal will receive compensation payments of £100,000 by the end of this month, the government has confirmed.It comes after a report published in July by infected blood inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff said the interim payments should be made "without delay".
But bereaved relatives say the announcement fails to recognise most family members, who will miss out on this raft of interim payments.The scandal has been labelled the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.
