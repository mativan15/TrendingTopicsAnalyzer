Former Brexit Secretary Lord Frost has rounded on the Government over its 'invented' net zero target.

He argued that the stated goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was passed with 'limited debate' and claimed it has had negative impacts on the energy sector.

Lord Frost's comments were made during a debate in the House of Lords over what steps should be taken to support behaviour change as a pathway towards net zero.

He said: 'We all agree that decarbonisation is a very desirable goal, but I would say that aspiration is different from the specific net zero 2050 policy.
