Expecting a further rise in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the state health department has written a letter to the district collectors to boost up testing, genome sequencing and surveillance. The letter sent on Friday further instructed that masking in closed places 'is a must'.
In the last one month, active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra have surged six-fold. Taking note of it, Additional Chief Secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas stated in the letter that the daily cases have crossed 1,000 for the first time after three months on June 1.
