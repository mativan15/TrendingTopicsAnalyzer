The Indian government is in talks with the market regulator seeking to relax a key public shareholding norm for the potential buyer of IDBI Bank in a bid to attract a larger pool of suitors, according to two sources. Earlier this month, India invited bids for a 60.72% stake in IDBI Bank -- which is 45.48% owned by the government and 49.24% by state-owned Life Insurance Corp (LIC) -- after dragging its feet for years.
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), India's capital markets regulator, mandates a minimum 25% of public shareholding for all listed entities, excluding state-owned companies, within three years of listing.
