Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of XLMedia PLC (LON:XLM) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
