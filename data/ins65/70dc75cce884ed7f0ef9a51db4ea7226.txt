Everton manager Frank Lampard says Dominic Calvert-Lewin cannot begin to think about his World Cup hopes with England until he has started producing for his club.
The striker has managed just 38 minutes of football this season after a knee injury on the eve of the campaign, having also been sidelined for much of last term.
Lampard has been holding back the 25-year-old in an attempt to ensure he reaches peak fitness but even after back-to-back substitute appearances the Toffees boss is still cautious.
