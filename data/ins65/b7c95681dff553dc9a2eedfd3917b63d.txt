The 2022 college football season hasn't even kicked off yet, but that hasn't stopped many national media outlets from projecting bowl game matchups.
In College Football News' post-spring bowl game projections, the Texas Longhorns found themselves back in contention after not qualifying for a bowl last season, and the Oklahoma State Cowboys appear to be the top team in the Big 12 with a New Years Six projection.
Texas Tech, Iowa State, Oklahoma and Baylor were also projected to various bowl games.
