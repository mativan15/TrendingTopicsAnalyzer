Lois appeared on this morning's episode of Rip Off Britain, explaining how she got scammed and was now at a total loss. Similar WhatsApp scams have been running rampant as fraudsters target parents and pretend to be their children.Lois explained that it all started with a simple WhatsApp message from who she believed was her son. The message read: 'Hi mum, I've changed phone provider. This is my new phone number for 24 hours until my old number imports in.'Shortly after this, Lois received another message, this one far more concerning than the first.
