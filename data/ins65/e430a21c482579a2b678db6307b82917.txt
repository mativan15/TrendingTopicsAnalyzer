Like many other milk-producing farmers in the State, who are complaining about low procurement prices being paid by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, farmer Kanthimathi Shanmugam too says she has been spending increasing amount on feeding her cattle.  'I went to Rasipuram recently to my relative's house, whose family is also into milk production, and I did not believe them when they said that they get a between ₹37-Rs.40 per litre of milk from a private dairy. We get ₹28 and ₹29 per litre when the fat is just about right.
