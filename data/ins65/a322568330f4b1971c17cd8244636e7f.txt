T﻿he introduction of Yves Bissouma into Tottenham's midfield was key in their 2-0 win over Everton, says the club's former midfielder Jermaine Jenas.B﻿issouma came on for Spurs on 52 minutes, shortly before the home side opened the scoring and later doubled their lead."I﻿ felt for a while that Spurs have needed to go with three in midfield," Jenas told Match of the Day."T﻿here was a definite change in the way Tottenham played the minute Bissouma came onto the pitch. That extra body created more movement for Tottenham and it gave more space for Kane and Son Heung-Min to operate in.
