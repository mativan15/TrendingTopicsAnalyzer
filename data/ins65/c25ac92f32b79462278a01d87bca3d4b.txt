May 31—Staffing shortages have reared their head in the Wilson County Emergency Management Agency and the Wilson County School System. Now, the sheriff is sounding a similar alarm.

Wilson County Sheriff Robert Bryan laid it all out bare before the Wilson County Budget Committee during a recent workshop, where department heads presented their needs list for the upcoming fiscal year.

"The night of the meeting, we were down to 20 correctional officers," Bryan said.

One of the key contributors to the exodus of officers is competition from the private sector.
