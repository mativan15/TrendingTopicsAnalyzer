SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Sheryl Sandberg, the No. 2 executive at Facebook owner Meta, is stepping down. Sandberg has served as chief operating officer at the social media giant for 14 years. She joined from Google in 2008, four years before Facebook went public.
'When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years. Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life,' Sandberg wrote on her Facebook page Wednesday. Sandberg has led Facebook — now Meta's — advertising business and was responsible for nurturing it from its infancy into an over $100 billion-a-year powerhouse.
