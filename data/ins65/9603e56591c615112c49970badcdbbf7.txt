By Ed Frankl Lanxess AG said Tuesday that it would join with private-equity firm Advent International Corp. to buy Royal DSM NV's engineering-materials business for around 3.7 billion euros ($3.99 billion) and create a new venture for high-performance plastics. The announcement came after the Netherlands-based DSM said earlier Tuesday that it would merge with Swiss fragrance company Firmenich SA to create a company with a EUR25 billion market cap. The DSM engineering-materials business, which would become part of the joint venture, represents sales of around EUR1.
