Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers had a simple idea for what his offense needs to do to get better after Sunday's loss to the New York Jets.

Be more simple.

'Simpler. Simpler. Simplify some things,' Rodgers said moments after the 27-10 defeat.

The Packers scored just three points on eight possessions in the first half and just 10 total points on 13 drives. Green Bay's struggling offense has contributed to a 3-3 start after six games, including back-to-back losses to the New York teams.
