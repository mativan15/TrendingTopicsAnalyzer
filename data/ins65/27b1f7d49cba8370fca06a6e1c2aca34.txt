My brother, Paul Dufour, who has died aged 74 from cancer of the brain and lungs, was a sought-after musician, who, in his 50s, became the original drummer with the rock band the Libertines, fronted by Pete Doherty and Carl Barât.

Paul joined the Libertines in 1997 before they became famous. As a new, unrecorded teenage band, they needed a drummer, and the recording engineer/producer Gwyn Mathias, a friend of Paul's, suggested him to them. He left the band after two or three years, but in 2014 worked with Doherty again, accompanying him – on cajon drum – at two venues (including the O2 in Oxford) when Pete was doing a solo tour with just his guitar.
