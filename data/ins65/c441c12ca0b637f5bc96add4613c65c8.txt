Rebecca Bishop, a professional baker, was ground down. Having run her Norfolk bakery Two Magpies on her own for three years after her then husband left suddenly, she was nearing burn-out.'I loved it but I hated it at the same time. That was the sort of state I was in,' said Bishop, now 55. 'It was really challenging ... because we were both directors and I couldn't even contact him for a year, so it was really messy.'She then met Steve Magnall, now 58. After a brief spell helping her to try to sell the business, they decided in 2018 that instead he would join her as co-owner and chief executive, and together they would grow Two Magpies to multiple sites.
