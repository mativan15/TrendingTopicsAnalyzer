Tech billionaire and investor Elon Musk has planned to lay off most of Twitter's workforce if and when he completes his $44 billion purchase of the social media company, according to a report by The Washington Post. While pitching his Twitter purchase deal to prospective investors, Musk said that he plans to cut nearly 75% of Twitter's workforce, leaving the company with just over 2,000 employees, the report said.



Twitter Inc., however, told its staff that there haven't been plans for companywide layoffs since it signed a deal to be acquired by the billionaire and warned employees to expect 'tons of public rumors and speculation' as the closing of the deal nears.
