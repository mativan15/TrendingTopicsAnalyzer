Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have created a multitude of new opportunities for artists to take control of their work. But the blockchain technology is not without its risks, as Seth Green now knows all too well.

The actor and 'Robot Chicken' creator has spent much of the past year developing a new show based on an NFT he purchased from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The series, 'White Horse Tavern,' was set to be centered around Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398, an ape cartoon that Green acquired in 2021.
