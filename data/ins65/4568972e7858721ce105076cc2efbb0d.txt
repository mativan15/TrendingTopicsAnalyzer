ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has seen their stock pullback around 25% so far this year, which is pretty similar to the NASDAQ pullback, comprised mostly of technology stocks. The company recently reported a strong start to the year with revenue growing 26.5% to $1.72 billion and coming in above expectations.
