(RTTNews) - European stocks are set to open a tad higher on Wednesday as Shanghai lifted a painful two-month lockdown and a private survey showed China's factory activity shrank at a slower pace in May. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI rose to 48.1 in May from a 26-month low of 46.0 the previous month. Asian markets traded mixed while the dollar hit a two-week high against the yen after U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated the Federal Reserve's "laser focus on addressing inflation" ahead of the November midterms.
