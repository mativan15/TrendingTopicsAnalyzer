China has come under fire for allegedly brutally suppressing protests outside its consulate general in Manchester, with alleged staff destroying provocative signs and dragging an activist off the street and "beating" him up. Footage released online showed a fight breaking out between masked men and protesters, which was swiftly broken up by the police. The protest occurred on Sunday as Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasised the importance of security in a bid to claim his third term as leader of the autocratic nation.
