It makes Russian goods uncompetitive in international marketsThe ruble's rapid gains may pose a risk to the country's economy in the future, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov told reporters earlier this week."The current exchange rate is a problem in the long run, because the real effective exchange rate is 40% stronger than in the last five years," the minister said.According to Reshetnikov, the ruble's strength makes Russian goods uncompetitive in foreign markets."This is a serious challenge for the domestic manufacturer, which, as import channels are restored, will increasingly feel pressure [from imported goods], trying to compete with them and losing this competition," he stated.
