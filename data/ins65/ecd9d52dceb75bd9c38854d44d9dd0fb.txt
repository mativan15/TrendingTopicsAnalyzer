(Bloomberg) -- Asset values at BT Group Plc's pension fund fell about £11 billion ($12.5 billion) in recent weeks as an investment strategy linked to UK government bonds roiled markets, prompting the Bank of England to intervene.The disclosure is one of the first to show how derivatives linked to liability-driven investment strategies caused huge mark-to-market losses for pension funds. The chaos was triggered after the Conservative party's uncosted mini budget sent gilt yields soaring, leading the central bank to introduce a temporary buying program to calm markets.
