The prosecution claim Jemma Mitchell murdered her vulnerable friend, Mee Kuen Chong, to get money to pay for house repairs. It is alleged that Mitchell was caught on CCTV footage dragging a large blue suitcase from the 67-year-old victim's house in Wembley, north-west London, before getting a cab home to nearby Willesden on June 11 last year.
