The values of cryptocurrencies are dropping on Thursday as the industry continues to go through some major growing pains. As values drop, companies start to lay off workers, which cuts into enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and a downward spiral begins. 
As of 11 a.m. ET, the value of Bitcoin (BTC -0.03%) was down 3.3% in the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH -1.72%) was down 5.2%, Solana (SOL -2.90%) had dropped 7.2%, and Dogecoin (DOGE -0.79%) was down 4.3%. From peak to trough, the cryptocurrencies were at one point down 6.
