One of Australia's top doctors said medics are threatening to quit their jobs after reports claimed the profession was riddled with rorting.

On Monday, it was suggested as much as $8billion was rorted from Medicare annually, which prompted the head of the Australian Medical Association Professor Steve Robson to comment.

Professor Robson shared a tweet that suggested doctors were leaving general practices as a result of the reporting.

He shared a picture from a GP, which read: 'Many GPs sending me DMs like this in the last 24hours'.
