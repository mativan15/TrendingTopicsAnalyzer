A "major incident" was declared on the Shetland Isles today after a fishing vessel accidentally damaged a cable which provides vital telephone and internet communication to the island. In the aftermath, one expert said he had other suspicions as to the cause, one being that it may have been a "dry run by Russia to test a larger attack against undersea cables." While the communication failure left 22,870 people without basic access to their mobiles and landlines - there are fears a bigger scale target on cables linking Europe and England with North America could cause a widespread communication outage.
