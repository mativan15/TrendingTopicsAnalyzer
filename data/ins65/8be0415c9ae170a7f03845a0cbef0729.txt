After nearly two months of lagging behind her GOP challenger in every publicly released poll, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto finally edged in front in a new Nevada survey this week.

But that poll, from Suffolk University and USA Today, wasn't necessarily good news for Democrats' most vulnerable Senate incumbent.

The toplines showed Cortez Masto, who is seeking a second term, leading GOP nominee Adam Laxalt, 46 percent to 44 percent. That's still better than trailing, but it's also well within the survey's margin of error, and Cortez Masto's vote share is well under the 50 percent threshold that's considered dry land for incumbents.
