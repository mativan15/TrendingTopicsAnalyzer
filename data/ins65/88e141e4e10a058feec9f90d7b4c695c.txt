One of the most iconic movie cars of all time has been reimagined as an EV and the results are spectacular. After months of teasing, DeLorean unveiled the ‘Alpha5' - a battery-powered supercar that's far removed from the classic wedge shape of the Back to the Future car.The original DeLorean motor company (DMC) is long extinct, but the new organisation has plans to launch several cars following the Alpha5.That car will be put into production some time in 2024 with an initial run of just 88, a nod to the 88mph speed needed to send the movie car back to the future.
