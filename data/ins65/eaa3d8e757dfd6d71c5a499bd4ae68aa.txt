A Virginia mother is desperate for help with only two weeks' worth of medical-grade formula remaining for her two young children who risk permanent brain damage without proper nutrition.Alexa Beichler told "America's Newsroom" Tuesday that the formula she needs for her boys' metabolic disorder is nowhere to be found and she doesn't know what she's going to do as the shortage worsens.The out-of-stock rate for baby formula jumped to 70% in May, nearly twice what it was in April. And while the Biden administration celebrated importing 78,000 pounds of formula, Beichler said the shipment didn't have any of the special formula she needs.
