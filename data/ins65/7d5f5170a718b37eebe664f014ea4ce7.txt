JHVEPhoto/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Intro We wrote about Shoe Carnival, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCVL) back in March, when we stated that shares would be a strong buy on any sustained pullback. Since we penned that piece, shares have now lost more than 12% of their value and currently sit just above the $27 level. As the chart below demonstrates, investors need to be prepared if indeed shares drop to the $21+ level, which in earnest is long-term support for Shoe Carnival. As we can see from the chart, shares have already lost their 50-week moving average, and if the 100-week is also lost over the near-term, then the 200-week may quickly come into focus ($21.
