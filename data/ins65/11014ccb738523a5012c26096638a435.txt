AICC spokesperson Sasoju Sravan has accused Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao of using farmers as pawns to further his national political ambitions, and said farmers have been left in the lurch with the government ignoring them and failing them at every level. At a press conference here, he said KCR was busy offering compensation to Punjab farmers with the money from the Telangana exchequer while ignoring 8,400 farmers suicides in his own state. He said KCR had announced that he would procure all the paddy within a week during his Deeksha in NewDelhi but not even 31 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured till now out of the 92 lakh metric tonnes of paddy produced.
