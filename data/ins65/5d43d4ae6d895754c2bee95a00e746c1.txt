Silvio Berlusconi has undermined his nascent coalition with the incoming Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni by hurling insults at her, throwing the media mogul's peculiar attitude to women back under the spotlight.The former Italian prime minister, 86, described Meloni as 'patronising, overbearing, arrogant' and 'offensive' after she refused a senior cabinet post to one of his senators and blocked his attempt to take over the justice ministry.Meloni, 45, leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party, took the top spot in elections in September and hopes to form a government this month.
