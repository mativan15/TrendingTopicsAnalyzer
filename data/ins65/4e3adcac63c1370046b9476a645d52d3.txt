A Regina firefighter spent the last couple of months competing in – and winning – FireFit competitions across North America. Kerry Gardner participated in his first FireFit challenge in Regina in August and has since set his sights on the world stage. The FireFit challenge consists of a course designed with tasks a firefighter would experience in their line of work and tests physical and cardiovascular strength. 'As soon as I did the first competition here in Regina I just fell in love with it,' Gardner said.
