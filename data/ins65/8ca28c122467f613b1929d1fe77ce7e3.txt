Last month, the blockchain Ethereum celebrated the successful completion of the merge, a long-anticipated technical update. The merge made Ethereum far more environmentally sustainable and harder to hack, and it laid the groundwork for the network to scale toward mass adoption.

But the merge has also brought at least one unintended consequence that critics argue threaten the whole premise of the network: More than half of the network's activity is now subject to new U.S. government sanctions. It's a twist that runs counter to everything Ethereum stands for, as it has long prided itself on being autonomous from governments and resistant to censorship.
