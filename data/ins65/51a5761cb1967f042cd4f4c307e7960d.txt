The logo for Goldman Sachs is seen on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., November 17, 2021. 
A former London-based Goldman Sachs banker alleges he was unfairly dismissed with a "woeful" lack of proper procedure after whistleblowing on 10 occasions and that he was forced to deal with "vile and bullying language".Thomas Doyle, the former EMEA head of synthetic swap sales, alleges he was fired in 2021 with no warning letter or proper performance management and was told he was "causing disruption and conflict", a court document seen by Reuters on Monday showed.
