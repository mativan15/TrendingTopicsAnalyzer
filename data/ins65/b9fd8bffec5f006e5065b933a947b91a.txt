Rockford, Ill. may have become a household name in Hollywood thanks to the beloved 1992 film "A League of Their Own," starring Geena Davis and Tom Hanks, but fast-forward to today, the charming town is filled with just as much female-led spirit and grit off-screen as its iconic baseball team was portrayed.

The Rockford Peaches women's baseball team captured the most championship titles in the league from 1943 to 1954, and the city of Rockford itself has long been preserving their history with pride as the group became 'very successful' despite being 'mocked and doubted,' John Groh, president and CEO of the the city's tourism company GoRockford, told Travel + Leisure.
