Singapore's deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat has told retail investors not to buy cryptocurrency.
'Retail investors, especially, should steer clear of cryptocurrencies, we can not express this enough,' said Keat, speaking on Tuesday at the Asia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG).
To enforce his point that non-professional investors should steer clear of crypto, Keat cited individuals who had lost large sums of money - sometimes their life savings - as a result of the meltdown of Luna and Terra. The latter is a so-called stablecoin whose worth plummeted to less than 10 percent of its previous value earlier this month.
