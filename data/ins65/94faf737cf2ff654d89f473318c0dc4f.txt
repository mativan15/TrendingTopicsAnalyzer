Windsor police are launching a security camera registry, a move a local business owner is commending after his bakery was robbed earlier this year. Police are asking residents and businesses in Windsor and Amherstburg to register their cameras to help police with investigations. The program is voluntary, so signing up doesn't give police the rights or privilege to your security camera. There is a protocol in place to gain access to the footage. 'We still need to make contact with that person and get their permission for any video surveillance that they may have captured,' said Constable Talya Natyshak Police can't watch your cameras live feed, but will build a list of camera locations as a starting point to investigate.
