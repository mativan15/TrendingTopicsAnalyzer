Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to cut Twitter's staff by a draconian 75% once he buys the company, The Washington Post reported Thursday, citing documents and interviews.

The cuts would almost certainly boost controversial content including porn, lies and hate-filled attacks, as vast numbers of posts would slip by largely unsupervised, the newspaper said. Far fewer staffers would also likely increase the number of security breaches.

Musk already told prospective investors in his deal to buy the company that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of Twitter's 7,500 workers, 'whittling the company down to a skeleton staff' of just over 2,000, the newspaper reported.
