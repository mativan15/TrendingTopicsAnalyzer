 Load Error That's the chief executive of Walmart Inc.'s U.S. business, saying that despite the various financial pressures on consumers, the retail giant continues to see positive spending trends. Speaking on NBC's 'Today' show earlier Wednesday, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner declined to predict whether we'd see a recession, but he offered that consumers seem increasingly to be searching for 'value' in the current economy. In the last quarter, Walmart 'saw a significant amount' of new customers who were 'at higher incomes than what we have seen previously,' he said.
