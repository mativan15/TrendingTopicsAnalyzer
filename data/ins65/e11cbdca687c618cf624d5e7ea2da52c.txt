Swapna Suresh, the prime accused in the UAE diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, has accused three top Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leaders of sexual misconduct. Swapna, who had declared an open season on the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government, levelled the politically stormy accusations in an exclusive television interview on Friday. She had singled out three top political executives in the previous Pinarayi Vijayan government, including two Ministers, for censure. At the time of the alleged incidents, Swapna was the executive secretary to the UAE Consul General with considerable influence in the corridors of power.
