The local office market continues to evolve in interesting ways.

Austin Business Journal's annual lists of the area's largest office buildings and office parks added three new properties in 2022, and they are not all in the usual places.

RiverSouth, developed by Stream Realty Partners LP, landed on the multi-tenant building list at No. 14. As the name signifies, the 15-story, roughly 350,000-square-foot building is south of Lady Bird Lake, seeding a new part of the skyline, as more dense development is expected to follow.
