Bernard Tomic wants to settle his dispute with Nick Kyrgios for once and for all by challenging the loud mouth Aussie bad boy to a $2 million boxing match.Tennis ace Kyrgios turned down the chance to play a tennis match for the same amount against his fellow compatriot pro, which has pushed Tomic to suggest a meeting in the squared circle following a bitter back and forth on social media. "I am so sick of all this trash talk," Tomic said to the Saturday Confidential when discussing a rivalry that has gone on for years.
