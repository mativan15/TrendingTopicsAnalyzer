The O.G. Obi-Wan, already an accomplished actor, soared to a new stratosphere — and made bank — when the George Lucas film became a global sensation.
 By the time Alec Guinness was offered $150,000 in January 1976 ($762,000 today) to play Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars — a character revived by Ewan McGregor in subsequent films and now in the miniseries Obi-Wan Kenobi, debuting May 27 on Disney+ — the 61-year-old actor already was a screen legend, having appeared in more than 50 films, including his Oscar-winning role as Colonel Nicholson in David Lean's 1957 masterpiece The Bridge on the River Kwai.
