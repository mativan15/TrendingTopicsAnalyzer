CPI-M, Congress and BJP workers took to the streets in Salt Lake and other parts of Kolkata on Friday in solidarity with job seekers who were removed from their protest site by the police following a court order. Government teacher aspirants were on the fourth day of hunger strike to protest delay in appointments when police removed them around Thursday midnight. The CPI-M's students wing and the ABVP, the students' arm of the RSS, scuffled with the police as they protested in favour of job seekers, and alleged forceful removal by the administration.
