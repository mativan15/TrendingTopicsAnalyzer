A New York City publicist felt like a 'trapped animal' when Oscar-winning filmmaker Paul Haggis allegedly raped her at his Manhattan apartment in 2013, she testified Thursday at a civil trial.

Haleigh Breest claims Haggis invited her up to his SoHo residence after offering her a ride home from a film premiere, then made repeated unwanted advances before sexually assaulting her.

'I couldn't understand how somebody who seemed like a nice guy would do that,' Breest said in Manhattan Supreme Court.
