A Bellingham man reportedly admitted to drinking an excessive amount of tequila and looking for a bathroom when he attempted to break into two downtown businesses.

The Bellingham Police Department booked Garrett James Hedin, 28, into Whatcom County Jail, Saturday, Oct. 8, on suspicion of second- and third-degree malicious mischief and two counts of second-degree burglary. Jail records show Hedin is being held in lieu of $2,500 bail.

Officers were called at 7:04 a.m. Saturday to the 1200 block of Cornwall Avenue after a passerby reported seeing a man, later identified as Hedin, climb over a security fence outside one of the victimized businesses, according to Whatcom County Superior Court documents.
