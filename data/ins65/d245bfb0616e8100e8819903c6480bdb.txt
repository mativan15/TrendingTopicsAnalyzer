Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on the stock market this year. The growth-focused Nasdaq Composite is down 32% from its high, and many individual growth stocks got hit even harder. For instance, Datadog (DDOG 4.23%) and Fiverr International (FVRR 2.07%) saw share prices plunge roughly 54% and 75%, respectively, this year and both stocks currently sit near 52-week lows.
Nothing material has changed about the business operations of Datadog or Fiverr, and the future still looks bright for both businesses.
