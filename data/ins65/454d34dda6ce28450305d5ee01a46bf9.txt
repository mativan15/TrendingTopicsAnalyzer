Ellen DeGeneres is learning how to use her time off wisely.
 
The retired talk-show host, 64, is back with a new short docu-style series, following her through unemployment as she attempts to learn new hobbies and keep herself preoccupied.
 
Dubbed About Time For Yourself… with Ellen, the series will be shared weekly on Ellen's YouTube channel, starting Saturday.
 
"You know, lately I've been taking some time just for myself, away from the cameras," DeGeneres said in a clip where she's wearing a multi-color striped sweater.
