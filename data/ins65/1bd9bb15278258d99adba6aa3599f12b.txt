The success of Top Gun: Maverick at theaters this weekend didn't just benefit media giant Paramount Global. The release  marked a turning point for struggling movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (AMC 2.74%). That brought investors piling into AMC this morning, with the stock jumping as much 12% in early trading. That jump didn't hold, but AMC shares were still up 3.7% as of 1:07 p.m. ET. 
So what
The Top Gun sequel came 36 years after the original, and that helped AMC bring an important audience back into theaters.
