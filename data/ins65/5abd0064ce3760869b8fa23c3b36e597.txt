About 55,000 education workers in Ontario, such as custodians, early childhood educators and administration staff, will be in a legal strike position as of Nov. 3, the Canadian Union of Public Employees said Monday. CUPE has not indicated if education workers would engage in a full strike - which could potentially close schools - or start with a work-to-rule campaign, or take some other course of action at that point. There are still talks in progress with the assistance of a mediator, with three days of bargaining scheduled between Monday and Wednesday.
