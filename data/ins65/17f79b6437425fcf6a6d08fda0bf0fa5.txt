In a 52-page slide presentation, Sequoia has laid out big picture risks for start-up founders while urging them to preserve cash for survival. The Silicon Valley firm says sustained inflation and geopolitical conflicts will limit the ability for a "quick-fix" solution by policymakers. "We do not believe that this is going to be another steep correction followed by an equally swift V-shaped recovery like we saw at the outset of the pandemic," Sequoia's partners say. One of Silicon Valley's most successful venture capital firms doesn't see the economy bouncing back anytime soon and is warning portfolio companies to tighten their belts in the meantime.
