Either a green light to Flair Airlines to keep flying or an order to ground all aircraft is expected from the Canadian Transportation Agency on Wednesday. The Edmonton-based discount carrier has been under review by the transportation regulator over concern an American shareholder exerts too much power. In order to be a licensed domestic airline, Flair Airlines must be incorporated in Canada and at least 51 per cent of voting shares must be owned and controlled by Canadians, according to the CTA.
