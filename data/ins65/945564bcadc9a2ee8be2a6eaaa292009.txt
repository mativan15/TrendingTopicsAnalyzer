Rooster Teeth, a gaming-oriented digital content creator and fan community owned by Warner Bros Discovery, has apologized for 'hate and mistreatment' after complaints were lodged by a former staffer.

	Kdin Jenzen, who worked for the Austin-based company as a content creator and editor from 2013 to July 2022, went public with her experiences in a post shared on social media last weekend. She alleged the company, which was founded in 2003, fostered a culture in which she was overworked, underpaid and repeatedly called a homophobic slur in the workplace.
