The recent 5.5% drop in Guardant Health, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GH) stock could come as a blow to insiders who purchased US$20m worth of stock at an average buy price of US$96.14 over the past 12 months. Insiders buy with the expectation to see their investments rise in value over a period of time. However, recent losses have rendered their above investment worth US$9.9m which is not ideal.

While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.
