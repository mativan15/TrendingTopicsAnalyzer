Scottish Rugby Union player Ben Cairns will be joining the Heriot's in November after leaving Stirling. New Heriots are a Super 6 club, and Ben, as head coach, could usher in many changes to the club's role. The offer of working close to home was too good to pass up, and Ben decided to take it head-on. Ben was with Stirling, who, under him, went as far as the finals of the FOSROC Super 6 Sprint Series at the beginning of this year. Heriot's current coaching team, with Fin Gillies and Stuart Edwards, will work with Ben, and hopefully, the club will see significant success.
