Michael Chaney just couldn't pass algebra. He took the class at least four times from two different institutions before he gave up on a plan to pursue architecture, a career path suggested by a vocational program after he injured his back on the job in a steel mill in 1996. Still unable to pay off what he borrowed more than a quarter-century later, he said, he owes the federal government more than $63,000 for a degree he never received. "For me to be retrained, I had to take out student loans," Chaney, 56, said.
