(Bloomberg) -- Investment firm North Wall Capital LLP is aiming to raise €500 million ($491 million) for its second European opportunities fund, as it looks to exploit ongoing credit market turmoil to generate outsized returns.The London-based fund manager has garnered €250 million in commitments so far, including a cornerstone investment from Australian superannuation firm MLC, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. The firm seeks to attract double that amount from investors by the end of September 2023, the letter said.
