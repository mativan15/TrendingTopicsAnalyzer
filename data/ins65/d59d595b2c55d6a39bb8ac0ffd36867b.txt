'Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope' is the second mash-up of the Mario and Rabbids video game characters
It took 300 staff working in five cities about five years, but the second edition of one of the most ambitious mash-ups in video games is set to arrive on Thursday -- "Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope".The game merges Nintendo's Mario, the Italian plumber who has given his name to an entire universe of games, with Ubisoft's Rabbids, a series focused on the adventures of a species of screeching, hyperactive rabbit-like animals.
