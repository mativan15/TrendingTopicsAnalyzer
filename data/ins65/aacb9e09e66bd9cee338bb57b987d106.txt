LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Councilman Curren Price was nominated Friday to serve as the president pro tempore of the Los Angeles City Council by Council President Paul Krekorian and Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, who is currently the president pro tempore. The president pro tempore is second in command of the City Council. Price was interested in seeking the council presidency after Nury Martinez resigned last week for her involvement in the City Hall racism scandal, but the council voted 10-0 for Krekorian earlier this week.
