The official opposition critic for First Nations and Métis Relations Betty Nippi-Albright, joined by Indigenous leaders from Onion Lake Cree Nation and Fishing Lake First Nation, pointed out the Saskatchewan government's announcement last month of Duty to Consult consultations.
Tuesday, Nippi-Albright targeted the Saskatchewan government and asked that they make meaningful changes to enshrine consultation into law and to implement legislation instead of policy when it comes to consulting policy framework, which she said results in no action on meaningful Duty to Consult in Saskatchewan.
