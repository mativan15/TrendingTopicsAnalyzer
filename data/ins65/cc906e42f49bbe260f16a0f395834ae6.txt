(Bloomberg) -- South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered the government to support the recovery of full operations at the nation's biggest mobile messenger and the top portal website after a power outage disrupted some services for hours.

'I feel a very heavy heart for the inconvenience and damage experienced by people,' he said, according to a statement from his office. Yoon asked the science minister to personally oversee the recovery after an SK C&C data center housing Kakao Corp. and Naver Corp.
