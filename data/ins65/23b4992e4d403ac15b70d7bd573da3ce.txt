British-American TV personality Sharon Osbourne has revealed that a hat was one of her husband Ozzy Osbourne's 'silliest' gifts she ever received. The straw hat did not fit and had a flower on it. It seems like it was meant for a baby, joked the talk show host. In 1982, they were married and had three children, Aimée, Kelly, and Jack. July marked the couple's 40th wedding anniversary, and they celebrated on social media. Moreover, the Lucifer alum sent a sweet note to her husband in honour of the milestone.
