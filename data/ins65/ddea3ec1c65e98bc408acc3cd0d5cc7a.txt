Eric Dier has revealed afternoon naps are the secret behind Tottenham's fine start to the season.A 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday helped Spurs move on to 23 points from a possible 30 in the Premier League this term, which is their best tally after 10 top-flight matches since the 1963-64 campaign.Harry Kane and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg struck after the break to down the Toffees as Spurs continue to end fixtures strongly, with 15 of their 27 goals occurring in the second half.Centre-back Dier has started every game and explained how Antonio Conte's men have come through a demanding schedule to sit third in the Premier League and one win away from making the last-16 of the Champions League.
