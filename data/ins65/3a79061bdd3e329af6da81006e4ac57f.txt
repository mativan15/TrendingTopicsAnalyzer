NBCUniversal Formats' hit entertainment show That's My Jam is learning to speak Italian — and Spanish, and Portuguese.

The format, inspired by musical segments on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, sees celebrity guests compete in dance and trivia-based games based on popular songs. The U.S. original version is produced by Universal Television Alternative Studio (UTAS), in association with Jimmy Fallon's Electric Hot Dog for NBC.

NBCUniversal Formats on Tuesday announced it has signed deals to do local versions of the show in multiple European territories, including with Endemol Shine Italy for free-to-air network RAI 2, with Polvora, the production company of Spanish actor and comedian Arturo Valls, host of the local version of The Masked Singer for Spain, and with Shine Iberia for Portugal.
