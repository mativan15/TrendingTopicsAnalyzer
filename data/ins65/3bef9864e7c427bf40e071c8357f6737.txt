A multibillion-dollar bike 'superhighway' is the Greens' latest pitch to Victorian voters before November's federal election.Announcing the policy on Wednesday morning, Sam Hibbins, who holds the inner-city seat of Prahan, said emissions from transport were the fastest growing in the state and criticised the Andrews Labor government for spending 1 per cent on 'active transport'.The cornerstone of the plan is a bike 'superhighway' connecting Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south, to Coburg in the north, which Mr Hibbins said would require substantial upgrades to Royal Parade, Flemington Rd and Sydney Rd.
