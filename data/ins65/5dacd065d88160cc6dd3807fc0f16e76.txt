Panaji: The state government has withdrawn its tender inviting bids to set up 600kW solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) power plants each at the North and South Goa district hospitals at a cost of over Rs 7 crore after companies expressed inability to participate in the tender process due to its conditions. A senior government officer said that a fresh tender will be issued with the changes suggested by the companies.During the pre-bid meeting, the companies wanted payment terms to be changed. They proposed a change in submitting a single performance bank guarantee of 10 per cent of the project cost for a five-year period and some relaxations in other clauses.
