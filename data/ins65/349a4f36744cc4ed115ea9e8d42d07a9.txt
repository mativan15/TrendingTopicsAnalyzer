Before MLB's 16-game schedule gets underway, Sean Zerillo and Collin Whitchurch of The Action Network are here to give their best bets (video above). 
We'll begin with Whitchurch, who sees value in a matchup between the San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies. In that game, he's backing the Giants moneyline (+110) on BetMGM Sportsbook. 
For Whitchurch, this is mostly a bet against Phillies starting pitcher Ranger Suarez.
