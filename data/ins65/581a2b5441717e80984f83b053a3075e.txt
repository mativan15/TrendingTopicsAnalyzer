Tottenham have been mocked by former Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor as flat-track bullies in the wake of their Premier League defeat to Manchester United. The Lilywhites were second best throughout the contest at Old Trafford on Wednesday night as the Red Devils ran out 2-0 winners.Spurs enjoyed their best ever start to a Premier League campaign after bagging 23 points from their opening 10 matches. But they came unstuck against United after already losing to Arsenal earlier this month and drawing with Chelsea in August.
