WILLISTON, N.D. (AP) — Trial has been scheduled for a northwestern North Dakota man accused of setting up an explosives manufacturing operation in his townhouse garage, where police discovered nearly 1,500 pounds of bomb-making materials.

Williston police updated the original estimate of 1,000 pounds after completing the removal and disposal of the materials Friday evening. Ross Petrie, 28, of Williston, is charged with a felony called ‘release of destructive forces.'
