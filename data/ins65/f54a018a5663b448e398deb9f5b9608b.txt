Devolved government in the region has been in flux across the year, and current legislation requires Mr Heaton-Harris to call a fresh election if an executive is not formed by October 28.Mr Heaton-Harris said he 'can't see the space' for any emergency legislation to potentially avert the move.Appearing at the Northern Ireland Affairs committee on Tuesday, Mr Heaton-Harris said he had discussed the ongoing paralysis at Stormont with his Cabinet colleagues earlier that day.'If we do not get a reformed executive by one minute past midnight on the 28th of October, I will be calling an election, that's what the law requires me to do, and that is what I will be doing,' he told MPs.
