A number of infrastructure and housing projects in Nunavut have been cancelled or put on hold, and government ministers say rising construction costs are to blame. The Legislative Assembly heard Wednesday the territory had not awarded contracts for the construction of public housing in Taloyoak, staff housing in Gjoa Haven and Kugluktuk, a new hamlet office in Sanikiluaq, a park office and visitors centre near Clyde River and diesel-solar power plant in Kugluktuk. The reason why, in each case, was that contractors had asked for more money than the territory had planned.
