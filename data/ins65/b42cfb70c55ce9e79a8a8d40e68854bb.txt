Emergency departments across Ontario are struggling to keep up with the high volume of patients and staffing shortages. This week, the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) reached an all-time high of 20 hours for patients waiting in the emergency department. 'As cold and flu season approaches, our team is doing everything they can to provide the best care possible to all our patients,' a spokesperson for the LHSC says. As of Wednesday, the hospital's wait times are down to 15 hours. 'We encourage our community to first consider alternative care options when seeking non-emergency medical care, including visiting a family doctor,' they advise.
