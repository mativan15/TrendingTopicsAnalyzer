Welcome to Wednesday, loyal readers. Here's what you need to know today.

Attention, Folsom foodies

It's been a year since I told you that Los Angeles-based Dave's Hot Chicken would open a location in a former bank space in the Folsom Gateway II retail center. The location is near Chipotle Mexican Grill and Lazi Cow, at East Bidwell Street and Iron Point Road in Folsom.

Update: Dave's Hot Chicken will open its Folsom restaurant on Oct. 27, according to a sign posted at the business.

The franchise chain has a menu that includes chicken tenders and chicken sliders.
