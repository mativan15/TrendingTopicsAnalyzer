Recent graduates from 20 US universities will now be able to apply for a visa to live and work in the UK for up to three years without having a job offer on the table. The visa is part of updates to the UK immigration system aimed at attracting highly skilled workers to the country. Before moving to the UK, US citizens typically need a UK-based firm to provide a concrete job offer and agree to sponsor their work visa paperwork. Now, under the new High Potential Individual (HPI) visa scheme, they'll be able to apply to move to the country without an offer, and bring their family along — as long as they obtained a degree from a "top" university within the last five years.
