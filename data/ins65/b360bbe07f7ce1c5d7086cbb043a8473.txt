Warren Buffett and his company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.89%)(BRK.B -0.72%) have a long track record of beating the broader market indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Between 1965 and 2020, Berkshire's stock has posted an annual average return of about 20%, while the Dow has an average annual return of roughly 7.75% between 1921 and 2019. 
A big part of this is due to Buffett and Berkshire's more than $350 billion stock portfolio. While some stocks like Apple and Bank of America make up a huge percentage of the portfolio and are likely ones that Buffett and Berkshire consider to be safer, there are other smaller picks in the portfolio that Buffett and Berkshire may deem to be riskier but that also have much more potential upside.
