New Delhi: Leading crypto exchange Coinbase, which
 halted payments via unified payments interface (UPI) mode on its app in India in April, on Friday announced to pause hiring for as long as the global macro-economic factors remain in place. The company also revoked accepted offers from some candidates who haven't joined it yet. "After assessing our business priorities, current headcount, and open roles, we have decided to pause hiring for as long as this macro environment requires," LJ Brock, Chief People Officer at Coinbase, said in a statement.
