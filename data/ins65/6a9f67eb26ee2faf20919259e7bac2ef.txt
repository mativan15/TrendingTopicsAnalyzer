TOP GUN: MAVERICK (12A)

Opening with the familiar beats and chimes of Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score to Tony Scott's 1986 film and the tub-thumping battle cry of Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone as fighter jets take off from an aircraft carrier, Top Gun: Maverick blasts Tom Cruise back into the box office stratosphere.

Director Joseph Kosinski, who previously worked with Cruise on the 2013 sci-fi thriller Oblivion, shares his daredevil leading man's need for speed, orchestrating edge of seat thrills on land and in the air to disprove the theory that sequels linger in the slipstream of the original.
