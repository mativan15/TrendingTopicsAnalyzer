What does it mean for a device to be family-friendly? Depending on the product, that can mean parental controls, limited content, or even extra features so the same device can be used by family members across ages.The Babbit — a new wireless speaker now available in North America — falls into the final category. It has an extra control feature aimed at young kids, which lets them play music without interacting with a mobile device.
