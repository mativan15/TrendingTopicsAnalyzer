Published: 05:12 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 05:17 EDT, 30 May 2022 Apple's upcoming iPhone 14 Pro will feature an always-on display mode just like the Apple Watch, a new report claims. According to an Apple tipster, the new iPhone will be able to display a small amount of 'quickly glanceable' information before its screen has been unlocked.Such a feature would be similar to Android phones that always show basic information – like time and battery level – on a dark screen while conserving power.The feature is expected to be part of iOS 16, Apple's next major mobile operating system, which is expected to be announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference next week.
