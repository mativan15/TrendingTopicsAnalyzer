The first time Nikola Jokic bypassed an open 3-pointer Friday night, it was curious. A second time raised a few more eyebrows.
When presented with another open 3-pointer in the second quarter, Jokic finally launched, despite a taped wrist that's hindered his preseason. Jokic likely won't admit how much, if at all, that wrist has bothered him, but his play might be indicative. In fairness, he did bury one from outside in the third quarter.
Jokic wouldn't have played in Denver's final exhibition against the Warriors — a 119-112 win — if there was any long-term concern about exposing it to live contact.
