President Joe Biden is looking to stem a root cause of a recent uptick in illegal immigration, enacting a politically risky policy in order to blunt Republican attacks on the issue ahead of crucial midterm elections but drawing the ire of many inside his own party at the same time.

Biden recently pinpointed Venezuela as one of three countries that were contributing to the influx, as a growing number of immigrants look to escape political and economic turmoil in that country. The increase comes as GOP governors relocate migrants to sanctuary cities in much-publicized political stunts.
