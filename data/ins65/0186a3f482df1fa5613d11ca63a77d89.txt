Bills quarterback Josh Allen had another big game against the Chiefs in Buffalo's 24-20 win at Arrowhead Stadium, then he had a really cool postgame moment.

After meeting with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and others, Allen made a special visit to one young Bills fan in the stands at Arrowhead Stadium.

Allen gave the kid a football and had his picture taken with the family (despite a other people trying to join the moment).

The young fan was clearly blown away by Allen's gesture. Dan Fetes of WHAM-TV shared this video.
