Menlo Microsystems unveiled its Ideal Switch recently and it also raised $150 million to shake up the electronics industry. It calls this the biggest innovation since the transistor, as it can power its functions with less than a milliwatt and switch at speeds in the billions of operations a second. The Irvine, California-based company raised the money to start domestic manufacturing, and it hopes its tech will save over $7 trillion by 2050. The lead investors in the recent round included Vertical Venture Partners and Tony Fadell's Future Shape, with participation from new investors Fidelity Management & Research Company, DBL Partners and Adage Capital Management.
