Elon Musk said Tesla is "pedal to the metal" whether there's a recession or not on Wednesday.

The Tesla CEO said the carmaker has no plans to slow ambitious production targets.

Jeff Bezos warned on Tuesday companies should "batten down the hatches" amid an economic downturn.

The two richest men in the world appear to have differing opinions when it comes to weathering the next few months and a potential recession.
