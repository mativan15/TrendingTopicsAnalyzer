The French cement company Lafarge pleaded guilty Tuesday in a Brooklyn court to taking advantage of the Islamic State's iron grip on Syria between August 2013 and October 2014, working with the terrorist organization to thwart its competition and make $70.3 million in revenue. Lafarge and its Syrian subsidiary, driven by potential economic advantages, coordinated with the al-Nusrah Front and ISIS to remain open amid the civil war, paying dues to ISIS's armed forces and buying materials from terrorist-controlled suppliers while the violent militia hurt Lafarge's competition.
