Unlike with COVID-19 we already have approved vaccines that can work for monkeypox. Emergent has a smallpox vaccine branded ACAM2000, which is expected to be effective against monkeypox due to its close relation to the variola virus that causes smallpox. Furthermore, Emergent recently announced that they have made a $225M deal with Chimerix (CMRX) to acquire the exclusive global rights to their smallpox antiviral, Tembexa.
