Inflation will hit 15pc next year if the Government scraps its energy price cap and leaves millions of families exposed to a surge in bills, economists have warned.
Analysts at Abrdn said Jeremy Hunt's decision to withdraw the universal energy price guarantee next April would put inflation on course to rise at the fastest rate since 1980, unless another subsidy is introduced.
The Chancellor is to end a guarantee that caps average annual energy costs at £2,500 early, instead of continuing it for two years as initially planned.
