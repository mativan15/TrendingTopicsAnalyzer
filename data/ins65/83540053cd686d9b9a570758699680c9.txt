The Chase star Mark Labbett has claimed he's been turned down from I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! several times due to his weight.
Best known as The Beast on the ITV quiz show, Mark, 57, has been open about his weight loss journey after shedding 10 stone when he decided to prioritise his health after being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.
The quizmaster enlisted a personal trainer to aid with his transformation, resulting in him losing the 63kg over a year.
However, he admits his weight previously prevented him from taking on TV opportunities, such as the Ant and Dec reality show.
