The yen soared against the dollar as Japanese authorities are intervening again to prop up the currency. The dollar-yen pair fell as much as 2.6%, the biggest drop since March 2020, to 146.23. It had earlier fallen to a fresh 32-year low of 151.95 despite a barrage of official warnings against testing its intervention strategy. Nikkei reported Japan intervened in the currency market to support the yen.

Authorities have repeatedly said they will step in to counter one-sided moves, although some analysts warn that any intervention will have limited impact as long as the Bank of Japan maintains a policy of rock-bottom interest rates while peer central banks hike.
