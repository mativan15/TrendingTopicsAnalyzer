A dour trading update may have been the final blow which killed off a billion dollar takeover of former tech darling Appen just hours after takeover talks were confirmed by the AI services provider.

The Canadian tech giant which approached Appen with an indicative offer of $9.50 a share earlier this month, Telus International, told the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that it lost interest after having a closer look at the ASX-listed group.

Richard Freudenstein said Appen has yet to receive an explanation from Telus about the abrupt withdrawal of its offer.
