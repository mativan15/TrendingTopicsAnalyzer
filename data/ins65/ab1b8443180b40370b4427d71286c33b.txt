Mr Johnson's election as leader would provide the stability that stock markets crave because he could guarantee there would be no election before late 2024.
He said: "Interest rates in the US have risen further and faster than in the UK. The US is entering into recession.
"There are serious global headwinds economically and we need a period of stable government to face those headwinds."
In the historical context, Mr Rees-Mogg said the last British political leader who had been forced out, made a comeback and went on to be Prime Minister since William Gladstone in the 19th century.
