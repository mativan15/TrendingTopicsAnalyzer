Meta's top executive Amin Zoufonoun, who led Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, has confirmed that he is leaving the tech giant after 12 years. In a Facebook post, Zoufonoun, designated Vice President of Corporate Development at Facebook, wrote: "Leading the corporate development function here has been the opportunity of a lifetime". "After almost 12 incredibly fulfilling years at Meta/Facebook, I have decided to leave the company," according to Zoufonoun. "From leading acquisitions such as Instagram, Whatsapp and Oculus, to working on many other industry-defining strategic initiatives alongside world-class leadership, to building a stellar team who inspires me every day, I could not have asked for a better experience - which is why I have been at it for quite a while," he added.
