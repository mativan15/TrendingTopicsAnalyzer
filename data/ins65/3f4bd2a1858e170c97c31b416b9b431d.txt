Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos traded lower on Friday despite another move upward in stocks.

Crypto traders are still in risk-off mode after experiencing almost nine consecutive weeks of negative returns. BTC is on track for a 27% decline this month, although it is up 10% from its recent extreme low at $25,840 on May 12.

The cryptocurrency is still down by 40% so far this year, compared with a 13% drop in the S&P 500 and a 22% dip in the Nasdaq 100 over the same period.
