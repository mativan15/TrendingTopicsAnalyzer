India's story has been growing leaps and bounds for the past few years. And as a result of the pandemic, digital services, in particular, have received a massive fillip. In 2021, the e-commerce market in India was estimated to be $38 billion. That's as much as the GDP of some countries in Europe.
As B2C e-commerce companies flourish, there will need to be a supporting infrastructure for B2B companies to grow along with them. For the most part, these B2B companies and services are offline. Data show that about $1 trillion worth of merchandise in the B2B offline commerce sector flows through small, unorganised retailers, suppliers and wholesalers.
