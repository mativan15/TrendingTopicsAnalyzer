JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia, the world's biggest exporter of refined tin, is planning to ban exports of the metal to attract investment in processing it domestically, although the government said the timing had yet to be decided.

WHAT IS THE PLAN?

Indonesia plans to ban the export of tin ingots to encourage investors to set up productions facilities and develop its industries to process tin into other products at home, a government official said.
