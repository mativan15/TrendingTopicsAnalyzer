A reputed leader of a notoriously violent Mexican cartel has been extradited to Chicago and arraigned on charges that he trafficked heroin in the Chicago area and sent hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds to Mexico.

Adán Casarrubias Salgado —also known by nicknames including 'El Tomate' — was extradited to the U.S. on Thursday. He pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, money laundering and drug trafficking Friday and he remains in federal custody, authorities said.

If convicted, he faces a sentence of 10 years to life, according to a spokesman for the U.
