This year's series of Strictly Come Dancing has been spectacular to say the least, with last week's episode seeing the 2022 contestants performing routines inspired by beloved movies.
Tonight, couples including Ellie Simmonds and Nikita Kuzmin; Ellie Taylor and Johannes Radebe; Kym Marsh and Graziano Di Prima; and Tony Adams and Katya Jones will return to the dancefloor once more.
The Strictly dancefloor is an iconic sight on British TV, as is the Glitterball Trophy that the competitors are all hoping they'll win by the time the end of the competition comes around.
