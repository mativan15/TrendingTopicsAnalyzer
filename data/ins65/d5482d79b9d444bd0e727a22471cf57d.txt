CULPEPER, Va. (AP) — The Virginia General Assembly's recently approved budget appropriates money to create a new state park in Culpeper County that would include two Civil War battlefields.The spending plan sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin earlier this week would create a 1,700-acre park focused on Culpeper County's Brandy Station and Cedar Mountain battlefields, which have been preserved by the American Battlefield Trust, the Star-Exponent reported.Proponents say Culpeper's location between Manassas National Battlefield Park and the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park will boost visitation.
