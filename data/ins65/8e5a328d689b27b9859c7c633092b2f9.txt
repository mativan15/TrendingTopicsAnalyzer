A new challenger is vying to derail the Biden administration's student loan debt relief plan by asking the nation's highest court to stop the cancellation from taking effect.

On Wednesday, the Wisconsin-based tax policy advocacy group, Brown County Taxpayers Association, filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking the court to temporarily block the government from giving away what it says are assets belonging to U.S. taxpayers.

'If this program goes forward as planned on Sunday then the president will unilaterally spend roughly 4% of the nation's GDP,' the association wrote in its emergency application for the injunction.
