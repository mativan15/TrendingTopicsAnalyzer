The Cartoon Museum's new show of Boris Johnson cartoons, This Exhibition Is A Work Event, chronicles Johnson's time as prime minister through the work of 50 different cartoonists (including a lot of regular Guardian contributors). But there is a question that, even now – as Liz Truss self-detonates and Tory members talk about the possibility of bringing him back – we must ask: were any of us actually delivering the coup de grace to Britain's Worst Ever Prime Minister (Up Until Then) by caricaturing his defining ridiculousness? Or did we merely frantically scramble to keep pace with the madness his premiership added in spades to the preexisting madness of the past six – or arguably 14, or even 5,000 – years?Many US cartoonists faced the same dilemma with Donald Trump.
