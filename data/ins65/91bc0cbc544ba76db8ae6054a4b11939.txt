The U.S. Treasury Department renewed a license Friday for Chevron to operate its oil production in Venezuela, a country sanctioned by the U.S., potentially setting up a broader license agreement later in the year. The U.S. has previously served as Venezuela's largest oil market but oil activity between the countries has been limited amid ongoing political turmoil between Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his opposition, Juan Guaido, who the U.S. recognizes as Venezuela's rightful leader, Reuters reported.
