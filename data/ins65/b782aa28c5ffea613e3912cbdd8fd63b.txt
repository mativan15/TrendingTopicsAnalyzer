Mark Henneman, president of St. Paul investment firm Mairs & Power, calls Lee Mitau "the CEO whisperer."

Mitau, retired general counsel for U.S. Bank, is chairman of two Minnesota manufacturers: Minneapolis-based Graco Inc. and St. Paul-based H.B. Fuller Co.

In that role, he helped hire both the new chief executives at both companies — and their long-time, successful predecessors.

"It's probably more than a coincidence that two very fine performing companies with a couple of the greatest CEOs that that we've actually seen, [were] under his watch," said Henneman, whose firm holds a big stake in both companies.
