AgenciesFrance is the third favourite destination in Europe for Indian companies to invest in after the UK and Germany. France is inviting Indian companies for investments after it topped for the third year in a row an EY survey on most attractive investment destinations in Europe. French Envoy to India Emmanuel Lenain said President Emmanuel Macron leads the most pro-business regime in France which has brought labour reforms, reduced corporate tax and provided for a flat tax on capital gains to make it easier to do business in the country.
