A new arts therapy group aims to offer front-line healthcare workers in Cambridge a much needed space to disconnect and reflect. Sh*fting Perspective, from Button Factory Arts in Waterloo, started Tuesday and will run weekly on a drop-in basis until Dec. 20. The program, which is being offered remotely, builds off a similar art therapy group Button Arts Factory ran for Waterloo region nurses last fall. Janice Luczka, a cardiovascular ICU (CVICU) nurse at St. Mary's Hospital in Kitchener, was one of the participants in that initial group.
