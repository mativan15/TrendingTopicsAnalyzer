By Colin Kellaher Shares of Zosano Pharma Corp. lost nearly half of their value and hit a new all-time low on Thursday after the cash-strapped biopharmaceutical company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to close up shop. Zosano, which has been struggling since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected its M207 transdermal migraine patch in late 2020, had warned last month that it was running low on cash and needed to find substantial funding to continue. Zosano initially filed for FDA approval of M207 in late 2019, but the agency turned the application away in October 2020.
