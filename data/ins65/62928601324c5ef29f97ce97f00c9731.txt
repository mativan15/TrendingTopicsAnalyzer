The creation of a new public sector body to oversee Britain's railways has been delayed.Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan told MPs that the Government has axed its plan to introduce a Transport Bill during the current parliamentary session because legislation to deal with the energy crisis is being prioritised.The Bill included the establishment of Great British Railways (GBR), which will absorb the state-owned infrastructure management company Network Rail and issue contracts to private companies to run trains.
