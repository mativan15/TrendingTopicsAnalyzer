How do silent second mortgages work?

When it comes to buying a home, a down payment is a major obstacle for most buyers. A silent second mortgage provides an opportunity to obtain the funds you need for a down payment but there's a right way and an illegal way to handle this option. In general, you must notify the original lender about the second mortgage or you may be violating both your original loan documents and the law. As you navigate the home buying process, consider working with a financial advisor to help create the right homeownership plan for you.
