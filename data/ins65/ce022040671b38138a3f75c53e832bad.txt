This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets. LONDON — European markets open higher as the region feels the impact of the U.K.'s fiscal U-turns on Monday. Most sectors and major bourses have made gains at 8.00 a.m. London time, with construction leading increases up 1.3%. Health care leads losses, down 0.28%. The British pound rose and bond yields fell after new Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt scrapped most of Prime Minister Liz Truss' fiscal policies in an announcement Monday. Truss apologized for the "mistakes" she made in her first six weeks in the position.
