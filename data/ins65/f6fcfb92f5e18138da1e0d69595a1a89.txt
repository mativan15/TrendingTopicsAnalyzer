Scientists have discovered an unexplained structure made of hydrogen gas that stretches for nearly two million light years near a famous group of interacting galaxies, according to a new study.

The strange gas trail may have been formed by an 'intruder' galaxy that collided with this galactic group, known as Stephan's Quintet, about a billion years ago, but it will take more observations to understand the mystery of its formation.
