Just_Super The Global X Funds - Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:LIT) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive Global Lithium Index (full replication). ETFs are attractive if you do not want to focus on individual companies or invest the time to analyze and keep track of them long-term. ETFs are suitable for regular accumulations to achieve a cost-average effect. This one combines some of the world's largest mining companies and a few electric car manufacturers. Given the strong increase in demand and the likely lack of supply, I think this will be a very good investment for this decade.
