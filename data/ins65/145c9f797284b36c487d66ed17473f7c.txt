President Biden's administration has opened up the student loan relief application process with a beta period starting Friday evening.

The relief application website will formally launch later this month.

A Department of Education spokesperson told CNN that 'The Department of Education will begin beta testing the student debt relief website. During the beta testing period, borrowers will be able to submit applications.'

Those who apply for student debt relief during the beta trial will receive confirmation via email, but their applications will not be processed until the website formally launches.
