School and college alumni reunions are commonplace; neighbourhood families coming together after decades is not. In a first of its kind, nearly 200 residents of the Erramanzil Colony who lived in the government quarters between 1957 and 2020 attended a reunion at the colony's Community Hall on October 16, 2022. Good cheer, camaraderie and squeals of laughter reverberated at the venue as people, young and old exchanged pleasantries and recalled the time that they all spent together in the colony. It was literally a walk down memory lane as the erstwhile residents walked through the lanes and bylanes of the colony, checked out their houses, clicked photographs and excitedly showed their children the play areas, cycling paths and their hangout spots.
