The last three months have been tough on Kogan.com Ltd (ASX:KGN) shareholders, who have seen the share price decline a rather worrying 34%. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. Indeed, the share price is up an impressive 126% in that time. So while it's never fun to see a share price fall, it's important to look at a longer time horizon. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.
