Netflix has postponed its Prince Harry and Meghan Markle documentary until next year following backlash to The Crown season 5, reports claim. 
The series is said to have been unofficially slated for December 2022, however, the streaming giant has delayed the project after fierce criticism regarding its period drama based on the royal family. 
It comes after former Prime Minister Sir John Major blasted The Crown as a ‘damaging and malicious' work of fiction in a new statement. 
‘They're rattled at Netflix, and they blinked first and decided to postpone the documentary,' a source told Deadline.
