Sen. Kelly Townsend will hold a hearing on claims from the movie '2000 Mules.' Meanwhile, we are hurtling toward the end of the fiscal year without a budget to keep government running.

In just 30 days, the state of Arizona will run out of money.

Oh, it's not that we're broke. We've got buckets of the stuff. The problem is, the agencies that serve the state won't be able to spend it.

In just 30 days, the people who teach our kids and patrol our highways and run our prisons and inspect our nursing homes and investigate complaints of child abuse and on and on and on won't be able to do their jobs any longer.
