By PA Media Published: 07:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 07:19 EDT, 17 October 2022 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp must await referee Anthony Taylor's report to learn whether he faces additional punishment for his red card in Sunday's 1-0 Premier League victory over Manchester City. The Reds boss was dismissed from the technical area late in the game after exploding in anger at the official and his assistant referee after a foul was not given when Bernardo Silva hauled down match-winner Mohamed Salah.
