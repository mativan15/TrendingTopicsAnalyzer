A south-central Iowa man was sentenced Thursday to 24 months in prison for false statements to the Social Security Administration.

Troy John Pitzen, 58, of Peru, Iowa, pled guilty to submitting false paperwork to the SSA between 2006 and 2017 in order to receive survivor benefits worth $371,356 for taking care of his three minor children after their mother died.

Pitzen used the money intended for the children while claiming they were under his care, but they were actually in the care of other people.
