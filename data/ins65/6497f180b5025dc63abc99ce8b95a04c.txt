Variety - TV News Despite rumors to the contrary, Netflix says it has no plans to stop dropping all episodes of a TV show at once for binge-friendly viewing.'We think our bingeable release model helps drive substantial engagement, especially for newer titles,' Netflix said in its Q3 shareholder letter, as part of announcing quarterly results Tuesday. 'This enables viewers to lose themselves in stories they love.' The company's comments come after the Puck newsletter last month reported that Netflix execs were mulling a change to binge strategy and release major titles on a weekly schedule.
