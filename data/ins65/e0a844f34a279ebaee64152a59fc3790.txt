Netflix's latest smash hit show The Watcher has made the home it is based on become a ‘dark tourism' hot spot.
Created by Glee's Ryan Murphy, the drama drew inspiration from the chilling events surrounding a house in New Jersey, which saw its owners ousted after receiving a slew of terrifying letters from a stalker.
The identity of the stalker, known as The Watcher, has remained a mystery since the correspondence started several years ago.
The seven-parter stars Bobby Cannavale and Naomi Watts as a married couple who move into their dream home, while The White Lotus actor Jennifer Coolidge plays their realtor.
