Ukrainian evacuees in Japan are taking a Japanese- language course designed for foreign residents who are looking for work. The free three-month course, commissioned by the Japanese government, is being provided in 24 of the country's 47 prefectures. Foreign residents can enroll after registering with a job placement center in their area. Alona Kostiushko is one of seven Ukrainians who are taking the course. The 21-year-old attended a class in Tokyo on Thursday, along with 10 people from eight other countries.
