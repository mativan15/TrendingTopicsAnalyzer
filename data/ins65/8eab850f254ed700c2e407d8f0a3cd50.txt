The National Stock Exchange may exclude heavyweight HDFC from 50-stock index Nifty closer to ex-date of its merger with HDFC Bank, which is likely to be concluded a few months ahead of the scheduled time.
The merger of the parent firm with its subsidiary HDFC Bank– the country's biggest merger deal so far — is scheduled to be concluded by mid-2023.
The merger proposal of the two entities has already got all the approvals, barring shareholders' nod (scheduled on November 25) along with the final clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.
