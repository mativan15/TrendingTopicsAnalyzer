Coleen Rooney has taken part in a sweet photoshoot with her son Kai.
The star, who is married to footballer Wayne Rooney, has in recent years earned the nickname Wagatha Christie for her investigation into who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account, revealing in 2019 that it was…. Rebekah Vardy's account.
Following on from an explosive libel trial this summer which saw Rebekah lose her case and be ordered to pay 90% of the Rooney's legal costs, the Wags have been keeping a relatively low profile.
