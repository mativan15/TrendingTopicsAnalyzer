Anyone got tickets? Diego Schwartzman hopes to watch the Champions League final Thomas SAMSON AFP Paris (AFP) – Who said what on the sixth day of the 2022 French Open at Roland Garros on Friday: "I'd like to apologise to my family for giving them a heart attack."-- Leylah Fernandez after her topsy-turvy win over Belinda Bencic."So Roland Garros, please ask for tickets for tomorrow. I know you can do it. President of Roland Garros, president of the Federation. I can go alone, eh? It's okay."-- Diego Schwartzman makes a cheeky late plea for a place to Saturday's Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool in Paris.
