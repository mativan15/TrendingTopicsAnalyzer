The Delhi High Court on Thursday refused to entertain a plea challenging a direction of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) imposing a complete ban on the manufacturing, storage, sale and bursting of all kinds of firecrackers until January 1, 2023, in the national capital.
A single judge bench of Justice Yashwant Varma said that 'it would not be appropriate for the court to entertain an independent challenge' as the issue is already pending adjudication before the Supreme Court.
The court noted that as per the material on record, the issue of pollution as a result of the use of firecrackers during Diwali was first considered by the Supreme Court in Arjun Gopal v Union of India and Others, a case which is still pending before the apex court.
