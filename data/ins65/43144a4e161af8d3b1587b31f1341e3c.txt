A slowdown in home improvement demand could spell trouble for Lowe's future growth outlook, Evercore ISI says. "Lowe's is above average in pricing power and is clearly benefiting from the housing shortage/home price improvements," analyst Greg Melich wrote in a note to clients Wednesday as he downgraded the stock to an in line recommendation from its prior outperform rating. "Our downgrade is based on the view that slower [home improvement] demand and disinflation could push comps lower in 2023, making margin gains muted," Melich said.
