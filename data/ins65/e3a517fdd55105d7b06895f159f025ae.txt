Scammers were able to deceive 76-year-old Christopher Short into parting with his personal details by telling him he had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus. He received a text message purporting to be from NHS Track and Trace and did not doubt the authority.Having recently attended a packed meeting and with an immunocompromised wife, Mr Short, clicked on a link in the message to order a testing kit.However the website it took him to was fake.The criminals had made a convincing but fake NHS site and instructed Mr Short to fill in his personal details and pay for delivery of the non-existent kit with his credit card.
