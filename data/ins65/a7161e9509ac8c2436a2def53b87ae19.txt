NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate has made deep inroads into Delhi's underworld , something that investigators believe will change the course of crime in the coming years. Till now, gangs were largely localised with turf wars being restricted to supremacy in areas within the capital.Till now, the fight was over land, property and extortion from bookies and cable operators, but Bishnoi's entry has not only changed the rules but also upped the game, say investigators. From targeted killings ordered from abroad, to controlling kabaddi tournaments and being the first to release songs by Punjabi singers on YouTube channels, the challenges for the underworld seem to be changing.
