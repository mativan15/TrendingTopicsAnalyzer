TL;DR: As of Oct. 15, you can get a One-Month Subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate(opens in a new tab) for just $9.99 instead of $14.99 — that's a 33% discount.A lot of highly anticipated titles are coming to the Xbox soon. It's an exciting time for gamers, but it's also an expensive one. Games aren't cheap, and the prices may not be much better if you're looking for slightly older games to play. However, you may be able to save on an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to set aside a little more money for the new games(opens in a new tab) and get unlimited access to some already-popular titles.
