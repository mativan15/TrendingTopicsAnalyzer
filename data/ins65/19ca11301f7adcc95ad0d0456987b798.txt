Britney Spears has driven fans wild with a full-frontal nude photo on social media.
The Toxic singer, 40, is no stranger to showing off her body online, having posted dozens of snaps over the past year with strategically-placed emojis allowing the photos to get past rules banning nudity.
Britney was released from a 13-year conservatorship last year, and has made the most of her newfound freedom with her own form of self-expression, which sometimes manifests in nude snaps.
Now the mum-of-two, who recently made a return to music via a duet with Elton John, has uploaded her most risqué photo yet – with an explicit caption to match.
