OTTAWA - Canada is announcing new funding to help launch a series of satellites that will help monitor and respond to climate change. Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, says Canada will contribute $200 million to the NASA-led Atmosphere Observing System. The satellites are to examine how clouds, air movements, precipitation and atmospheric particles affect climate change -- a major source of uncertainty in climate models. Champagne says the multi-satellite mission will improve extreme weather prediction, climate modelling, and monitoring of disasters.
