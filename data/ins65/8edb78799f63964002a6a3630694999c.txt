MUSK BRAND

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk needs to cut one in ten jobs at Tesla . Some may already have their eye on the exit.The Tesla chief executive's intentions, conveyed in an internal email seen by Reuters, are rooted in what he described as his 'super bad feeling' about the U.S. economy.Some of the nearly 100,000 people employed at the electric carmaker may already be considering their options after Musk issued them with a return-to-office ultimatum this week.In an email sent to staff Tuesday night, Musk threatened to fire anyone who did not work in the office 40 hours a week, a sharp contrast to flexibility offered by Big Tech companies that compete for the same talent pool.
