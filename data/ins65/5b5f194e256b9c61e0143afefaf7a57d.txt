The revolving door of national politics once again transfixed Britain when Prime Minister Liz Truss's announced her resignation on Thursday, making her the second leader to depart in just a few weeks. The announcement came just over a month after the country gained a new monarch, King Charles III, underscoring the instability at the heart of the government and a sense of flux for Britons.

When the king's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died in September, there was an outpouring of grief nationwide, as well as international sympathy, in part because after 70 years on the throne, she had represented, for many people, stability in a changing world.
