The Wrap Judi Dench is joining the chorus of critics of 'The Crown' to speak out against what she called a 'cruelly unjust' and 'inaccurate and hurtful' fictionalized depiction of the British monarchy going into Season 5's Nov. 9 premiere.While maintaining in an open letter to Netflix (via The Times) on Thursdsay that it's a 'brilliant but fictionalised account of events,' the U.K. acting royalty and Oscar winner has gotten wind of 'wounding suggestions apparently contained in the new series' that she believes requires an explicit message to viewers that what they're watching is more fiction than fact.
