The local operators of a restaurant specializing in French Creole cuisine are retiring and have closed their East Sacramento location.

Celestin's Restaurant, owned by Phoebe and Patrick Celestin, closed its doors on Oct. 14. The restaurant — which offered a menu with small plates, gumbo, sandwiches, desserts and main courses such as jambalaya and Brazilian-style Pacific snapper — had operated out of its 1,457-square-foot space at 3610 McKinley Blvd. since 2018.

The Celestins have operated restaurants in the Sacramento area for more than 30 years.
