The animated TV sitcom gets a movie spin-off, in which Bob and his family struggle to save their burger restaurant from the twin threats of a recalled bank loan and a giant sinkhole that opens directly in front of the door to the premises. The business suffers a further blow when it's revealed that the hole contains the remains of a murdered fairground employee.But this brief plot synopsis can barely scratch the surface of the elliptical weirdness and bone-dry humour of this immensely enjoyable film.
