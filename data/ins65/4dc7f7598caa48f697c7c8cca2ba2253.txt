Because astrology can tell you so much about who you are, it comes as no surprise that it can also tell you who you've been. Your natal chart not only acts as a map of the sky at the moment of your birth, but it also holds the key to understanding your karmic path. And because the meaning of the South Node can tell you who you were in a past life, it's the best way of understanding not only where you're going, but who you've been. After all, your past always contains clues about your future.

Everyone's birth chart contains something called the Lunar Nodes, which represent the highest and lowest points of the moon's orbit (where the moon's orbital path crosses the sun's orbital path, otherwise known as the 'ecliptic').
