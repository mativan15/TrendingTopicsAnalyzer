Meghan Markle has appeared to make a fresh dig at the Royal Family with a remark about "expectations" for the future of her children Archie and Lilibet. In a wide-ranging new interview, Meghan opens up about several topics including her podcast Archetypes, the death of the Queen and if she would ever return to acting. She also talks about her new Netflix docuseries with Prince Harry that she says will tell their story and gives advice to other actresses who may play her on screen in the future. But when she's asked about if she would encourage Archie and Lilibet if they wanted a career in the entertainment industry, she gives a cryptic comment about tradition and family expectations.
