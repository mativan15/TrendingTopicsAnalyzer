Meet Bobbi Ann Brady, the first independent in decades to win a seat in the legislature.'I'm already formulating my goals and ambitions for our riding and the things that I want to set up, the roundtables and the issues that I first want to bring forward,' said the newest member of provincial parliament for Haldimand-Norfolk.
