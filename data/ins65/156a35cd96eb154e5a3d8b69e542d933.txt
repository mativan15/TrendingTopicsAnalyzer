Aaron and Austin Nola not taking this rare opportunity for granted originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

When the Nola brothers caught up early this week prior to the start of the NLCS in San Diego, they avoided talking baseball other than to acknowledge the rarity of the opportunity ahead of them.

"Pretty much the only thing we talked about that involved the series was this might be one of the last times, because you never know," said Aaron Nola, who hasn't allowed an earned run in 12⅔ innings in his first two postseason starts.
