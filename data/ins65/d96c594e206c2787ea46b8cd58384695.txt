Investors are eager for Five Below's (FIVE -0.42%) earnings update, set for release this week. The youth-focused retailer's stock has been swinging wildly in recent weeks as rivals reported a mix of good and bad news around consumer spending patterns. Some companies are seeing declining demand for many niches that had been booming. Others are reducing their earnings outlook as costs soar.
Five Below has a good shot at navigating through those challenges thanks to its focus on value and its flexible merchandising strategy.
