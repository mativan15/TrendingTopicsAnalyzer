A strain of Windows uses PowerShell to add a malicious extension to a victim's Chrome browser for nefarious purposes. A macOS variant exists that uses Bash to achieve the same and also targets Safari.
The makers of the ChromeLoader software nasty ensure their malware is persistent once on a system and is difficult to find and remove, according to threat hunters at cybersecurity shop Red Canary, who have been tracking the strain since early February and have seen a flurry of recent activity.
"We first encountered this threat after detecting encoded PowerShell commands referencing a scheduled task called 'ChromeLoader' – and only later learned that we were catching ChromeLoader in the middle stage of its deployment," Aedan Russell, detection engineer at Red Canary, wrote in a blog post this week.
