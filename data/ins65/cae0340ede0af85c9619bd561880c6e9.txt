Simon Cowell has admitted how bad he feels after upsetting a performer during tonight's Britain's Got Talent semi-final, saying: ‘I now hate myself,' as he made his apology.
The latest live show will see two more acts make it through to Sunday's final, where they'll join acts including The Greatest Showman singer Loren Allred and dance group Five Star Boys.
The first act who took to the stage was Matricks Illusion, a magic and illusion speciality act who wowed in their first audition with their illusions and quick costume changes.
