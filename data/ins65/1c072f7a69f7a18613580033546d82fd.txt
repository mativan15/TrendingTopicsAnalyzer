An op-ed attributed to President Biden has promised the US won't try to remove Russian President Vladimir Putin from power over his invasion of Ukraine — two months after Biden dramatically declared that Putin 'cannot remain in power.'
'As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow,' said the editorial, which was published late Tuesday by the New York Times.
It was unclear from the piece whether the US would encourage Russians to topple Putin themselves as US-led sanctions force the country into steep economic decline.
