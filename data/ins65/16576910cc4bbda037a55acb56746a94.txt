Hong Kong has launched a $3.8bn (£3.4bn) fund to lure international businesses back to the region after its zero-Covid policy and authoritarian crackdown crippled the city state's economy. 
John Lee, who took over as chief executive of the region in July, outlined a new plan on Wednesday that will attempt to reverse an exodus of foreign nationals by cutting property tax for non-permanent residents and relaxing visa rules.
The move will also seek to attract skilled mainland Chinese workers, halt a brain drain of local residents prompted by years of isolationist Covid policies and political turmoil and regain Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
