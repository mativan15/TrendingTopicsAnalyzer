Ben Johnson loved having older guards last season with fifth-year senior Payton Willis and other graduate transfers, but the problem is they were one-and-done with no eligibility left for the Gophers.

When the Gophers second-year basketball coach looked to replace Willis and company, he did it this time with a mix of veterans and talented freshmen.

Morehead State transfer Ta'Lon Cooper will be the leader of an all-new U backcourt this season. His running mates are fellow transfer Taurus Samuels and freshmen Braeden Carrington and Jaden Henley.
