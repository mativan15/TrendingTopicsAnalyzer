Showtime's TV adaptation of American Gigolo just got its first trailer, but Paul Schrader—who directed the original 1980 film with Richard Gere and Lauren Hutton—isn't especially thrilled about it. Now, to be fair, it's rare for Schrader to seem especially thrilled about anything, especially when he gets on the internet, but he's back with another one of his fiery Facebook posts and those are always fun.

This comes from Deadline, and there's an interesting twist to this one: It's not the fact that Showtime is adapting Schrader's movie that's making him mad, it's the simple fact of revisiting American Gigolo at all.
