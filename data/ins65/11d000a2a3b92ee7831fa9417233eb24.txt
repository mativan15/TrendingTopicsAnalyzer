Ofer Shmuelfeld pulls his kayak up on the shore of a small inlet. Others in the group he is leading pull up next to him and take a look around. In the mud of a small, shallow basin, transparent, glass-like cubes sparkle in the sun. The air is filled with a strong smell of sulfur and a blessed silence.
The cubes are sodium chloride—table salt—while the mud is all seaweed and the rotten, compressed remains of hundreds of years of organic material. The brittle walls of the inlet are actually a the sides of a sinkhole, one wall collaped to connect it to the Dead Sea.
