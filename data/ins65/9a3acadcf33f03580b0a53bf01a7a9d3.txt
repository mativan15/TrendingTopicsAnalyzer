Chelsea coach Graham Potter will look to maintain his unbeaten run with the club this afternoon (Sunday 16 October), as he takes the Blues to Villa Park for a Premier League clash with Aston Villa.

Upon taking over from Thomas Tuchel in mid-September, Potter drew his first game in charge and has since guided the west London club to four straight victories – most recently a 2-0 victory over AC Milan in the Champions League group stage this Tuesday (11 October). Having seen off Wolves 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend, Chelsea sit fourth in the table on 16 points, seven behind third-placed Tottenham with two games in hand.
