Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said Wednesday that he was unconscious at some point after he exited Week 4 with a scary head injury.

Tagovailoa was carted off the field following a big tackle by Cincinnati defensive lineman Josh Tupou before being taken to a local hospital. He flew home with the team that night but missed the next two games with a concussion.

"There was a point where I was unconscious so I couldn't really tell what was going on," Tagovailoa said Wednesday, speaking with reporters for the first time since the injury.
