On Feb. 6, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II became the the first British Monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, which marks 70 years of service.
To honor Her Majesty, the people of the United Kingdom, the Realms, the Commonwealth and fellow royals have been holding events and initiatives throughout the year.
Now, it all culminates with a UK bank holiday weekend from June 2 to June 5.
The four day celebration is set to include public events, community activities and moments of reflection.
