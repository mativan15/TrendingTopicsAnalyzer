Yankees fans booed certain AL MVP Aaron Judge during Game 2 of the ALDS on Friday at Yankee Stadium. Yes, that really did happen.
A couple of players termed booing the superstar, who set the American League home run record and hand-delivered the AL East title to the Yankees, 'crazy.' I might upgrade it a notch or two, to borderline insane.
And poorly timed, too. Let's not forget Judge is about to be a free agent. It's time to be especially nice to him, folks.
I get it when Yankees fans boo a middling reliever who gives up the lead.
