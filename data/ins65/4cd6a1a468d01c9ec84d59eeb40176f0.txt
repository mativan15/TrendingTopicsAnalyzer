RiverNorthPhotography Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) on Friday boosted its 2022 guidance for net interest income as the Federal Reserve continues on its rate-hiking campaign. Meanwhile, it reduced its guidance for non-interest income as it's retaining Small Business Administration loan balances instead of recording gain on sale. The bank said it sees 2022 non-GAAP net interest income (excluding PPP and PPA) rising in high 20s to low 30s percentage range from its previous range of rising in the low to mid-20s.
