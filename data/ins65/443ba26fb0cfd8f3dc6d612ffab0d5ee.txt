Jeremy Hunt has warned that 'difficult choices' lie ahead for the Government amid reports that he could delay plans for a 1p cut in income tax. The new Chancellor warned that taxes could rise and departmental budgets could be slashed as the Government attempts to restore market confidence in the UK. Government sources told the Sunday Times that Mr Hunt could delay his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's promise to cut the basic rate of income tax by a year in a bid to calm financial markets. If carried out, it would represent another u-turn for the Government after plans to cut corporation tax and the top rate of income tax were scrapped earlier this month.
