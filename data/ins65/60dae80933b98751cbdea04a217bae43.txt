Pressure was mounting on Prime Minister Liz Truss on Sunday evening as three Tory MPs called for her resignation ahead of a critical week for her premiership. Crispin Blunt, Andrew Bridgen and Jamie Wallis all called on the Prime Minister to go on Sunday, while other senior figures within the parliamentary party expressed deep unease with Ms Truss's leadership but stopped short of calling for her to go.Mr Wallis accused Ms Truss of 'very basic and avoidable errors' while Mr Bridgen told the Telegraph that the country 'could not carry on like this' and that the British public 'deserved better'.
