It's been eight long years since Wolfsburg lifted back-to-back UEFA Women's Champions League titles. For a team that's dominated one of Europe's top leagues for the past decade, it's a drought they're desperate to rectify. And while their 4-0 demolition of minnows St Pölten on Thursday won't exactly strike fear into their rivals, the manner with which they ruthlessly approached the match showed their sights are set on making an even deeper run in the UWCL. "We want to win everything," Netherlands international Jill Roord told DW.
