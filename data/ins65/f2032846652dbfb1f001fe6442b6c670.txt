— Tampa Bay Buccaneers (@Buccaneers) October 12, 2022 After three straight homes games, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are heading back out on the road for a Week 6 date with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.
They'll once again be wearing white jerseys for the occasion, along with pewter pants and helmets.
Bucs fans are used to seeing white jerseys pretty much every week early in the season, even for home games.
