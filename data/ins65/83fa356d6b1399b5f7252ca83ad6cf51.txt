Discount carrier Flair Airlines is allowed to keep its licence after the Canadian Transportation Agency concluded on Wednesday the company "is Canadian." The Edmonton-based airline had been under review by the transportation regulator over concern an American shareholder exerted too much power. The CTA said on Wednesday that Flair "addressed the concerns raised in its preliminary determination." In response to the review, Flair added a rule that Canadian shareholders make up at least half of Flair's board and had to demonstrate to the CTA it would not be financially dependent on the American shareholder.
