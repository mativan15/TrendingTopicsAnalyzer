Published: 21:15 EDT, 16 October 2022 | Updated: 00:20 EDT, 17 October 2022 The long-running stoush between the rail union and NSW government is escalating again, with the union poised to deactivate Opal card readers in a move that could cost the government millions. The readers will be turned off for the afternoon peak from Thursday, after members of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union voted in favour of taking protected industrial action last week. From 3pm to 7pm every weekday - for an indefinite period - the readers will be switched off, RTBU secretary Alex Claassens told media on Monday.
