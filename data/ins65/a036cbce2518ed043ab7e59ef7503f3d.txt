As life expectancy has grown, so have rosy expectations of longer retirements. But new research suggests the reality is far more complicated. Lisa Berkman, director of Harvard's Center for Population and Development Studies, led a team that studied the issue in a Sloan Foundation-sponsored project and produced the recent book, 'Overtime: America's Aging Workforce and the Future of Working Longer.' The collected articles, co-edited by Berkman and Beth Truesdale, a researcher at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a visiting scholar at the Harvard Population Center, examine the push to work longer — coming both from retirement programs like Social Security and from the pressure exerted by personal finances — so that people ensure they have enough to last the years.
