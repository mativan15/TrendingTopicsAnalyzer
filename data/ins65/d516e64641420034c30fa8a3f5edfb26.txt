Ukrainian forces continued to target the illegally annexed southern Kherson region Friday after bombarding a key river crossing on Thursday.  Both Russia and Ukraine appear to be preparing for major battle over Kherson, the largest and first Ukrainian city that Russia captured during the invasion. The city is a prime objective for both sides because of its key industries, major river and sea port. Ukraine has targeted resupply routes along the Dnieper River while Russia has sent as many as 2,000 draftees to the region.
