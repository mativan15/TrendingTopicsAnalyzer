Tim Boyle Introduction In my search for a medical devices and healthcare company with a strong diabetes franchise, I came across Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). In my analysis published in August, I concluded that the stock is still somewhat expensive at $110, although it is down 20% from its all-time high and the speculation triggered by the company's strong COVID-19 franchise may be largely over. This is also underscored by the abysmal - but expected - year-to-date performance of vaccine makers like Pfizer (PFE).
