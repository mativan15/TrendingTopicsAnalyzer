As a 28-year-old marketing co-ordinator, Nora doesn't earn a high salary quite yet. She makes $62,000 a year before tax and has a self-professed spending problem, which has put her $3,500 in credit card debt.

Nora says she's having a hard time budgeting and inflation has made everything more expensive, from the food she eats to the transportation she takes. Nora's landlord also recently increased her monthly rent by $200 — she pays $1,350 for a small, shared apartment in the Junction neighbourhood.
