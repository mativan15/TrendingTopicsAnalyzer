A George Michael ‘superfan' has won planning permission to renovate the signer's former home despite backlash from neighbours. 
Stephen Cameron and his wife Clare Harrison bought the Grade-II listed property in 2020 for a cool £19million, four years after Michael's death on Christmas Day. 
After securing permission for minor work to the exterior of the house in July, including replacing old railings and reconfiguring rooms, the couple has now also been given the go-ahead for extensive renovations.
