Twitter has frozen equity award accounts for employees days ahead of the deadline to close its deal with Elon Musk, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, a sign that the social media firm hopes the deal will consummate.
The report sent Twitter shares up 1.8% at $51.60, still lower than Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share.
Musk, chief executive of Tesla, and Twitter are directed by the Delaware court to close the $44 billion deal on Oct. 28. The deal was first announced in April.
The social media company updated its employee FAQ page this week to alert staff that they won't be able to access or trade shares from the Equity Award Center, according to the report.
