It's a stock split frenzy, and Amazon is getting in on the action. They're the latest in a string of big names to implement or announce a stock split, drastically increasing the number of shares on offer to investors. Alongside Amazon, 2022 is also likely to see stock splits from Alphabet, Shopify, Tesla, Nintendo, and the ever-present GameStop. But this isn't a recent phenomenon. Over the years, many public companies have implemented stock splits, including one class of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway stock in 2010 and Apple, which has split five times since its IPO in 1980.
