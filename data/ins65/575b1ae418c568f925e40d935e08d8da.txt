The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the latest Biden administration regulator to warn of the potentially destructive impact of cryptocurrencies on the U.S. economy.

Acting FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said Thursday he was particularly concerned about the impact of so-called 'payment stablecoins' on the business models of traditional banks.

Stablecoins, like USD Coin USDCUSD, +0.01% and Tether USDTUSD, are a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value relative to the dollar.
