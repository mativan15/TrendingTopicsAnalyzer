Want to see an updated listing of the region's most powerful business leaders all in one spot? You're in luck — Power 100 will soon be returning for the fourth year.

We first introduced Power 100, which includes profiles of the Pittsburgh region's most influential business leaders, in January 2020. A year later, in the midst of the pandemic, we reexamined the list and issued a new version in January 2021. Then, we took another look and put out our latest version in February 2022.

Over the years, there's been a lot of change on the list, and that's expected to continue this year as many on last year's list have left the region or announced plans to retire.
