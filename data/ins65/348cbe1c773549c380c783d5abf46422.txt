Joe Biden has been criticised for intervening in UK politics after berating Liz Truss's mini-budget. The US President has been described as "disloyal" for "publicly trashing" a British Prime Minister. This came after Mr Biden said Ms Truss's economic plans were "predictable", adding: "I wasn't the only one who thought it was a mistake."He continued: "The idea of cutting taxes for the super-wealthy."I disagree with that policy but it's up to Britain to make that judgement, not me."He was criticising the policies announced at Ms Truss's mini-budget, which included cutting the basic rate of income tax from 20 to 19 percent and abolishing the 45 percent top rate of tax.
