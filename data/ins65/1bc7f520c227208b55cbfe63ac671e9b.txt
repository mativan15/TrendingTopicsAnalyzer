GONZALO FUENTES / AFP President Emmanuel Macron is getting impatient. As fuel shortages drag on and Tuesday's strikes could be renewed, the president is taking a proactive approach in a bid to retain control over the situation. The president held a late afternoon meeting yesterday at the Elysée Palace with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and the relevant ministers – Bruno Le Maire (economy), Clément Beaune (transport), Agnès Pannier-Runacher (energy) and Christophe Béchu (environment), as well as government spokesperson Olivier Véran.
