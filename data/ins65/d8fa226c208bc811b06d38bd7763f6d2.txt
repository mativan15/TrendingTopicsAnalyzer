Medical professionals are sounding alarms over "gaming supplements" — products marketed to video gamers of all ages — that promise to "fuel" their gaming and supposedly allow the users to play longer, focus more intensely and achieve better results.

These products contain caffeine, which — if consumed in too great a quantity — may be harmful for children or teens.

In 2017, 16-year-old Davis Allen Cripe of South Carolina consumed a large Diet Mountain Dew, a café latte from McDonald's and an energy drink all in a span of two hours, later collapsing and dying from a "caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrhythmia," as Fox News Digital reported in May 2017.
