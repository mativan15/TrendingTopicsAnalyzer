Jeremy Hunt has said that Liz Truss has "changed" as he urged Conservative MPs not to ditch their third prime minister in four years. Hours after he took the axe to her economic strategy in a bid to save her premiership, the new chancellor warned voters would not thank the party for further instability. Mr Hunt got the job after Ms Truss brutally sacked her first choice for the post, Kwasi Kwarteng, in a bid to stem the fall out from his disastrous mini-Budget. She also announced a major U-turn on her flagship plan to cut corporation tax.
