Local authorities have banned an LGBTQ-plus movie from screening in Singapore months after its government announced plans to repeal a law that criminalizes acts of 'gross indecency' between men.

Several government bodies in Singapore — including the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) — released a joint statement on Monday announcing that director Ken Kwek's LGBTQ-plus film '#LookAtMe' will not be released in theaters across the city-state.
