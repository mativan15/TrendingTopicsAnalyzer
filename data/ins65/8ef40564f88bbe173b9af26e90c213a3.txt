Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated $84.5 million to the Girl Scouts, the organization announced Tuesday, continuing her streak of eye-popping donations to large national nonprofits this year. 
Scott's donation is the largest gift the Girl Scouts of the USA has ever received from a single donor—as is the case with many Scott gifts—and it will be used to launch diversity initiatives; expand career-readiness, mental wellness and STEM programs; boost staff and volunteer training and upgrade facilities at Girl Scout camps, including accessibility improvements and 'high adventure elements.
