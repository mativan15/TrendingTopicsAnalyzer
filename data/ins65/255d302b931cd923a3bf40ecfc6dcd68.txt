Control System Labs in Buffalo has been repairing electronics for manufacturing equipment across the country for more than 50 years, but without a new state law, the small company likely would not have seen another 10 years.

Control System Labs is co-owned by Gary Fredricks and Ed Bialek, both electrical engineers who employ 24 at a Kensington Avenue facility. The company has 5,000 customers around the globe and does about 4,000 repairs a year, mostly for manufacturing equipment.

The equipment that comes in to be repaired is usually 20 years old or older.
