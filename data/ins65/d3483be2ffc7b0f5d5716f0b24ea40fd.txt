I may not have time to finish this column because I've got to rush off and move my car, which I parked in a no-stopping zone on a busy stretch of Yonge Street in the middle of rush hour.

Indeed, maybe I'll also bring over a hot-tub and press on my car's horn non-stop for hours and hours to remind people trying to sleep that I'm here and I demand my freedom.
