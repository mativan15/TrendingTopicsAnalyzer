Goulash is almost onomatopoeic; a promise of rich, warming heartiness. I made this and all of a sudden winter didn't seem as goulish… little dad joke for you there (sorry boss). Having been bandied about in Hungary since at least the 9th century, the word itself, gulyás, is a reference to the herdsmen that made it. Paprika wasn't used until the 16th century - until then - the spice was virtually unknown in Europe, having originated in Central America. But it quickly became a key ingredient in Central European cuisines - even the word paprika is Hungarian.
