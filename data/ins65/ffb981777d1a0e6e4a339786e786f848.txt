Guido Mieth Elevator Pitch I continue to assign a Buy investment rating to Federated Hermes' (NYSE:FHI) shares. I evaluated Federated Hermes' financial performance for the second quarter of this year in my earlier update for FHI written on August 4, 2022. The focus of the current article is FHI's recently completed acquisition and the preview of the company's upcoming third-quarter earnings release. My bet is on Federated Hermes announcing above-expectations earnings next week. Also, I am of the view that FHI should continue to execute on more M&A deals going forward, which should be positive for the company's intermediate term growth prospects.
