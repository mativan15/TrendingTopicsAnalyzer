Victoria's most senior Catholic has backed the Coalition's proposal to amend the Equal Opportunity Act to allow religious schools to hire staff on the basis of faith, despite opposition from the state's peak multicultural organisation and a leading Jewish group.Peter Comensoli, the Catholic archbishop of Melbourne, said he supported the Victorian opposition's election pledge, arguing 'any leader who supports fairness to religious organisations is simply doing the right thing by all Australians'.'Faith-based organisations should be protected by the law, so that they can employ staff who support their faith, values and mission,' he told Guardian Australia.
