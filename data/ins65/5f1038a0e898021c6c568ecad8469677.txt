Half of the UK's small businesses (SMEs) fear they will be forced to slash prices before Christmas because of the downturn in consumer spending.A poll of 250 SME owners found 45 per cent had surplus goods they were desperate to offload.And 59 per cent in this situation admitted there would be 'dangerous' ramifications for their business if they failed to sell off the excess stock.In addition to slashing the prices of products, small retailers were likely to resort to offering free items with other purchases, bundling products together, and even giving away unwanted items.
