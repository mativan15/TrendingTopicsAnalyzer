The case to buy Nvidia just got even more compelling, according to Bank of America. Analyst Vivek Arya named Nvidia a top pick, saying in a Tuesday note that chip stocks are already pricing in a recession, even as they generate better free cash flow margins than stocks in the broad market index. "While macro factors can enhance stock volatility, we believe the recent 36% peak-trough PE multiple contraction in the SOX index (vs. 27% downturn historically) already reflects a medium-sized 'recession,'" Arya wrote.
