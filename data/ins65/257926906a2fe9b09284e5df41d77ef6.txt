Amazon said Thursday it will shutter its Kindle service in China next year, making it the latest big technology company looking to diminish its presence in the communist country.  Amazon's announcement follows reports this week that Apple is moving some production out of China and comes after Microsoft-owned LinkedIn's decision last year to remove the social component of its service for people in China.  Amazon said its Kindle bookstore will cease operating in China on June 30, 2023, but it is not leaving the Chinese market.
