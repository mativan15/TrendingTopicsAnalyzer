The Government Taluk Hospital at Vaniyambadi near Tirupattur was inundated on Wednesday after heavy rain lashed the neighbourhood and surrounding areas for the past few days. The 144-bed hospital, built in 1957, is tucked between the bus terminus and the railway level crossing. As it was inundated, patients and their relatives, the doctors and the staff members had to wade through knee-deep water. 'Every monsoon the hospital is inundated. In the November, 2021 rain, wards were flooded. We used pumps to drain the water,' said Ambika, Medical Officer of the hospital.
