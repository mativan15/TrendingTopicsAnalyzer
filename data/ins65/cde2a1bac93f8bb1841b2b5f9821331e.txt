The Pakistan Army on Saturday observed the 24th anniversary of the country's nuclear tests and said it established a 'credible minimum nuclear deterrence' and restored the "balance of power" in the region. Both the Pakistan Army and Foreign Office issued separate statements to mark the 24th anniversary of the May 28, 1998 nuclear tests, codenamed 'Yaum-e-Takbeer' (The day of greatness).

Pakistan carried out the tests after India conducted a series of five nuclear test explosions at Pokhran in May, 1998.
