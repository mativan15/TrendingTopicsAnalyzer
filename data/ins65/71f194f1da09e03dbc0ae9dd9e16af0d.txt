The govt on Thursday ruled out a rise in onion prices in coming weeks. While unseasonal rains may have some minor impact on kharif onion output, India has enough buffer stocks to meet any resultant shortfall, it said."Prices of onion and pulses will not rise till December because we have enough buffer stock available with us," Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh said.Not just onion, prices of pulses are also likely to remain sable till December, PTI reported quoting Singh.45 per cent of onion production happens during kharif (summer) season.
