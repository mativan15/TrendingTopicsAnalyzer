Prime Video's original series The Boys arrives for Season 3 on June 3, and the upcoming slate of eight episodes takes the series in numerous directions. Much like previous seasons of the show, The Boys continues to be a wild, very adult story about superheroes who go too far and the people trying to stop them, and somehow, even in Season 3, the show continues to get better and better.Throughout the eight episodes, the show continues the narrative that Homelander (Antony Starr)--and many superheroes in general--is corrupt with power, and The Boys want to stop him, the company supporting him (Vought), and bring accountability to the supes for their actions.
