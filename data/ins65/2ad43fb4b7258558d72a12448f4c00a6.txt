Love Island winners Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Davide Sanclimenti are officially moving in together. Nearly three months after winning the show, Davide, 27, decided to take their relationship to the next level as they headed out for dinner - and captured it all on camera. Taking to Instagram, Davide shared the moment a waiter brought out a special tiramisu that was decorated with a simple question written in chocolate. "Moving in?" it read along with a small heart. Ekin-Su, 28, looked delighted as she read the question and squealed out a 'Yes' before leaning in to kiss him.
