The Lubbock County Courthouse.

A 19-year-old man accused of breaking into a sandwich shop, stealing from it and setting fires in the business' kitchen and office is now facing a separate burglary charge at another restaurant.

A Lubbock County grand jury returned an indictment charging Blair Warner with a state jail felony count of burglary of a building.

The charge stems from a July 6 arrest in connection with a break in at the Mar Y Tierra Restaurant in the 5700 block of 19th Street.
