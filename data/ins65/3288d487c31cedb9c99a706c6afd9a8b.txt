Published: 15:18 EDT, 30 May 2022 | Updated: 15:22 EDT, 30 May 2022 Midsomer Murders viewers were left terrified after victims murdered were dressed as 'creepy and menacing scarecrows' in the special 25th anniversary episode last night.The show, set in the village of Little Upton, featured three people killed and staged to look like scarecrows amid the area's Scarecrow Festival, organised to raise money for the village church. But the festival quickly turned gruesome, as well-liked village dweller Naomi Ashworth was found dead - and in another twist her body was decorated as a scarecrow.
