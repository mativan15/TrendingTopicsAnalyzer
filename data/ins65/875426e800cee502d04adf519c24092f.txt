General Motors' premium-priced pickup truck, the GMC Sierra Denali, is getting an electric upgrade. The Sierra EV will launch in early 2024 in the popular (and pricey) Denali trim, with an estimated 400 miles of range and a fully optioned suggested price of $107,000. The following year, GMC will offer more moderately priced AT4 and Elevation trims, the latter of which is expected to start at $50,000. The Sierra EV Denali will arrive amid a multidecade love affair between American car buyers and trucks, with pickups accounting for five of the industry's 10 bestselling vehicles in 2021 despite their increasingly higher prices.
