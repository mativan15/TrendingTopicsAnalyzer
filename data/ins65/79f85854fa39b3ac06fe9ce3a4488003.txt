If you're a small business owner in the Mid-South, FOX13 has a warning for you.

The Better Business Bureau (BBB) said scammers are targeting handymen and contractors across the Mid-South.

When it starts to warm up, the BBB said business scams really start to increase.

FOX13′s reporter Mandy Hrach spoke with a local painter and said he's been targeted four times over the past couple of months.

'I get a text saying they want me to get an estimate on a job,' Harry Camp, the owner of ‘The Paint Doctor' said.
