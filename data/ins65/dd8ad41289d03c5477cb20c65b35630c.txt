The Silent Hill Transmission stream is set for broadcast today at 2pm PT/5pm ET/10pm BST, where several new titles in the Silent Hill series will be revealed. The waiting room for the stream went live on YouTube, and fans quickly found some interesting details about what games are going to be showcased.
First of all, in the stream's description, there was a now removed section labeled 'Silent Hill 2', followed by a prompt for the PlayStation Store, but no link had been inserted. It's assumed that this link will be filled in once the stream is broadcast and the store page is live.
