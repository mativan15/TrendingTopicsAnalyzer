A federal jury has found a Columbus man guilty on all 35 counts of money laundering in connection with an online romance scam that swindled multiple people out of more than $1 million.

Seth Nyamekye, 39, who lives on the city's Southwest Side near Canal Winchester, laundered money for the overseas perpetrators of the scam between June 2016 and February 2018, a jury in U.S. District Court in Columbus determined Tuesday.
