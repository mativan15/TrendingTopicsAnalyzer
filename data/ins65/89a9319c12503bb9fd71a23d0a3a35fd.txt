Wayne D, Tay & BamaOct 20, 2022When I was growing up, we had all kinds of heroes. I'm 64 so a lot of younger people would know his name, but not understand why he was famous. I'm talking about Evil Knievel. I was probably 8 or 9 when this kid said to me 'Have you heard about the crazy guy who is jump the grand canyon on a motorcycle?' Well, from then on, I was, like a lot of people, fascinated by his story. They did a movie about him an it was great. George Harrison played him and it made me an even bigger fan.
