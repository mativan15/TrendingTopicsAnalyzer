valiantsin suprunovich/iStock via Getty ImagesThe Hain Celestial Group (NASDAQ:HAIN) expects flat sales growth in 2022. However, estimates include sales growth and free cash flow growth from 2023. In my view, if management finds more buyers for certain subsidiaries, and acquires trending brands, we could see further free cash flow growth until 2031. Even considering some supply chain risks and the amount of leverage, the current valuation does seem cheap. The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Incorporated in Delaware, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.
