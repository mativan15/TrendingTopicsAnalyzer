Embattled journalism startup News.net will suspend operations from the close of business today amid a major pay dispute with its employees and suppliers who are owed thousands of dollars in unpaid wages and invoices.The company's sole director Brendt Munro told staff on Wednesday evening that he had no choice but to temporarily stop operating, three days after this masthead revealed the entity was facing federal court action over its inability to pay staff and third-party services. He would not put a definitive date on when outstanding wages would be paid.
