The Morning RushJun 3, 2022Vicky Umodu was looking through ads on Craigslist hoping to find some furniture for her new home in Colton, California. She scrolled down and saw some free items and the first one she clicked on was from a family that wanted to give away a sofa that belonged to a deceased relative. Vicky contacted the family and picked up two sofas and a chair, which she said worked perfectly in her new home.

No one would be the wiser if she kept that money.
