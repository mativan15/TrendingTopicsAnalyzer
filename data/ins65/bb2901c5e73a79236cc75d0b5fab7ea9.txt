Bruins' depth shining bright after starting new season with two wins originally appeared on NBC Sports Boston

BOSTON -- Bruins players and management raved about the team's depth at Media Day earlier this week.

That excitement and optimism, at least through the first two games of the 2022-23 NHL season, has been warranted.

After the Bruins' top players -- primarily David Krejci (one goal, two assists) and David Pastrnak (one goal, three assists) -- carried most of the scoring burden in a 5-2 season-opening win over the Washington Capitals on Wednesday, it was the bottom-six group that led the way Saturday against the Arizona Coyotes.
