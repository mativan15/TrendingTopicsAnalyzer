Mango Markets, the decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) which suffered an exploit earlier this month, will soon start returning the funds stolen during the $114 million exploit.

The DEX had earlier said that its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), entities that are owned and governed by their members without any central leadership, would vote on how to return the funds to users.

"The program for depositors to recover funds is in audit and should be ready to go by tomorrow morning. Much thanks to all the Mango contributors working tirelessly to make this happen," Mango Labs co-founder, Daffy Durairaj, said in a tweet.
