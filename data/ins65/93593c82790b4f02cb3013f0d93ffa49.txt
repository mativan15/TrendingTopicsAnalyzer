A Miami federal prison nurse has been charged with smuggling drug-laced documents soaked to inmates in exchange for money and other compensation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida announced Friday.

From Nov. 2021 to Aug. 2022, Ruben Montanez-Mirabal smuggled documents soaked in 'spray,' synthetic marijuana also known as spice and K2. She also smuggled in other contraband such as cell phones, according to prosecutors.

The recipients of the pages then sold them to other inmates inside the prison.
