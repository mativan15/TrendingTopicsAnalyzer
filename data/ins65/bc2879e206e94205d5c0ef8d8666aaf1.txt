Almost no one noticed in 1996 when Congress gave online social media platforms sweeping legal immunity from what their users posted on them.

The provision, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has since become labeled as the "twenty-six words that created the internet."

Without Section 230, according to Jeff Kosseff, the law professor whose book on the section bears that title, the social media world as we know it today "simply could not exist."

That's why advocates of online speech are nervous that the Supreme Court has taken up a case that could determine Section 230's limits, or even its constitutionality.
