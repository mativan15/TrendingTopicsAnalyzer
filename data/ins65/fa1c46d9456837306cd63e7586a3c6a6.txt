Delhi minister Satyendar Jain was Monday arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in an alleged money laundering case.
Earlier in April, the ED had provisionally attached immovable properties worth Rs 4.81 crore belonging to companies allegedly linked to Satyendar Jain and his relatives. The attachments have been made in connection with a case of money laundering the agency is probing against the minister.
The ED case is based on a 2017 FIR of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Jain under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
