US factory production rose for a third month in September, suggesting firm growth in manufacturing that's underpinned by solid business investment and demand for consumer goods.

The 0.4% increase in output matched the upwardly revised August advance, Federal Reserve data showed Tuesday. Including mining and utilities, total industrial production also rose 0.4% in September.
