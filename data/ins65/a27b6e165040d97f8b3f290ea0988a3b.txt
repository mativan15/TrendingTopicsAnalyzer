Sacramento Kings rookie Keegan Murray is reportedly expected to make his NBA debut on Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers, according to Marc J. Spears of Andscape.
Murray missed the final two games of the preseason and the season opener on Wednesday after a recent stint in the health and safety protocol. He recently was cleared to exit the health and safety protocol and returned to the team on Wednesday.
Kings head coach Mike Brown said previously that he would want Murray to practice at least once prior to returning to game action.
