Xi Jinping made this remark in 2005 while visiting Anji county in Zhejiang province's Huzhou city, then as the province's Party chief.
Seventeen years later, Huzhou has lived up to Xi's words.
The city has been on a sustainable development path that has led to an improved environment, greener industries and wealthier residents, noted Huzhou's Party Chief Chen Haonan, who is a delegate to the ongoing 20th CPC National Congress.
