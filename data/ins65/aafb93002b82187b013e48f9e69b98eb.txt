PeopleImages/iStock via Getty Images With Globalstar (NYSE:GSAT) identifying many opportunities in the growing asset tracking industry, I believe that the stock may gain some traction soon. Keep in mind that the asset tracking industry is growing at more than 33% CAGR. GSAT already has more than $660 million in property and equipment ready to offer services to industries interested in commercial internet of things services. If management is not successful in offering services to other industries, or their satellites fail, I believe that the stock price could decline to close to $0.
