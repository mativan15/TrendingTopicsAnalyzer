Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) general partner Chris Dixon shed some light on the firm's recent investments in controversial WeWork founder Adam Neumann on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2022.
Neumann raised $350 billion from the venture firm back in August in a deal that reportedly valued his new real estate venture, Flow, at $1 billion before it had even launched.
That investment, which marked the largest check a16z had ever written for a single company and its second bet on a Neumann startup in 2022, drew criticism from VCs and founders.
