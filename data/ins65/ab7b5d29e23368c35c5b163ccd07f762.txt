Tokens of the lending application Apricot Finance, which was launched in 2021, surged on Tuesday despite the lack of any recent technical upgrade and little chatter on its social media forums.

An unintended anomaly caused the surge instead. Apricot Finance's APT tokens – which surged some 70% in the past 24 hours – share the same ticker as Aptos' native APT tokens.

Aptos launched on Monday and its tokens are slated to be offered on major crypto exchanges Binance and FTX.

That didn't stop traders from taking bets on the existing APT.
