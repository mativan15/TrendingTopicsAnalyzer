US stocks were mostly lower on Wednesday despite stronger-than-expected third-quarter corporate earnings results from companies like Netflix, United Airlines, and Intuitive Surgical. The strong results helped drive futures higher in early morning trades, but those gains faded after bond yields surged to a new cycle high, with the 10-year US Treasury yield surging to 4.12%, representing its highest level since 2007.Meanwhile, inflation overseas is not abating based on data from the UK. The country saw inflation clock in at 10.
