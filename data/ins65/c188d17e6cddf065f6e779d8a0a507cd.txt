Great British Bake Off star Candice Brown has offered her opinion on the recent scandal that saw contestants make tacos for Mexican Week.
Week four of the Channel 4 show proved controversial, both due to the lack of baking used in the technical, and a joke by Noel Fielding and Matt Lucas that some saw as perpetuating harmful stereotypes.
Professional chef Candice, who won the 2016 series of the show, now puts her culinary skills to use in her Eversholt pub the Green Man, which she runs with her brother.
