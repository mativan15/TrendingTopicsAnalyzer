If the phrase 'dangerously close' sounds familiar it is because it was the key phrase used by defense lawyer, Todd Spodek, in the Netflix (NFLX) hit series, Inventing Anna. Although the context of how Todd used the phrase is dramatically different, and I don't want to reveal the ending for anyone that hasn't watched the series, I love this phrase and incorporated it on the morning of May 12, 2022 when I wrote we were 'dangerously close' to a market bottom, in a research note to my group.
