Even as the overall job market comes off from its recent highs, at the top end, senior leadership hiring is still seeing plenty of action. Leading executive and recruitment firms including Korn Ferry, EMA Partners, Insist Consulting, Transearch, ABC Consultants, Stanton Chase and Odgers Berndtson that ET spoke to said hiring at senior levels was still upbeat. For most, mandates are still rising; at the worst, it's flat compared with last quarter. The industrial and manufacturing sectors, auto, chemicals, cement, financial services, consumer, energy, private equity and well-funded tech firms are leading the demand for CXOs and leadership hiring, while traditional IT companies and startups are pulling back as they focus on costs.
