Cinema's box office got some long-awaited relief from a big-opening drought last weekend, as Jamie Lee Curtis and Halloween Ends (CMCSA) opened to $40.1M. Now its Warner's time (NASDAQ:WBD) as the studio trying for the first big superhero film opening since Thor: Love and Thunder (DIS) in July. That comes via arguably the top-earning film star, Dwayne Johnson, and his DC Comics entry Black Adam (WBD), universally expected to take the top spot this weekend - but how much the expensive film will draw is an open question.
