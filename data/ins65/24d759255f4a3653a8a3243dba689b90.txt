On Thursday night, the Islanders failed to capitalize on a strong start when they dominated the first period against Florida, failing to score in the opening 20 minutes and ultimately losing the game.
There was no such issue on Saturday.
Following a two-goal first period, the Islanders stepped on the gas pedal, turning it into an 7-1 blowout win over the Ducks at UBS Arena to put an exclamation mark on Lane Lambert's first win since being named head coach.
With Anaheim on the first game of an East Coast trip, the Ducks might have still been feeling some jet lag.
