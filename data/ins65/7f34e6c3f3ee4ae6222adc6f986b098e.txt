Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said his government has formed volunteers-based committees to look after all the 500 high-mast tricolours that are being installed on flagpoles across the city under its 'Deshbhakti Budget'. He added that each Tiranga Samman Samiti must mobilise an army of 1,000 young volunteers and commit themselves to social welfare works.

"Each flag's condition will be monitored, cared for by respective five-member Tiranga Samman Samiti in Delhi. Tiranga Samman Samiti will report to PWD officials if a flag gets torn, soiled or has any blemish due to dust, storm or pollution," Kejriwal said at an event organised to address the volunteers of Tiranga Samman Samiti at the Thyagaraj Stadium.
