Sure, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Bills' Josh Allen are teammates at The Match golf event, but this was too good of an opportunity to let it pass.

During a group interview Wednesday before Mahomes and Allen took on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the Buccaneers' Tom Brady, the quartet of stars answered random questions.

Mahomes was asked about Allen.

'Josh's biggest fear,' Mahomes said, and then he scratched his chin. 'A coin toss.'

That reference to January's AFC Divisional playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium drew a mix of laughs and groans.
