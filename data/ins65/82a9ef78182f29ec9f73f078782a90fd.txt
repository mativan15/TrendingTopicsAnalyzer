Rutgers basketball landed the biggest recruit of the Steve Pikiell era with the commitment of four-star forward Gavin Griffiths on Thursday afternoon.

Griffiths' decision was broken by 247Sports.

The No. 33 player in the nation in the 247Sports Composite, Griffiths is a 6-foot-7 small forward who recently stood out at the Nike EYBL event in Louisville, KY.

In comments made to 247Sports, Griffiths explained why he chose Rutgers basketball and head coach Steve Pikiell's program:

'Right when I visited, I just knew it for sure,' Griffiths told 247 Sports.
