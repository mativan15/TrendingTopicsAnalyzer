Hardware makers are currently among the mix when it comes to the problem of environmental sustainability, in part by "penalizing" and competing with resellers that are trying to sell refurbished kit.
"Vendors are claiming their commitments to circular economies and to reducing waste in the supply chain but all of you in the vendor community are still goaled and paid on selling new products," said Alastair Edwards, chief analyst at Canalys.
He was addressing an IT crowd at the analyst's Channel Forum in EMEA, held in Barcelona, which includes brands from across the industry including Dell, HPE, Schneider Electric, and hundreds more, as well as distributors, resellers and other third party providers of technology.
