A woman in Arizona has found an emaciated rattlesnake under her shed that had been trapped there for over two years. The western diamondback rattlesnake had likely survived all that time without food or water.The snake was first seen on the property in 2020, skulking around the woman's garden. She quickly installed a wire fence along the bottom of the shed to keep out rats that might attract the deadly reptile. But what she did not realize was that the snake had already slithered underneath."How this snake survived so long is a mystery to us," a spokesperson for Rattlesnake Solutions, who removed the snake, told Newsweek.
