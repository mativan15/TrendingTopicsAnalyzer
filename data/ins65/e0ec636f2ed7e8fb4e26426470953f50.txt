MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — How many concussions has Tua Tagovailoa had in his lifetime?

"I don't know," Tagovailoa said Wednesday. "I don't know."

Tagovailoa said that the whole strapped-on-a-gurney-transported-to-a-Cincinnati-hospital-thing wasn't particularly scary in real time.

"I remember the entire night up to the point where I got tackled," Tagovailoa, the Dolphins' quarterback, recalled. "After I got tackled, I don't remember much from there. Getting carted off, I don't remember that."

That's scary.
