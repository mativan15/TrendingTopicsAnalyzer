Lewis Capaldi and Niall Horan knew each other pretty well before but, after their epic road trip to Ireland, there's certainly nothing to hide now. 
The pop hitmakers are set to star in Niall Horan's Homecoming: The Road to Mullingar with Lewis Capaldi, which will debut on Amazon Prime Video. 
As it says on the tin, the one-off special will follow the pair as they return to Niall's hometown in Ireland where it all began before he propelled to fame with One Direction and prior to Lewis dazzling us with his stirring ballads.
