The areas are viewed as a battle ground for votes for the two major parties, having traditionally been Labour seats but which switched to the Tories at the last general election. More than 1,000 constituents in these seats - which span across the North and Midlands - were asked on their views on the climate crisis and taxation by pollsters Survation.
