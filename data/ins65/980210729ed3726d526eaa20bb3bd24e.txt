Former president Donald Trump endorsed a handful of candidates for the 2022 midterms on Sunday including House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy.The endorsement comes just two days ahead of a nonpartisan party primary for California's 20th congressional district where the top two candidates will face off in a head-to-head battle in November. In previous years, Mr McCarthy has typically faced a Democratic challenger, though his district was redrawn after the 2020 census. It is still considered to be a safe Republican seat, according to analysts including the Cook Political Report.
