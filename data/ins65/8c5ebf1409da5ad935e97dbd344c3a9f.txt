House Republicans are pressing the Biden administration over reports that the government purchased $1.3 billion worth of Chinese-manufactured COVID-19 test kits.

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Thursday, GOP lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee demanded that the administration clarify why it chose Chinese suppliers over American competitors.

'American people deserve to have their tax dollars spent at home, investing in American infrastructure, American research and American-made products,' the lawmakers wrote.
