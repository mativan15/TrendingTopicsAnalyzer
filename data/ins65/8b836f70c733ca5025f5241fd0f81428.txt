Mumbai: Facing a tight battle over the sixth Rajya Sabha seat, the Maha Vikas Aghadi leaders met BJP leaders with an offer of compromise, which the BJP rejected. Minister Chhagan Bhujbal of NCP, Shiv Sena's Anil Desai and Congress minister Sunil Kedar met opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Friday with the offer. Bhujbal told Fadnavis that the BJP should withdraw its third candidate, Dhananjay Mahadi, for the Rajya Sabha seat, so that the elections would be unopposed and Shiv Sena's candidate Sanjay Pawar could get elected.
