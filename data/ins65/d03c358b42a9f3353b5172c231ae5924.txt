Sidney de Carvalho Mesquita, a man from Brazil, made the headlines recently. The man surprised everyone with his record for eye protrusion by popping his eyes out at a whopping 18.2mm. An optometrist used a proptometer to measure the eye protrusion. People also call Sidney "Tia Chico." He discovered his talent at nine. Mesquita used to make silly faces looking in the mirror, which made him realise this unique ability. He used to show off his skills to friends and family, who were intrigued. His family thought it was a disease symptom and were worried.
