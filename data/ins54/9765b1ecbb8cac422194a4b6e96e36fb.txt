Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday suggested Interpol to establish a 'real-time information exchange line' between counter-terrorism and anti-narcotics agencies of member countries, while also offering India's help in creating a ‘dedicated centre or convention' for the initiative. Speaking at the concluding ceremony of Interpol's 90th annual general assembly, held in India after 25 years, Shah reiterated the Indian government's earlier demand to define 'terrorism' and 'terrorist' if the world wants to fight the menace.
