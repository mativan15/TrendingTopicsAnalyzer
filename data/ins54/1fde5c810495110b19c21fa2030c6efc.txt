SOUTHERN PINES, N.C. — Women's golf is on the rise, a momentum swing not lost on fans and sponsors. With an abundance of emerging stars gaining notoriety, the sport is drawing more attention — and sponsorships — in the post-Covid era. Tickets sales for this week's U.S. Women's Open are up more than 50% over the three-year, pre-COVID average, according to the USGA. South Korea's Jin Young Ko and America's Nelly Korda are not yet household names, but are leading the charge. They combined to win nine LPGA Tour tournaments last year.
