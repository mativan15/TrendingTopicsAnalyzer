Cryptocurrency LUNA's sudden crash last week preceded a bearish market (where value falls by more than 20 percent), with various currencies following the ill-fated token in trending down. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both dropped by two points, while Doge and Solana have fallen by 3.39 and 7.56 points respectively. But Michael Kamerman, CEO of leading trading platform Skilling, told Express.co.uk that cryptocurrency will not only bounce back - it will change the UK economy, in a way that can help the average UK consumer.
