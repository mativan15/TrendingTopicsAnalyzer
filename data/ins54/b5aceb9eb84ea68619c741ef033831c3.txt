Actor Jitendra Kumar recalled his years of struggle in Mumbai, and the encouragement both him and the TVF team got after Amitabh Bachchan expressed his appreciation for a sketch video that they'd made. The video was so successful that it spawned a series that people across age brackets could relate to.
In an appearance on Mashable India's The Bombay Journey, Jitendra, who is popularly known as Jeetu, recalled how he had taken a corporate job to make ends meet after giving acting a shot. He'd moved to Bangalore at that time, but was called back after a TVF video became very popular.
