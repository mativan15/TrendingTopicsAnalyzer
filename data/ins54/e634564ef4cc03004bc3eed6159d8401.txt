The European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) and the Coalition Against SLAPPs in Europe (CASE) will organise the European Anti-SLAPP Conference. It is organised under the patronage of the European Parliament and with the support of the Council of Europe, and funded by the kind support of Open Society Foundations. Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) are legal threats and lawsuits used by powerful individuals and corporations to limit freedom of expression by intimidating and discouraging journalists from gathering and publishing information on public matters.
