SANTA BARBARA, Calif. , May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Reset Summer Camp for Digital Detox & Life Skills has a few spots left for this summer's program in Santa Barbara, CA.
Founded in 2018, Reset is the first of its kind, offering a clinical, therapeutic summer camp program for teens suffering from excessive screen-time overuse, social-media and gaming addiction.
"None of our campers really want to come here at first, but after they have been with us for a few weeks, they begin to adjust back to the kids they were before their tech addiction.
