Michael Cohen addressed rumors that Trump, his former boss, will launch a new presidential bid.

He predicted Trump will not, as it would limit Trump's ability to spend money he has fundraised.

Cohen was once Trump's right-hand-man, but is now one of his bitterest critics.

Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's ex-personal attorney, said he believes the former president is unlikely to launch another White House bid in 2024 as it would impact his ability to spend the millions he raised in political funds in the way he wants to.
