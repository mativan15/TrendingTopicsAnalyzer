Viaplay Plans November 1 Launch Date For UK As Premier Sports Deal Closes

	Viaplay has confirmed the date for its launch in the UK: November 1. It will offer two packages – a film- and series-focused option focused on Nordic storytelling, including Viaplay Originals and third-party shows, and a ‘Total' package also including sports, priced at £3.99 ($4.50) and £14.99 ($17) per month, respectively. The Total package will include Premier Sports content after Viaplay's acquisition of the UK streamer received Irish media merger control clearance this week.
