NEW YORK (Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc will reorganize its business into three units and scale back ambitions for its consumer bank, it said on Tuesday, as the Wall Street giant reported a smaller-than-expected 44% slump in third-quarter profit.

The bank, which unveiled its biggest business overhaul since 2020, will now have three operating segments - asset and wealth management, global banking and markets, and platform solutions.
