The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum tells PEOPLE at BravoCon 2022 that her sons — Mason Edward Cibrian, 19, and Jake Austin Cibrian, 15, both of whom she shares with ex-husband Eddie Cibrian — are "the loves of my life."
 
"Jake has straight As. He's in Europe right now with this class visiting, and he's going to Paris, London and Munich, Germany. And then Mason signed this huge [modeling] contract," she says, joking that she thought it was about time he got a job.
