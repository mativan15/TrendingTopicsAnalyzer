Something new has been put on display in downtown Brockville, and it is all about honouring local veterans leading up to Remembrance Day. Banners honouring those who served are proudly displayed along King Street and up Courthouse Square.  The idea came about during a veterans' coffee group at Royal Canadian Legion Branch 96, according to member Wayne McIsaac.  McIsaac served with the Royal Canadian Navy for more than three decades. "Donny Bain said, 'Have you seen the banners that are in various towns around the country, honouring veterans?', and I said, 'Yes I have, I'm interested in the project,'" McIsaac recalled.
