CINCINNATI — More details and fall out of Tommy Pham's slap heard 'round the baseball world emerged Saturday in the lead up to the Giants' second game here at Great American Ballpark.
While addressing his confrontation with Joc Pederson for the first time, Pham broke the news of his three-game suspension, explained why he resorted to physical violence and expressed little remorse. Shortly after he finished speaking with reporters in the Reds clubhouse — where the Bay Area News Group was the only San Francisco media to speak with Pham — MLB made official Pham's suspension, ruling him out for the remainder of the series.
