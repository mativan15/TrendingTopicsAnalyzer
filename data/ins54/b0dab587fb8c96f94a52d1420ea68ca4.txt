Rogers and Shaw are firing back at the Competition Bureau, arguing their $26-billion merger deal will be good for Canadian consumers and the economy.The companies filed new materials Friday in response to the bureau's court application to block the deal. Both asked the Competition Tribunal to dismiss the bureau's case.The bureau has said the loss of Shaw's wireless business — including Freedom Mobile, which operates in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta — would lead to a substantial reduction in competition in the cellular market, which is dominated by Rogers, Bell and Telus.
