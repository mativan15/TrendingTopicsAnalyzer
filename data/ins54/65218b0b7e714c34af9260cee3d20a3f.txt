By Josh Beckerman The New York Stock Exchange suspended Revlon Inc. trading. Shares were down 5% to $3.90 before they were halted due to news pending. Revlon filed for bankruptcy in June. While common shares routinely lose all or most of their value following a company's chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, Revlon stock has drawn interest from individual investors. Its share price has consistently remained well above its June 16 closing price of $1.95. The NYSE said in June that it would commence delisting proceedings.
