Hans Niemann, the teenage American grandmaster at the centre of the alleged anal beads cheating scandal, is suing world champion Magnus Carlsen, online platform Chess.com and others.
On Thursday, the grandmaster filed a lawsuit suing his accusers for slander and libel and is seeking at least $100 million in damages.
The lawsuit also lists Carlsen's online chess platform Play Magnus, Chess.com executive Danny Rensch and American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura as defendants.
Niemann, 19, claimed that the defendants are ‘colluding to blacklist' him from the professional chess world and that he has been shunned by tournament organisers since five-time world champion Carlsen publicly accused him of cheating.
