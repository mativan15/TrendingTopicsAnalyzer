The Mall of America now is using metal detectors at one of its entrances on a trial basis, a move taken after two incidents of gunfire within the past year, and nearly eight weeks after a man with a rifle allegedly robbed two retailers and forced a lockdown of the massive shopping and entertainment complex.

Bloomington police were notified of the mall's security enhancement about a week ago, Deputy Police Chief Michael Utecht said Tuesday.

In response to a Star Tribune inquiry about the installation of the metal detectors along with patrons having their bags searched before entry, mall spokeswoman Laura Utecht also clarified in response to a question from the Star Tribune that the metal detectors are only in use at one entrance.
