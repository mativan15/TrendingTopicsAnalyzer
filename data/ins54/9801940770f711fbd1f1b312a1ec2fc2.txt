News of Liz Truss's resignation has prompted quick reaction from political leaders and media commentators around the world, with many editorials focused on the brevity of Truss's time in office and the ongoing political chaos in Britain.

Among foreign politicians, France's President Emmanuel Macron said that on a personal level, he was always "sad to see a colleague go", but that the most important thing was for Britain to find stability as soon as possible.
