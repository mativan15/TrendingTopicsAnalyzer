Mumbai: After betting big on India in the last two years, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned their back on Dalal Street, which remains one of the best-performing markets in the world in 2022. Indian equities witnessed record outflows to the tune of $24 billion from FIIs year-to-date, eventually washing out net inflows of a little over $23 billion seen from them in 2020. The financial services sector, where FII holding is very high, saw net outflows of Rs 39,849 crore until September, way higher than the net outflows of Rs 1,342 crore seen in the same period year ago.
