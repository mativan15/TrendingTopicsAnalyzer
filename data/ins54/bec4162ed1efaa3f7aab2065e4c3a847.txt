The deities 'were meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to be thrown around loosely on the floor, bathrooms, cars, etc."

BOSTON (AP) — A Hindu rights activist is calling on a Massachusetts museum to stop selling children's plush toys representing three Hindu deities, which he says are 'insensitive.'

Toys depicting Lord Krishna, Lord Ganesh and Lord Hanuman were available on the Peabody Essex Museum's online shop last week but had been removed by Tuesday, Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, said in a statement.
