An international conglomerate with its North American headquarters in south St. Louis is opening a new $400 million battery plant in the Carondelet neighborhood there, capitalizing on demand for electric car batteries.

Israel-based public company Israel Chemicals Ltd., more commonly known as ICL (NYSE:ICL), which last year opened an $18 million production facility to develop plant-based meat substitutes at its existing 19-acre production campus in Carondelet, plans to open a new factory at the campus at 8201 Idaho Ave.
