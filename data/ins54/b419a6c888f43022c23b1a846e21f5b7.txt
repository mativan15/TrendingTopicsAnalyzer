Joe Raedle Wedbush analyst Seth Basham shifted to Neutral on Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) as tougher market conditions portend an only bumpier ride for the stock, in his view. Basham had previously maintained an 'Outperform' rating on the stock, first turning toward that bullish rating on the name in October 2021. Since that point, shares have declined over 90%. 'While we have been cautious on the near-term outlook for CVNA for some time, we have maintained a positive long-term outlook given potential for solid unit economics at scale,' Basham explained.
