The Bank of England's deputy governor for financial stability has told MPs that the central bank was not fully briefed about the contents of the unfunded £45bn mini-budget that caused market havoc last month.

Threadneedle Street is usually briefed confidentially by the Treasury ahead of a budget, so it knows what public spending announcements may affect monetary policy, Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Treasury Committee on Wednesday.
