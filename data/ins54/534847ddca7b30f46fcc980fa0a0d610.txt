Forward Alexander Barabanov has been activated off of injured reserve, clearing the way for him to play in the San Jose Sharks game against the New York Islanders on Tuesday at UBS Arena.
Sharks coach David Quinn said Tuesday morning that Barabanov's availability would be better known closer to the 4:30 p.m. (PT) game time. The Sharks' game against the Islanders is the first of four on their week-long road trip.
Barabanov, 28, was a full participant in Monday's practice on Long Island and per reports, skated on a line with Tomas Hertl and Steven Lorentz.
