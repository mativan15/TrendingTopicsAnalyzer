The 2022 Edition of Michter's 20 Year Old BourbonMichter's
Here's a dirty little secret about whiskey: just because it's older doesn't mean it's better. In fact, in the production of bourbon and rye—where barrels used for maturation must be brand new, and charred black—older whiskey is often inferior whiskey. Too much aging in that medium and you end up with an overly-oaked spirit; something that tastes more like wood shavings than whiskey. Consequently, most Kentucky distillers will tell you the sweet spot in the barrel is somewhere between the eight to ten year mark.
