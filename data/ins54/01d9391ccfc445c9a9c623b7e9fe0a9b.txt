Despite it being a critical election, not enough people turned up at the annual general meeting of the Christchurch Memorial Returned and Services Association (Christchurch RSA) to form a quorum. The organisation's annual general meeting on Saturday (October 15) was to elect a president, vice president and executive. Current president Dennis Mardle, who is also the association's treasurer, is standing again and is being challenged by current executive member and former president Jim Lilley. Former executive member Craig Cormack is standing for vice-president.
