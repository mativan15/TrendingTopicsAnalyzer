Ben Bosnan and his wife Wendy have been battling a cancer diagnosis for the last two and a half years. 'Everyday is a struggle,' said Wendy. Bosnan was diagnosed with head and throat cancer that soon spread to his lungs and lymph nodes, and now a tumour in his throat has become entangled with is tongue. Wendy says all of Bosnan's teeth had to be removed because of the radiation and chemotherapy treatments to the area, causing him to have to eat through a tube in his stomach for over a year. 'Some days it's really bad,' she said.
