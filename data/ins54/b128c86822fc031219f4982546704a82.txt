DR Martens today defied global economic turmoil to produce record results that offer at least a glimmer of hope for a battered UK high street.

With rival retailers floundering, the iconic boot brand saw sales jump 18% to £908 million with profits up 43% to £214 million as it shrugged off inflation and oil price pressures.

That is testament, said chief executive Kenny Wilson, to both the enduring power of the brand that 'never goes out of fashion' and to thousands of enthusiastic staff.
