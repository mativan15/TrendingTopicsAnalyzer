Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday set the tone for the next five years with a speech that emphasized "higher-quality" growth and the need for national self-sufficiency. "China's economy has shifted from a period of high-speed growth to one of high quality," said Zhao Chenxin, member of the commission's Chinese Communist Party leadership group and vice chairman. Zhao said Monday that China would encourage foreign investment in advanced manufacturing, higher-quality services, high-tech, energy conservation and environmental protection.
