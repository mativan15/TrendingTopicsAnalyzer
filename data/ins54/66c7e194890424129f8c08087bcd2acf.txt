FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Quinnen Williams kept bulldozing his way into the backfield and getting in Aaron Rodgers' face. John Franklin-Myers also constantly made his presence felt with each bruising hit. Sheldon Rankins, Carl Lawson, Jacob Martin, Vinny Curry and Bryce Huff, too. The New York Jets' defensive line was downright dominant in a 27-10 victory Sunday at Green Bay. And it's a major reason the team is 4-2 and off to its best start in seven years. 'The sky's the limit for this group, and you can feel it,' said Curry, who made his Jets debut Sunday after health issues kept him sidelined since signing with New York in March 2021.
