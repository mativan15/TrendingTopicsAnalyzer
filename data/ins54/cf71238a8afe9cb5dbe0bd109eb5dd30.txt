 As India battled the Covid pandemic in 2020, then Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma gave contracts to companies of his wife and son's business partners to supply PPE kits above market rates, AAP leader Manish Sisodia alleged on June 4 citing media reports. At a press conference, he claimed that while the Assam Government procured PPE kits for ₹600 a piece from other companies, Mr. Sarma gave urgent supply orders to the firms of his wife and son's business partners for ₹990 a piece 'taking advantage of the COVID-19 emergency'.
