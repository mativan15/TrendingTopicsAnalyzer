Scotland's public sector workers are set to be offered a four-day week in exchange for pay cuts, in an attempt to tackle a soaring taxpayer-funded pay bill, as per TheTelegraph UK.Documents published alongside this week's SNP (The Scottish National Party) spending review, which reportedly outlined the need for serious budget cuts to plug an estimated £3.5 billion black hole, state that a four-day week could offer an 'opportunity' to save money on salaries.The plan to associate pay with a reduced work week has reportedly provoked a backlash from campaigners and trade unions, who believe working fewer hours would lead to increases in productivity and that employees should not have to accept reduced salaries.
