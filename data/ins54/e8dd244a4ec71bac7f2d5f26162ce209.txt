An Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) warehouse in Burlington, Skagit County, slated to open earlier this year is facing delays.

It's one of a number of warehouse projects in Washington the Seattle-based tech giant is putting on the slow track as it looks to get a handle on soaring logistics costs.

The 111,000-square-foot delivery station, located about an hour north of Seattle, was expected to open in the first quarter of 2022, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc., which tracks Amazon's vast logistics network.
