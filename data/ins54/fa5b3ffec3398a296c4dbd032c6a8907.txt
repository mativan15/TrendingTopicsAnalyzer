Arkansas Basketball lost eight players from last season's Elite 8 team. However, the Razorbacks should have nothing to worry about, as they bring in the nation's No. 2 signing class from the 2022 recruiting cycle.

That is one reason why Eric Musselman's bunch will begin the season with high hopes. The KenPom rankings see a successful season for Arkansas as well, as the rankings based on analytics have placed Arkansas at the No. 15 spot in the initial rankings for the 2022-23 season.

Arkansas begins the season in the top 25 of both offensive and defensive efficiency.
