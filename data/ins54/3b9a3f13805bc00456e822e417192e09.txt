Déjà Vu Café, a staple in the Moose Jaw, Sask., food scene and well known outside of the Friendly City, has been closed since May 16 after simply running out of chicken.
The restaurant, which has been featured on the Food Network because of its popularity, covered up their front windows and put up a sign explaining the situation during the temporary closure.'Sometimes you hear people through the door, like, ‘No chicken',' said owner Brandon Richardson.The staff at Deja Vu Cafe — known for its chicken wings and milkshakes — are just as stunned as their customers about being closed due to a shortage of the item that makes up 95 per cent of their menu.
