The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said Sunday that Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will be arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday. Sisodia tweeted earlier in the day that he had been summoned by the central agency at 11 am on Monday.
'CBI raided my house for 14 hours. My bank locker was searched, they did not find anything. They did not find anything in my village either. Now they have called me to the CBI headquarters at 11 am tomorrow. I will go and cooperate fully. Satyamev Jayate,' he tweeted.
