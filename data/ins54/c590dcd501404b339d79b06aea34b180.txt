Q: I never write you, but I was at the game Wednesday night. At what point do we admit that Kyle Lowry is simply an ineffective starter? They closed within four points and he shoots two threes that did not come close to the basket on a 1-for-7 night. He was off all night. He was not defensive, not offensive. He is a veteran and has to know better. Feed Max Strus or Tyler Herro. This is not one game, it was all of last year. something is wrong there. Love Pat Riley, love Erik Spoelstra, but please start Gabe Vincent, who knows his role.
