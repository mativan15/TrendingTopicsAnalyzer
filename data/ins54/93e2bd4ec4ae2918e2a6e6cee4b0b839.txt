They have become one of the most common litter items since the pandemic started, but now a group of Timaru teenagers wants to turn disposable masks into something useful. Three Craighead Diocesan School students are on a mission to turn disposable masks into planter boxes, with the number of masks they have seen on the ground, prompting them to tackling the mask pollution problem. Abby Lowe, 16, Charlotte Boyce,, and Jessamy Roadley, both 17, are year 12 and 13 students who are part of the school's business class where they take part in the Young Enterpise Scheme.
