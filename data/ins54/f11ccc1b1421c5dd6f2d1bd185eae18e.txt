Ben Grant, 30, helped drag his comrade to safety as mortars and artillery were fired towards them in woodland north of Kharkiv earlier in May, with the rescue filmed on a helmet-mounted camera. The former Royal Marine, who is the son of Conservative MP Helen Grant, said he was 'terrified' but focused on getting former Grenadier Guardsman Dean Arthur out of danger.
