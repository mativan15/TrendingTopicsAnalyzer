BOSTON–The rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics is well-documented. These two teams have a long history of brawls and heating each other that can sometimes spill onto the floor.
The Sixers fell to the Celtics 126-117 in the season opener and there were fireworks early in the third quarter between Joel Embiid and Boston guard Marcus Smart.
Embiid and Smart went up for a rebound and they were then tangled up. Smart then appeared to trip Embiid and the big fella then got into it with both Smart and Jaylen Brown.
