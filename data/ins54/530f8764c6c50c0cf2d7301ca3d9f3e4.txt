Rebecca Kleefisch lost the fight to land former President Donald Trump's endorsement, but Wisconsin's former two-term lieutenant governor remains adamant that she'll win her state's Aug. 9 Republican gubernatorial primary in the race to face off in November with Democratic Gov. Tony Evers."I'm going to win this primary and then I'm going to win the general and then we will make Wisconsin the place to admire for a conservative policy revolution," Kleefisch predicted in a Fox News interview on Friday.
