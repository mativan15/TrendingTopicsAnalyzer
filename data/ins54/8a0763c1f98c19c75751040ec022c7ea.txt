Famah Toure has very quietly turned into a top prospect in New Jersey in the class of 2023. He hasn't sought attention or headlines, but that hasn't stopped a number of Power Five programs from offering him.

A 6-foot-4, 200-pound wide receiver from Irvington High School (Irvington, N.J.), Toure currently holds 13 offers with 10 coming from Power Five programs: Boston College, Duke, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Maryland, Ole Miss, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Syracuse and Vanderbilt.

He is a three-star recruit according to Rivals.
