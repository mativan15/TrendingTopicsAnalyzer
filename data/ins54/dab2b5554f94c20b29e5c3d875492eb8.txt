Published: 06:44 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 07:54 EDT, 19 October 2022 Tory MPs have been told a Labour vote in the Commons seeking to ban fracking is being treated as a 'confidence motion' in Liz Truss's embattled Government. Conservative deputy chief whip Craig Whittaker warned his MPs that Wednesday afternoon's vote is a '100% hard' three-line whip. Ms Truss sought to reassure MPs with concerns that there would be a 'robust' process to ensure that local communities consented before fracking went ahead.
