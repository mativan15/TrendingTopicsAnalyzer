Earlier this year, the announcement of a project in the Union Budget—linking the rivers Par, Tapi and Narmada to provide water to the parched regions of Saurashtra and Kutch—stirred up a hornet's nest in the tribal regions of south Gujarat. Following a series of protests by the tribals that eventually reached Gandhinagar, the BJP government at the Centre was forced to call-off the project at the behest of state BJP chief CR Patil and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel.
Leading these rallies was Anant Patel, 45, a first-time Congress MLA from Vansda constituency of Navsari district in south Gujarat, and among the younger faces in the Gujarat Assembly.
