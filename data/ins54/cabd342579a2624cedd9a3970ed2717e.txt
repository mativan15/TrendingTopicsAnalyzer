With only one win in Pac-12 play and just three wins overall last season, Oregon State is welcoming a chance for a fresh start.

The Beavers return just four players this season as coach Wayne Tinkle undertakes an ambitious makeover that emphasizes youth. Nine players on the roster are freshmen.

The top five scorers from last season are gone, including Jarod Lucas, who led the Beavers with an average of 13.5 points a game but transferred in the offseason to Nevada. Forward Warith Alatishe, who was part of the 2020-21 team that surprisingly went to the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament, decided to go pro.
