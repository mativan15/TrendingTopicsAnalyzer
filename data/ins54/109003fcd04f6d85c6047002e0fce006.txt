MEMPHIS – Steven Adams has 'probably' conceded the title of the NBA's greatest offensive rebounder to Mitchell Robinson.

During Robinson's impressive preseason, Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau declared his center as the best at cleaning up the offensive glass. Adams, the Grizzlies center who was the only player to grab more offensive rebounds than Robinson last season, said Wednesday he agreed with Thibodeau's assessment.

'Probably,' Adams said. 'Dude's really good.'

Not that Adams is very interested in that title.
