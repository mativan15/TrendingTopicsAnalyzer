Hong Kong will roll out an aggressive investment-led strategy to steer economic development, starting with a HK$30 billion (S$5.5 billion) fund to entice overseas enterprises to set up businesses in the city in what is seen as a radical departure from its past conservative approach of leaving such outcomes to market forces. In his maiden policy address on Wednesday (Oct 19), Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said the government would introduce new set-ups and measures to drive the city's economic growth and enhance its competitiveness, expressing his determination to compete for enterprises, investment and talent.
