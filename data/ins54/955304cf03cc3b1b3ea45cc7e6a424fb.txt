Celebrity Jeopardy! featured its first semifinal round, Sunday, and when Ike Barinholtz responded to a clue, Simu Liu, who was playing for the charity Stop AAPI Hate , couldn't help but point out the odd way Ike phrased his answer.

The clue was: 'October is the history month for this Asian-American ethnic group that included Olivia Rodrigo and Jo Koy.'

Barinholtz replied, 'What are Filipinos?'

While host Mayim Bialick awarded Barinholtz the money, his answer did ot sit well with Liu.

'What do you mean, ‘what are Filipinos?'' Liu asked.
