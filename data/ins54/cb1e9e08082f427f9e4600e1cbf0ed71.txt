President Biden, fresh from his visit to Uvalde, Texas, a day earlier, called on 'rational' Senate Republicans on Monday to nudge lawmakers toward a deal on gun restrictions as the tragic deaths of 19 students and two teachers continue to move the nation.

On Sunday, Biden promised Uvalde residents that he would move to pass legislation to combat gun violence and take action unilaterally where he can. A day later, the president made an overt appeal to Republicans who could be in the mood for some change, telling reporters that he alone cannot adequately respond to the shootings with the strike of a pen.
