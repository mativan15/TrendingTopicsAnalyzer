(Bloomberg Law) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has hired a new head of digital assets regulatory policy, less than a month after CEO Jamie Dimon told lawmakers that cryptocurrencies are 'decentralized Ponzi schemes.'Aaron Iovine joined the company this week as executive director for digital assets regulatory policy, a newly created role, a JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed. He was previously head of policy and regulatory for cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network Ltd., whose bankruptcy filing has roiled the digital asset market.
