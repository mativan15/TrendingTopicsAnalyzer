MINNEAPOLIS – On a corner of East Lake Street stands a vacant building hollowed out by fire in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. But Janice Downing is one of its new owners, eager to move her small business into it and create a space for other entrepreneurs to thrive."When I was a young girl my grandmother used to say, 'Wherever you go, make it better than you found it.' And I feel like we found this building and working with everyone, we're going to create a space that is so much better," Downing said.
