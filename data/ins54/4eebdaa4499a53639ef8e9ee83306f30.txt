NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 19, 2022 / At O-I, we love glass - and we are not alone. The United Nations has declared 2022 to be the International Year of Glass. And it is easy to see why. Glass is a key ingredient for modern life. Glass has transformed and elevated cityscapes, architecture, vehicle design, art, and the gigabit speeds at which we live our digital lives. Glass has also transformed our relationship with food and beverages, not only by providing shelf-stable packaging but also enabling brand-defining and beautifully distinctive designs.
