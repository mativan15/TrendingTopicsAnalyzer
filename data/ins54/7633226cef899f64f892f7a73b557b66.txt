EXTREME-PHOTOGRAPHER/iStock via Getty Images Year to date, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) has lost more than 30% of its market value compared to the decline of about 13% of the broader market. Data by YCharts Although, according to the traditional price multiples, GPRO's stock is selling at a significant discount compared to its peers, the stock could turn out to be a value trap. We believe that the firm is likely to face difficulties both from supply and demand sides. On one hand, we think that the demand for GoPro's products is not likely to significantly increase in the near future while on the other hand, macroeconomic headwinds could create pressure on the supply side.
