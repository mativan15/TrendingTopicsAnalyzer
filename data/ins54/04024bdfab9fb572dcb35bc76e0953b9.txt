The defence ministry is cracking down on foreign companies who have defaulted on their offset obligations, with harsher action expected in the coming months in case of non-compliance. Notices have been sent to overseas companies bagging major military contracts but failing to undertake mandatory investments of at least 30% into the Indian defence and aerospace sector. Sources said that the crackdown is taking place as several major foreign manufacturers, particularly from Europe and the US, are either behind on their offset commitments or have not submitted viable plans under the prevailing rules.
