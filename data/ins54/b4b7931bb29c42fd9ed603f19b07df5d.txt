Good morning and welcome back! If you had time off yesterday, I hope you enjoyed it. And if you didn't, I hope you survived your Monday. Due to Memorial Day, it was a relatively quiet tech news day, but we did get a glimpse at a new DeLorean. Yes, DeLorean Motor Company is making an EV. The four-seater Alpha5 should arrive with a 100kWh battery pack, capable of 0 to 60MPH in 2.99 seconds, and a heady $175,000 price. It won't be built by the original DeLorean people but by a Texas company that purchased the rights to the DeLorean name and spare parts.
