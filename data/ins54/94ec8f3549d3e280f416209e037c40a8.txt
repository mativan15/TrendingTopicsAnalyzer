The urgency to implement the Provisions of the Panchayat Extension of Scheduled Act (PESA) in Jharkhand, the immediacy of involving gram sabhas in decentralising development and the plan to think about a parallel economy once the coal extraction is stopped in the next 10-15 years. These were some of the key points that emerged during a day-long discussion on climate change and its impact on Jharkhand and the roadmap for a 'just transition'.
The event was organised by ASAR and the Policy & Development Advisory Group in Ranchi.
