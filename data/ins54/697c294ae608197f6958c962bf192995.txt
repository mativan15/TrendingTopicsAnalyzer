peterschreiber.media A bear market rally began last week and the inflation picture could give rise to a big move before stock resume a downward trajectory, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Mike Wilson says. "From our vantage point, inflation has peaked," Wilson wrote in a note. "8% is hardly a rate the Fed can live with but if you look out 6 months, the seeds have been sown for lower prices in many goods and services." If rates begin to discount falling inflation "it will give legs to the rally that began last Thursday, particularly if 3Q earnings season does not bring the step function decline to 2023 EPS forecasts we still think is coming," Wilson said.
