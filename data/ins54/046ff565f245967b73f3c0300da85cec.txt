By Mauro Orru Vivendi SE on Thursday posted higher third-quarter revenue led by growth at Gameloft and its advertising and public-relations business Havas. The media conglomerate steered by the family of French billionaire Vincent Bollore said revenue climbed to 2.58 billion euros ($2.52 billion) for the quarter ended in September, from EUR2.48 billion last year. The result represents a 0.6% increase on an organic basis. Organic revenue growth--a closely watched metric--refers to the change in net revenue excluding the impacts of acquisitions, disposals and currency fluctuations.
