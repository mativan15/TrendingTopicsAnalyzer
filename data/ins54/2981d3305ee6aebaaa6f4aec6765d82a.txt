DETROIT (AP) — The Senate on Thursday confirmed former California pollution regulator Steven Cliff to run the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
President Joe Biden's pick to run the agency was confirmed by consent without objections or a formal roll call vote.
Cliff takes over the road safety agency at a critical time, about a week after it estimated that nearly 43,000 people were killed on U.S. roads last year, the highest number in 16 years.
The 10.5% jump over 2020 numbers was the largest percentage increase since the agency began its fatality data collection system in 1975.
