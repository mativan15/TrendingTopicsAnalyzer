Indiewire As one of the longest reigning queens on Bravo's 'Real Housewives' franchise, Kyle Richards has found great success on camera, even if it wasn't exactly what she imagined for herself as a kid. The 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' fan favorite began her career as a child actress at just five years old, following in the footsteps of her sisters Kathy and Kim, who have also appeared on the reality show at different times. Though not her biggest role (she had a longstanding run on 'ER' in the early aughts), her most notorious appearance is in the original 'Halloween,' a role she reprises in 'Halloween Ends.
