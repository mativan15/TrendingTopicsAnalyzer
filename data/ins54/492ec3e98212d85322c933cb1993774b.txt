Crysis: Remastered arrived on Steam last year, but the rest of the trilogy has remained on the Epic Games Store for PC players. Those of us wanting to smash up some aliens in a nanosuit while keeping to the Valve storefront won't have to wait much longer. The remaining remastered sequels will hit Steam on November 17.

Store pages for Crysis 2 and 3 arrived on Steam today, and the games are currently available for wishlisting. The trilogy will be priced at $50, though a 40 percent launch sale will drop that to $30 for seven days following launch.
