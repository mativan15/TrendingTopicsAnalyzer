Britney Spears' conservatorship has legally been terminated , but the singer is still embroiled in a heated court battle with her father and former conservator, Jamie Spears.

A judge ruled that Britney, 40, was no longer required to live under the legal arrangement — which came into effect in 2008 — in a momentous court hearing last November, which came months after the singer had publicly spoken out against its ' abusive ' terms in court.

'My dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a key role in punishing me — they should be in jail,' she told the courtroom.
