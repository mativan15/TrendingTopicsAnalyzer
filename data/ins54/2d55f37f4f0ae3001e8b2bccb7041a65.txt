Dodger Stadium sat quiet and still Sunday. The gift shop was open, but the batter's box was closed.

On this day, there would be no decisive Game 5 of the division series. The Dodgers had failed to force a fifth game, and the next game at Dodger Stadium is five months away.

That is on the Dodgers, not on a rigged playoff system.
