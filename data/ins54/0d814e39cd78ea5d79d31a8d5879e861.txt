There were two things that annoyed Jan Morris. One was being called a 'travel writer'. True, she had written a shelf full of books about an atlas of places – Oman, Trieste, Sydney and, most famously, Mount Everest – but that was not the point.

'Travel writing', by contrast, conjured up Baedeker-type tourist manuals, which was not the effect she was after.
