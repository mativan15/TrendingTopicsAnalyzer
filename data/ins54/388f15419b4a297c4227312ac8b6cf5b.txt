If Gil Penalosa is elected mayor of Toronto, the east Gardiner Expressway will be torn down and replaced with a ground-level boulevard and thousands of new homes, he said Wednesday.

Penalosa called the current 'hybrid' plan — to rebuild the section aloft, but shifted closer to the downtown rail corridor, championed by Mayor John Tory and endorsed by city council in 2015 — a costly 'fiasco.'

Penalosa, Tory's most high-profile election challenger, would revert to a plan recommended by city staff — turning the Gardiner east of Jarvis Street into a boulevard, freeing up land for a new community.
