The NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics begins Thursday night, and there's disagreement between two factions of the sports world over who will win the title. Sports bettors are heavily favoring the Stephen Curry-led Warriors, while two popular projection models have the Celtics as big favorites. According to the online sportsbook PointsBet, 87% of the money wagered on the winner of the Finals is for the Warriors, who are favored at -150 to win the series.  It's not a surprise that many sports fans are betting on Golden State — a recent dynasty that is eyeing an NBA title for the first time since 2018 when it won its third championship in four years.
