Dear Amy: Overall, things are great between my partner "Beth" and me.

Beth is a teacher, and I'm a security engineer. Basically, I stop computer hackers.

Every day after work, I'll listen and weigh in while Beth tells me about troubles at the school, her kids, curriculum, theories — and everything in between. But when it comes to me sharing things about my work, she will say, "I don't like/understand technology" and remove herself from the conversation.

I love how passionate she is about her career, but it hurts that I cannot share my own passion with her.
