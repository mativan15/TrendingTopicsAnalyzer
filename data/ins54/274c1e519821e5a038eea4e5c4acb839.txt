The £150 emergency cost of living payment arriving in accounts this month ‘won't even touch the sides' for disabled people facing extra costs, charities have said. 
Tom Marsland, policy manager for disability equality charity Scope, says that even before the current crisis, life was already costing around £580 a month more for disabled people who need to use more domestic energy for day-to-day living as well as buying specialist food and equipment.
‘We've been inundated with calls to our Disability Energy Support helpline,' he says.
