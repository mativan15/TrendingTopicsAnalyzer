Kanye West was spotted enjoying an ice cream in Calabasas, California, giving the impression he's not overly concerned about his recent Twitter ban due to anti-Semitic comments, the ongoing controversy around his White Lives Matter t-shirts and reports that ex Kim Kardashian is refusing contact with him. The 45-year-old rapper stopped to get a cool treat on Friday on his way to his warehouse. Opting for black jeans, rain boots and a long sleeved white tee that featured a print across the front, Kanye seemed comfortable as he indulged himself.
