SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Jordan Walker's swan song at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick featured a three-hit melody that helped his Rafters squad nab a 10-6 victory over the Solar Sox on Thursday afternoon. 
Walker has demurred in the past when asked about his hard-hit ability; after all, it feels like a byproduct of being 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds. But in his final Arizona Fall League contest that will boast Statcast data during 2022, the Cardinals' No. 1 prospect put a cherry on top of his three-week sprint of home outings as he ripped all three of his knocks with an exit velocity of at least 103 mph.
