Josh Campbell will lead CNN's new 'Guns in America' beat, one of the new initiatives announced earlier this year by CNN chairman and CEO Chris Licht.

	Providing reporting and analysis to the beat will be figures from a range of points of view, including Stephen Gutowski, the founder of firearms reporting site Reload; Jennifer Mascia from The Trace, which covers the impact of gun violence; and Abené Clayton, reporter on the The Guardian's Guns and Lies in America project.

	CNN said that the team 'will explore who buys and sells guns; who makes and regulates them; and dive into the communities most impacted to help illuminate possible solutions to America's epidemic of gun violence.
