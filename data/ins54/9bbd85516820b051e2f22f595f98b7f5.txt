The company develops biopharmaceutical products for treatment of cancer, blood clots, and more and is growing a great track record. The small number of uninsured Americans will allow BMY to continue its sales trends and continue to grow its top and bottom lines even through times of economic uncertainty. Although many of the company's key patents are expiring this decade and some generic versions have already begun limited roll-outs, the company's new and nearly released products are expected to have major blockbusters that could generate lots of revenue while also helping with the large amount of debt BMY has.
