Not so long ago, the Trinamool Congress and its mercurial leader Mamata Banerjee were projecting their national ambitions by leading an attempt to stitch together an Opposition alliance against the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre. This, at a time when the party it sought to replace as the Opposition pivot, Congress, appeared listless.
Now, the Congress is gaining momentum nationally with its Bharat Jodo Yatra, while the TMC appears to have put its national expansion plan on the back-burner.
Sources in the party said that the CBI and ED investigations into various scams and subsequent arrests of heavyweight party leaders, have dealt a major blow to the TMC's national ambitions, with the leadership trying to set its house in order first, instead of taking the challenge to the BJP in other states.
