SAN DIEGO — Three-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw, still in uniform, reached into the cooler to grab a couple of Pacifico beers Saturday night before retreating to his locker.

Third baseman Justin Turner, the heart and soul of the team, sat in front of his locker with his head buried in his hands.

Manager Dave Roberts, who in spring training guaranteed the Los Angeles Dodgers would win the World Series, stared blankly ahead in an interview room.

All-Star first baseman Freddie Freeman, like most of his teammates, quickly dressed, and addressed reporters about the cruelty of postseason.
