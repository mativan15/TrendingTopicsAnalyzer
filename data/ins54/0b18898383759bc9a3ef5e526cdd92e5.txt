In how many languages can you say congratulations? Some time in the coming week, the shortlist for the JCB Prize, a ₹25-lakh literary award, will be announced. Already, there's reason to celebrate. Six of the 10 books on the longlist are works not originally written in English. There are Malayalam and Bengali novels. Hindi, Urdu and Nepali translations have made an appearance for the first time. And when the winner is announced on November 19, 'there's a good chance that, like 2021, a translated book will take the prize,' says writer and translator Arunava Sinha.
