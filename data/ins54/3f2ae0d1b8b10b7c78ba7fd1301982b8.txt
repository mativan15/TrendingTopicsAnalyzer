Fanatics has hired Andrea Ellis to be chief financial officer of its Sports Betting and Gaming Division. Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin says the company will launch sports betting in January. Sports betting is a crowded and competitive landscape, but Fanatics is seen as a potentially formidable contender with its database of 94 million customers. Fanatics is getting one step closer to launching its highly anticipated sports-gambling division, nearly five years after the Supreme Court overturned the rule preventing states from legalizing bets on sporting events.
