Young athletes back on the field and bleachers full of parents is enough to get Dave McPherson excited.
Following two years plagued with pandemic restrictions, McPherson, the co-chair of the East Coast Games, is thrilled to see organized sports return.'To see kids back in action, on a pitch playing football behind us, we got tennis, softball, lacrosse happening today, and it's a Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, it's amazing,' McPherson said, standing beside Emera Field in Saint John.His enthusiasm will only increase as the East Coast Games finally return to Saint John in June, nearly three years since its last occurrence.
