Matt Ryan Makes Lakers Regular Season Roster
Oct 15, 2022 2:03 PM

The Los Angeles Lakers will bring Matt Ryan onto their regular season roster. Ryan was signed to a non-guaranteed training camp contract. Ryan finished last season with the Boston Celtics on a Two-Way contract. In 30 G League games between the Grand Rapids Gold and the Maine Celtics, Ryan averaged 19.4 points and shot 41.3% on three-pointers. Because Ryan's contract was an Exhibit 9 deal vs an Exhibit 10 contract, the Lakers weren't able to convert Ryan to a Two-Way deal.
