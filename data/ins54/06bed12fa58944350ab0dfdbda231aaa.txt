Deepti Vempati was finally able to get honest about her relationship with her "Love Is Blind" castmate Kyle Abrams in her new book "I Choose Myself," which was released in September.While the relationship was over before the public knew it had ever begun — the friends decided to give dating a try on the "After the Altar" season two special, which was filmed earlier in 2022 — Deepti had a response for anyone who thought her relationship with Kyle was a PR stunt."I think it's really hard to read those because I had a friendship, and a really close friendship, with Kyle since last October," she said of some of the comments she'd seen accusing them of faking their relationship.
