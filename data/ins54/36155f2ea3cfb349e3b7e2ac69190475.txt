AS it turns out, Ubisoft's cutesy mascots, the Rabbids, have a fairly well-established world, even when separated from Mario and his pals. 
They're not simply Rayman's Minions. No, there are even unique Rabbids with their own personalities, which quickly becomes evident when you meet Sparks of Hope's Edge.

Edge is, well, edgy, as indicated by her leather jacket, spiky black and green hair, and the sword she literally throws at enemies. 
She's not the sort of character that would usually fit in a Mario game, but she's one of the best Rabbids, easily.
