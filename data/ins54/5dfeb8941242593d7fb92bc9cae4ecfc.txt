NASHVILLE—Mobile production and audio facilities provider TNDV this week announced its adoption of LiveU rackmount decoders to support its evolving production business requirements, including remote integration model (REMI) production, while minimizing the cost of live acquisition and media networking.

TNDV recently bought a pair of LiveU LU20000 rackmount decoders. The units are used on its trucks and as part of its live production workflow in its Nashville network operations center (NOC).
