(CNN)Georgia Republicans last week rejected two malignant trends within their party -- one less conspicuous, but no less important, than the other.Best-known is the "Big Lie" about the 2020 election. By renominating Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the Peach State GOP rejected former President Donald Trump's attempt at vengeance against two high-profile politicians he couldn't bully into summarily overturning the voters' will and reversing his loss to Joe Biden there.The second is the increasing propensity of Republican politicians to contrive culture war controversies as a substitute for materially improving the lives of their constituents.
