The National Education Policy 2020 envisages a greater role for Sanskrit at all levels of school and higher education. Some Sanskrit scholars, however, are of the opinion that more needs to be done to protect the classical language.
For over a decade, Karnataka Samskrit University, which was established by the state government in Chamarajpet in 2010, has been trying to promote the study of Sanskrit. The Directorate of Samskrit Education was also established by the Karnataka government to administer Sanskrit pathshalas and to encourage the study of Sanskrit language and literature as initially envisioned by the kings of Mysore.
