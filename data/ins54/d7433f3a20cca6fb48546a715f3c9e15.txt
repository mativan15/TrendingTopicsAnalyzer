It's been nearly a decade since those conversations began, and Matta and Kingsford finally opened Otra, an Iberian Peninsula-inspired restaurant, on South Main Street on Providence's East Side, earlier this year. Otra's building, situated in an old fire station, was in its heyday when horses pulled the fire equipment. Now, the restaurant's grand bar seats and accent colors are a burnt orange-red, where they've incorporated Spanish flare, French pendants, arches, and stonework.In creating Otra, owners Kingsford and Matta didn't want to pull customers away from Bacaro, which has been open since 2007.
