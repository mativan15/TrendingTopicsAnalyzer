A couple who employed a woman and treated her and her family as their own, are now having to put their lives back together after she stole more than $450,000 from them. Anne and John McDonald bought Vista Motor Lodge in Wairoa in 2017, and looked forward to spending the last of their working years there. Anne was 64 and John was 69 when they moved there after selling their restaurant in Tuakau, Waikato. The McDonalds came to know local woman Danielle Grant, also known as Danielle Mete, 34, and employed her to do a variety of jobs.
