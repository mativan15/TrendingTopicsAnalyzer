BOSTON (AP) — For Earl Grant's first year at Boston College, he was starting fresh.Year 2 offers the hope of continuity – and more success.Grant was hired in 2021 after Jim Christian's teams posted just one winning record in seven seasons and never broke .500 — or even .400 — in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Eagles (13-20, 6-14 ACC) couldn't snap the streak last year – their 13th straight season without reaching the NCAA Tournament.But BC is returning four of five starters, including its top three scorers: Makai Ashton-Langford (12 points per game last season), DeMarr Langford Jr.
