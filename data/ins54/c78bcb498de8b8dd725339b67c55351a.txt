Microsoft has officially brought the Xbox Elite 2 controllers to the company's Xbox Design Lab after teasing the feature last month.

Like the standard Xbox wireless controller, the Elite 2 controllers on the Xbox Design Lab will allow you to fully customize nearly all of the parts on the controller, such as the triggers, d-pad, and thumbsticks. Microsoft also notes that players can finally choose between a cross-shaped or faceted D-Pad in the Xbox Design Lab, a feature you previously could not do.
