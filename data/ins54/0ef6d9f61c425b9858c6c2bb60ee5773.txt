There are emotional scenes ahead as a traumatised Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) continues to break down in the wake of being raped by Lewis Butler (Aidan Callaghan) in EastEnders. 
As Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) confronts Ben about his destructive behaviour, he opens up to his mum about what he has been through – and a shellshocked Kathy wants him to go to the police.
Elsewhere, disaster is set to strike for arch enemies Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) when they are caught in a car crash.
