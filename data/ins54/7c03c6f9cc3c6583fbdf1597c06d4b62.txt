Suella Braverman has criticised Liz Truss's 'tumultuous' premiership as she quit as British home secretary, further imperilling the embattled prime minister's grip on power.The popular figure among the Tory right told Ms Truss she had made a 'technical infringement' of the rules by sending an official document from a personal email and was now taking responsibility.'I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,' she wrote in a barely-coded dig at the prime minister whose disastrous mini-budget sparked financial turmoil.
