The FA Cup first round draw is upon us with Football League clubs thrown into the pot for this year's instalment of the historic competition. A host of non-league sides have battled through numerous qualifying rounds to reach the first round proper and hope to earn some money-spinning ties. 80 balls are in the hat to draw out 40 first round ties to be played between Friday, November 4 and Monday, November 7. League One and League Two teams enter the competition at this stage, meaning former Premier League teams like Portsmouth, Bolton and Ipswich could potentially be drawn against minnows like Needham Market, King's Lynn Town or Coalville Town.
