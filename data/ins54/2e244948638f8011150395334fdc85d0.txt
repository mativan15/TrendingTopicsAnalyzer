Yoshiki Takagi, Roderick Tabalba and Michael Rogers are Team CyberCOP
A University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa team of Information and Computer Sciences Department graduate students took home $10,000 as one of two winners in the student division of a national hackathon competition. Their project, CyberCOP (Common Operating Picture), is a virtual reality application designed to support cyber operators in denied, degraded, intermittent or low-bandwidth environments.
PhD student Yoshiki Takagi, and master's students Michael Rogers and Roderick Tabalba, presented their project to military leaders on May 25 in the final round of 'Reality Bytes: Visualizing Cyber Operations,' hosted by the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN).
