The U.S. government said Thursday that it was trying to shut down sanction evasion measures used by Russia's elites, including President Vladimir Putin, 'to attempt to hide and move money and anonymously make use of luxury assets around the globe.'
The targets include a yacht brokerage, aircraft, Russian officials and others close to Putin.
Targeted yachts include the Russia-flagged Graceful and the Cayman Islands-flagged Olympia, as well as two other yachts, the Shellest and the Nega, both owned by Russian companies.
