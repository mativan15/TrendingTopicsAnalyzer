The Kia EV6, the Korean carmaker's first full EV in India, has been launched at a starting price of ₹ 59.95 lakh for the rear-wheel drive (RWD) variant, going up to ₹ 64.95 lakh for the all-wheel drive (AWD) version (ex-showroom, India). The Kia EV6 is pricey as it comes to our shores as a full import (CBU) and will be limited to only 100 units for 2022. It will sell only through 15 dealerships in 12 cities. Deliveries for the new Kia electric will begin in September 2022. Kia also revealed that they have received 355 bookings for the EV6 so far, and are trying to increase allocation to meet the demand.
