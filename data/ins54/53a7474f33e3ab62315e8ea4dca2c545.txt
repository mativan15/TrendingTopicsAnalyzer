The Toronto municipal election is anything but dull. How could it be when it's a battle for an opposition to the status quo?

While Mayor John Tory and other sitting councillors seem to be coasting to victory with little effort, relying on name recognition and incumbency advantage, they're really riding a tide of civic decline that few are willing to address.
