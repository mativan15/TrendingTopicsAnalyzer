Vertigo3d/E+ via Getty Images The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) reported a robust Q1 card, but its Q2 guidance showed that even the Open Internet demand-side platform (DSP) leader couldn't escape the macro headwinds. Despite guiding a revenue YoY growth of 30% for Q2, its guidance for adjusted EBITDA was a little disappointing. Management expects its adjusted EBITDA to increase by just 2.6% YoY. Furthermore, we have also noticed a weaker GAAP EBITDA margins trend over the past two quarters, raising another red flag.
