"United Community Bank is deeply committed to fulfilling our role as a true 'community' bank, and that includes providing resources for members of our community who may have previously not had access to traditional banking services," said Rich Bradshaw, President and Chief Banking Officer. "We believe a basic transaction account is a critical first step in establishing a longer-term banking relationship that can help lead to accessing credit and saving for the future. We have worked thoughtfully to develop a product that allows us to contribute toward a stable and secure financial future for our customers and communities.
