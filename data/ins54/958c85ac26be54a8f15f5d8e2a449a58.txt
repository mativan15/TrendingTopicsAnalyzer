Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag reportedly sent Ajax star Brian Brobbey a ‘text in vain' as he tried to convince the forward to join the club in the summer. The United manager spent much of the transfer window trying to add to his attacking options and is said to have considered the Dutchman before eventually moving for his club colleague Antony. Brobbey is a player who is very familiar to Ten Hag having come through the Ajax academy before breaking into the first team in 2020. He was sold to RB Leipzig in the summer of 2021, but the move did not work out and he returned to the Eredivisie champions on loan six months later, before making the move permanent earlier this year.
