Sunday's episode of the Jeremy Clarkson favourite featured only famous faces, all playing to earn money for their chosen charities. Among them was frequent Good Morning Britain star Richard Madeley, but it seems the journalist became a bit confused at one point, mistaking Jeremy for the show's former host, Chris Tarrant. The Grand Tour favourite had to awkwardly point out he in fact wasn't called Chris as the 66-year-old laughed.Jeremy began hosting the classic quiz show in 2018, with Chris presenting it from 1998 to 2014.
