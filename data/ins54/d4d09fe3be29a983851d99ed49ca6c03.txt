One of the following statements is false while the others are true:

Novavax (NVAX 2.04%) is very late to the party in entering the COVID-19 vaccine market.
Shares of the vaccine maker have plunged more than 80%.
Wall Street analysts are extremely pessimistic about the stock.

If you guessed that the third statement is false, pat yourself on the back. Novavax definitely is late in entering the COVID-19 vaccine market and still hasn't won authorization for its vaccine in the U.S. Novavax's shares really have sunk like a brick since the fourth quarter of 2021.
