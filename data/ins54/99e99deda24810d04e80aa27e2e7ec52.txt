Sweetcorn. A corn on the cob is a lovely thing in the summer, and they can be pricey in the supermarket. Sweetcorn (mainly bought tinned and frozen) is in the top 10 most popular veg in Britain. But still, corn is quite tricky to grow, and probably not worth your while.' Mark Ridsdill Smith, founder of Vertical Veg, says there's no need to buy expensive seeds from a garden centre – they may already be in your store cupboard without you realising. Dried chickpeas, fava beans and marrowfat peas can all be planted up to grow your own plants.
