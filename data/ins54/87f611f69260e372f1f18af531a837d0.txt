Former Arkansas guard Isaiah Joe is set to sign a free-agent deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, according to multiple reports.

Joe spent the last two seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers who selected him in the second round of the 2020 NBA Draft. He played in 55 games with one start last year for the Sixers, but found himself outside the team's rotation plans heading into this season.

The rebuilding Thunder have room and need a floor-spacing shooter. Joe is a career 35% shooter from 3-point range, though that is expected to improve with regular playing time.
