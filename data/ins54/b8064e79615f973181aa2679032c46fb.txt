You can get a pretty good idea of where Notre Dame and Texas Tech stand when looking at their individual leaders. For instance, runs are both scored and driven in frequently by senior captain Carter Putz, so the Irish know where their production most likely will come from. When it comes to pitching, it begins and ends with John Michael Bertrand, a graduate captain and one of the most decorated pitchers the Irish have had in recent years.

The Red Raiders have a fiery offense that revolves heavily around sophomore Jace Jung, who's expected to be selected early in this year's MLB draft.
