An iconic Chicago steakhouse is closing up shop even earlier than expected.

Tavern on Rush, which opened in the '90s, announced Thursday that it would be closing on October 26, despite saying earlier that it would remain open through New Year's Eve for an appropriate send-off, according to Eater Chicago. The restaurant had announced in late August that it would be closing because its landlord had decided not to renew the lease.

'While the decision to depart has been bittersweet, it's a business and we respect our landlord's decision,' Phil Stefani, the owner of Tavern on Rush, wrote in a letter posted to the restaurant's website.
