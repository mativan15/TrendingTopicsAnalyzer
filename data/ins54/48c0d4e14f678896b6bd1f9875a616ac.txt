Lenny Emson could have left Ukraine months ago.
Though he identifies as bigender, his passport still says ‘F' for female, meaning martial law does not prevent him from leaving.
When his wife asked him to go to Canada, he said no.
When the invading army was within a few miles of the capital and millions were heading for the border, he stayed put.
‘My team is in Kyiv', he said. ‘They all stayed. We all made this decision to stay and serve our community and serve our country.'
The organisation he leads, Kyiv Pride, is engaged in a daily battle to ensure the LGBTQ+ community survives Vladimir Putin's illegal war.
