Today, we present our choices for Toronto Council in the remaining Wards, 17 through 25:

Ward 17, Don Valley North: Shelley Carroll's experience will prove valuable in the coming term as it's expected council will deal with contentious changes to legalize rooming rooms and increase housing densities. She deserves to be returned.

Ward 18, Willowdale: Long-time councillor John Filion is stepping away from politics. The race to replace him is between Markus O'Brien Fehr, who served as Filion's chief of staff, and Lily Cheng, a community organizer.
