Fans hoping for more of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime will be disappointed to hear that CD Projekt Red currently has no plans to create a Season 2.In an interview with Famitsu (translated by VGC), CD Projekt Red's Japanese community manager Satoru Honma said there are no plans to continue the Studio Trigger-developed anime."I personally would like to continue to work with Japanese studios to produce more anime in the future, partly because we have received very good feedback," Honma said. "However, just to be clear, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was planned as a standalone work, so there's no such thing as ‘we are actually working on Season 2 in the background'.
