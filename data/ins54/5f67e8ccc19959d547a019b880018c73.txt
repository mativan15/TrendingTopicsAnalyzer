'My eyes light up when I talk about it,' says Anna Popova, of Globant's new Be Kind Tech Fund. A vice president for delivery at the digital technology company, Popova is co-leading the fund, which has a remit to back businesses with a very different type of take on innovation and digital transformation. 'We hear a great deal of talk about the positive impact of technology on society, and that is very real,' says Popova. 'But not enough is said about the other side of the coin.' She is talking about the growing concern about the harm that technological change is driving, across issues ranging from the rise in online harassment to the potential for bias in artificial intelligence systems that perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.
