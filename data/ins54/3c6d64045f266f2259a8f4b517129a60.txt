During an interview on "Mornings with Maria" former Foreign Policy Adviser under Margaret Thatcher Nile Gardiner said that the European Union remains "deeply divided" on sanctions imposed on Russia. NILE GARDINER: The European Union is moving forward with a series of sanctions against Russia with regard to oil imports. And, of course, this is a step in the right direction. But the reality is, is that the EU remains very divided on this. On this issue, there are some carve-outs involved with regard to the EU sanctions.
