Meta is worth selling even if others are enthusiastic about the stock, said Laura Martin, senior entertainment and internet analyst at Needham & Company. "Fifty buys, we're the one sell," Martin said on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "Our opinion is liquidity only has value if you use it." The company has struggled to maintain relevance in recent years as younger platforms emerged. Martin called Meta's revenue "under pressure" as ByteDance's TikTok pulls engagement time and content creators away from its social media platforms Facebook and Instagram.
