New York's largest hospital sees growing demand for heart-transplant services in Manhattan, and regulators agree. The state Department of Health approved new facilities in June — but then tacked on conditions that have nothing to do with need in the borough. It's yet another pay-to-play scheme under Gov. Kathy Hochul.
A just-unearthed July follow-up letter requires the hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian's Weill Cornell Medical Center, to pay $50 million to subsidize health care in Brooklyn and Queens before spending $8.
