A teenage boy was saved by lifeguards and members of the public on a beach when a hole he was digging in the sand suddenly collapsed on him.

Holidaymakers reportedly used children's spades to help lifeguards try to save the schoolboy as he sunk into the sand up to his neck.

He was eventually freed from the sand at Dolwen Beach in Aberporth, west Wales, on Friday (3 June).
