LOS ANGELES, May 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Seven insurance companies have contributed $122,500 to the LGBTQ Caucus, which in turn spent the money on an independent expenditure campaign to re-elect Ricardo Lara as insurance commissioner without disclosing the source of the donations.

The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog has filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) alleging the contributions violated state prohibitions against money laundering and disclosure of earmarked contributions.
