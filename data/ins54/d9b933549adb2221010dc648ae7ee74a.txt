The number of beneficiaries of GramaOne, the state government's flagship programme of delivering citizen services in villages, has crossed the one-crore mark. The landmark achievement, the e-governance department said, has come in nine months of the launch of the programme in January this year. E-governance secretary V Ponnuraj said they have approached the GramaOne programme in a such way which makes the centres viable as they offer a combination of services. He felt the service will see a demand for a longer time as digital literacy will take some more time to catch up in villages.
