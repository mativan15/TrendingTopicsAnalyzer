In this podcast, Motley Fool senior analyst Jason Moser discusses:

Starbucks (SBUX -2.52%) becoming the latest U.S. business to exit Russia.
VMware (VMW 1.54%) shares popping 20% on reports it will be acquired by Broadcom (AVGO -0.43%).
The chances more companies with deep pockets will start buying companies at lower valuations.

Motley Fool analysts Nick Sciple and Asit Sharma take a closer look at Funko (FNKO 0.10%) and share some of the reasons they're feeling bullish about this pop culture company that is perhaps best known for bobbleheads.
