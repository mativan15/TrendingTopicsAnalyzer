Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen will write to South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Edward Kieswetter and to the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) for clarity into former spy boss Arthur Fraser's claims against President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Fraser has laid criminal charges against Ramaphosa for allegedly contravening the Prevention of Organised Crime Act for failing to report a theft from his farm in Limpopo, in 2020.

Fraser alleges that $4-million was stolen and that the thieves were caught and kidnapped, interrogated and paid to stay silent about the ordeal.
