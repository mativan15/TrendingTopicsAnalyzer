Ted Kravitz has revealed rival teams are looking to throw Red Bull out of the constructors championship as punishment for breaking the rules. The Sky Sports F1 host said this would be just one of the punishments with teams also calling for the team to lose its prize money and pit lane position for 2023.He warns a tip of action could be enough to act as a detriment to stop teams breaching the cap next season. Kravitz explained: 'The other teams will demand that if there is a penalty to be meated out that it is both sufficiently harsh in a sporting way and in a financial way, and in a way that has an effect on Red Bull going into next season.
