TORONTO - Canada's main stock index ended down more than 100 points on Canadian inflation data that was higher than investors had hoped, while U.S. markets were also down. The S&P/TSX composite index was down 123.78 points at 18,674.40. Inflation in September was higher than expected, said Vincent Tonietto, senior vice-president and portfolio manager with Fiduciary Trust Canada, much like last week's inflation data out of the U.S. Statistics Canada's latest consumer price index report released Wednesday showed that overall inflation was at 6.
