The Los Angeles Chargers offense could be getting a key piece back very soon.

Keenan Allen told reporters on Friday he's aiming to return from a hamstring injury in Week 7 against the Seattle Seahawks.

"We're just playing it day-by-day," the Chargers wide receiver said. "This week would be great, but I don't think I'm going to make it. So, Seattle's looking bright."

Allen looked like he was going to have a fantastic start to the season. The 30-year-old had four receptions for 66 yards in the first half against the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 1.
