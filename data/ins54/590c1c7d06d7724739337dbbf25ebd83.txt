Sporting organizations in Regina are combating issues related to a shortage of registered officials. Both Queen City Box Lacrosse (QCMBL) and the Regina Football Officials Association (RFOA) said they have yet to return to pre-pandemic numbers, while Hockey Saskatchewan is seeing those numbers start to bounce back. Heather Wenarchuk, treasurer for the QCMBL, is tasked with scheduling the referees. She said the QCMBL was down to around a dozen officials this past season from the 28 they had prior to the pandemic.
