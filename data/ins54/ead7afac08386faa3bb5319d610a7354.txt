Making bath bombs, coding an AI-powered robot, learning how mechanical energy powers a skateboard, joining a Lego League, creating virtual stories in an augmented reality world, making custom cosmetics, even designing and building a model F1 race car — this is fun, hands-on education for kids provided by a Miami nonprofit organization.

S.E.E.K Foundation, which stands of 'Seeking Education Empowers Knowledge,' is focused on STEAM education — that's science, technology, engineering, art and math.
