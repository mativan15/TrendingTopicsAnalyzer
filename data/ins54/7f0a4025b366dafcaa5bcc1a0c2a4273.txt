BERLIN (AP) — Germany must avoid repeating with China the mistakes that it made in its relationship with Russia over recent years, the German foreign minister said Tuesday.

Annalena Baerbock said Germany must face up to a 'competition of systems" between countries that believe in international law and cooperation and authoritarian regimes.

'We must first of all learn from the mistakes of our Russia policy of recent decades,' Baerbock said at a foreign policy forum in Berlin organized by the Koerber Foundation think tank.
