Who is the 2022 Pac-12 Offensive MVP through seven weeks? We talked to Ducks Wire about our midseason Pac-12 awards.

This is what we wrote:

Right now it's either Dorian Thompson-Robinson or Zach Charbonnet. The answer will depend on — most likely — the USC-UCLA game on Nov. 19.

Oregon's offense is putting up huge numbers. Emphatic victories over UCLA and Utah could elevate Bo Nix in this conversation. USC obviously has Caleb Williams and Travis Dye in the discussion.

Troy Franklin of Oregon also has to be considered.
