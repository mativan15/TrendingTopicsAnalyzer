This isn't about political point scoring. 
Of course, I want a Labour government, but no matter which political party you support, it is clear the Tories are incapable of governing and the country has had enough. 
It has been the case for a while now. It is like the Wizard of Oz – once you see behind the curtain, you can't unsee it. The Tories were trusted and they abused that trust quite spectacularly.
We saw that last night with the disgraceful and unprecedented scenes in Parliament, where it has been alleged that some Tory MPs were bullied and even physically manhandled into voting lobbies.
