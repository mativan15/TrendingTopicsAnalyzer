Huawei has entered the data center construction business with an offering that it claims can be built in half the time required by competing methods, then run more efficiently.
The prosaically-named 'Next-Generation Data Center Facility', as depicted in a video posted to Chinese social media, employs suspiciously-shipping-container-sized modules stacked into a larger building.
In the video, a pre-school girl and her father use Lego to assemble a cube-shaped building. The scene cuts to film of a very similar building under construction in the real world, before the director makes sure the metaphor can't be missed by morphing the Lego and actual buildings, as depicted below.
