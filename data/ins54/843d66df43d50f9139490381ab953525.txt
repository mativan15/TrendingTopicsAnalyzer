Gov. Hochul supposedly has the right to disburse up to $920 million of taxpayer funds to basically whomever she wants. This is totally outrageous ('Kat buy me gov,' Oct. 15).
She has failed to protect the public from rising crime, taxpayers are already overtaxed compared to other states and the state seems to be out of control with only a few select politicians and their friends benefitting.
She seems to have failed in everything she has done, as no one I have spoken to can recall her doing anything of substance for the normal, everyday taxpayers.
