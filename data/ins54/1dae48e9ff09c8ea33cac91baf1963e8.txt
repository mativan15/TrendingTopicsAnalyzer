A group of anganwadi workers, under the banner of Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union, protested on the AAP headquarters premises in the national capital on Wednesday.The workers raised ' Farjiwal sharam karo, sharam karo' slogans and refused to leave the premises, due to which a scheduled press conference was also delayed. 'We protested, firstly, against the illegal termination of 884 anganwadi workers, and secondly, against the imposition of the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to prohibit strike by anganwadi workers for six months,' said union president Shivani Kaul.
