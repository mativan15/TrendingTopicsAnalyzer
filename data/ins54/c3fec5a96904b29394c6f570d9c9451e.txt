US energy giant ExxonMobil announced on Monday that it has left Russia completely, discontinuing operations in the Sakhalin-1 project in the country's Far East, after it was transferred to a local entity.'With two decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated our interests in Sakhalin-1 and the project has been transferred to a Russian operator,' the company said in a statement, adding, 'We have safely exited Russia following the expropriation.'Exxon did not elaborate on whether it received compensation for the assets, which it had valued at more than $4 billion.
