Nelson's three softball world champions and members of the province's first title winning team were among the guests at the Nelson Softball Association 60th jubilee. The reunion kick-started the new softball season at Saxton Field this month with games proceeding after Nelson Softball Association life member Rab Jamieson hurled the first ceremonial pitch. Among the attendees were Karen Rackley (Fraser), who batted in the crucial second run in the New Zealand women's team's world championship final victory in Taiwan in 1982, a side coached by late Nelson softball stalwart Ed Dolejs.
