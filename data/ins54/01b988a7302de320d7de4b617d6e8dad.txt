On Monday evening, Ms Truss will attempt to stabilise her premiership by hosting a Cabinet reception to discuss ideas for her reset of economic policy due on October 31. All Tory MPs have also been offered Treasury meetings to input their thoughts.
The olive branch comes after the Prime Minister and Jeremy Hunt, the newly installed Chancellor, held two hours of talks at Chequers about economic policy, followed by a Sunday lunch with their families.
Mr Hunt, who at the weekend ditched major parts of Ms Truss's original economic approach, dismissed claims he was now the most powerful person in Government, telling the BBC: 'The Prime Minister's in charge.
