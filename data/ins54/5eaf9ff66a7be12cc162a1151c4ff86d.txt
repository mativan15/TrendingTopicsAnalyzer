SOUTHAMPTON is set to celebrate the hard work of its carers with a series of events this week.

To mark National Carers Week, the city council and its partners will be hosting activities across the city including tree planting, sending sunflowers to carers and workshops.

The annual campaign, which raises awareness of caring and the challenges unpaid carers face, will this year have the theme of "make caring visible, valued and supported".
