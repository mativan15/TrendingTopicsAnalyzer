A new inland port is being developed in Marlborough by Port Nelson to support the flow of wine and other goods from the region's primary industries. The development, at Riverlands, south of Blenheim, will initially be on a 1.4ha site, containing 5000sq m of warehousing for storage and packing, as well as a facility for container operations and storage. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. A further 2.6ha immediately next to the site has been reserved for future development of the Marlborough Inland Port.
