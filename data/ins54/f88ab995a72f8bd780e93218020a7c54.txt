Jay Ellis doesn't think there will be a sequel to Top Gun: Maverick, but he admits he could be wrong.
 
The actor, 40, caught up with PEOPLE at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles on Saturday night, where he chatted about the potential for a third Top Gun film.
 
While he played Lt. Reuben "Payback" Fitch in the box office smash earlier this year, he revealed he's not in the know when it comes to a follow-up project.
 
"I haven't heard about it, so if you know something, tell me," Ellis told PEOPLE exclusively.
