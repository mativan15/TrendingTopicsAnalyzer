The Trees is black comedy — which we might define as laughing at things we're not supposed to laugh about — at its darkest. It is a funny crime novel that uses as its springboard the racist murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955. If anyone can get away with this, it is Everett, who over a four-decade career has made a speciality of head-spinning satirical takes on race in the United States.The book starts off with a kick: in the town of Money, a white man, Junior Junior, is found dead — garrotted by barbed wire — and next to him lies the mutilated figure of a black man who holds Junior's severed balls in his hand.
