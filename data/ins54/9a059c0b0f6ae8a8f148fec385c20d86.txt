Oct. 15—Cinde Warmington, whose N.H. Executive Council District 2 takes in Keene and much of the Monadnock Region, faces state Sen. Harold French in a Nov. 8 general election race for a panel that shares power with the governor.

The five-member council approves receipts and expenditures of state and federal funds, confirms the appointment of judges and commissioners and hears pardon requests.

A running battle on the council involves funding of state contracts for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which has an office in Keene, and two other family planning providers.
