Legislators in many U.S. states have been voicing the need to shield children from complexity, controversy, and differing perspectives. Since the beginning of 2022, politicians have introduced 139 bills across 37 states designed to limit educators' latitude to address racism, inequity, bias, structural injustices, and gender and sexuality issues in school. Thus far, 20 states have enacted related laws or executive orders. Many of these efforts stymie civic learning and discussion of controversial issues, and limit experiential learning about how to engage as local civic actors.
