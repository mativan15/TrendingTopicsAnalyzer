Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday virtually released the 11th installment of the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, the cash-transfer scheme for farmers, paying out ₹21,000 crore to nearly 100 million cultivators, at an event in Shimla organised to mark eight years of his government at the Centre. Addressing the Garib Kalyan Sammelan at Ridge Maidan in the Himachal capital, the PM said his government stood for 'welfare for all'. 'These eight years have been years of devotion to welfare of the people and good governance,' the PM said while interacting with beneficiaries of 16 centrally sponsored schemes conducted by nine central ministries.
