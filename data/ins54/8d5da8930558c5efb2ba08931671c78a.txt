Shares in the platform for streaming services on Friday closed at their lowest level since February 2019 and have lost more than three quarters of their value since the start of 2022, the 12th-biggest drop in the Russell 1000 Index. While Netflix is up 36% since the market low in mid-June, Roku has lost about the same amount since then.
