Aston Villa are reportedly amongst the Premier League clubs interested in signing 19-year-old Peterborough United defender Ronnie Edwards.

What's the story?

That's according to The Sun, who claim that the English youngster is valued at £10m despite being relegated to League One with the Posh this term.

Grant McCann couldn't steady the ship after replacing Darren Ferguson in February with the Cambridgeshire side finishing 22nd after just one season back in the second tier.
