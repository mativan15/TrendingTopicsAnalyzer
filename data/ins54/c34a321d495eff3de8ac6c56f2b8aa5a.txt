The Royal Mint has unveiled a Harry Potter coin collection that will feature portraits of both Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III.

The commemorative coins were launched to celebrate 25 years since the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J K Rowling was first published in the UK in 1997 by Bloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L).

The coin producer is expecting high demand for the coins, adding that its Harry Potter collection will be one of "a small number" that will see a change of portrait during the series.
