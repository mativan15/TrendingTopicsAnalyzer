ETCIORepresentative ImageNew Delhi/Chennai: The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-In)'s directives on reporting a cybersecurity incident within six hours from being aware of it, the lack of clarity on what constitutes a severe or a large-scale incident and other directives could potentially 'undermine incident investigation and response, including the deployment of defensive measures', software policy group BSA has said. 'We recommend that the directions ask to provide an initial report of high-impact or severe cyber incidents as soon as practicable or within 72 hours of the confirmation of an incident, whichever is faster,' Venkatesh Krishnamoorthy, Country Manager India of BSA, The Software Alliance said.
