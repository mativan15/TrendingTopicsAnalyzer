Thursday is here again, and that means it's time to unveil the next Epic free game. For the week of Oct. 27, 2022, through Nov. 3, 2022, you can grab Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus from Bulwark Studios for absolutely nothing, just months after it originally launches, alongside Saturnalia, a survival horror game that launches on the Epic Games Store and Xbox on the same day. 
Only the base Warhammer 40,000 game is free. If you want the add-ons, such as the Heretek expansion, you'll have to pay for them separately.
