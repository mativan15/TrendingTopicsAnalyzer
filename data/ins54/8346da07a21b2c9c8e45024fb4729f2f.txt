'We have been cash profit and we continue to be cash profit,' says 
Sushant Dash, CEO, Tata Starbucks 
Has higher raw material prices impacted the business?We have seen 7% to 8% inflation on coffee. For us what is more important is to provide the right value to the consumers and to give them the right experience in terms of what we want. We keep a lookout in terms of inflation and in terms of where it is going. So, we will keep a watch on that and see what we need to do. For us, the focus has always been about the consumer and about giving them the right experience.
