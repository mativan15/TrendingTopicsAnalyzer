By Reuters Published: 10:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 | Updated: 10:10 EDT, 17 October 2022 PARIS, Oct 17 (Reuters) - France's highest administrative court on Monday ordered the state to pay two new fines of 10 million euros ($9.75 million) each for failing to improve air quality in the country's major cities. The sanction comes after a first 10 million euros fine back in 2021, and five years after the Conseil d'Etat, which acts as a legal adviser to the executive and as the supreme court for administrative justice, ordered the government to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide and fine particles in more than a dozen zones to comply with European standards.
