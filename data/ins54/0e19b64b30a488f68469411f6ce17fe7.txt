Report: No rookie-scale extension for Thybulle before deadline originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

Matisse Thybulle reportedly did not sign a rookie-scale contract extension with the Sixers before Monday's deadline, meaning the 25-year-old will become a restricted free agent following this season.

Yahoo Sports' Chris Haynes reported that Thybulle and the Sixers did not reach a deal. The two sides 'briefly held discussions on the possibility of an extension recently but were unable to come to an agreement,' Haynes reported.
