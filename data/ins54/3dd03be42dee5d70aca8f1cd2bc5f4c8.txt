A six-pack of Miami Dolphins notes on a Tuesday:

▪ Mike Gesicki knew the question was coming, so much so that he asked it for the reporters gathered around his locker on Sunday.

'That's been unfortunately the story line, people talking about me fitting in the offense — do I fit? Do I not fit?' he said.

For one week, at least, he certainly fit, catching six passes for 69 yards and two touchdowns in Sunday's loss to Minnesota.

With Durham Smythe sidelined due a hamstring injury and Gesicki's snap count ballooning to 60, he was targeted far more than he had been during the first five weeks.
