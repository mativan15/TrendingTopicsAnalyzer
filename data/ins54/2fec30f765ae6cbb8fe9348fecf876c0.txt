Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif testified on Saturday in a special court hearing in the PKR 16 billion money laundering case against him that he had refused to take any salary when he was the Chief Minister of Punjab province, and termed himself a 'majnoo' for doing so.
Shehbaz and his sons – Hamza and Suleman – were booked by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in November 2020 under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act.
Hamza is currently the Chief Minister of Punjab province, while Suleman is absconding and residing in the UK.
