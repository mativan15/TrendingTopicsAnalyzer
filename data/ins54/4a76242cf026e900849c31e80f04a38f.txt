Irish gifting platform &Open has opened a new on-demand marketplace making its services more accessible, particularly for smaller enterprises.The Dublin-based company opened a waiting list for the service earlier this year. More than 1,000 companies have joined ahead of the official launch of &Open On-Demand.'The wait list has been quietly growing throughout the last few months,' said cofounder Jonathan Legge. 'This is a really exciting new chapter for us because it moves us beyond being able to serve a fairly niche part of the gifting space with corporate gifting to allow us to support, fundamentally, any company that wants to gift.
