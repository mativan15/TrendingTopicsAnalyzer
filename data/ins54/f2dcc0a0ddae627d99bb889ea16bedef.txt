Pfizer (PFE -0.15%) and Moderna (MRNA 8.73%) both have generated billions of dollars in revenue, thanks to their coronavirus vaccines. They both dominate the U.S. market.
Pfizer has fully vaccinated more than 127 million Americans, while Moderna has vaccinated nearly 77 million. But their stock prices haven't followed the same path. Since the start of the pandemic, Moderna's shares have soared more than 600%, while Pfizer's stock has gained about 45%.
When I ask, "which is the better COVID stock?" the answer might seem obvious.
