Charday Penn/E+ via Getty Images Technology and defense company Parsons (NYSE:PSN) has been trading stagnant for quite a while, which is interesting enough given the moves seen in the market itself. In the final days of 2020, I concluded that Parsons was delivering on its promises, and delivering on bolt-on M&A after going public in spring of 2019. With shares trading at a fair valuation multiple, I considered shares to be fairly valued, yet with defense markets attracting greater interest for obvious reasons, it is certainly interesting to update the investment thesis here.
