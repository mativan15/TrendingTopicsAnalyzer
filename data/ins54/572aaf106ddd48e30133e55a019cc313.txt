Oct. 20—HAMILTON — The jury is continuing deliberation in the death penalty trial of Gurpreet Singh, taking a break for lunch and a few words from Butler County Common Pleas Judge Greg Howard.

The jury returned to the courtroom about 9:15 a.m. after two hours of deliberation Wednesday. At about 12:30 p.m., the attorneys, Singh and the jury filed into the courtroom where Howard read a statement to them and told them to continue deliberation.

"The process of discussions and deliberation in the jury room is necessarily slow and requires consideration and patience, " the judge said.
