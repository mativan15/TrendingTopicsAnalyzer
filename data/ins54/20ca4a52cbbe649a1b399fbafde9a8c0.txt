When Suella Braverman stood up at the dispatch box to decry tofu, I felt it deep in my waters, namely the milky white waters in the small plastic wrapping of my soul."I'm afraid it's the Labour Party' she said, apportioning blame for the environmental protests blocking the M25, 'it's the Lib Dems, it's the coalition of chaos, it's the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati'.It's a recurring oddity of British politics that such attacks are still made, but even by the standards of such things, this seemed weak.
