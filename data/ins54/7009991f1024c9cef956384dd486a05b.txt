Kourtney Kellar and NBA player Isaiah Hartenstein — the buzzy new member of the New York Knicks — met in 2019 when the athlete, then playing center on the Houston Rockets, slid into her DMs.   'My Instagram is pretty sexy, so I get a lot of comments about my body, which is nice. But he came in and messaged me something like, ‘You have the most beautiful smile,' and sent me his favorite photo of me from my feed,' Kellar, 31, said. Kellar's Instagram is filled with bikini shots of the blonde model.
