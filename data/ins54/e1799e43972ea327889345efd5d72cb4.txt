U.S. equities charged forward for another day, extending a comeback that kicked off the week as earnings season sets into high gear.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) surged 2.3% at the open, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 600 points, or 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced 2.8%.

Sentiment got a boost Tuesday morning on third-quarter results from Goldman Sachs (GS) — Wall Street's premier investment bank — which posted earnings that beat analyst estimates across the board despite challenging year-over-year comparisons.
