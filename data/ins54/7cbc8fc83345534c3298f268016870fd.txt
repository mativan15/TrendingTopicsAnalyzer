EAST LANSING, Mich.

Tom Izzo insists he has no plans to call it a career anytime soon.

The Hall of Fame coach, who turns 68 in January, is entering his 28th season in charge of Michigan State's program and his energy level hasn't missed a beat.

'When it's time that I don't enjoy it, when it's time I can't take a red-eye (flight) from Vegas to Orlando, it will be time to get out," Izzo said. 'That is not where I'm at right now in any way, shape or form."

Izzo is running out of contemporaries.

Former Villanova coach Jay Wright stunned a lot of people by retiring by retiring at the age of 60 last spring, saying he lost 'the edge' needed to continue coaching at a championship level.
