iantfoto/E+ via Getty Images Digital Turbine (NASDAQ:APPS) is at a 52-week low and lost over 20% yesterday following disappointing guidance on its Q4 earnings release. The current valuation, at 11x forward P/E, discounts few of the many growth drivers that have made APPS an exciting stock in the past and in my opinion, will make it an exciting stock in the future. The bad first, then the good. As a small company dealing with telco and social media giants, Digital Turbine often gets ensnared in bureaucracy at its customers and projects take longer than expected to close and ramp.
