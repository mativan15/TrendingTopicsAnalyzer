During an interview on ‘Cavuto: Coast to Coast,' Thursday, Former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin speculated on the root cause of the nations' historical inflation rates and how to effectively solve it. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: At the time, there had to be a point at which the number was too big, where the answer to the question it's better to air on the side of being too big than too small. No, it's not. I mean, when you get to 2 trillion, that's a really big number, and you're erring on the side of being way too big.
