As likenesses go, is this the best bar naan?
Jonathan Hoitinga, 40, thinks he's spotted the face of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his chicken korma – and believes it's a sign the Etonian will be soon back in power.
Liz Truss' is facing a fight to keep her job and Boris himself is the favourite among Tories to return to the hot seat after leaving Downing Street just last month.
Jonathan, from Leatherhead in Surrey, was preparing a chicken korma ready meal for a client he was caring for and arranged the plate so the rice and curry were separate.
