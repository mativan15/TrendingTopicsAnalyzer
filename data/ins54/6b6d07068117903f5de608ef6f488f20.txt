E-commerce giant Amazon has launched a $2 billion Housing Equity Fund to preserve and develop more than 20,000 affordable housing units across three major hubs–Puget Sound, WA, Nashville, TN, and Arlington, VA. Amazon's Housing Equity Fund illustrates how major corporations can collaborate with local governments and help solve the affordable housing crisis that many communities are facing today. Amazon has already put its Housing Equity dollars to work in Arlington, where the corporation is now funding about 18 percent of all multifamily affordable housing in the county.
