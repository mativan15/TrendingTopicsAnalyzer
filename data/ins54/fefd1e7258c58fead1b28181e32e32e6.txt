Oregon got away from its defensive discipline and rebounding last season, so that's the focus of this season's Ducks.'We were a very inconsistent ball team last year,' said coach Dana Altman, who is embarking on his 13th season with the Ducks. 'Part of that was our rebounding and our defense. Our defensive numbers weren't good last year. Our rebounding numbers weren't good last year. And all the nights we didn't shoot it well, it really cost us.'Oregon finished last season 20-15 overall and went 11-9 in Pac-12 play.
