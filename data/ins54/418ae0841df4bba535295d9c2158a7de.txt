ATLANTA — When Eric Goldmann took his first business trip after 15 months of being grounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, the avid road warrior sensed he was getting back to his true self.

Goldmann, who traveled almost weekly in pre-pandemic times for his health care technology sales job, was so pumped for his first in-person customer meeting in June 2021 that as soon as he landed in Jackson, Mississippi, 'I just ran up to the Hertz counter, grabbed the keys, left the airport.'

'I just felt — I felt alive,' Goldmann said.
