Sam Burns won for the third time on the PGA Tour on Sunday at the 2022 Charles Schwab Challenge. His first-place check was good for $1,512,000, bringing his season total to $6,145,981, which moved him to third on the PGA Tour's 2021-22 season money list.

Burns started the final round seven strokes back but tied for low round of the day. He also tied Nick Price, who in 1994 set the mark for the largest final-round comeback by a winner in tournament history.

Burns beat good friend Scottie Scheffler in a playoff but Scheffler still walked away with $915,600, which brings his season total to $11,215,187.
