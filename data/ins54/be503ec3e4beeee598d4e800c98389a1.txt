Two people who scaled the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, causing its closure, are Just Stop Oil supporters, the protest group said.

Police closed the bridge, which connects the M25 between Essex and Kent, after reports of climbers at about 03:50 BST.

Just Stop Oil said it was part of a protest against new government oil and gas licences.

A diversion for traffic was put in place via the Dartford tunnel.

Essex Police said the incident "may take some time to resolve due to the complexities of safely getting people down from height".
