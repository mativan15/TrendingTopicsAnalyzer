The Union Cabinet on economic affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday approved hikes in minimum support prices (MSPs) for rabi or winter-sown crops (2023-24). Wheat is one of the crops planted in winter, and harvested in late spring of the following year, and this year's harvest was affected by extreme weather in March, trimming output, and forcing the government to curb exports. In percentage terms, the government has increased the MSP on wheat by 5.5%, the highest in three years, to ₹ ₹2125 a quintal (100 kg).
