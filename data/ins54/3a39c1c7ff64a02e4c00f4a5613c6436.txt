A meeting between Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu and actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan in Vijayawada on Tuesday set off speculation about a potential realignment of political forces in Andhra Pradesh in the run up to the 2024 assembly elections. Naidu's meeting came a day after Kalyan, who heads the Jana Sena Party, returned from Visakhapatnam where he was reportedly confined to his hotel for nearly 40 hours by police preventing him from meeting party workers or addressing any rallies.
