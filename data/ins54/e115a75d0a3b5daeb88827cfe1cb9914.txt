The Washington Commanders added to their quarterback room this week, signing former Georgia Bulldogs signal caller Jake Fromm to the practice squad.

The Washington Commanders have a new face in the locker room with the quarterbacks.

On Tuesday, the team signed Jake Fromm to the practice squad. Fromm was drafted in the fifth round of the 2020 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Last season, the New York Giants signed him off the Bills' practice squad and he started the final two games of the year for the team with Daniel Jones and Mike Glennon injured.
