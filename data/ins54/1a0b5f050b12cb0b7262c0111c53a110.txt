As we wind down the list of the 2022 undrafted free agent class we turn our attention to Mika Tafua. Tafua was a four-year starter at Utah, and was deployed in a variety of ways for the Utes defense. He spent time as an edge rusher, a 3-technique, a true linebacker, and a stand-up edge rusher.

An older prospect, Tafua is entering the NFL at 25 years old, and turns 26 in his first year after serving his two-year mission. In his final year at Utah, Tafua put together his best year as a player, leading the PAC-12 in both pressures and sacks.
