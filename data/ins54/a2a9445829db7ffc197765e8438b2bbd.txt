Theresa Powell leaned against the fence at Fridley's Commons Park, cherishing a rare chance to watch her grandson play football for Frogtown.

With only a few city recreation centers offering tackle football this season, there is no St. Paul league for city teams. As a result, home games are nearly nonexistent, requiring family members to drive a half-hour or more to see their kids play in suburbs like Blaine, Andover and Rogers.

"It's hard, with the gas and everything," said Powell, who said she never missed a game in the city.
