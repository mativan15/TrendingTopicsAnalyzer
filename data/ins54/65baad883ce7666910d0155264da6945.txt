The biggest game of the season so far takes place in NFL Week 6 and it could go a long way in deciding who enters the playoffs with home-field advantage in the AFC as the top two teams in the Super Bowl odds face off at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.

The Bills will be looking to make up for their wild loss in the divisional round last season and they come into this one after a dominating 38-3 win against the Steelers last weekend.
