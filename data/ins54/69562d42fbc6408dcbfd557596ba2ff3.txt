Jun. 3—SOUTHERN INDIANA — Area nonprofits are noticing an uptick in the call for services, especially for people experiencing homelessness or those with unstable housing.

"(At) Haven House our biggest need is affordable housing, we are working with about 35 families right now in a local hotel, and that's not counting the people not in a hotel we are working with," said Haven House Services Director Barbara Anderson.

In total, Anderson said, Haven House is working with 105 families.

Based in Jeffersonville, Haven House provides services to people in need.
