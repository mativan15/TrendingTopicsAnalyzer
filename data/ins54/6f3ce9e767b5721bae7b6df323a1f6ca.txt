Former President Barack Obama took a shot and cancel culture and knocked 'buzzkill' Democrats for getting caught up in 'policy gobbledygook.' 
In a new interview with on the 'Pod Save America' podcast on Friday, the 44th President said that Democrats have strayed away from a message of equality to 'scolding' on social issues.
'My family, my kids, work that gives me satisfaction, having fun,' Obama said. 'Hell, not being a buzzkill. And sometimes Democrats are.'
'Sometimes people just want to not feel as if they are walking on eggshells, and they want some acknowledgment that life is messy and that all of us, at any given moment, can say things the wrong way, make mistakes,' he added.
