When I find a game I love, it's hard to pry myself away. That said, it's also hard for me to set aside time to kick back and sink a few hours into gaming when I have chores to do, dogs to walk, and appointments to stop running late to. As a result, I typically don't game very much when I'm at home. And as much as I love my Switch, it's simply too bulky to fit into most of the bags I take with me when I leave my apartment, so it ends up collecting dust in its dock until I have some time to sit on the couch and play a game or two.
