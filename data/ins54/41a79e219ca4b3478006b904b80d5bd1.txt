Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Ryan clashed over abortion, guns, immigration, Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a raw and sometimes personal debate Monday that could decide who wins Ohio and - with it - which party wins control of the U.S. Senate.Denouncing Ryan for his support of Trump, Ryan used their second debate to cast Vance as a carpetbagging venture capitalist who wants to prohibit abortions, close the border, and is generally "too extreme" for Ohio."I'm running to represent the exhausted majority: Democrats, Republicans, and independents," Ryan said.
