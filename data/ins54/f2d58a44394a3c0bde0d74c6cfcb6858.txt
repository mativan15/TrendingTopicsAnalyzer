I had always said I was going to retire when I was 50. I had worked and saved since I was 16. Retiring without Medicare and Social Security is a scary thing. I wound up retiring then going back to work. At 53, I took a part-time job with a decent salary for the hours but I was sooooo bored. And then life rang my bell.  I had major medical problems. So major that when I was able to return to work they let me go because they didn't think I could keep up with the workflow. They were probably right. Nobody else felt comfortable enough with my health issues to hire me.
