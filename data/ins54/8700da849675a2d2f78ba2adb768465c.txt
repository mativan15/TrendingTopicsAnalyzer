Indoor training is a great way to improve your fitness. By removing both bad weather and traffic from the equation it allows you to focus on the session with little or no distraction.

Fitting it around a busy schedule is easy too. You can essentially train night or day, and if even you're short on time a 30-minute cycling workout at a high intensity will pay dividends.

Indoor cycling also ideal for those new to cycling, allowing you to get used to efforts out of the saddle, clipping in and out of the pedals, and generally becoming at one with your bike, all from the safety of your home.
