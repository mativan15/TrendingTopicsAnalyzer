Tokyo shares closed higher Wednesday after robust US corporate earnings and rising Wall Street futures helped cheer investors. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 0.37 percent, or 101.24 points, to end at 27,257.38, while the broader Topix index edged up 0.19 percent, or 3.62 points, to 1,905.06. Traders were also monitoring the yen as it sits around levels last seen in 1990 and edges towards 150 per dollar, with finance minister Shunichi Suzuki saying "we'll respond appropriately against excessive moves".
