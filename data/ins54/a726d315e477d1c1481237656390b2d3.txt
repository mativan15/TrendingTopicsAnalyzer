Last year, Sarah Mensah made history by becoming the first Black woman vice president at Nike North America, the apparel giant's biggest geographical location.

Mensah told Footwear News (FN) that her appointment shows the brand's commitment to diversity and elevating women. The Oregon University alum added the appointment is something she takes seriously.

'It's important to me personally and to our athletes, our employees, our consumers. We talk a lot about listening to them, and the best way to listen is to reflect them,' Mensah said.
