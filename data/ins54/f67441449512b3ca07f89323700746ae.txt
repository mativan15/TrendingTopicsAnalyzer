PDC Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCE) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, PDC Energy investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of June.
