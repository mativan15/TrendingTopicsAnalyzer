(RTTNews) - European stocks are seen opening slightly lower on Friday after the previous session's strong rally. The U.S. dollar sank to a one-month low versus major peers as investors reduced their expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. As U.S. inflation expectations fall, it is believed the Fed might slow or even pause its tightening cycle in the second half of the year. Bond yields held broadly steady and gold edged up as investors await a report on U.S. personal income and spending that includes a reading on inflation said to be preferred by the Federal Reserve.
