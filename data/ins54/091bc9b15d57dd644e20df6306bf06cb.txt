LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Liz Truss told her cabinet team of top ministers on Tuesday she wanted to level with the public that times would be tough, but she could put Britain on a stronger path.

"The prime minister said she wanted to be honest with the public that times would be tough but by addressing long-standing issues now, we can put the country on a stronger path for the future," her spokesperson quoted her as telling ministers a day after her new finance minister ripped up most of her economic growth plan.
