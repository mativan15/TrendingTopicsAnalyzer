While it's good for the Cardinals, who welcomed him with open arms, it begs the question of his future with the organization. If they don't compensate him now and he has an MVP type season, it will cost them a lot more than he's currently asking. But if they pay him now and he doesn't improve, they will be saddled with a huge contract and a lame duck QB.
