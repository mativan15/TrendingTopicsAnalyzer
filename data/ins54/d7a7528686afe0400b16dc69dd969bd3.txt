New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is to fast-track on Monday new Budget measures to seek to end the economic turmoil in Britain.

He was due to make an emergency statement on his tax and spend plans at 11am, before addressing the Commons at 3.30pm.

The announcement was made before markets opened in the morning after the mayhem sparked by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini budget on September 23.

The Chancellor briefed Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey on his plans on Sunday night.
