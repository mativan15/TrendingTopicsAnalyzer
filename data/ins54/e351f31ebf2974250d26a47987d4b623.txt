(RTTNews) - Russia's manufacturing activity expanded at a marginal pace in May on improved demand conditions and easing price pressures amid sanctions and logistics delays, survey data from S&P Global showed on Wednesday. The S&P Global Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 50.8 in May from 48.2 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while any reading below suggests contraction in the sector. Although sanctions continued to reduce client demand, new orders and output decreased only at a slower pace in May.
