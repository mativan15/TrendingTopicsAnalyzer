New Zealand's youngest mayor-elect's mother was involved in a lengthy employment matter with the council he will lead. Ben Bell's mother, Rebecca Tayler, was employed as the council's general manager, regulatory and community services on October 5, 2020. She said her role was disestablished on April 14, 2022. She said she was then engaged for some short-term project work for the council until July 30, 2022, before moving on to other opportunities. On legal advice both Tayler and the Gore District Council are not commenting on what the matter was over, or how it was resolved.
