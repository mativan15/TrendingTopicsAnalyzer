Arcimoto says it cut $20 million in annual spending with its recently announced restructuring, which included layoffs and furloughs at the Eugene electric vehicle maker.

That's twice what one analyst had figured. But the spending reductions, along with possible new financing initiatives, haven't turned around a sinking stock (Nasdaq: FUV), and the company said before markets opened Thursday that it would 'explore all strategic alternatives.'

Last on a list of 'four key actions to maximize value,' it was the first overt signal by Arcimoto of an openness to a sale or merger.
