Brandon Bell Thesis We urged investors in our previous article in August to use the rally to cut more exposure in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock, even as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett went on the offensive as it added more shares. Accordingly, OXY fell nearly 20% from its August highs to its September lows. However, OXY buyers stepped in to support the stock as OPEC+ went on the offensive against the oil bears by aiming to cut 2M barrels a day in production. However, we urge investors to be wary of the actual output cut, as the curtailment could be just 10% of the announced reduction.
