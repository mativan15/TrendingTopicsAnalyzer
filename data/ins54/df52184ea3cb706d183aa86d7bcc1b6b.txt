The Carolina Panthers kicked an 'upset' Robbie Anderson off the field during Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams after the wide receiver got into verbal altercations with an assistant coach. Anderson was sent to the locker room by interim coach Steve Wilks in the fourth quarter of a 24-10 road loss. Anderson, who did not have a pass target in the game, had been jawing with wide receivers coach Joe Dailey.

'I've never been told, in X amount of years, to get out of the game in the fourth quarter, so I was honestly confused and upset by that, as I should be,' Anderson told reporters after the game.
