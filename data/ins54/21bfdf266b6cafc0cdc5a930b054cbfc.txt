 The Edmonton Elks on Monday announced quarterback Taylor Cornelius will be out of action Friday night when the team hosts the B.C. Lions in the regular season finale on The Brick Field at Commonwealth Stadium.
Cornelius was admitted to hospital because of an injured spleen after the Elks 28-23 loss to the Toronto Argonauts on Saturday.He was still hospitalized as of Monday but the team said he's expected to make a full recovery.The #Elks are not on the field until tomorrow but I would expect to see Tre Ford start at QB.
