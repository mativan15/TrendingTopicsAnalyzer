Meghan Markle opened up about her return to Hollywood, revealing in a new interview she never thought she'd be back after leaving Suits in 2018 to go marry Prince Harry.

"I didn't think I'd ever be in the entertainment industry again," Markle explained to Variety.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they would be stepping down as senior members of the royal family in Jan. 2020. Although they eventually landed in Montecito, Calif., about two hours north of Los Angeles, the couple quickly jumped into the entertainment business.
