Israel has slammed Australia's 'wretched' decision to reverse its recognition of West Jerusalem as the country's capital, while Palestinian terror group Hamas described it as 'a step in the right direction'.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong announced the move on Tuesday, saying the city's status should be decided by Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, unwinding a contentious decision by the previous conservative government.

In 2018, Prime Minister Scott Morrison followed US President Donald Trump's lead in unilaterally recognising West Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
