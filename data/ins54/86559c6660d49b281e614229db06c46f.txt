Hundreds of Metropolitan Police officers deserve to be sacked, commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has admitted, after a review of culture and standards found Britain's biggest police force is allowing criminals and serial rule-breakers to keep their jobs.A long-awaited report laid bare the Met's failure to root out officers facing serious misconduct allegations, including those of sexual assault and discrimination, and exposed racism and misogyny in the force's internal disciplinary system.Baroness Louise Casey, the report's author, said the Met's misconduct system 'is not fit for purpose', with a low number of dismissals causing frustration among staff and contributing to public mistrust of the force.
