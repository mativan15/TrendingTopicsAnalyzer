Apple App Store is showing signs of slowing growth, which could hurt the stock in the near future, Morgan Stanley said. "While we are bullish on the longer-term App Store and Services outlook, a deceleration in App Store growth (and monetization) could be a near-term headwind to results," wrote analyst Katy Huberty in a note to clients Friday. May App Store revenue growth slowed to 4% year over year compared with 8% growth in April. The bank expects June revenue growth to come in below forecasts but bounce back thereafter.
