(Bloomberg) -- When Congress returns in a few weeks, Republicans and Democrats will be focusing a compromise to extend tax breaks for both low-income children and corporations -- which would hand wins to both parties before year's end but after the critical midterm elections.Any deal would resolve a series of tax issues that each party has tried to address. Republicans have warned about damage to US investment and innovation, while Democrats say they won't vote for any business-tax incentives unless the child-tax credit is also addressed.
