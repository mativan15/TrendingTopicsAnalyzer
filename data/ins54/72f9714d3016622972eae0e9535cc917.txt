The IGN Deals team has always been fans of the LG C1, and based on how many we see in our reporting, so are you. Right now, Best Buy has the best deal going on the 65" LG C1 OLED, beating Amazon and Walmart's prices by almost $100.

This is one of the most popular TVs we see in the deal world, and every time it goes on sale it generates some good buzz. Best Buy having the lowest price right now is also notable, not because Best Buy doesn't have lots of sales, but because Amazon almost always either price-matches or beats them.
