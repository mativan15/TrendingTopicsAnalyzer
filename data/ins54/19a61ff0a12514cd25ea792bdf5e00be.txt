Published: 17:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 | Updated: 17:09 EDT, 21 October 2022 The high-scoring Pittsburgh Penguins will hit the road Saturday for a Metropolitan Division matchup with the host Columbus Blue Jackets, who have begun to find a nail-biting way to win games. Pittsburgh is averaging five goals through its first four games, with scoring coming not only from its big names but also from depth players. "Our guys are finishing," coach Mike Sullivan said. "They're creating opportunities." As an example, in the Penguins' 6-1 win Thursday against the Los Angeles Kings, 13 players registered at least one point.
