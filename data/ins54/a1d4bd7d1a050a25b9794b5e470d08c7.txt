A processing error by BNZ meant 'multiple transactions' were deducted incorrectly from some cardholders' accounts earlier this week. A BNZ spokesperson said a processing error on Wednesday afternoon resulted in multiple transactions being deducted from some debit and credit cardholder accounts, affecting both BNZ and non BNZ cardholders. 'The issue was caused by a systems error and is not a data or privacy breach,' she said. 2degrees customer Russell Bowden said two payments of $81.40 had been taken out of his account without authorisation.
