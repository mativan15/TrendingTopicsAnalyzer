matt_benoit/iStock via Getty Images Investment Thesis Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance (Nasdaq: NASDAQ:REFI) is a mortgage REIT that lends to state-licensed operators in the cannabis industry. On a valuation basis, REFI is trading at 1.1x P/B and yields 9%, which is not terribly attractive. On a more concerning note, the legal environment provides no margin of safety for cannabis investors, as REFI is not allowed to take title to the underlying real estate while it is being used to conduct cannabis-related activities.
