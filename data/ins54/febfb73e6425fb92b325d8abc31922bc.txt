May 28—As American as apple pie and baseball, the drive-in movie theatre offers up the classic experience of a film under the stars, and there is an authentic 1950s drive-in just 15 minutes from downtown Owensboro.

Originally opened in 1955, Holiday Drive-In Theatre, 646, Indiana 161, is less than 10 miles from the city, and a quick drive across the Blue Bridge has movie goers pulling up to one of its six movie screens.

Operator Tim Moseley said the drive-in was purchased by his father in 1978 after it had closed.
