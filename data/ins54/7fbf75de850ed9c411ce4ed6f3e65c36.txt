Hooghly: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday inaugurated a rail over bridge at Kamarkundu in Hooghly district, in the process deepening the spat between Trinamool and BJP.The incident triggered a war of words between the Trinamool and the BJP, with the opposition BJP pointing out that she had not invited any representative of Indian Railways which shared the cost of the bridge, and the Trinamool countering that the Central Government too had ignored West Bengal representations at inauguration of projects which were funded by both.
