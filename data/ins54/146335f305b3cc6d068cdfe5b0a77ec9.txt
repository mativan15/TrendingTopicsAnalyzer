The Japanese currency yen is weakening against the dollar to levels not seen in decades, and the government has once again reiterated its stance on the issue. On Wednesday, the yen is being traded for the dollar at the upper-148 to lower-149 level. It is edging closer to the 150 level that analysts say is psychologically significant, and might prompt Japanese authorities to conduct another currency intervention. Japanese Finance Minister Suzuki Shunichi said wild fluctuations in the yen's value triggered by speculation are unacceptable.
