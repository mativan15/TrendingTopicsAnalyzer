Absconding IPS officer Manilal Patidar, wanted in connection with the death of a 44-year-old Mahoba businessman, has been booked in a case of corruption and cheating.
In June last year, the UP government announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh on the former Mahoba Superintendent of Police.
'Manilal Patidar and a few other policemen have been booked for cheating and charged for disobeying law with intent to cause injury to any person. They have also been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The case was lodged on May 30 after getting sanction from the government,' a senior officer of the Vigilance Department said.
