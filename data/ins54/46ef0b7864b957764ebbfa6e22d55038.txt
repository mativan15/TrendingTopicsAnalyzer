KEIR Starmer has demanded an immediate general election to throw out a Tory government that has reached 'a new chaotic low' with its 'pathetic squabbles'.

The UK Labour leader said the choice for voters was 'now as stark as it gets'.

It came as more Tory peers and MPs, including the former Brexit minister Lord Frost, called on Liz Truss to quit over the dysfunctional nature of her administration and reversals on policy.
