The Utah Senate race between conservative Republican Sen. Mike Lee and Independent Evan McMullin has emerged as a potential wild card in the battle for the Senate.

Recent polls show the race is close, with McMullin trailing Lee by only a few points in a state where Republican victories are usually all but guaranteed.

Lee, a conservative who supported then-President Trump's effort to challenge the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, is a star among many members of Utah's Republican base, but his unpopularity among moderates and Democrats has driven his approval rating down to the low 40s.
