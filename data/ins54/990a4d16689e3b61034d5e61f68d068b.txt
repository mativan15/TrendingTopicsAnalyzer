The Saudi-backed rebel golf league will announce Aston Martin as a major sponsor when Dustin Johnson and Co tee off at its first event next week.
A partnership with a marquee brand had been identified as a major priority for LIV Golf organisers after months of controversy over its funding from the Gulf state.
Aston Martin's backing for the breakaway competition is seen by insiders as "returning the favour" after Saudi Arabian company Aramco became a leading sponsor for the Formula One team.
The state-owned oil and gas company has been on Aston Martin F1 livery since the start of the season, and it emerged this week it has an option to obtain a 10 percent stake in the team.
