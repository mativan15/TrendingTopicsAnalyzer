"Quite scary." "Fed up." "Just unbelievable, really." That's how Britons describe their attitudes towards the country's head-spinning political changes, a day after Britain's shortest-serving prime minister resigned. "It just feels so confusing," Louise Barclay, who works in finance, said outside the London Bridge subway station. "We've always felt like we had a kind of stable system, and the last few months have been absolutely crazy." Many Friday-morning commuters appeared to be grappling with the thought that they were living with a more shambolic political landscape than they believed existed, a little over a month since the death of Britain's longest-serving monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.
