The stock market has many investors feeling nervous about the future, as the S&P 500 recently dipped into bear market territory for the first time since 2020. In fact, nearly 40% of investors say they have pulled money out of the stock market as a result of the volatility, according to a recent survey from MagnifyMoney. It's an intimidating time to be investing, and you're not alone if you're unsure about whether or not to continue putting money in the stock market.
