Nicola Sturgeon has said that the prime minister's failure to resign is a sign of 'how badly broken UK politics is' as a senior Scottish Tory MSP joined the chorus calling for Liz Truss to go.Before announcing fresh economic plans for an independent Scotland, the first minister said it was an understatement to say that the UK government and prime minister were operating 'without a shred of credibility'.'Indeed, it is perhaps a sign of how badly broken UK politics is that the prime minister's resignation has not already been tendered,' she said.
