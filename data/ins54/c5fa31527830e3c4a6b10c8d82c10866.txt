The San Jose Sharks are going into this weekend's games against the New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers with something they've lacked for most of the season: confidence.
Maybe that was the missing ingredient all along.
Sharks coach David Quinn stressed to his players prior to their game with the New York Rangers on Thursday that they weren't as bad as their winless record indicated, and that he and his staff still believed in them.
But Quinn also knew the Sharks were in desperate need of some positive reinforcement, as the five straight losses to begin the season was starting to have an effect on the player's psyche.
