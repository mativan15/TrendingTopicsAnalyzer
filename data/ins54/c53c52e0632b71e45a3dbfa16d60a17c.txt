It's the moment investors in Novavax (NVAX -3.05%) have been waiting for. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee will meet next week to discuss the possible authorization of the company's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Novavax originally aimed to file for authorization in the first half of last year, but the company struggled with manufacturing issues, which held up its filing.
Meanwhile, Novavax's once market-beating shares sank. They climbed more than 3,400% over the past two years through December.
