ABU DHABI – Muhammad Mokaev doesn't intend on wasting anytime at UFC 280 – or after.
Mokaev (7-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) takes on Malcolm Gordon (14-5 MMA, 2-2 UFC) on Saturday at Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. The main card airs on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPNews and ESPN+.
With a goal to become the youngest UFC champion in history, 22-year-old Mokaev is eager to enter the rankings, but is having a hard time getting people to accept fights.
'When I beat Malcolm Gordon, people will say, ‘You're still beating cans,'' Mokaev told MMA Junkie.
