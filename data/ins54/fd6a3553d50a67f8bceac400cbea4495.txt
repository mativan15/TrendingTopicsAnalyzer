Myles Turner has not appeared in a game for Indiana since Jan. 17.
Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner will have to wait even longer to make his season debut after missing the team's season opener on Wednesday.
Per multiple reports, Turner will be out at least one week after suffering an ankle injury when he landed on a ball boy under the rim while warming up at Gainbridge Fieldhouse to play the Washington Wizards. Indiana lost the game 114-107 and third-year center Jalen Smith got the start instead.
