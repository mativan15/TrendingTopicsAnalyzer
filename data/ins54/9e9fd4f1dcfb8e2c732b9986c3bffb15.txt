Boris Johnson said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to help Kyiv's embattled forces prevent Russian invaders from gaining ground in the Donbas.But the prime minister stopped short of committing the UK to sending the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks.Johnson said the MLRS would enable Ukraine 'to defend themselves against this very brutal Russian artillery, and that's where the world needs to go', in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
