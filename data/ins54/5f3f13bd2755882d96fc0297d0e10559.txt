ANIStubble burning continues in PunjabBarely one-third of the crop residue management machines deployed by Punjab government to discourage farmers from burning stubble have been used. As farmers harvest paddy and ready their fields for rabi crops, Punjab government has prepared an intensive month-long action plan to prevent stubble burning, which contributes to pollution in northern India. At the core of the action plan is behavioural change of Punjab farmers who have been shunning mechanisation of harvesting and crop residue management.
