The Ravens are touchdown favorites over the visiting Cleveland Browns ahead of their matchup Sunday, according to Las Vegas sportsbooks.

After a 24-20 loss Sunday to the New York Giants that dropped them into a tie for first place in the AFC North, the Ravens (3-3) are 6 1/2-point favorites in Week 7. Cleveland (2-4) has dropped three straight games, most recently a 38-15 blowout loss to the New England Patriots.

The Ravens have been touchdown favorites only once this season, in their season opener against the New York Jets, who were 6 1/2-point underdogs.
