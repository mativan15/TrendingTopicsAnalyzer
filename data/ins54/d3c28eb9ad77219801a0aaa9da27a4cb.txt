PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The November general election is just over three weeks away, and it's pretty hard to miss that major offices are on the ballot this year.As KDKA-TV political editor Jon Delano explains, it's not too late to register to vote or even to vote by mail.You can't turn on the television without seeing dozens of ads for governor, senator, member of Congress or state legislature.  If you are just now feeling the need to register to vote, there's still time, says David Voye, Allegheny County elections manager.
