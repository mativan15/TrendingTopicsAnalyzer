Benchmark indices Nifty 50 and Sensex can test 20,000 and 75000 points, respectively by the next Diwali, if global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions do not get worse and spoil the momentum, said Anmol Das, smallcase manager and head of research, TejiMandi Investment Technologies. This upmove in the indices will be led by strong earnings growth of companies in the second half of 2022-23 (April-March) and FY24, Das said in an interview to ETMarkets. Private sector lender , quick service restaurants operator , and Royal Enfield-owner are among the five high conviction stocks for TejiMandi Investment, a subsidiary of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, over the next one year.
