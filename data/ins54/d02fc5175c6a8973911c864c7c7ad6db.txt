President Biden's three-point plan for fighting inflation relies almost entirely on actions from Congress and the Federal Reserve, revealing limits on what he can do on the issue from the White House. Inflation in the U.S. hit a 40-year high in March and remains oppressively high, raising prices for everyday goods like food and gas. The issue is front-of-mind for millions of American voters heading into the midterm elections, and Biden unveiled his plan to rein it in on Monday.The plan opens by placing the inflation issue at the feet of the Federal Reserve, with Biden stating he has no plans to weigh in on the agency's policy decisions.
