The NFL's Thanksgiving weekend is getting a little longer. Starting in 2023, the league will add a game on the day after Thanksgiving that will stream on Amazon's Prime Video, thus drawing millions of viewers into the e-commerce giant's realm on the biggest shopping day of the year. The deal, rumored for some time, adds another NFL window for the streamer, which took over the Thursday Night Football franchise this year. 'Thanksgiving is synonymous with football, and we're excited to give our fans another day of NFL action during this holiday weekend,' said Hans Schroeder, COO of NFL Media.
