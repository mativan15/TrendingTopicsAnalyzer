A mum died after she was struck by lightning in an ‘unusual and desperately sad case', an inquest has heard.
Daniella DiMambro was on holiday with her children in Croatia when tragedy struck.
A freak lightning strike is said to have entered through her right ear.
It caused catastrophic injuries and Ms DiMambro suffered an ‘out of hospital cardiac arrest'.
A bystander desperately tried to carry out CPR, but the 48-year-old still suffered hypoxic brain injuries.
She was rushed into an intensive care unit in hospital and was later repatriated to the UK.
