Weeks after a judge denied her request to have the charges against her dropped, lawyers for Democratic Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby are trying again to have her perjury charges dismissed.

In court papers filed late Wednesday evening, Mosby's lawyers asked U.S. District Court Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby to allow them to present new arguments for her charges to be dismissed, after Griggsby rejected their original attempt.

'It is not an effort to surprise or sandbag the government or the Court, and it is not a second bite at the apple,' Mosby's lawyers wrote.
