4:39 PM ETEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New York Giants wide receiver Kadarius Toney remains sidelined with a second hamstring injury he says occurred several weeks back while running."When you go hard, stuff happens," said Toney, who has missed the past four games. He's almost certainly going to miss Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars after sitting out the first two practices of this week.Toney originally injured his right hamstring during training camp. He tweaked that same hamstring in a Week 2 win over the Carolina Panthers.
