Buy the Bowflex SelectTech 552 adjustable dumbbell and you can say goodbye to cluttered workout spaces. This nifty customer crams 15 pairs of free weights into one compact package measuring just 15.8in by 8in when fully loaded. So, you can enjoy all the training benefits of a dumbbell rack without sacrificing a significant section of your spare room or home gym. The space-saving dumbbells come in a holding dock and feature dials on either end that, when turned to your weight of choice, automatically attach the relevant plates.
