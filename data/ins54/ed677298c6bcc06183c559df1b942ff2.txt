Hotel credit cards can help ease the strain of rising travel costs on your budget. As with airline credit cards, hotel credit cards are typically a co-branded venture between a major credit card issuer and hospitality brand, like Hilton or Marriott hotels. These cards offer travel-friendly rewards programs with extra benefits themed around staying at eligible in-brand hotels. There are also general travel credit cards that allow for less brand-loyalty and more general perks.Whether you're vacationing, exploring or traveling for business, these cards can help make your stays more comfortable.
