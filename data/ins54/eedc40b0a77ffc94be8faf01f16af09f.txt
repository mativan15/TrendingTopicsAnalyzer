 MILWAUKEE — Joe Musgrove of the San Diego Padres lost his bid for another no-hitter with two outs in the eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers. Kolten Wong hit a double that short-hopped the wall in right field to break up Musgrove's try. Musgrove has thrown the only no-hitter in Padres history. It came in a 3-0 victory over the Texas Rangers on April 9, 2021. After Wong's double, Musgrove stayed in and got the last out in the eighth with his career-high 114th pitch.
