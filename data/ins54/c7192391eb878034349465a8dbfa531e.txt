Yachtsman Sir Russell Coutts claims his SailGP competition will bring more economic benefits to New Zealand than the America's Cup and an industry will form around it. He made the comment at the launch of a new design and manufacturing company, headquartered in Warkworth north of Auckland, which will employ around 60 people locally and 400 globally. Coutts said for his team of engineers, the launch marked a move away from the 'secretive and inward looking' days of competing in the America's Cup as Oracle Team USA.
