Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday kicked off the distribution of PMJAY cards to 50 lakh eligible beneficiaries who remain to be covered in Gujarat and said that his government has changed the ritual of merely launching schemes and has gone a step further going door-to-door to find eligible beneficiaries.
Addressing an event organised at GMERS Gandhinagar through video-conference, PM Modi said, 'Today's programme is a testimony to the amazing results that can be achieved with a politically stable government… Many governments have come before but after announcing a scheme, they would light a lamp, cut the ribbon, address a speech and finish it… We have changed this ritual… The government goes door-to-door, looks for eligible beneficiaries, reaches out to them.
