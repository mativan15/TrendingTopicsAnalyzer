Indiewire 'La Dolce Vita' inspired a sweet flash mob performance of the iconic film score in Rome.Composer Nino Rota crafted the soundtrack to Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning 1960 classic about a tabloid journalist (Marcello Mastroianni) who searches for the beauty of Rome over the course of a week. The soundtrack is getting a re-release via record label Cam Sugar, and led to an impromptu performance of select 'Dolce Vita' songs in front of the iconic Trevi Fountain in Rome.
