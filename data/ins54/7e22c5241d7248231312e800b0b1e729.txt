Dwayne Johnson has unveiled his singing talents in a duet with Kelly Clarkson and we're seriously impressed.
As well as taking time out of his busy schedule to offer Alison Hammond a sweet tribute, the Rock appeared on the Stronger singer's eponymous talk show to promote his upcoming superhero flick, Black Adam, but had another surprise in store for viewers.
During the episode, the pair performed a frankly incredible rendition of Loretta Lynn's Don't Come Home a Drinkin', leaving fans calling out for an album.
