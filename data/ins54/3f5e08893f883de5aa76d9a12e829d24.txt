Donald Trump's media company plans to launch a subscription-streaming service stocked with a range of right-wing content — including 'shows that embrace the Second Amendment' and 'Trump-specific programming' — a Netflix-style offering squarely pitched at his MAGA followers. The new programming focus for Trump's prospective subscription VOD service was outlined Friday in a regulatory filing by Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that intends to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group.
