RomanOkopny/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) $44 billion sale to Elon Musk is said to have drawn the interest of regulators on potential national security concerns due to some foreign investor involvement. Some of the foreign backers of the proposed Twitter (TWTR) deal have drawn interest from The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, according to an earlier report in the Washington Post on Wednesday, which cited people briefed on the inquiry. Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al Saud agreed to roll his stake in Twitter (TWTR) into Musk's purchase, Alwaleed confirmed earlier last month.
