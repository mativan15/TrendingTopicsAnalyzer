FLUSHING, New York — At the NYC Franklin Open over Memorial Day weekend, the Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP) served up big prizes and garnered even more excitement for the fast-growing sport.

The five-day tournament held at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens was one of the stops on the APP 2022 tour that consists of 32 tournaments. The tour draws an average of 800 players in each tournament, spans five countries, and is offering a total of $2 million in prizes.

'What an honor what a thrill to be here, kind of building that bridge between tennis and pickleball,' APP Tour CEO and Founder Ken Hermann told Yahoo Finance at the NYC Open.
