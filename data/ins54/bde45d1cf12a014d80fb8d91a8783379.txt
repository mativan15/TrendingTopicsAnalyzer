Leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase is 'tremendously overvalued' at current levels, warned short-selling legend Jim Chanos, predicting a collapse in fee income that will send the stock plunging.

He told the Crypto Critics Corner podcast that Coinbase still gorges itself on overly favorable retail trading commissions, and his short position is based on an end to the 'feasting' it enjoys relative to mature brokers like Charles Schwab.

'Coinbase was not a call on crypto prices,' Chanos said in a podcast published on Sunday.
