More Video Subrat Patnaik, Bloomberg News (Bloomberg) -- Roblox Corp. shares surged as much as 21%, their biggest jump in five months, after the video game platform forecasts Monday a significant jump in September bookings as users spent more time on its games. Bookings are expected to be $212 million and $219 million, up as much as 15% from a year earlier, the San Mateo, California-based company said. That figure includes revenue, deferred revenue and other adjustments, and defied a stronger US dollar that dampened results from outside the country.
