Los Angeles City Hall has lurched from scandal to scandal in recent years. If there's any good news to come from this bad situation, it may be that there's finally serious momentum to reform city government.

In the last couple of years, three councilmembers — Jose Huizar, Mitch Englander and Mark Ridley-Thomas — have been indicted in corruption investigations. The former general manager of the Department of Water and Power pleaded guilty to accepting bribes. Mayor Eric Garcetti's bodyguard sued the city, alleging that he was sexually harassed by Garcetti's top aide and that the mayor did not intervene.
