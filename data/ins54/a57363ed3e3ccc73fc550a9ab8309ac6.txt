Mysuru: Exhorting JD(S) cadre to work harder to help the party increase its tally in the 2023 assembly elections, former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Thursday said that neither the Congress nor the BJP was criticising the regional unit since leaders of both parties believed they would need to lean on the JD(S) to form the government in Karnataka. Kumaraswamy attributed the silence of both the parties to their belief of Karnataka heading towards a hung assembly following the elections next year.
