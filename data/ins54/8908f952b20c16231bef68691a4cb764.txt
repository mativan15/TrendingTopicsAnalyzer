Kampala, Uganda — 
A court in Uganda has given a lifetime prison sentence to a man convicted of illegally trafficking wildlife products, but the verdict leaves wildlife officials and human rights activists at odds over whether it fits the crime. 
On Thursday, Oct. 20, the Ugandan Standards, Utilities, and Wildlife Court sentenced Pascal Ochiba to life in prison for illegal possession of wildlife products, including two pieces of elephant ivory weighing a total of 9.55 kilograms. 
It is the country's highest punishment ever for wildlife violations.
