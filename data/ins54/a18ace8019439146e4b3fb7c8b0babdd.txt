Sheryl Sandberg, the woman dubbed Mark Zuckerberg's most valuable friend, has quit her second-in-command role at Facebook owner Meta after 14 years. 
In a post on Facebook, Ms Sandberg said she was stepping down as chief operating officer of the company which she has been credited with transforming from a startup into a multibillion-dollar technology titan. 
Meta's shares slumped by almost 4pc following the announcement. 
Ms Sandberg, who did not provide a reason for quitting, will remain on the board of the company and will be replaced by Javier Olivan, Meta's chief growth officer, in the autumn.
