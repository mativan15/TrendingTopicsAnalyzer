After a long period where almost everyone has been too complacent about inflation, the tide may finally be about to turn. Inflation is now set to peak sooner and fall faster than many expect – even in ‘Brexit Britain'.
Admittedly, this is partly a reflection of just how far inflation has already risen. The headline measure of UK consumer price inflation hit 9pc in April. It is widely predicted to climb even further in the autumn, when the Ofgem price cap on domestic energy bills is updated. The alternative RPI measure is already above 11pc.
