PHOENIX —

The federal government is demanding that Arizona remove double-stacked shipping containers placed to fill gaps in the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, saying they are unauthorized and violate U.S. law.

The Cocopah Indian Tribe in southwestern Arizona welcomed the call to take down the containers in the latest rift between the Biden administration and Republican-led border states over how to prevent illegal border crossings.

In a letter last week, the federal Bureau of Reclamation also demanded that no new containers be placed.
