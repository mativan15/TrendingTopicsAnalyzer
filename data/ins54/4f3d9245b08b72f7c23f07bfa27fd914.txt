Anthony Joshua earned just £15,000 for his debut against Emanuele Leo but could now earn £100million for his rematch against Oleksandr Usyk. The British star has reigned as two-time heavyweight champion during his career where he has fought some of the division's leading fighters including Wladimir Klitschko and Dillian Whyte. After winning gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Joshua signed with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing to make his first outing in professional ranks. Joshua earned around 6000 times less for his debut victory over Emnauele Leo than he will earn for his upcoming sequel with Usyk this summer.
