The home secretary has unveiled plans for a major crackdown on climate protesters as she pledged to stop demonstrators holding the public "to ransom". Under the plans, Suella Braverman will give police stronger powers to take a more "proactive" approach when dealing with protests that threaten or cause "serious disruption or a serious adverse impact on public safety".
The tactics have been long favoured by environmental groups, such as Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, who have staged various disruptive demonstrations in recent months.
