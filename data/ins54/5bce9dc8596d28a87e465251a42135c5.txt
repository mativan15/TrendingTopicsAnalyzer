The sky might not be falling yet in the US real estate market, but home values will soon start to, warns a new report from UBS."Prices look overvalued," said Matthias Holzhey, the head of Swiss real estate at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a recent interview with Insider. "They look too high — even compared to prepandemic levels."Holzhey is no stranger to spotting bubbly housing markets. Since 2015, he's authored UBS's annual global real estate bubble index. In this year's report, which came out in October, four of the largest US cities — New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Boston — were firmly entrenched in "overvalued territory" but weren't considered at risk of being bubbles.
