It looks like Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Commercial Metals' shares before the 26th of October in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of November.
