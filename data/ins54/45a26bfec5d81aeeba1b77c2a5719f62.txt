Toshiba Corp. says it has received eight offers to buy out the conglomerate and two proposals for capital and business alliances, as the industrial giant moves a step closer to becoming privately owned.
The Tokyo-based company revealed the number of nonbinding bids received in a statement Thursday, without disclosing the bidders. It will evaluate them and choose one or more to pursue as soon as possible after the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for June 28. This could be due to a conflict with your ad-blocking or security software.
