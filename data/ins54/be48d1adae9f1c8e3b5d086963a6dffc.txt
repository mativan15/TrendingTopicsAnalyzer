Sundry Photography/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered a strong quarter for Q1 of the calendar year 2022, which is actually Q1 of the fiscal year 2023 for the company. Sales, margins, and earnings came in ahead of expectations for the period. Guidance for the next quarter was below Wall Street forecasts. However, this is due to a $500 million cut due to not selling in Russia and the lockdowns in China. Without that cut, revenue guidance would have been above estimates.
