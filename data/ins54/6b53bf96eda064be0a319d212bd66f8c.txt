Amazon is getting into the insurance business by launching a home insurance comparison portal in Britain.
Called Amazon Insurance Store, the service shows shoppers quotes for policies from third-party insurance providers including Ageas and Co-op.
The tech giant has signed up three big-name insurers as it pushes further into financial services across the globe.
Ageas UK, Co-op, and LV= General Insurance, a unit of German insurer Allianz, will provide third-party services initially, Amazon said on Wednesday, and it hopes to add more insurers ‘early next year'.
