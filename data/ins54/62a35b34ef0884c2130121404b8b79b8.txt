Standing in the way of a new footpath skirting Poole harbour is the RNLI's gleaming national hub, where it builds five new lifeboats each year, refits the charity's existing fleet and trains countless volunteers.'It's a shame the path stops dead and people can't walk any further,' says Philip Broadhead, deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) council. Access to water is essential to the charity's twin-hangar complex, so walkers and cyclists will be diverted away from the waterfront for that section of the route.
