 Apple is reportedly pausing production of the iPhone 14 Plus while it works out whether or not there's sufficient demand for the new phone.Unlike the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, which launched alongside the smaller iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini, Apple decided that for the iPhone 14 range bigger is better, and released the iPhone 14 Plus alongside the standard model. This larger version of the latest iPhone doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of the iPhone 14 Pro, but is a more budget-friendly upgrade over the base model.
