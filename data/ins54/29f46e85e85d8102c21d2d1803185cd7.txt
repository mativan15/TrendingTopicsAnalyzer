Jared Derrico, 35, of Boxford, was also sentenced this week to three years probation, ordered to forfeit $315,000, and pay $1.45 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, according to a statement from the US attorney's office in Boston. He may also have to repay some of his customers an amount that has yet to be determined.
