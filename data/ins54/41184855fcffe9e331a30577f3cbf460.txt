Otodus megalodon is an extinct species of mackerel shark that swam the world's oceans during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, some 23–3.6 million years ago. Megalodon could reach sizes of up to some 66 feet in length, more than three times the lengths of the largest great white sharks alive today. Palaeontologists have drawn up many theories as to how megalodon grew to such massive sizes and why it eventually died out — with its diet and dietary competition often being proposed as key factors.In their study, geoscientist Dr Jeremy McCormack of the Goethe University Frankfurt and his colleagues analysed the teeth of modern and fossil shark teeth sampled from across the globe — including both megalodon and modern and ancient great white sharks.
