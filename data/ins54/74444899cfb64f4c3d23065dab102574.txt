UNKNOWN PERSONS made a fake profile of DGP (UT) Praveer Ranjan and attempted to cheat people, urging them to purchase Amazon gift cards on Saturday. DGP Ranjan came to know about the fraud when someone he knows phoned him and informed him about it. Ranjan, a 1993-batch IPS officer of AGMUT cadre, shared the screen-shot of the fake profile on his official Twitter account, alerting people about the same.
The UT Cyber Crime Investigation Cell (CCIC) examined the number and found it registered in Jharkhand.
