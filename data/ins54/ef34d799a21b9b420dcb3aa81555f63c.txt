The biopharmaceutical company said it would move most of the products made or packaged in Oakville to one of its three U.S. sites.
ANIP believes this action will improve profitability and cash flow by $7M-$8M on an annualized basis.
ANI said it will look for potential buyers for the Oakville site.
ANIP stock earlier closed -3.3% at $29.
