The 2022 WWD Apparel and Retail CEO Summit, titled 'An Era of Agility: The Path Ahead,' is set for Oct. 25 and 26 and features a lineup of speakers from retailers, brands, and solution providers who are leaders in innovation and future-ready strategies.

As retailers and brands ready themselves for the peak holiday shopping season, companies are challenged with new consumer demands, a stepped-up competitive landscape, workforce shortages, inflation and a looming recession.
