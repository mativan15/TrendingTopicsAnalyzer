(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan's top financial regulator is moving to strengthen the market's defenses in the face of outflows set to reach the highest level in two decades.'We are at a period of transition, and I believe foreign investors will return to Taiwan's markets eventually,' Huang Tien-mu, chairperson of the Financial Supervisory Commission, said in an interview Wednesday. At the same time, DBS Group Holdings Ltd. is expected to make big investments after completing its deal to buy Citigroup Inc.
