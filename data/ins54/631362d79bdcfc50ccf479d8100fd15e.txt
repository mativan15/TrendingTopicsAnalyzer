A study at the University of Colorado found that going shirtless on Tinder makes women more likely to think you have STDs. Researchers showed over 500 people fake profile pics of a guy named "Noah." Sometimes he had a shirt on, and sometimes he didn't. And when he was shirtless, women AND men were more likely to think he engaged in "risky sexual behavior." The shirtless version was also seen as less competent in general.
