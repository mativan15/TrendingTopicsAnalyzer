When he made Lockport's varsity roster as a junior last season, Zach Skiba found himself separated from his two closest, longtime teammates.

Zach's fellow triplets, Jake and Nick, were on the junior varsity.

'It was a little bit odd,' Zach said. 'I expected them to be on the varsity team, too. It was the first time we haven't been on the same team, so it was different.

'Now we're all back together, so we're having a lot of fun.'

The Skiba triplets are seniors who form nearly a third of the starting lineup.
