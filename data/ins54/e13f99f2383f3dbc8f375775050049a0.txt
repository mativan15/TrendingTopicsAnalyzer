Star Entertainment's Sydney gambling venue is not fit to hold a casino licence, with the gambling giant only starting to remedy its corporate failings, an inquiry has been told.The New South Wales gaming regulator's inquiry has examined claims the ASX-listed Star enabled suspected money laundering, organised crime, fraud and foreign interference at Star Sydney as part of assessing whether the venue should retain its casino licence.The 36-day inquiry was told notorious gang-linked junket operator Suncity ran an illegal cage at the casino, that the venue flouted rules on the use of Chinese debit cards (on which $900m was transacted) and that staff lied to banks and did not do enough in dealings with regulators.
