Oct. 17—At the Saturday morning Aiken County Farmers Market, customers can find NKBJ Microgreens.

Michael and Vicki Simons, husband and wife of 31 years, run the microgreen business together and are there almost every Saturday.

Vicki Simons explained that microgreens are the nutrient-dense seedlings of vegetables and herbs that contain four to 40 times more nutrients than their mature counterparts.

"We say whatever it is you're preparing, you can add a microgreen to it to add color, flavor, nutrients and texture," said Vicki Simons.
