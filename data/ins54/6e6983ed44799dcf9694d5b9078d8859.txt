Voters must choose between a Democratic incumbent or a Republican challenger for the treasurer's office this year, a role that is charged with overseeing the state budget but that has little direct power over the state's monetary policies.

Under the treasurer's purview is the state's investment portfolio, one seat on the Public Employees' Retirement Association board, and the Great Colorado Payback program, which returns publicly held assets to their rightful owners.

Democrat Dave Young and Republican Lang Sias both have experience in the state legislature, but that is where their similarities end.
