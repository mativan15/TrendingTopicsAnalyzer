Congressional Democrats have nearly wrapped up the political circus generally known as the Jan. 6 Committee.
That panel was supposed to look into the allegedly democracy-shaking events of Jan. 6, 2021. Though this has been called an 'insurrection,' it was closer to a campus mob occupying the dean's office than a coup d'etat. 
The actual violence that day pales in comparison to the bloody and fiery riots that raged across American cities in 2020, with approval, tacit and otherwise, from Democratic politicians and media (who described those riots as 'fiery but mostly peaceful').
