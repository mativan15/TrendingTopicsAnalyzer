Cloud services are not meeting expectations, and are adding to complication and cost: More than one third (36%) of enterprises said cloud services adopted in the last three years had not met expectations, while 56% said past cloud decisions had made digital transformation projects more difficult in 2021, and 48% more expensive.
Contributors to overspending: The factors adding to costs included not having enough insight into spend or ways to optimize costs; the need to improve security and compliance functionality; inflexible pricing plans that don't give enterprises what they need in a single package; management tools that don't give the control needed; data not being stored where needed to meet regulatory or performance requirements; and vendor lock-in, meaning enterprises cannot use the specific cloud infrastructure they want.
