A kitchen barge connected to Hong Kong's famed Jumbo Floating Restaurant capsized on Wednesday morning – triggering calls from a group of lawmakers for the government to do more to help the struggling business before it pulls out of the city.

The incident involving the 30-metre barge came barely two days after the restaurant's operator announced it would leave Hong Kong because of a lack of funds for maintenance.

Police said they received a call from a security guard at 11.52pm on Tuesday that the barge attached to the 46-year-old restaurant in Aberdeen was sinking.
