Tess Daly has been left in disbelief as her daughter, Phoebe, has celebrated her 18th birthday.
The Strictly Come Dancing host shares two daughters with presenter Vernon Kay – Phoebe, 18, and Amber 13.
Tess, 53, was unable to contain her excitement as she showered her eldest with love on her special day, but also couldn't believe that she's now all grown up.
Phoebe really is the spitting image of her mum, as seen in a gorgeous snap shared by Tess, showing the teen cuddling their family dog.
‘Where did the time go? Our little Phoebe is 18 today!', Tess wrote alongside the sweet snap.
