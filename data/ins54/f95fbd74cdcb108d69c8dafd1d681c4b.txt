AvigatorPhotographer/iStock via Getty Images In my last article on Danaos Corporation (NYSE:DAC), I explained that after its drop from around $100 to below $85 per share, DAC has turned into a more opportunistic investment. Due to a strong 1Q 2022 financial results, the ending of COVID-19 lockdowns in China, and the company's new developments, I am bullish on DAC in the short term and long term. In the short term, Danaos is well-positioned to benefit from the market condition as the COVID-19 lockdowns in China end.
