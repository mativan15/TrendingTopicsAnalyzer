By Dave Sebastian The parent of Indonesian e-commerce company Blibli said it aims to raise up to $532 million in its trading debut in Jakarta, joining companies that have chosen to go public in this year's rocky market for initial public offerings. PT Global Digital Niaga Tbk, as the company is formally known, is offering up to 17.77 billion shares at 410 Indonesian rupiah (3.0 cents) to IDR460 apiece, according to a prospectus dated Monday. That implies a market capitalization equivalent to $3.16 billion to $3.
