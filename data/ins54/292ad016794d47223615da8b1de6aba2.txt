A consultancy project that tasks students with working on a live business problem has helped a De Montfort University Leicester (DMU) student secure a coveted role at home furnishing giant Dunelm.

Daisy-May Peberdy secured a role as a social media executive at the company, having completed a Business Research Project (BRP) that explored ways that TikTok can be utilised as a business-to-business tool.

The BRP replaces the traditional dissertation and is open to postgraduate marketing courses students, allowing them to work on a live business problem provided to the university by both local and national companies.
