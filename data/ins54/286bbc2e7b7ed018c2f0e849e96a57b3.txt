Boris Johnson is poised to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee with a post-Brexit pledge to bring back pounds and ounces in Britain's shops.Whitehall sources have told Sky News he will announce on Friday that imperial measurements are to be revived as part of a bonfire of EU regulations.
His promise of legislation will be seen as "red meat" designed to appeal to pro-Brexit voters in Red Wall constituencies and older Conservative supporters.But it is likely to be ridiculed by Opposition MPs and denounced as a waste of taxpayers' money.
