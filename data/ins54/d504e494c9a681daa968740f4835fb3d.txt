Ms Smillie said the growth of social media had made it more unpleasant for female broadcasters who are getting older.
She said: 'It's vile that some oik in their bedroom can pass comment on what you're wearing, how old you are, what your weight is, and they didn't like this or they didn't like that.
'It's really nasty and I just don't want to get into that so I came out.'
Cosmetic surgery is ‘terrifying'
Ms Smillie said she had never considered getting cosmetic surgery, but some of her former colleagues had done so, feeling 'pressure' to do it.
