Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Rajkot Mohan Kundariya said on Friday that majority of farmers have sold their wheat crop and therefore the ban on export of the cereal will not affect them.
'90 per cent farmers have sold their wheat and whatever balance is there with traders is coming into the market,'  Kundariya said in response to a question from The Indian Express.
Kundariya was addressing a press conference in Rajkot to mark the eight years of NDA government at the Centre.
The former Union agriculture minister further said that the ban on import was necessitated by the hot weather which reduced production by 60 per cent of initial estimate.
