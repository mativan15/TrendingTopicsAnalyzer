There's an old adage that says, 'You don't choose HBCUs; HBCUs choose you.' For Kennedy Orr, that couldn't have been more true. 'I knew that in my heart I wanted to go to an HBCU,' the 19-year-old says. 'I don't care where it is as long as it's an HBCU.' For Orr, it was simply a matter of selecting the university that could help cultivate her interests.

Born and raised in Chicago, Orr landed on Southern University and A&M College, the largest HBCU in Louisiana where she felt the institution's robust agricultural programs would bolster her purpose.
