The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) announced it was canceling crab seasons in different parts of the state for the 2022/2023 fishing season. The Bering Sea snow crab season, the Bristol Bay red king crab season, the Pribilof District red and blue king crab season, and the Saint Matthew Island blue king crab season have all been closed.
 
The crab's stock has been declared too low for the fisheries to be allowed to open, according to the statements.
 
Snow crab populations in the Bering Sea have been declining for years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
