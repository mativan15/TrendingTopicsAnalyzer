Following controversy in Bihar about a Class 7 English exam presenting Kashmir and India as separate countries, rural development minister Shrawan Kumar said that the matter will be investigated. "... anyone responsible will be punished," he was quoted by news agency ANI. The Nitish Kumar government is facing heat following the incident - which happened in Kishanganj district - after the Bharatiya Janata Party - former allies of the ruling Janata Dal (United) alleged a conspiracy and demanded the union education ministry intervene.
