Bangkok (AP) -- A court in military-ruled Myanmar ruled Tuesday that the last trial for corruption of the country's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi will go ahead after finding that state prosecutors submitted enough evidence to sustain her indictment.

Suu Kyi, who was arrested when the military seized power from her elected government in February last year, has since been charged with a total of 12 counts under the anti-corruption law, each punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a fine. The corruption cases are among several charges pursued by the military against her.
