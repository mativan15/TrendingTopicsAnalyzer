Steve Trimper was Maine's coach in 2014 when he got a call from an old teammate at Eastern Connecticut State, Don Gustafson, to check out a sophomore shortstop at Classical High in Providence.The Black Bears had a game at Holy Cross a few days later and Trimper took a side trip to see Peña play. The game was snowed out, but Trimper decided to stick around.'Missed two days of practice and my players were all mad at me,' he said. 'But I had come that far.'The next day Trimper watched Peña take batting practice and wasn't overly impressed.
