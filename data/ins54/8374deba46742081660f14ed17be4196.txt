By Associated Press Published: 03:24 EDT, 19 October 2022 | Updated: 03:25 EDT, 19 October 2022 LONDON (AP) - U.K. inflation accelerated to a 40-year high in September as the soaring cost of food squeezed household budgets. The consumer price index rose 10.1%, compared with 9.9% the previous month, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday.
