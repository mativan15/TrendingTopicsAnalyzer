Infosec researchers have idenitied a zero-day code execution vulnerability in Microsoft's ubiquitous Office software.
Dubbed "Follina", the vulnerability has been floating around for a while (cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont traced it back to a report made to Microsoft on April 12) and uses Office functionality to retrieve a HTML file which in turn makes use of the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) to run some code.

This is a nice find, looks like an EDR tooling gap from initial tests.
