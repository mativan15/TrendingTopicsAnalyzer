A Tory MP has said his constituents are 'frightened' of Liz Truss's government.

Robert Halfon, a senior backbencher, said the prime minister has 'played into' the Conservative stereotype of being the party for the rich.

It comes amid the ongoing economic turmoil sparked by the prime minister and ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous 'growth plan' announced in the mini-budget only three weeks ago.
