In a win for work-life balance, a new law is now in effect in Ontario that forces many companies to craft policies on employees disconnecting from work after hours. As of June 2, employers in Ontario with 25 or more employees must have a written policy with respect to disconnecting outside business hours. The new law was part of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives' Working for Workers Act, which was passed in late 2021. It's the first law of its kind in Canada. "'Disconnecting from work' means not engaging in work-related communications, including emails, telephone calls, video calls or the sending or reviewing of other messages, so as to be free from the performance of work," the 2021 legislation explained.
