When Xander Bogaerts arrived in spring training, he faced questions about how long he could remain at shortstop — the position he's occupied for the Red Sox since 2014. Bogaerts brushed them aside as he entered his age-29 season.'I'm a shortstop, man,' Bogaerts said then. 'That's where I've played my whole career. Obviously it's a position I take a lot of pride in.'Bogaerts did not merely state his preference, however. When spring training opened following the lockout, he talked with his coaching staff about ways he could improve at the position — taking increased risks to stretch his range — in pursuit of a long-held goal.
