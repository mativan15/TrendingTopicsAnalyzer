Shares of Elastic N.V. (ESTC 17.11%) were up 15% on Thursday as of noon ET. The enterprise software company, which allows companies to search their vast IT ecosystems for relevant data quickly, handily beat expectations on last night's earnings report, while also delivering solid guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.
Elastic's share price had been rocked along with many others in the SaaS sector this year, as inflation and rising interest rates have taken down valuations for virtually all growth stocks.
