HAVANA, Cuba (Reuters) - Cuba´s communist-run government replaced its energy and mines minister with Vicente de la O Levy, head of the state-run electronics company, official media reported on Monday, as the country struggles to contain hours-long blackouts that have stirred rare protests across the island.

The newly appointed O Levy formerly served as director of the National Electric Union, the state´s grid operator, and spent time in Venezuela, a close ally of Cuba, as a delegate from the island´s energy sector.
