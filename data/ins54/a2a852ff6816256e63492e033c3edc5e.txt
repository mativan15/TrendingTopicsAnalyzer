Rishi Sunak has room for up to £30bn of tax cuts in the autumn to alleviate the cost of living crisis, economists said, as the Chancellor comes under pressure from his own party to prove he can do more than just ramp up spending.
Demands are growing for cuts to income tax or VAT to make a large-scale difference to living standards by either leaving more money in workers' pockets or reducing the tax levied on family spending.
Robert Halfon, Conservative MP and campaigner known for successful demands to freeze and then cut fuel duty, welcomed the recent help on bills and said any future tax cuts should help those on low incomes.
