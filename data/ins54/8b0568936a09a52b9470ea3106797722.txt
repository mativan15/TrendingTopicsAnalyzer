Drew Barrymore got candid about her thoughts on intimacy in a new blog post after a fan claimed the actress "hates sex."Barrymore originally commented on the news that Andrew Garfield had abstained from sex for six months while preparing for his role in "Silence.""What's wrong with me that six months doesn't seem like a very long time? I was like, ‘Yeah so?'" the actress said during an episode of her talk show, "The Drew Barrymore Show."Now, Barrymore has clarified that she has not been in an intimate relationship since her split from ex-husband Will Kopelman in 2016.
