Ryan Gobeil's Point Douglas-area hobby supply shop backs on to a dead end near a set of train tracks. Over the last 15 years, it has become a common site for illegal waste dumping. 'Someone will back up a truck and unload anything from household garbage to furniture, bricks, landscaping - anything like that, just as they please,' he said. Robeil said it goes beyond being unsightly or inconvenient. It can be dangerous, too. Hazardous goods like needles can end up by his business, as well. He said the city used to have a security camera set up along the problematic road, which helped catch quite a few offenders over the years, but it has since been taken away.
