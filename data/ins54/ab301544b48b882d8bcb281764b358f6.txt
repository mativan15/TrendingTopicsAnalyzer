NEW YORK — U.S. markets headed lower before Tuesday's opening bell after the European Union agreed to embargo most Russian oil imports by the year's end, sparking a fresh spike in oil prices. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6%, and the S&P 500 ticked down 0.5%. Oil prices, up almost 60% this year, rose another 3% and neared $120 per barrel early Tuesday after the EU said it would embargo most Russian oil imports because of its brutal invasion of Ukraine. The pact was worked out at a summit focused on helping Ukraine with a long-delayed package of new financial support.
