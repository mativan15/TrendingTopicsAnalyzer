A ‘tiny hotel' built by a 25-year-old has made $500,000 (£441,282) in bookings in a single year.Isaac French, a bookkeeper and contractor, co-owns the tiny hotel in Texas, which is made up of seven cabins and opened earlier this year. He began his project after buying a five-acre plot in March 2021, he told Business Insider. French has since created what is now known as Live Oak Lake at the site near the city of Waco in central Texas. Cabins are all between 550 and 650 sq ft, and built in his signature Scandinavian architectural style.
