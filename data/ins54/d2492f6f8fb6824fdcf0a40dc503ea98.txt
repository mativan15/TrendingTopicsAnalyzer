It strikes me, though, that the real reason this isn't officially an 'emergency Budget' is that if it were a bona fide fiscal event the Treasury would have been obliged to produce a lot more detail, explaining precisely where this money will come from.
As it is, Sunak has just 'press released' an additional £15bn in spending – while unveiling only an as-of-yet only very loosely specified windfall tax on the receipts side of the ledger. That's pretty handy, amid the 'partygate' scandal and ahead of a series of tricky by-elections.
