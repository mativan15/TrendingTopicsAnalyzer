An umbrella group of seven extremist outfits has reminded its rival National Socialist Council of Nagalim or NSCN (I-M) that its members are tenants in Nagaland. Hurling the barb hours before the NSCN (I-M) held its ‘national assembly' to discuss the fate of the 'Naga political issue', the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) slammed their rival for sticking to its demand of a separate Naga flag and constitution as part of the final settlement of the peace process.'Nagaland today is a land where tenants, with Government of India's help, dream to be landlords through harassing and brutalising the owners with symbolic tools like integration (of Naga areas), flag, constitution, etc.
