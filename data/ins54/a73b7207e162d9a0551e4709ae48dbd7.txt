Nick Cannon is being very transparent about his past relationship with money early on in his career. The entertainer recently detailed how he blew straight through a hefty check he once received as a gift from Will Smith.

He explained how he went broke even after the veteran actor blessed him with a check in the amount of $200,000 and financial advice.

'Will found me at like 17, and by the time I was 18, the check came in, and at the time, I remember Will had a red Range Rover. And I was like ‘I want a black one,'' Cannon recalled during an appearance on Angela Yee's 'Money Pie' series.
