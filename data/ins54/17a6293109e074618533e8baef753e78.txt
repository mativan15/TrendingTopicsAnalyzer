Tucked away in the Singapore pavilion at gamescom asia is a booth that's not quite like the others.

JoyTact, makers of mobile joystick TactJoy, is the only product booth among the other game developers from Singapore.

Created by inventor Daniel Quek, the mobile controller has already won praise from ​​Frank Keienberg, game lead of Brawl Stars at Supercell Games.

"They are the best and pretty much never break and actually work, especially if you have sweaty thumbs after a while," posted Keienberg on Twitter.
