New research from Magnify Money found that pumpkin spice products this year cost 14% more on average than the regular version of the same products and can go up to a 160% increase based on the type of product. While upcharging customers for seasonal or limited-time products is nothing new for retailers, because the products are all small-ticket items, customers may not even notice the higher cost or are just willing to pay more for a seasonal treat.
