A blood donor clinic in Calgary, on March 27, 2020.Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian PressCanadian Blood Services wants to scrap a lifetime ban on sex workers giving blood in a further move to make blood donation more equitable.The blood-donation service this month recommended to Health Canada that it abolish the lifetime ban on donation by people who have taken money or drugs in exchange for sex.The ban, introduced 45 years ago, is set to be replaced by a one-year 'deferral' after paid sex work.The move follows an end last month to the ban on gay and bisexual men from donating blood, which was welcomed by MPs and LGBTQ advocates.
