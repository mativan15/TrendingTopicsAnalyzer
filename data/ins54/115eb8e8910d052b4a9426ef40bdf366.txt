Even after featuring in two films and serving as an assistant director for four years, Aayush Sharma recently introduced himself as an 'aspiring actor' at the TEDxDYPIT event. He explained the reason behind it and said that instead of an ‘actor' he is often referred to as Salman Khan's brother-in-law and Arpita Khan's husband.
Life was good, he said, when no one cared about his posts on social media, whether they were about the weather in Mumbai or a movie review. But the actor said that everything changed after he got married to Arpita.
