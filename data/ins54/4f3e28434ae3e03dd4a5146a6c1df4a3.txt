We often forget that the word cash is derived from the Sanskrit word "Karshapana". Indians invented the idea of money long ago. Irregularly-shaped copper coins were used by merchants for banking 2,500 years ago, about the time coins began being used in ancient Greece and China. Even before this, Harappans are known to have used cowrie shells as currency for exchange. Across India, we find women from tribal communities still wearing cowrie shells or coins around their neck. The ornaments indicate their use as currencies of exchange for a long time in the past.
