Kolors, a Mexico City-based startup, says its platform that connects intercity bus riders with bus drivers is like 'if Uber and Southwest Airlines had a baby.'
Like Uber and other ride-hailing platforms, Kolors doesn't own any of its own vehicles, but rather partners with small and medium-sized bus operators that are already running scheduled services. And like Southwest and other airlines, passengers are coddled by a bus attendant, a Kolors employee who checks in passengers, accepts payments of cash when needed, and sells snacks and drinks.
