Marcus Lemonis fell in love with Jacksonville years ago. The Ponte Vedra resident chose the First Coast as the primary location to produce season one episodes of his new HGTV series, The Renovator.

The series is not a quantum leap from the entrepreneur's former CNBC show — The Profit — it's a transition that intertwines business and home design to repair chaotic family structure.

From an Orange Park family of six to a Jacksonville Beach father and daughter mourning a mother's death, Lemonis exposes audiences to his own gentle spirit while teaching coping skills and making homes pretty.
