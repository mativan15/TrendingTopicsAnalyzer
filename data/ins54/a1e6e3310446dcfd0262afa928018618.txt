Mercury retrograde ends today. With the planet of communication moving forward again, many of the delays and roadblocks that we faced over the past few weeks are finally being resolved. Although there can be some lingering hiccups here and there, we should start to see some momentum now. We should find ourselves feeling more confident about making decisions. As the weekend approaches, we're ready to shake off the blues and our frustrations and have a little fun. The latter half of the day bodes well for laughter and entertainment, creative projects and romance.
