MUNICH, Germany, May 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (Lilium N.V. (NASDAQ: LILM) ('Lilium'), developer of the first all-electric vertical take-off and landing ('eVTOL') jet, today announced that its technology demonstrator Phoenix 2 has achieved main wing transition. This means it is the first ever full-size electric jet aircraft to transition from hover to wing-borne flight. This is a landmark moment for Lilium and for electric aviation as a whole.From a flight physics perspective, completing transition means the airflow going over the flaps attaches and becomes smooth, allowing the lift to be generated by the wing (as in conventional fixed wing aircraft), rather than by the engines (which is the case during the hovering phase).
