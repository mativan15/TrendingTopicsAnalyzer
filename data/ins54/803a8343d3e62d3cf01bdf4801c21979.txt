Three Conservative MPs have come out publicly to call for Liz Truss to quit, as pressure builds on the Prime Minister.

Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP for Reigate who was a justice minister in the early years of David Cameron's premiership, told Channel 4's Andrew Neil Show: 'I think the game is up and it's now a question as to how the succession is managed.'

Mr Bridgen, who backed Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer, said: 'Our country, its people and our party deserve better.
