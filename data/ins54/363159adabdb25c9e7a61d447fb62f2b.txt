Becky Hill opens up to Keith Lemon about her sexuality in tonight's episode of Shopping with Keith Lemon, revealing that she went to an all-girls sex party after a break-up.
The 28-year-old singer recently got engaged to her long-term boyfriend Charlie, but their relationship came with ups and downs, and even a break-up.
