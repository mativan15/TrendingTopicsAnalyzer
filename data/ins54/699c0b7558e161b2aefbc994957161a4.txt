A minister has said Liz Truss cannot afford to make "any more mistakes" as he suggested further missteps would cost the premier her job.

James Heappey, the Armed Forces Minister, was asked how many further mistakes he believes Ms Truss can afford, and he told Sky News: 'Well, I suspect given how skittish our politics are at the moment, not very many."

He added: "I don't think that there is the opportunity to make any more mistakes because the nation needs a government that is governing well and is making good decisions.
