cemagraphics I love listening to the old Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings. I joke that I can never identify the year of the annual meeting just by listening to the audio though. It could be 1999 or 2009 or 2019. Buffett's investing approach is timeless. So is the perpetual amount of noise that exists in the world. Every year, Berkshire attendees ask about interest rates, headline valuations, geopolitical risks, and inflation. Every year, Buffett's answers stay the same. I would fail miserably trying to guess the year of the annual meeting if a friend played a random clip for me.
