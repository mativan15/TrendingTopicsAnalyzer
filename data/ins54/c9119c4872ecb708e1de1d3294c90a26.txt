The cost of living is rising at the fastest rate in 40 years, with inflation figures expected to hit 10pc this week. 
Mortgage rates have not been this high since 2008, with rates now above 6pc, even after a reversal of the 'mini-Budget' that shocked bond markets. 
For those facing up to a bleak winter, a lack of experience on how to handle a sharp rise in costs has left them nervous.
Turning to older generations has never been so vital. Those who lived through the inflation crisis in the 1980s and higher mortgage rates in previous decades are conversely feeling a sense of déjà vu.
