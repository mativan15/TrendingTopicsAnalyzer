Jaime in the Morning!Oct 17, 2022I have to tell you, I was a little bit wary of heading to Poughkeepsie to take on the Walkway Over the Hudson. Not because I don't love Poughkeepsie, and not because I don't enjoy walking. I just thought it might be too high for me to enjoy (I have a healthy fear of heights). But man I was wrong. We had such a wonderful time. We met our cousins Mary, Lisa and Tom there (they live in Jersey so it was a nice halfway meet-up place) and it was great. First, you take the elevator up 21 stories, and then you get off at the Walkway and go for it.
