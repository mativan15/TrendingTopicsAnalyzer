The recent episode of Hulu's dystopian drama The Handmaid's Tale came to a shocking end with two enemies joining forces, which was a twist viewers didn't expect. Showrunner Bruce Miller lifted the lid on why Serena Joy (played by Yvonne Strahovski) didn't pull the trigger and end her brutal feud with June Osborne (Elisabeth Moss). Serena and June have been long-time enemies since the day June was placed in the Waterford residence to work as a Handmaid. There she endured years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse under the watchful eye of Serena and her husband Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes).
