Toni Preckwinkle is tough. At 75 years old, she's likely running for her final term as president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, an office she has held since 2010 when the former five-term alderman was elected as the first Black woman to run the county in which some 40% of Illinoisans reside.

But if she has decided that for herself, she wasn't letting on at our endorsement meeting. Her brow was firm, her body ramrod straight, her teeth gritted and her determination palpable.

That was no surprise.
