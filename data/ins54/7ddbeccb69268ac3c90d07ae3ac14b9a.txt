For a lot of shoppers, Costco is the holy grail of retail. Selling everything from food to clothes to patio furniture, this warehouse is stacked with items that you need (or don't, but still grab on the way out). This mega store houses a variety of brands to ensure that you have the ability to choose from a wide selection, and one of those brands is Costco's very own—Kirkland Signature.

Kirkland Signature is a private label that defines itself as synonymous with "quality and value," meaning you'll be getting the best bang for your buck while still getting top-tier products.
