June 02, 2022 07:46 PM Eastern Daylight Time LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A new federal lawsuit was filed today against Beyond Meat and its CEO Ethan Brown alleging false advertising and unfair competition. The suit, filed in the Central District of California, claims that Beyond Meat overstates the protein value of its products by up to 30% and has falsely represented that its products are free from 'synthetic' ingredients.



The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Don Lee Farms, a leading plant-based and meat protein manufacturer for national food brands and previously the exclusive supplier of the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meat products.
