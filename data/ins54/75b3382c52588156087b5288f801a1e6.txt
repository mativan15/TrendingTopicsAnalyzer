Though Diwali this year will be observed during the "warmer part of the early winter", concentrated stubble burning in Delhi's neighbouring states may compound the problem, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Thursday. The air quality in Delhi-NCR starts worsening in October due to unfavourable meteorological factors such as low temperatures and wind speed, which do not allow dispersion of pollutants. A cocktail of emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning in neighbouring states further deplete the air quality.
