As a Manatee resident with a long history of service to the county – including roles as an assistant planning director, an appointed member of the Board of Zoning Appeals, a two-term At-Large commissioner and a collaborator with several local nonprofits – I am extremely concerned about our future.

As an American Institute of Certified Planners planner for more than 30 years in Manatee County, I am intimately familiar with growth management policies and how they have been implemented.
