Myles Garrett now owns the franchise record for career sacks after a strip sack of New England Patriots quarterback Bailey Zappe. Now with 62.5 career sacks, Garrett has surpassed Clay Matthews Jr. at just the age of 26-years-young.
After a week of discourse as to whether or not Garrett has an impact on football games, he comes up huge for his team early on for the Browns here. Deadlocked at three as the first quarter winds down, this has the makings of another close game for this Cleveland Football team.
