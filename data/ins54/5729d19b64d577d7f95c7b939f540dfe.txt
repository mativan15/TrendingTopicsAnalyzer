Encouraged by the success of its two existing hotels at Bridge Park, Crawford Hoying is building a third. But unlike the others, the Dublin developer's new project has the backing of one of Central Ohio's highest-profile restaurateurs.

On Wednesday, Columbus Business First was first to report on Crawford Hoying and Cameron Mitchell Restaurants' plans for a new boutique hotel at Bridge Park in Dublin.

It's a different type of venture for Mitchell, but not for Crawford Hoying, who opened an AC Hotel in fall 2017 and a Springhill Suites about a year ago.
