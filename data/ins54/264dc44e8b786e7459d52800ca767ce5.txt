Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing Christopher Nkunku, despite Chelsea closing in on a deal for the RB Leipzig striker. Nkunku, 24, has established himself as one of the best forwards in Germany after a stunning 2021/22 campaign, scoring 35 goals in 52 games to fire Leipzig to success in the DFB-Pokal - the club's first major honour - and a fourth-placed finish in the Bundesliga. The Frenchman is the reigning Bundesliga Player of the Season and broke into his national side earlier this year, earning eight senior caps to date.
