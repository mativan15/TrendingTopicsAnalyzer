Cary's proposed budget would leave town property taxes unchanged and add funds for employee raises and more police officers while supporting operational costs and new employees for the Downtown Cary Park.

The proposed $443.6 million budget is $43.5 million, or 10.9%, more than the budget for the current year. If approved, the budget would go into effect on July 1.

Pending approval, the 2022-23 budget would bring funding to hire six new police officers and allocate $2.6 million to purchase 36 new police vehicles, ensuring one vehicle per officer.
