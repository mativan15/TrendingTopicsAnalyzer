Article In Brief

Two neurologists at Duke found they shared a passion for racing cars. They discuss their introduction to the world of fast cars, crash stories, and thoughts on the intersection of racing and neurology.

Drs. Matthew Ehrlich and Mark Skeen were at different points in their neurology careers when they met, but they bonded over their shared love of racing cars.

When Matthew Ehrlich, MD, MPH, first joined the Duke University faculty as a vascular neurology fellow in 2016, he took note of the name of a colleague, Mark Skeen, MD, a professor of neurology specializing in multiple sclerosis.
