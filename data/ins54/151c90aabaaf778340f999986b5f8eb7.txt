Anyone who's spent time in Edmonton in the summer has probably spent some of that time splashing in the series of pools and fountains at the Alberta legislative building.
Now, thanks to funding from the province and the federal government, those water features are going to be updated.'The Alberta legislature grounds are so much more than just the seat of government in Alberta's capital city.'The grounds are a beautiful spot for Edmontonians and visitors alike to escape and reflect right in the heart of our city,' Minister of Tourism Randy Boissonnault said on behalf of Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities Dominic LeBlanc.
