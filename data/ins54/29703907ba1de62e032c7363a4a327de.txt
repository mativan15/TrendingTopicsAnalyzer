After the best season in the team's history, CF Montreal will lace up and hit the field at Saputo Stadium for the team's first playoff game since 2020. Coach-of-the-year candidate Wilfried Nancy's squad will look to push past the first round of the playoffs tonight in a winner-take-all game against Orlando City SC at 8 p.m. Montreal is coming off its best-ever regular season with 65 points, 20 wins, 63 goals and 11 wins on the road. The team was the third-best team in all of MLS, behind the Eastern Conference-winning Philadelphia Union (67 points) and Western Conference-winning LAFC (67 points).
