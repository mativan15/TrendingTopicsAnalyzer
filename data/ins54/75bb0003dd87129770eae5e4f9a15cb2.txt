Comedian Joe Lycett insisted he was thrilled when Liz Truss was named Prime Minister - but left fans in stitches because he had a funny way of showing it. In a statement outside Downing Street on Thursday, Truss said she cannot deliver the mandate she was elected on by Tory members and had told King Charles she was resigning. She went on to say that she met with 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady - and they agreed there will be a leadership election within the next week, adding that she will remain as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen.
