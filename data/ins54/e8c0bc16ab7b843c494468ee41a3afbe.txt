Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers pointed to the 3-3 starts by four of the favorites in the NFC as evidence for why there should be no panic in Green Bay despite a disappointing six-game stretch to open 2022.
'A lot of people, if you're looking preseason at the NFC, four teams for sure in the conversation: San Fran, LA, Tampa and us,' Rodgers said Tuesday on 'The Pat McAfee Show.' 'All four of us are 3-3. I don't think there's any panic at any of those four places.'

The Packers, 49ers, Rams and Buccaneers are all even at 3-3 entering Week 7, although the 49ers and Buccaneers are currently leading their respective divisions.
