Tory MPs were reportedly ‘crying on the shoulders' of Labour counterparts as chaos descended in the Commons yesterday.
There were claims of ‘bullying' and even ‘shouting matches' amid last night's mayhem.
Labour former minister Chris Bryant said the disorder, which surrounded a vote on fracking, had left politicians ‘utterly desperate'.
The MP, who has been in politics for more than 20 years, said he had never witnessed such chaotic scenes.
