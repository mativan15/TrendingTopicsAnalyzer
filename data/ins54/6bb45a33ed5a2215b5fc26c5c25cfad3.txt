Boris Johnson could lose his chance to return to Number 10 over the privileges committee's investigation, Andrew Marr warned. The former Prime Minister could be found to have lied to Parliament by the privileges committee over the Partygate scandal at the very beginning of his premiership - if elected. If the probe rules he has breached the ministerial code, Mr Johnson will be suspended for at least 10 sitting days and will have to face a by-election in his Uxbridge constituency, which he would most likely lose as well as the premiership.
