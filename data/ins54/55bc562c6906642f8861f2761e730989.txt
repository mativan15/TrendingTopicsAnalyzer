A man has been ordered to pay more than $3000 after assaulting a neighbour and attacking a tractor with an axe, following a dispute over damage caused by passing stock. Judge Joanna Maze said the incident between Allan Gibbs and the neighbour started with an argument over claims Gibbs' land had been damaged by passing stock. That escalated to an assault, in which Gibbs' victim ended up with a black eye. Gibbs also swung an axe twice at the rear of a tractor doing damage which cost $2900 to repair, the Timaru District Court heard on Wednesday.
