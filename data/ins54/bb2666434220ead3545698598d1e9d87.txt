Maddie Meyer/Getty Images News Investment Conclusion We were highly pleased with The Cheesecake Factory's (NASDAQ:CAKE) F1Q2022 financial performance. Consistent with what appears to be a developing trend among full-service restaurants, and which we believe is driven by a pent-up customer demand for experiential dining, year-over-year growth in total sales and comparable sales expanded significantly. The dramatic boost in sales was supported by an uptrend in both traffic and menu prices. In addition, despite substantial improvement in dine-in sales, the off-premise category continued to outperform, with first quarter average weekly sales double that generated during F1Q2019.
