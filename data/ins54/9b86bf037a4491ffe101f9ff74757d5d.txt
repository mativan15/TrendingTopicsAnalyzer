The contractor chosen to provide health care services to people in state prisons expects to earn nearly $10 million in annual profits, according to procurement documents published by the state. The contract represents a 74% increase in the amount of money the state pays to provide health care for each prisoner every day.

On Friday, the Arizona Department of Corrections announced it had awarded the contract for providing health care to people in state prisons to NaphCare, an Alabama-based health care provider that settled with the United States Department of Justice over allegations of overcharging clients in 2021.
