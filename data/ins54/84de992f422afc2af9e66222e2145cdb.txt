SoftBank Group Corp.'s top executives saw steep cuts in their paychecks as the Japanese conglomerate marked a historic loss for its Vision Fund unit.
The company's founder and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son kept his pay unchanged at 100 million yen (roughly $785,000), however some of his top executives whose compensation was made public through a company filing on Monday saw big drops following a record $20.5 billion loss.
Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto made 293 million yen, down almost 40% from the previous year.
