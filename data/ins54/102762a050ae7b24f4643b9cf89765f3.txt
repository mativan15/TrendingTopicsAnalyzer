IMA requests CM to extend Diwali bonuses to resident doctors as well 
 

Mumbai Chief minister Eknath Shinde had recently announced Diwali bonus for several municipal workers as well as healthcare professionals, given their contribution during the covid-19 pandemic. Although he mentioned the teachers at the civic-run hospitals, he did not mention anything about the resident doctors. State branch of Indian Medical Association has appealed to the chief minister to consider the inclusion of resident doctors for this bonus.
