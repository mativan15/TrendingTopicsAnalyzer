Anna Moneymaker U.S. economic activity "expanded modestly" in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report on the U.S. economy. That's better than the roughly flat picture portrayed in the previous report that was issued on Sept. 7. Retail activity was relatively flat, while tourist activity "rose strongly." Manufacturing activity was steady or expanded in most of the Fed's 12 districts, in part due to easing supply chain disruptions. The Fed's Beige Book collects observations across all of the country's Federal Reserve Bank districts in assessing the health of the economy.
