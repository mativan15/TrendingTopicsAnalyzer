A-levels should be scrapped because pupils specialise far too early, a multimillionaire education philanthropist has said.Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said he was not in favour of private education, despite campaigning for the government to fund places for poorer children at independent schools.Twenty-five years after setting up the Sutton Trust to pour money into education and address disadvantage, he said teenagers should study a range of subjects until their first year of university.
