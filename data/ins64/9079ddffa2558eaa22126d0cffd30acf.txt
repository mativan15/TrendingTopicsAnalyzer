Liquid staking protocol pSTAKE has partnered with crypto custodial firm Anchorage Digital to allow Anchorage's institutional clients to hold the PSTAKE governance token.

pSTAKE is a product of Persistence, a layer 1 blockchain network that focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that unlock the liquidity of staked assets.

The partnership comes as liquid staking has become more popular, especially after Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism last month.

Liquid staking occurs when users who have staked their tokens are issued new tokens with the same value.
