We're down to the final eight teams in the 2022 NCAA Division I softball tournament. Even though there are only Power 5 conferences represented at the Women's College World Series, the road to Oklahoma City has been far from only outlined in chalk.

Top-seeded Oklahoma is back trying to defend its crown. But only five of the 16 national seeds advance past super regionals — OU, No. 5 UCLA, No. 7 Oklahoma State, No. 9 Northwestern and No. 14 Florida.

The rest of the field in OKC includes unseeded teams in Arizona, Oregon State, Texas.
