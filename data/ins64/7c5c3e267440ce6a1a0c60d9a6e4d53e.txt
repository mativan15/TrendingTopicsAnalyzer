HOUSTON — Harrison Bader is giving Aaron Judge a run for his money as the Yankees' top power threat.
The center fielder continued his home run hysteria on Wednesday, going deep for the fourth time in six playoff games before the Yankees fell to the Astros 4-2 in Game 1 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park.
Bader put the Yankees up 1-0 in the second inning when he crushed a 2-2 slider from Justin Verlander 411 feet to left field. In doing so, he became the first player in franchise history to hit four home runs in his first six playoff games with the Yankees, according to Stathead.
