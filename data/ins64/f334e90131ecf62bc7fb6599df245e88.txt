Lululemon expects the momentum in its business to continue in spite of broader economic headwinds. The athletic apparel retailer posted earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's expectations. "Our product pipeline remains very strong and it's the bedrock of the business," CEO Calvin McDonald said. Lululemon customers so far aren't balking at higher prices on the retailer's leggings and sports bras, Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald said Thursday. The athletic apparel maker reported fiscal-first quarter profit and revenue that outpaced Wall Street's expectations, boosted by double-digit growth online and in the retailer's still nascent men's division.
