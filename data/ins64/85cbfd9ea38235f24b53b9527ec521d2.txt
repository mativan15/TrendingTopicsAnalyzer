Donald Trump just threatened America's Jews. Over the weekend, Trump warned Jews that they need to "get their act together" before "it is too late!""No President has done more for Israel than I have," Trump wrote on his own social media platform, "Truth Social," before adding that it was "somewhat surprising that our wonderful Evangelicals are far more appreciative of this than the people of the Jewish faith, especially those living in the U.S."The insulting comments are a new low, even for the notoriously white nationalist former president.
