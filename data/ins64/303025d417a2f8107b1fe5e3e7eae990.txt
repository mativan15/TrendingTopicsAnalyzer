The Falcons will re-introduce red helmets in 2022 to pair with the team's 1966 throwback uniforms.

The team will debut the red helmets in a Week 6 home game against the 49ers.

The red helmet, which pays homage to the club's inaugural squad, features a grey facemask. It has a throwback black Falcon crest logo trimmed in white and a black stripe down the middle of the helmet trimmed in white and gold.
