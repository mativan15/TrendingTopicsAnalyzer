As prices rise across basically all industries, the ripple effect has found its way to customers of snow removal businesses on P.E.I.With the Island's first snowfall getting closer every day, businesses are preparing for the snow removal season ahead and with the increased cost of diesel, insurance, repairs and more, customers will likely see an uptick on their bill.For Dickieson's Snow Removal, which operates in the Charlottetown and Cornwall areas, that means an increase of more than $100 in costs to customers for snow removal this year.
