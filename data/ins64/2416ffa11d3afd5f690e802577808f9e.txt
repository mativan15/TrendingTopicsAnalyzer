BUENOS AIRES (AP) — The project of a Super league of European soccer teams 'is dead,' UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said in a meeting with with journalists in Argentina on Thursday.

The head of Europe's football association rejected comments made the previous day by Bernd Reichart, the new director general of the company behind the project, A22 Sports Management. Reichart said the breakaway initiative is still standing, though in a different format.

'We are here to talk about soccer, and that (the Super league) is not soccer,' Ceferin said.
