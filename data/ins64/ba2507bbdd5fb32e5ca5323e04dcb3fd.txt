Elijah-Lovkoff/iStock via Getty Images I've covered Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (NYSE:PAC) extensively over the years. Shares have returned 150% since 2017 when I first highlighted the company. And shares have outperformed the S&P 500 by 24% since December 2021 when I gave my refreshed post-pandemic thesis on the company. I'd refer back to my previous work on the company for a comprehensive look at all the catalysts, drivers, and risks associated with Pacifico stock.
