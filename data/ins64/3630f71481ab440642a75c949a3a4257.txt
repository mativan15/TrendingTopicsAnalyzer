Governor Tim Walz on Friday signed the controversial bill that spends about $70 million in lottery funds for conservation projects around the state, while at the same time objecting that a dozen of the projects had been inserted into the bill by legislators without being reviewed by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR).

"The bill sent to my desk has twelve legislative additions, out of a total of 80 projects — a full 15% of the bill — that were not even proposed in the LCCMR vetting process," Walz wrote in a letter to legislative leaders.
