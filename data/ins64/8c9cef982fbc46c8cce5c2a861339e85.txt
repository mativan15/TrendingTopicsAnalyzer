It was two years ago that I bought my Macintosh Plus from a scrap dealer. I found the unit in the narrow lanes of Delhi's Jahangirpuri, complete with the keyboard and mouse. The case had a greyish-yellow tinge due to age, but the computer was in pristine condition. I booked an auto, put the computer in an oversized canvas bag, and rushed home. I didn't even bother if the Macintosh Plus was working or dead; all I knew was I got my hands on a gem – a classic computer that made its debut shortly after the launch of the original Macintosh in 1984 — 1986, to be exact.
