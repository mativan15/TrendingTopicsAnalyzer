Mark Cuban compared cryptocurrencies to the early internet in terms of hype and skepticism, predicted a shake-out in the crypto space, and defended non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a flurry of tweets this week."People dismissed the net just like they are crypto," Cuban tweeted, adding that naysayers failed to grasp the revolutionary potential of networked computing.The "Shark Tank" investor and Dallas Mavericks owner drew a parallel between dot-com fever two decades ago, and crypto fervor today. He said an industry downturn will temper the rampant promotion and speculation, and help decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and other genuine opportunities stand out from the crowd.
