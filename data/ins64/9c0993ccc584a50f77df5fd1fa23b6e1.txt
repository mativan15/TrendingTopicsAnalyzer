When foldable phones first hit the market in 2019, there were two distinct form factors pioneered by Samsung and Huawei. Samsung's method was the inside fold, in which the screen closes on itself like a book, Huawei's way was the outer fold, which sees the screen bend backwards and wraps around itself. There were pros and cons to both: Samsung's inner fold method provides more protection, as the folded screen is closed up in folded form. However, this means a second outside display is needed in order for the device to be used in folded form.
